This paper extends the benchmark New-Keynesian model by introducing two frictions: (1) agent heterogeneity
with incomplete markets, uninsurable idiosyncratic risk, and occasionally binding borrowing constraints;
and (2) bounded rationality in the form of level-k thinking. Compared to the benchmark model, we
show that the interaction of these two frictions leads to a powerful mitigation of the effects of monetary
policy, which is more pronounced at long horizons, and offers a potential rationalization of the “forward
guidance puzzle”. Each of these frictions, in isolation, would lead to no or much smaller departures
from the benchmark model.

This paper extends the benchmark New-Keynesian model with a representative agent
and rational expectations by introducing two key frictions: (1) agent heterogeneity with
incomplete markets, uninsurable idiosyncratic risk, and occasionally-binding borrowing
constraints; and (2) bounded rationality in the form of level-k thinking. Compared to the
benchmark model, we show that the interaction of these two frictions leads to a powerful
mitigation of the effects of monetary policy, which is much more pronounced at long
horizons, and offers a potential rationalization of the “forward guidance puzzle”. Each
of these frictions, in isolation, would lead to no or much smaller departures from the
benchmark model. We conclude that the interaction of bounded rationality and market
frictions improves the ability of the model to account for the effects of monetary policy.


1     Introduction
The baseline New Keynesian setup is a workhorse model for monetary policy analysis.
However, in its basic form, it also has implications that are controversial or unrealistic.
For example, despite various concrete results that limit the number of equilibria, inde-
terminacy concerns remain. In addition, although the model provides a rationale for
effective monetary policy, some view the power of monetary policy as too effective, and
changes in future interest rates may be especially powerful—the so-called “forward guid-

ance puzzle”.1 Finally, while the model can explain recessive effects arising at the zero
lower bound or following from other contractive monetary policies, these effects seem
excessive.2 These shortcomings provide important reasons to entertain departures from
the basic New Keynesian setup.
    In our view, the extreme forward-looking nature of the model due to complete mar-
kets and rational expectations underlies these frustrating properties. This paper studies
the effects of monetary policy in the presence of nominal rigidities exploring two realistic
departures from standard benchmark models. First, we depart from the representative
agent or complete market assumption by considering, instead, heterogeneous agents and
financial market imperfections, including both incomplete insurance and borrowing con-
straints. Second, we depart from rational expectations, by adopting a particular form of
bounded rationality. As we will show, these two frictions interact in powerful ways and
help make the model more realistic by fixing its aforementioned shortcomings.
    We study monetary policy and focus on changes in current and future interest rates
and study their effect on aggregate output. In standard New-Keynesian models changes
in future real interest rates are equally potent to changes in current real interest rates,
a property that some have labeled the “forward guidance puzzle”, as introduced by .3
Although each of the two departures we consider from the benchmark model may affect
this property, we show that each deviation in isolation exerts only a moderate influence.
The combined effect of both deviations, however, is potent and potentially affects the
workings of monetary policy significantly, reducing the sensitivity of current output to
future interest rate changes—we call this the mitigation effect—the more so, the further
in the future they take place—we call this the horizon effect. In other words, incomplete
markets and level-k bounded rationality are complements. This highlights a more general
point, that it is not always enough to investigate one deviation at a time from standard
   1 A similar issue arises in the context of the fiscal policy:
                                                            as shown by Christiano, Eichenbaum and Rebelo
(2011) at the zero lower bound spending is very stimulative. As shown by Farhi and Werning (2016a),
future spending is more powerful—a “fiscal forward guidance puzzle”. In ongoing work we apply the
framework we introduce here to fiscal policy and show that level-k thinking mitigates the inflation-output
feedback loop which is responsible for these effects, and improves the realism of the model.
    2 For example, in deterministic models, recessionary forces become arbitrarily large as the duration of the

liquidity trap lengthens, and in some stochastic models, when the probability of remaining in the liquidity
trap is large enough, the equilibrium simply ceases to exist. These effects are exact manifestations of the
forward guidance puzzle in reverse—applied to a situation where monetary policy is too contractionary
over the horizon of the liquidity trap. Although we de not develop these applications explicitly in the paper,
our resolution of the forward guidance puzzle also leads to a resolution of these liquidity trap paradoxes.
    3 Given standard empirical identification challenges, which are only heightened when focusing on for-

ward guidance shocks, relative to standard monetary shocks, one can interpret the term ’puzzle’ as reflect-
ing the property of standard models relative to a prior where monetary policy in the far future has smaller
effects on current activity.

benchmark models.
    Our first deviation drops the representative agent and complete market assumptions.
Our model is populated by heterogenous agents making consumption decisions subject
to idiosyncratic shocks to income that cannot be insured. In addition, borrowing may also
be limited. These frictions affect the capacity of households to smooth their consumption,
potentially affecting the potency of forward guidance. Intuitively, if agents expect to be
borrowing constrained in the near future, then changes in future interest rates should
not greatly influence their current consumption decisions. This line of reasoning was put
forth by McKay et al. (2016). However, as shown by Werning (2015), while incomplete
markets always have an effect on the level of aggregate consumption, the way it affects
its sensitivity to current and future interest rates is less clear. Indeed, this sensitivity is
completely unchanged in some benchmark cases and may be enhanced in others. This
implies that the power of forward guidance is not necessarily diminished by incomplete
markets, at least not without adopting other auxiliary assumptions.4 Here we adopt the
benchmark cases that imply the neutral conclusion that incomplete markets have no effect
on the sensitivity of aggregate consumption to interest rates.
    Our second deviation drops the rational-expectations assumption, adopting instead
a form of bounded rational expectations closely related to the notions of “calculation
equilibrium” and of “reflective equilibrium” introduced in macroeconomic settings by
Evans and Ramey (1992; 1995; 1998) and García-Schmidt and Woodford (2015) respec-
tively. They are based on a finite discrete deductive procedure involving k iterations,
which we refer to as “level-k thinking”, which describes how, starting from a status
quo rational-expectations equilibrium, agents form expectations about changes in future
macroeconomic variables in response to a given change in policy. As we shall argue,
our choice amongst the “wilderness” of options of non-rational expectations seems well
suited to the economic and policy scenario that we shall focus on.
    In our case, the change in policy is the announcement of a new interest rate path, (or,
more generally, a new path for the interest rate policy rule).5 Households are perfectly
aware of the entire new path of current and future interest rates set by the monetary au-
   4 As  highlighted in Werning (2015), two features that push to mitigate the impact of future interest rates
relative to current interest rates on current aggregate consumption are: (i) procyclicality of income risk,
making precautionary savings motives low during a recession; and (ii) countercyclicality of liquidity rela-
tive to income, making asset prices or lending fluctuate less than output. If one adopts the reverse assump-
tions, as a large literature does—so that recessions heighten risk, precautionary savings and are accompa-
nied by large drops in asset prices or lending relative to GDP—then aggregate consumption becomes even
more sensitive to future interest rates, relative to current interest rates.
   5 To simplify our model and allow for a non-linearized solution we consider cases where there is no

ongoing aggregate uncertainty; all uncertainty has been resolved at t = 0, including any unexpected “MIT”
shock. Thus, rational expectations is equivalent to perfect foresight.


                                                      3
thority and, as a result, the entire yield curve immediately adjusts to reflect this announce-
ment.6 We are motivated by specific policy contexts, especially at the zero lower bound,
where the intended interest rate path is directly and exhaustively communicated by the
central bank; economic actors pay close attention to these announcements. In contrast,
expectations for other endogenous macroeconomic variables, such as output or inflation,
are not under the direct control of the central bank nor directly announced and, thus,
agents can only form beliefs about them indirectly. In our formulation, agents make an
effort to think through the behavior of these variables, but stop short of achieving perfect
foresight. This is motivated by two other considerations. First, the notion that the status
quo is a natural focal point to start to reason through the effects of the policy on future
variables and that agents may be limited, or believe that others are limited, in performing
this deduction. Second, we are interested in relatively unfamiliar scenarios, with interest
rates near zero at an effective lower bound, where learning protocols that converge to
rational expectations cannot be naturally invoked. Indeed, agents may recognize the that
past experience may be a poor guide in such relatively unfamiliar scenarios. For these
reasons, backward-looking learning approaches to the formation of expectations may be
inadequate. Our modeling of expectations is entirely forward-looking and deductive.
    The simplest interpretation of our basic setting assumes that prices and wages are
fully rigid. This allows us to follow McKay et al. (2016) by focusing on changes in the real
interest rate path on consumption, since real and nominal interest rates changes obviously
coincide when inflation is unresponsive.7 However, even when prices are sticky but not
fully rigid, monetary policy changes affect the real interest rate path.8 We maintain this
full price rigidity assumption in Sections 2-5 and relax it in Section 6 where we consider
sticky but not fully rigid prices.
    In our model, households care to forecast the path for aggregate income because of
its effect on future household income. With full price rigidity, given the new interest rate
   6 This  is an important difference with Gabaix (2017) who assumes that agents are inattentive to the in-
terest rate and with Angeletos and Lian (2017) who assume that agents only observe the interest rate with
some noise. As a result, in these models, the yield curve is “stale” and only partially adjusts to shocks and
policy announcement. We see this as an important advantage of our model in light of the recent experience
in which the yield curve has been reactive to shocks and policy announcements.
    7 Standard New Keynesian models with a purely forward looking Phillips curve with levels of nominal

rigidities calibrated to frequency of price changes between 6-12 months may imply large and counterfactual
changes in inflation to shocks, especially at the zero lower bound. A line of work attempts to modify the
basic models to explain the why inflation appears to have been relatively well anchored during the Great
Recession.
    8 When monetary policy is described by nominal interest rate changes, then one must also consider the

effect of inflation, which exerts an endogenous effect on the real interest rate path. Even in this case, under-
standing the effects of real interest rate is instrumental and remains relevant since consumption depends
on the expected real interest rate path.


                                                       4
path, this turns out to be the only endogenous macroeconomic variable that households
need to forecast. They form these expectations according to the iterative level-k iterative
which we describe next.
    Level-1 thinking assumes that agents expect the path for future output to remain as in
the original rational-expectations equilibrium before the announced change in the path of
interest rates. Given current assets and income, individuals choose consumption and sav-
ings, reacting to the new interest rate path, using the status quo expectations for future ag-
gregate income. In equilibrium, aggregate output equals aggregate consumption in each
period, and the economy is in (general) equilibrium. In the k-th deductive round, house-
holds take the path of future output to be the equilibrium path of output that obtains in
the previous round, etc. This process converges to the rational-expectations equilibrium
when the number of rounds k goes to ∞.
    An interesting advantage of working with level-k is that it sidesteps issues of inde-
terminacy, as argued forcefully by García-Schmidt and Woodford (2015). Indeed, for any
shift in the path of interest rates, the equilibrium outcome for any level k is unique. In-
deed, one can see level-k thinking as a selection device which isolates a particular rational
expectations equilibrium in the limit when k goes to ∞, without having to resort to policy
rules or the Taylor principle.9
    We start in Section 2 by defining our different equilibrium concepts (temporary equi-
librium, rational-expectations equilibrium, level-k equilibrium) in a reduced form model
for which the key primitive is a reduced-form aggregate consumption function. We also
offer a decomposition of the response of output to interest rate changes under rational
expectations into a partial equilibrium effect and a general equilibrium effect. The par-
tial equilibrium effect computes the change in aggregate consumption resulting from the
change in the path of interest rates, holding the expected path for aggregate income un-
changed. The general equilibrium effect then considers the change in aggregate consump-
tion resulting from adjusting the expectations of future aggregate income. Under some
conditions, the level-1 outcome coincides with the partial equilibrium response, since it
keeps expectations about future aggregate income unchanged. As one increases the num-
ber of rounds of thinking, the level-k outcome incorporates to a greater extent the general
equilibrium effects from increased future expected aggregate income, converging to the
rational-expectations outcome as k goes to ∞.
    In the subsequent sections, we spell out explicit models of individual optimizing be-
   9 When prices are rigid, level-k converges to rational expectations when k goes to ∞. When prices have
some degree of flexibility, each level-k equilibrium remains uniquely determined, but the convergence de-
pends on the monetary policy rule. We obtain convergence with a Taylor rule.

havior and map their implications into the reduced-form aggregate consumption func-
tion. We can then apply the equilibrium definitions of Section 2.
    We start with the complete-markets, or equivalently, the representative-agent case, in
Section 3. As we show, bounded rationality affects the response of consumption to the
path of interest rates. First, the effect of the current interest rate is equal to the one under
rational expectation, but the effects of any future interest rate change on output are lower,
implying that there is a mitigation effect. Second, this mitigation is stronger for interest
rate changes occurring further out in the future, implying that there is a horizon effect.
    Qualitative conclusions aside, our calculations show that the mitigation and horizon
effects obtained with level-k bounded rationality and a representative agent are relatively
modest. In particular, for level-1 we show that the response of current output to an inter-
est rate change decreases exponentially with the horizon with an exponent equal to the
interest rate. That is, the response is proportional to e−rτ where τ is the horizon and r
is the interest rate. For example, with an interest rate of 2%, the effect on output of an
interest rate change in 4 years is a fraction 0.92 of the effect of a contemporaneous interest
rate change, arguably a small amount of mitigation and horizon.
    Sections 4 and 5 turn to economies with incomplete markets. We wish to separate
two different aspects of market incompleteness: the presence of binding borrowing con-
straints and uninsurable idiosyncratic income risk. To isolate the impact of occasionally-
binding borrowing constraints, we consider first in Section 4 a perpetual youth overlap-
ping generations model. On the one hand, the presence of annuities eliminates unin-
surable idiosyncratic income risk, removing precautionary saving motives. On the other
hand, as is well known, the death rate in overlapping generation models can be reinter-
preted as frequently binding borrowing constraints. This shortens the effective planning
horizon and increases the marginal propensity to consume.
    We specify the perpetual youth model with logarithmic utility to ensure that there
are neither mitigation nor horizon effects under rational expectations. Intuitively, al-
though binding borrowing constraints mitigate the substitution effect from changes in
interest rates, it enhances the reaction of consumption to changes in income, i.e. increases
marginal propensities to consume (MPCs). This larger income effect exactly offsets the
smaller substitution effect for our baseline specification. The general point is that under
rational expectations incomplete markets does not necessarily deliver a departure in the
aggregate response of consumption to the path of interest rates, even though the under-
lying mechanism and intuition may be quite different.
    Turning to level-k bounded rationality we obtain mitigation and horizon effects, but
these effects are now amplified relative to those in the representative agent case. In par-


                                               6
ticular, for level-1 the response of current output to an interest rate change decreases ex-
ponentially with the horizon at a rate equal to the interest rate, r, plus the rate of death, λ,
which should be interpreted as the frequency of binding borrowing constraints. That is,
the response is proportional to e−(r+λ)τ . For example, a frequency of binding borrowing
constraints of 15% implies a response of current output to an interest rate change 4 years
into the future of almost half of the effect of a contemporaneous interest rate change.
    Section 5 considers a standard Bewley-Aiyagari-Huggett model. This model com-
bines occasionally-binding borrowing constraints and precautionary savings due to unin-
surable idiosyncratic uncertainty. We allow for a long-lived outside asset in fixed sup-
ply—commonly referred to as a “Lucas tree”—that determines the amount of liquidity in
the economy. Again, we specify the model to ensure that there are no mitigation or hori-
zon effects under rational expectations. Indeed, the aggregate properties of the model are
identical to those of a representative-agent. This provides a neutral platform to investi-
gate the interaction of bounded rationality and incomplete markets.
    As is well known, Bewley-Aiygari-Huggett models are not analytically tractable, so
we must turn to numerical simulations. Our explorations show that this model delivers
significant mitigation and horizon effects. Consistent with our earlier results, we find that
these effects are especially strong when the model is parameterized to feature significant
risk and binding borrowing constraints.
    In our baseline we consider a steady state with a 2% annual interest rate and use a
fairly standard idiosyncratic income process. We set the fraction of outside liquidity to
output at 1.44 (as in McKay et al. 2016).10 The implied fraction of borrowing-constrained
agents in the steady state is then 14.7%. Quantitatively, in our baseline calibration, we
find that the effect on output of an interest rate change in 4 years is about half of the
effect of a contemporaneous interest rate change; this number is similar to our perpetual
youth example. Calibrations with a lower amount of liquidity yield a higher fraction of
borrowing-constrained agents and give greater mitigation and horizon effects.
    Overall, these exercises show the interaction of bounded rationality and incomplete
markets has the potential for significant mitigation and horizon effects in monetary policy,
even if each element has only modest effects in isolation.
    Finally, in Section 6, we study the role of inflation by departing from the assumption of
fully rigid prices. Household must now also form expectations regarding future inflation.
We modify the model of Section 5 to incorporate monopolistic competition and staggered
time-dependent pricing a la Calvo, as well as explicit labor supply and labor demand
  10 This value for the fraction of outside liquidity to output V   = 1.44 is meant to capture the value of liquid

(as opposed to illiquid) wealth in the data.

decisions. Once again, we explore this model numerically, fully nonlinearly, without the
use of log-linearization techniques.
    Because inflation is responsive, the “forward guidance puzzle” under rational expec-
tations is enhanced. Indeed, this baseline now features anti-horizon effects in the sense
that the response of current output and inflation increase with the horizon of monetary
policy. These anti-horizon effects arise because of a feedback loop between output and
inflation: higher outputgenerates higher inflation, which reduces real interest rates and
further increases output, etc. The longer the horizon of the monetary policy change, the
longer the time horizon over which this feedback loop plays out, and the stronger its
effects.
    Under level-1 thinking, the response of output is identical when prices are rigid and
when they are sticky, simply because at this level of reasoning, agents do not expect any
inflation even if prices are sticky. It features stronger mitigation and horizon effects, the
more incomplete markets are. The same applies to the response of inflation. As k in-
creases, the responses of output and inflation converge monotonically to their rational-
expectations counterparts, but this convergence is markedly slower now, the more in-
complete markets are. In the rational-expectations limit which obtain for k = ∞, by
construction, they become independent of the degree of market incompleteness in our
model.
    Incomplete markets alone does not change the aggregate responses . Level-k bounded
rationality alone mitigates and for low values of k reverses these effects. But even for
k = 1, the horizon effects remain very weak, exactly as in the case of rigid prices consid-
ered in Section 5. Level-k bounded rationality and incomplete markets together generate
powerful horizon effects, exactly as in the case of rigid prices considered in Section 5. The
complementarity between incomplete markets and bounded rationality that we identified
in the case of rigid prices remains and is even strengthened with sticky prices.


Related literature. The intellectual genealogy of the concept of level-k equilibrium is
well described in García-Schmidt and Woodford (2015). More generally, and following a
categorization proposed by Guesnerie (1992) and adopted by Woodford (2013), our ap-
proach belongs to the eductive class of deviations from rational expectations, where one
assumes that agents correctly understand the model and form inferences about future
outcomes through a process of reflection, independent of experience, and not necessarily
occurring in real time.11 This class of deviations from rational expectations is distinct from
inductive approaches, which assume that the probabilities that people assign to possible
 11 This   terminology originates in the work of Guesnerie (1992) on “eductive stability”.


                                                      8
future outcomes should not be too different from the probabilities with which different
outcomes actually occur, given that experience should allow some familiarity with these
probabilities, regardless of whether agents understand the way in which these outcomes
are generated (models of incomplete information with econometrics learning and models
of partially or approximately correct beliefs).
    The concept of level-k equilibrium is related to the iterative algorithm proposed by
Fair and Taylor (1983) to compute numerically rational-expectations equilibria of a dy-
namic economic models, with the successive iterations resembling the ones described
in the construction of level-k equilibria. The difference that the concept of level-k equilib-
rium sees the different iterations not simply as steps towards the computation of rational-
expectations equilibria, but as interesting equilibrium concepts per se that can be com-
pared to the data. The concept of level-k equilibrium is closely related to the concept of
calculation equilibrium of Evans and Ramey (1992; 1995; 1998), who advocate stopping
after a few iterations owing to calculations costs. It is slightly different from the concept
of “reflective equilibrium” in García-Schmidt and Woodford (2015) who consider a con-
tinuous process whereby expectation are governed by a differential equation in the level
of thought rather than my a discrete recursion as we do, but this difference is largely
inconsequential.
    The concept of level-k thinking has also been proposed to explain behavior in labora-
tory experiments with games of full information (Stahl and Wilson 1994; O. and W. 1995;
Nagel 1995; Crawford et al. 2013). The model specifies a naive form of behavior which is
taken to be that of level-0 players. Level-k players use their understanding of the game to
calculate their best action on the assumption that other players in the game are level-k − 1
players. The observed play of many experimental subjects in multi-player games is found
to correspond to low levels of reasoning (usually between 0 and 3) when the subjects are
confronted with a new situation (they have no experience playing the game) but have had
the rules explained to them (so that they can compute their best response to a conjecture
about other players’ expectations).12 These experimental games are arguably consider-
ably simpler than the economies that we consider in our paper, and so lower levels of
reasoning should be expected in our context.
    Our paper also belongs to the growing literature studying the effects of macroeco-
nomic stabilization policy in incomplete-markets models, but maintaining the assump-
tion of rational expectations. Recent examples include Auclert (2017), Caballero and
  12 Arad and Rubinstein (2012) argue than even in simple games and with fairly sophisticated agents, few
if any exhibit level higher than 3. Camerer et al. (2004) and Crawford et al. (2013) provide other empirical
evidence on the levels of thinking in experimental games.

and that reasonable benchmarks produce instead a neutrality result whereby incomplete
markets per se do no affect the sensitivity of the economy to interest rate changes. In our
paper, we make a deliberate effort to make such neutral choices. Thus our results are not
driven by incomplete markets

(2017), Angeletos and Lian (2017), and Wiederholt (2016), who study the effects of mone-
tary policy, and in particular the limits of forward guidance, in standard New Keynesian
models with either bounded rationality for the first two of these papers (“reflective equi-
librium” and “sparsity” respectively) or full rationality and informational frictions the
last two of these papers. An important difference between and these papers and ours is
that they maintain the assumption of complete markets while we study incomplete mar-
kets. Another important difference between our paper and Angeletos and Lian (2017) and
Wiederholt (2016) is that they rely on an inductive approach with informational frictions
and full rationality instead of an eductive approach with bounded rationality. In Angele-
tos and Lian (2017), there is imperfect common knowledge because agents receive private
signals about interest rate changes and must forecast the forecasts of others. Wiederholt
(2016) also assumes informational frictions but of a different form, by positing that agents
have sticky expectations a la Mankiw and Reis (2002) and receive information about in-
terest rate changes after the realization of an idiosyncratic Poisson shock. In contrast to
these models with full rationality and informational frictions, ours is one of full infor-
mation with bounded rationality where agents know the path of interest rates but face
difficulties in calculating the macroeconomic equilibrium consequences of changes in in-
terest rates. We think that our approach is better suited to capture the limits of forward
guidance in contexts where considerable efforts are made by central banks to communi-
  13 Caballero  and Farhi (2017) offer a rationalization of the forward guidance puzzle in a model with het-
erogenous risk aversion where risk-tolerant agents issue safe assets to risk-averse agents through a process
of securitization of real risky assets hampered by a securitization constraint. When the securitization con-
straint is binding, the effectiveness of forward guidance is reduced because the constraint prevents it from
increasing the supply of safe assets and hence reduces its ability to stimulate the economy.

to these announcements.


2     Level-k in a Simple Reduced-Form Model
We being by introducing the basic concepts of level-k equilibrium within a simplified
model building on a reduced-form aggregate consumption function. Various explicit dis-
aggregated models can be explicitly reduced to this formulation. For example, representative-
agent models, overlapping generations models, models with a fraction of permanent-
income consumers and a fraction of hand-to-mouth consumers, and Bewley-Aiyagari-
Huggett models of heterogenous agents with income fluctuation and incomplete markets,
all give rise to an aggregate consumption function of the form considered below. We will
make this mapping explicit for several of these models in future sections.


2.1   Baseline Reduced-Form Model
We consider a simple model with one consumption good in every period and no invest-
ment. Time is discrete and the horizon is infinite with periods t = 0, 1, . . . We denote
current and future real nominal interest rates by { Rt+s }, and current and future aggre-
gate income by {Yt+s }, where s runs from 0 to ∞. We focus for simplicity on the extreme
case with perfectly rigid prices, where real interest rates equal nominal interest rates. We
maintain this assumption in Sections 2-5. We take as given the path of nominal interest
rates { Rt+s } coincides with the path of real interest rates. Our goal is to solve for the
equilibrium path of aggregate income {Yt+s }. An alternative interpretation is that we are
characterizing the response of the economy to different path of real interest rates, which
are under the control of the monetary authority because of nominal rigidities. In any case,
we relax the assumption of perfectly rigid prices in Section 6 where we consider sticky
prices.


Aggregate consumption function.        We postulate an aggregate consumption function

                              Ct = C ∗ ({ Rt+s }, Yt , {Yte+1+s }),                      (1)

where {Yte+1+s } denotes future anticipated aggregate income.
    The fact that the aggregate consumption function depends only on current and future
interest rates, current income and future anticipated income is useful and merits brief


                                               11
discussion. With a representative agent such a formulation is straightforward, and we
discuss this example below. Otherwise, the consumption function should be interpreted
as performing an aggregation and consolidating any distributional effects, including solv-
ing out for wages and profits as a function of current Yt . Implicitly we are also assuming
there is no heterogeneity in beliefs about future income, {Yte+1+s }, although one may ex-
tend the analysis to capture heterogeneity in beliefs.
    In this formulation the consumption function is purely forward looking—it does not
depend on the past or on any state variable that is affected by the past. This can ac-
commodate various interesting and simple models, such as the representative agent, the
perpetual youth overlapping generations model, and certain simple models with hetero-
geneity such as models fraction of hand-to-mouth agents. It does not fit all situations,
however. In the next subsection we provide an extension with an aggregate state variable
which allows us to captures standard Bewley-Aiyagari-Huggett models.

Temporary equilibria. We are interested in allowing for more general beliefs than ratio-
nal expectations. We start by defining the notion of temporary equilibrium in the spirit
of Hicks (1939) and Lindahl (1939), and further developed by Grandmont (1977; 1978). A
temporary equilibrium takes as given a sequence of beliefs {Yte } and simply imposes that
the goods market clear
                                         Yt = Ct .                                    (2)

Definition (Temporary equilibrium). Given a sequence of beliefs {Yte }, a temporary equilib-
rium is a sequence { Rt , Yt } satisfying (1) and (2) for all t ≥ 0.

    Start at some baseline temporary equilibrium { Rt , Yt , Yte } and consider the one-time
unexpected announcement at t = 0 of a new interest rate path { R̂t }. The equilibrium re-
sponse depends on the adjustment of beliefs. We now describe two possible adjustments
of beliefs: rational expectations and level-k thinking.

Rational-expectations equilibria. A rational-expectations equilibrium is a particular
case of temporary equilibrium with the extra requirement of perfect foresight, i.e. that
beliefs about future income coincide with actual future income

                                             {Yte } = {Yt }.                                          (3)

Definition (Rational expectation equilibrium). A rational-expectations equilibrium (REE) is a
sequence { Rt , Yt , Yte } such that { Rt , Yt } is a temporary equilibrium given beliefs {Yte } and which
satisfies perfect foresight (3) for all t ≥ 0.

                                                   12
    For notational convenience, we often denote a given REE by { Rt , Yt } instead of using
the more cumbersome notation { Rt , Yt , Yt }.
    Start at some baseline REE { Rt , Yt } and consider as above a one-time unexpected an-
nouncement at t = 0 of a new interest rate path { R̂t }. Under rational expectations, there
is an issue about selection since there are typically several REEs for a given interest rate
path { R̂t }. In our detailed applications, and for the considered interest rate paths, we
will always be able to select a unique REE by imposing that the baseline and new REEs
coincide in the long run:
                                       lim Ŷt = lim Yt .
                                         t→∞           t→∞

From now on, we always use this selection.


Level-k equilibria. We now deviate from rational expectations and describe an alterna-
tive adjustment of expectations encapsulated in the notion of level-k thinking. We then
introduce the notion of level-k equilibrium { Rt , Ŷtk } which specifies a sequence of beliefs
{Ŷte,k } indexed by k. As above, we start at some baseline REE { Rt , Yt }, and consider a
one-time unexpected shock change in the path for the interest rate { R̂t } at t = 0.
     The level-1 equilibrium { R̂t , Ŷt1 } is a temporary equilibrium given beliefs {Ŷte,1 } =
{Yt } corresponding to the aggregate income path of the original REE. In other words,
expectations for future aggregate income are unchanged after the announced change in
interest rates and equal to the original REE path. For each each t = 0, 1, . . . , Ŷt1 can be
computed as the following fixed point equation

                               Ŷt1 = C ∗ ({ R̂t+s }, Ŷt1 , {Yt+1+s }).

The level-1 equilibrium captures a situation where agents take into account the new an-
nounced path for interest rates and observe present income, but do not adjust their ex-
pectations about future income. However, actual realized income is affected.
     The level-2 equilibrium { R̂t , Ŷt2 } is a temporary equilibrium given beliefs {Ŷte,2 } =
{Ŷt1 } corresponding to the aggregate income path from level-1. For every t ≥ 0, Ŷt2 can
be computed as the following fixed point equation

                               Ŷt2 = C ∗ ({ R̂t+s }, Ŷt2 , {Ŷt1+1+s }).

Here agents update their beliefs to take into account that the change in aggregate spend-
ing (by all other agents) associated with level-1 thinking has an effect on aggregate in-
come (and hence on their own income). In other words, level-2 thinking incorporates the


                                                  13
general equilibrium effects of future income from level 1.
   Continuing, the level-k equilibrium { R̂t , Ŷtk } is defined as a temporary equilibrium
given beliefs {Ŷte,k } = {Ŷte,k−1 } corresponding to the aggregate income path of the level-
k − 1 equilibrium in a similar manner. Thus, Ŷtk solves the fixed point equation

                                   Ŷtk = C ∗ ({ R̂t+s }, Ŷtk , {Ŷtk+−11+s }).

Definition (Level-k equilibrium). Given an initial REE { Rt , Yt } and a new interest rate path
{ R̂t }, the level-k equilibrium { Rt , Ŷtk } is defined by a recursion indexed by k ≥ 0 with initial
condition {Ŷt0 } = {Yt }, and such that { R̂t , Ŷtk } is a temporary equilibrium given beliefs {Ŷte,k } =
{Ŷtk−1 }.

    In the definitions of temporary and level-k equilibria, we include the actual present
aggregate income, instead of some expectation over current aggregate income. This im-
plies that markets clear in the present period and that basic macroeconomic identities
hold. This impact of current aggregate income, however, will vanish in some cases in
continuous time.
    Note that in contrast to rational-expectations equilibria, there is no issue of equilib-
rium selection in level-k equilibria. The initial REE equilibrium { Rt , Yt } acts as an anchor
which ensures that the construction of the level-k equilibrium associated with a new in-
terest rate path { R̂t } is determinate.


Decomposing equilibrium changes: PE and GE. Start at some baseline REE { Rt , Yt }
and consider as above an one-time unexpected announcement at t = 0 of a new interest
rate path { R̂t }.
    Under rational expectations, the new equilibrium { R̂t , Ŷt } is an REE. We can decom-
pose the change in aggregate income

                                               ∆Yt = Ŷt − Yt

as
                                          ∆Yt = ∆YtPE + ∆YtGE ,

where

                 ∆YtPE = C ∗ ({ R̂t+s }, Yt , {Yt+1+s }) − C ∗ ({ Rt+s }, Yt , {Yt+1+s }),
                 ∆YtGE = C ∗ ({ R̂t+s }, Ŷt , {Ŷt+1+s }) − C ∗ ({ R̂t+s }, Yt , {Yt+1+s }).



                                                       14
The term ∆YtPE can be interpreted as a partial equilibrium effect considering only the
change in interest rates, holding constant current and future income. The term ∆YtGE cap-
tures the general equilibrium effects from changing current and future expected income,
holding interest rates fixed at their new level.
   Under level-k thinking, we denote the change in aggregate income by

                                              ∆Ytk = Ŷtk − Yt .

We can again use a decomposition

                                        ∆Ytk = ∆YtPE + ∆Ytk,GE ,

with
               ∆Ytk,GE = C ∗ ({ R̂t+s }, Ŷtk , {Ŷtk+−11+s }) − C ∗ ({ R̂t+s }, Yt , {Yt+1+s }).

In particular, since {Ŷt0 } = {Yt }, the only reason why ∆Yt1,GE = C ∗ ({ R̂t+s }, Ŷt1 , {Yt+1+s }) −
C ∗ ({ R̂t+s }, Yt , {Yt+1+s }) is not zero is due to the effect of the adjustment of current income
Ŷt1 . As we shall see, this difference vanishes in some cases in continuous time. In these
cases, level-1 thinking coincides exactly with the partial equilibrium effect.


Effects of monetary policy at different horizons. To summarize the effects of monetary
policy at different horizons, we define the elasticities of output at date t to an interest rate
change at date τ as follows.
    We consider an initial REE { Rt , Yt } which for simplicity we assume is a steady state
with Rt = R and Yt = Y for all t ≥ 0. We consider a change { R̂t } in the path for the
interest rate ∆Rτ at date τ so that R̂τ = R + ∆Rτ and R̂t = Rt for t 6= τ. The rational-
expectations elasticity is defined as

                                                            Rτ ∆Yt
                                        et,τ = lim −               ,
                                                 ∆Rτ →0     Yt ∆Rτ

and can be decomposed as
                                                     PE     GE
                                             et,τ = et,τ + et,τ ,




                                                      15
where

                                     PE            Rτ ∆YtPE
                                    et,τ = lim −            ,
                                            ∆Rτ →0 Yt ∆Rτ
                                     GE            Rτ ∆YtGE
                                    et,τ   = lim −          .
                                            ∆Rτ →0 Yt ∆Rτ

Similarly, the level-k elasticity is defined as

                                      k                 Rτ ∆Ytk
                                     et,τ = lim −               .
                                             ∆Rτ →0     Yt ∆Rτ

   An immediate consequence of the fact that the aggregate model is purely forward
looking is that all these elasticities are zero whenever t > τ. We will therefore focus on
the case where t ≤ τ.


2.2   Extended Model with an Aggregate State Variable
The previous analysis is sufficient for the simplest cases, such as the representative agent
and the perpetual youth overlapping generations models. Aggregate consumption is
purely forward looking in these cases. However, in an incomplete-markets Bewley-Aiyagari-
Huggett economy, the distribution of wealth induces a backward looking component. To
incorporate these effects we now extend the analysis to include an aggregate state vari-
able.
   Suppose that aggregate consumption is given by

                               Ct = C ∗ ({ Rt+s }, Yt , {Yte+1+s }, Ψt ),                        (4)

where the state variable Ψt is potentially of a large dimension and evolves according to
some equilibrium law of motion

                              Ψt+1 = M({ Rt+s }, Yt , {Yte+1+s }, Ψt ).                          (5)

The initial state Ψ0 is taken as given. In incomplete-markets economies, Ψt may capture
the distribution of wealth and M the evolution of the wealth distribution. The important
point is that the aggregate consumption function is no longer purely forward looking.
    We can easily extend all our definitions. A temporary equilibrium given beliefs {Yte }
is a set of sequences { Rt , Yt , Ψt } satisfying (2), (4), and (5) for all t ≥ 0. An REE is a set of
sequences { Rt , Yt , Yte , Ψt } such that { Rt , Yt , Ψt } is a temporary equilibrium given beliefs


                                                  16
{Yte } and which satisfies perfect foresight (3) for all t = 0, 1, . . . Given a baseline REE
and a one-time unexpected announced at t = 0 of a new interest rate path { R̂t }, level-k
equilibria { R̂t , Ŷtk , Ψ̂kt } are defined by a recursion indexed by k ≥ 0 with initial condition
{Ŷt0 } = {Yt }, and such that { R̂t , Ŷtk , Ψ̂kt } is a temporary equilibrium given beliefs {Ŷte,k } =
{Ŷtk−1 }. Armed with these definitions, it is straightforward to extend the definitions of the
                      PE , e GE , and ek . Since the model is no longer necessarily purely forward
elasticities et,τ , et,τ       t,τ       t,τ
looking, it is no longer necessarily true that all these elasticities are zero for t > τ.


3     The Representative-Agent Model
In this section, we consider the particular case of a representative-agent model with per
period utility function U in a Lucas tree economy with a unit supply of Lucas trees with
time-t value Vt capitalizing a stream δYt of dividends and with non-financial (labor) in-
come given by (1 − δ)Yt . The representative agent can invest in Lucas trees and also
borrow and lend in short-term risk-free bonds with the sequence of interest rates { Rt }.
At every point in time t, the agents has beliefs {Yte+1+s , Vte+1+s } about future aggregate
income and values of Lucas trees.
    In Section 3.1, we show how to derive the reduced-form aggregate consumption func-
tion from the consumption policy function of an individual problem using the asset mar-
ket clearing condition for a general utility function. We then leverage all the definitions of
Section 2.1: temporary equilibria, rational-expectations equilibria, level-k equilibria, and
the corresponding interest rate elasticities. In Section 3.2, we specialize the model to the
case of an isoelastic utility function and derive analytical results.


3.1    The General Representative-Agent Model
In this section, we consider a general utility function U.

Individual problem. Consider sequences { Rt , Yt , Yte , Vt , Vte }. An individual takes these
sequences as given. At every point in time t, current consumption ct , current bond and
Lucas tree holdings bt and xt are determined as a function of past bond and Lucas tree
holdings bt−1 and xt−1 via the individual policy functions

                     ct = c∗ (bt−1 , xt−1 ; { Rt+s }, Yt , {Yte+1+s }, Vt , {Vte+1+s }),
                     bt = b∗ (bt−1 , xt−1 ; { Rt+s }, Yt , {Yte+1+s }, Vt , {Vte+1+s }),
                     xt = x ∗ (bt−1 , xt−1 ; { Rt+s }, Yt , {Yte+1+s }, Vt , {Vte+1+s }).

                                                     17
This defines a recursion over t, which together with the initial conditions b−1 = 0 and
x−1 = 1, entirely determines individual sequences {ct , bt , xt }.
   The individual policy functions at time t are derived from the following individual
problem at time t, given bt−1 and xt−1 :

                                                                ∞
                                               max          ∑ βs U (c̃t+s )
                                       {c̃t+s ,b̃t+s ,x̃t+s s=0
                                                          }


subject to the current actual budget constraint

                          c̃t = (1 − δ)Yt + xt−1 Vt + bt−1 Rt−1 − x̃t Vt − b̃t ,

and future expected budget constraints

    c̃t+1+s = (1 − δ)Yte+1+s + x̃t+s Vte+1+s + b̃t+s Rt+s − x̃t+1+s Vte+1+s − b̃t+1+s           ∀s ≥ 0.

We define c∗ (bt−1 , xt−1 ; { Rt+s }, Yt , {Yte+1+s }, Vt , {Vte+1+s }), to be the value of c̃t at the op-
timum. Similarly, b∗ (bt−1 , xt−1 ; { Rt+s }, Yt , {Yte+1+s }, Vt , {Vte+1+s }) is the value of b̃t at the
optimum, and x ∗ (bt−1 , xt−1 ; { Rt+s }, Yt , {Yte+1+s }, Vt , {Vte+1+s }) is the value of x̃t at the op-
timum. These values satisfy the current actual budget constraint.14
    We now simplify these steps by imposing the following necessary no arbitrage condi-
tions for the individual problems to have a solution:

                                                    Vte+1
                                 Vt = δYt +                       ∀t ≥ 0,
                                                     Rt
                                                     ∞   δYte+1+s
                                 Vte   =   δYte   +∑ s                      ∀t ≥ 0.                       (6)
                                                   s =0 Π u =0 R t + u

Given no arbitrage, an individual agents is indifferent between bonds and Lucas trees,
and the composition of his portfolio is indeterminate. Accordingly, we define a new vari-
able at = bt−1 Rt−1 + xt−1 (δYt + Vt ) denoting financial wealth at time t.
   We can then simplify the individual problem at time t:

                                                            ∞
                                               max        ∑ βs U (c̃t+s )
                                            {c̃t ,ãt+1+s } s=0

  14 Importantly, note that at the optimum { c̃
                                                      t+1+s , b̃t+1+s , x̃t+1+s } is in general different from
{ct+1+s , bt+1+s , xt+1+s }. This is a symptom of time inconsistency when beliefs deviate from rational ex-
pectations.

subject to the current actual budget constraint

                                                                   ãt+1
                                      c̃t = (1 − δ)Yt + at −             ,
                                                                     Rt

and future expected budget constraints

                                                                    ãt+2+s
                      c̃t+1+s = (1 − δ)Yte+1+s + ãt+1+s −                       ∀s ≥ 0,
                                                                    R t +1+ s

We denote by c∗ ( at ; { Rt+s }, Yt , {Yte+1+s }) and a∗ ( at ; { Rt+s }, Yt , {Yte+1+s }) the individual
policy functions of the individual problem at time t. They are given by the values of
time-t consumption c̃t and time-t + 1 assets ãt+1 at the individual optimum. These val-
ues satisfy the current actual time-t budget constraint. Note that Vt and {Vte+1+s } are no
longer arguments of these policy functions, a very convenient simplification.
   At every point in time t, current consumption ct and financial wealth at+1 are deter-
mined as a function of past financial wealth at via the individual policy functions

                                    ct = c∗ ( at ; { Rt+s }, Yt , {Yte+1+s }),
                                 at+1 = a∗ ( at ; { Rt+s }, Yt , {Yte+1+s }).

This defines a recursion over t, which together with the initial conditions a0 = V0 , entirely
determines the individual sequences {ct , at }.


Reduced-form aggregate consumption function. The reduced-form aggregate consump-
tion is obtained from the individual consumption function C ({ Rt+s }, Yt , {Yte+1+s }) =
c( at ; { Rt+s }, Yt , {Yte+1+s }) by imposing the asset market clearing condition at = Vt , where
Vt is given by the no-arbitrage condition (6). This yields

                                                         ∞  δYte+1
          C ({ Rt+s }, Yt , {Yte+1+s })   = c (δYt + ∑ s
                                              ∗
                                                                         ; { Rt+s }, Yt , {Yte+1+s }).
                                                     s =1
                                                          Π u =0 R t + u

   We can then use this reduced-form aggregate consumption function to go through all
the definitions given in Section 2: temporary equilibria, rational-expectations equilibria,
level-k equilibria, and the corresponding interest rate elasticities.

3.2   Isoelastic Utility Function
In this section, we specialize the model to the case of an isoelastic utility function with
intertemporal elasticity of substitution σ:
                                                       1
                                                   c1− σ −1
                                                                    if   σ 6=1,
                                  U (c) =            1− σ1
                                              log(c)                if   σ = 1.

It is then easy to see that the individual consumption function is

                                                                                                  (1−δ)Yte+1+s
                                                        at + (1 − δ)Yt + ∑∞
                                                                          s =0                     Πsu=0 Rt+u
              c∗ ( at ; { Rt+s }, Yt , {Yte+1+s }) =                                                             ,
                                                                                       β σ (1+ s )
                                                                     1 + ∑∞
                                                                          s =0    Πsu=0 Rt+u 1−σ


so that the aggregate reduced-form consumption function is

                                                                                    Yte+1+s
                                                                     Yt + ∑∞
                                                                           s =0    Πsu=0 Rt+u
                       C ({ Rt+s }, Yt , {Yte+1+s }) =                                               .
                                                                                    β σ (1+ s )
                                                                 1 + ∑∞
                                                                      s =0    Πsu=0 Rt+u 1−σ


Equilibrium characterization. For concreteness, we briefly characterize the various equi-
libria in the context of this particular model. Given beliefs {Yte }, and given the path for
interest rates { Rt }, { Rt , Yt } is a temporary equilibrium if and only if the path for aggre-
gate income {Yt } is given by

                                                    Yte+1+s
                                           ∑∞
                                            s =0   Πsu=0 Rt+u
                                  Yt =                                    ∀t ≥ 0.
                                                       β σ (1+ s )
                                         ∑∞
                                          s =0   Πsu=0 Rt+u 1−σ


Similarly, given the path for interest rates { Rt }, { Rt , Yt } is an REE if and only if the path
for aggregate income {Yt } satisfies the fixed point

                                           ∑∞
                                                    Yt+1+s
                                            s =0   Πsu=0 Rt+u
                                  Yt =                                    ∀t ≥ 0.
                                                    β σ (1+ s )
                                         ∑∞
                                          s =0   Πsu=0 Rt+u 1−σ




                                                        20
Finally given an initial REE { Rt , Yt } and a new interest rate path { R̂t }, the level-k equilib-
ria { R̂t , Ŷtk } satisfy the following recursion over k ≥ 0:

                                                   Ŷtk+−11+s
                                          ∑∞
                                           s =0   Πsu=0 R̂t+u
                                Ŷtk =                          ∀t ≥ 0,
                                                 β σ (1+ s )
                                         ∑∞
                                          s=0 Πs R̂t+u 1−σ
                                               u =0


with the initialization that Ŷt0 = Yt for all t ≥ 0.
   We now turn to the computation of the different interest rate elasticities of output
around a steady state REE { Rt , Yt } with Rt = R = β−1 > 1 and Yt = Y > 0 for all t ≥ 0.


Monetary policy at different horizons under RE. We start with the RE case, where as
discussed above, we use the selection that limt→∞ Yt = Y as we perform the comparative
statics underlying the computation of the interest rate elasticities of output.

Proposition 1 (Representative agent, isoelastic utility, RE). Consider the representative-agent
model with isoelastic utility and rational expectations. For t > τ the interest rate elasticities of
output are zero et,τ = 0. For t ≤ τ, they depend only on the horizon τ − t and are given by

                                               et,τ = σ.

They can be decomposed as et,τ = et,τ  PE + e GE into PE and GE elasticities e PE and e GE . For t > τ
                                             t,τ                              t,τ      t,τ
                             PE = e GE = 0. For t ≤ τ, they depend only on the horizon τ − t and
these elasticities are zero et,τ    t,τ
are given by
                            PE          1             GE             1
                          et,τ  = σ τ −t+1 and et,τ      = σ (1 − τ − t +1 ).
                                   R                              R
    Because the aggregate model is purely forward looking, the interest rate elasticity et,τ
of output at date t to interest rate changes at date τ is zero for t > τ. From now on we
focus on t ≤ τ and we call τ − t the horizon of monetary policy.
    The total interest rate elasticity of output is equal to the intertemporal elasticity of
substitution et,τ = σ, independently of the horizon τ − t. This lack of horizon effect is
a version of the “forward guidance puzzle”, which refers to the extreme effectiveness of
forward guidance (interest rate changes in the future) in standard New-Keynesian models
compared to its apparently more limited effectiveness in the data.
    To understand this result, it it useful to go back to the decomposition into PE and GE
effects. The lack of horizon effect
                                           ∂et,τ
                                                 =0
                                             ∂τ


                                                    21
                                                                                                                  ∂e
can be understood as follows, where, slightly abusing notation, we write ∂τt,τ for et,τ +1 −
                                                            PE is decreasing with the horizon
et,τ . The PE effect does feature a horizon effect so that et,τ
τ − t with
                                     PE
                                   ∂et,τ              PE
                                         = − log( R)et,τ < 0.
                                    ∂τ
This is because for a given path of output, a cut in interest rates is more discounted, and
hence leads to a smaller partial equilibrium consumption increase, the further into the
future the interest rate cut takes place. But the GE effect features an exactly offsetting
                              GE increases with the horizon τ − t with
anti-horizon effect so that et,τ

                                                      GE
                                                    ∂et,τ    ∂e PE
                                                          = − t,τ > 0.
                                                     ∂τ       ∂τ

This is because in general equilibrium, output increases for a longer time, up until the
horizon of the interest rate cut, leading to a higher increase in human and financial wealth,
the further into the future the interest rate cut takes place, and hence leads to a larger
consumption increase. As a result, the relative importance of the GE effect increases with
the horizon, and that of the PE effect correspondingly decreases with the horizon, but the
two effects always sum up to a constant total effect.


Monetary policy at different horizons under level-k.                             We now turn to the level-k case.
We start by defining the function

                                              k −1              τ − t −1 τ − t −1− s0         τ − t −1 − s m −3
                     k
                    E ( R − 1, τ − t) =       ∑ ( R − 1)    m
                                                                  ∑          ∑          ···         ∑             1.
                                              m =0               s0 =0      s1 =0                s m −2 =0


The function E k is increasing in k with E 1 ( R − 1, τ − t, 1) = 1 and limk→∞ E k ( R − 1, τ −
t) = Rτ −t .15

Proposition 2 (Representative agent, level-k). Consider the representative-agent model with
isoelastic utility and level-k thinking. For t > τ the interest rate elasticities of output are zero
  15 It   is also useful to compute a few other examples explicitly. We have

                      E 1 ( R − 1, τ − t, 1) = 1,
                      E 2 ( R − 1, τ − t, 2) = 1 + ( R − 1)(τ − t),
                                                                         ( R − 1)2 (τ − t − 1)(τ − t)
                      E 3 ( R − 1, τ − t, 3) = 1 + ( R − 1)(τ − t) +                                  .
                                                                                       2




                                                           22
 k = 0. For t ≤ τ, they depend only on the horizon τ − t and are given by
et,τ

                                     k        E k ( R − 1, τ − t)
                                    et,τ =σ                       .
                                                      Rτ −t

    As above, we focus on the interesting case t ≤ τ. To begin with, note that the in-
terest rate elasticity of output with level-k thinking converges to its rational-expectations
counterpart in the limit k → ∞:
                                              k
                                        lim et,τ = et,τ .
                                         k→∞

The rational-expectations case can therefore be seen as a limit case of level-k thinking
as the number of rounds k goes to ∞. Recall that the treatment of rational expectations
required an equilibrium selection, whereas that of the level-k case did not. Hence one can
also see the convergence of the level-k equilibrium to the particular rational-expectations
limit as a validation of the equilibrium selection that underpinned its construction.
    Next recall that the PE effect is always the same under rational expectations and under
                      PE . The level-1 elasticity is always higher than the PE effect by a factor
level-k thinking at et,τ

                                                                              ∂ek     k +1    k +1

The mitigation effect et,τ < et,τ is entirely due to a mitigation of the GE effect et,τ < et,τ .
Similarly, the monotonically increasing convergence limk→∞ et,τ    k = e
                                                                          t,τ is entirely due to
                                                                         k,GE      GE .
the monotonically increasing convergence of the GE effect limk→∞ et,τ = et,τ
   In addition, for any k > 0, in contrast to the rational-expectations case, there is now a
horizon effect of monetary policy
                                               k
                                            ∂et,τ
                                                  < 0,

                                                 23
so that the effects of monetary policy decrease with its horizon. This horizon effect disap-
pears in the rational-expectations limit when k goes to ∞.
    However the mitigation and horizon effects are rather weak. To see this focus on the
                    1 = σ 1 and so
case k = 1. Then et,τ     Rτ −t

                                       1
                                     ∂et,τ             1
                                           = − log( R)et,τ .
                                      ∂τ
           1 = e
Hence et,τ        t,τ when the interest rate change is contemporaneous τ − t = 0, and then
  1
et,τ decreases with the horizon τ − t at the exponential rate log( R) while et,τ = σ stays
constant. We call log( R) the strength of the horizon effect. If the annual interest rate is
5%, the effects of monetary policy decrease at rate 5% per year with a half life of 14 years;
if the annual interest rate is 1%, the effects of monetary policy decrease at rate 1% per year
with a half life of 69 years.
     There is a simple intuition for all these results in terms of the decomposition of the
effects of monetary policy into PE and GE effects. The PE effect features mitigation—the
effect of interest rate changes is lower than the full effect under rational expectations
because the latter is the sum of the GE and the PE effect. It also features horizon—for
a fixed path of output, interest rate changes affect partial equilibrium consumption less,
the further in the future they are. These effects are weak for reasonable values of R. As
we shall see below, this last conclusion can be overturned in models with heterogenous
agents and incomplete markets.
     Under rational expectations, the GE effect eliminates the mitigation feature by adding
to the PE effect, and eliminates the horizon effect because the GE effect features an anti-
horizon effect. At round k = 1, monetary policy almost (exactly in the continuous time
limit) coincides with the PE effect and features weak mitigation and weak horizon. In
the rational-expectations limit when k goes to ∞, the mitigation and horizon effects dis-
appear. Intermediate values of k interpolate smoothly and monotonically between these
two extremes.
     It is also interesting to note that the various interest rate elasticities of output are all
independent of the amount of outside liquidity δ. This is because human and financial
wealth play very similar roles in this representative-agent model. As we shall see shortly,
this irrelevance breaks down in heterogenous agents models with incomplete markets.

3.3     Continuous-Time Limit
We now explain how the results can be adapted in continuous time. This can be done
either directly by setting up the model in continuous time, or by taking the continuous-
time limit of the discrete time model. In Section 4, we follow the former approach. In this
section instead, we follow the latter.
    The continuous-time limit involves considering a sequence of economies indexed by
n ≥ 0, where the calendar length λn of a period decreases with n. For example, we
can take λn = n1 . We keep the discount factor constant per unit of calendar time as we
increase n requires by imposing that the discount factor per period equal β n = eρλn for
some instantaneous discount rate ρ. The steady-state interest rate is then constant per
unit of calendar time as we increase n, but the interest rate per period is Rn = erλn for the
instantaneous interest rate r = ρ. This naturally implies that limn→∞ β n = limn→∞ Rn =
1. Note that a given calendar date t corresponds to a different period number tn (t) = λtn
for different values of n.
    We can then apply our definitions from the previous sections for every value of n and
take the limit as n goes to ∞. For fixed calendar date t and τ, we can compute the limits
of etn (t),tn (τ ) , etPE
                       n ( t ),tn ( τ )
                                        , etGE(t),t (τ ) , etk (t),t (τ ) , and etk,GE
                                                                                    (t),t (τ )
                                                                                               when n goes to ∞. We denote
                                  n    n         n    n               n     n
                        PE , e GE , ek , and ek,GE . They represent the elasticities of output at
these limits by et,τ , et,τ   t,τ    t,τ      t,τ
date t to a localized cumulated interest rate change ∆rτ at date τ, by which we mean
a change in the interest rate path {r̂t } given by r̂t = r + ∆rτ δτ (t) where δτ is the Dirac
                 Rt                                   Rt
function so that 0 (r̂u − r )du = 0 for t < τ and 0 (r̂u − r )du = ∆rτ for t > τ.
   We also define the continuous-time analogue Ectk (r (τ − t)) of E k ( R − 1, τ − t):

                                                             k −1
                                                                 [r (τ − t)]m
                                       Ectk (r (τ − t)) =   ∑         m!
                                                                              ,
                                                            m =0


where Ectk (r (τ − t)) is increasing in k with Ect1 (r (τ − t)) = 1 and limk→∞ Ectk (r (τ − t)) =
er (τ −t ) .

Proposition 3 (Representative agent, continuous time). Consider the representative-agent
model with isoelastic utility and either rational expectations or level-k thinking. For t > τ the
                                                      k = 0. For t ≤ τ, they depend only on the
interest rate elasticities of output are zero et,τ = et,τ
horizon τ − t and are given by

                         et,τ = σ,       PE
                                        et,τ = σe−r(τ −t) ,          GE
                                                                    et,τ = σ [1 − e −r ( τ − t ) ],

                                            k
                                           et,τ = σe−r(τ −t) Ectk (r (τ − t)).

                                                           25
    All of our other results go through and the intuitions are identical. In particular, level-k
                                      k < e , and monotonic convergence with t,τ > 0   ∂ek
thinking features (weak) mitigation et,τ     t,τ                                 ∂k
              k
and limk→∞ et,τ = 1 . Compared to the discrete-time case, a useful simplification occurs
for k = 1 since now have
                                  1
                                 et,τ    PE
                                      = et,τ = σe−r(τ −t) ,

so that level-1 now coincides exactly (and not just approximately) with the PE effect.
This is because in continuous time, the impact of current income on current consumption
vanishes, since it becomes a vanishing fraction of permanent income. As a result, the
(weak) horizon effect is now given by

                                          1
                                        ∂et,τ      1
                                              = −ret,τ ,
                                         ∂τ

so that its strength is simply r.


4    The Perpetual-Youth Model of Borrowing Constraints
In this section we introduce a standard overlapping generations model of the “perpetual
youth” variety a la Yaari (1965) and Blanchard (1985). As is well known, overlapping
generation models can be reinterpreted as models with heterogenous agents subject to
borrowing constraints (see e.g. Woodford, 1990, Kocherlakota 1992). The death event
under the finite lifetime interpretation represents a binding borrowing constraint in the
other interpretation. The important common property is that horizons are shortened in
that consumption is only smoothed over a limited intervals of time.
    We offer an explicit interpretation along these lines. The perpetual youth setup with
homothetic preferences and annuities allows us to neatly isolate the impact of occasion-
ally binding borrowing constraints while getting rid of precautionary savings. It also
implies that the model aggregates linearly, and therefore, that no extra aggregate state
variable capturing the wealth distribution is required to characterize the aggregate equi-
librium.
    We set up the model directly in continuous time for tractability. The economy is popu-
lated by infinitely-lived agents randomly hit by idiosyncratic discount factor shocks that
make borrowing constraints bind according to a Poisson process. There is unit mass of
ex-ante identical atomistic agents indexed by i which is uniformly distributed over [0, 1].
    We assume that per-period utility U is isoelastic with a unitary intertemporal elasticity
of substitution σ = 1 which simplifies the analysis. We refer the reader to the appendix


                                               26
for the case σ 6= 1.
    We allow for positive outside liquidity in the form of Lucas trees in unit-supply with
time-t value Vt capitalizing a stream δYt of dividends and with non-financial (labor) in-
come given by (1 − δ)Yt , the ownership of which at date 0 is uniformly distributed across
agents. At every date, non-financial income is distributed uniformly across the popula-
tion.
    Agents can invest in Lucas trees and also borrow and lend in short-term risk-free
bonds with the sequence of instantaneous interest rates {rt } subject to their borrowing
constraints, and can also purchase actuarially fair annuities.


Individual problem. We first describe the individual problem. We proceed as in Sec-
tion 3.1 to formulate the individual problem given the aggregate paths {Yt , Yte , rt } directly
in terms of total financial wealth ait as long as Lucas trees satisfy the no-arbitrage condi-
tions                                  Z ∞          Rs
                                Vt =        δYt+s e− 0 rt+u du ds.                           (7)
                                                       0
    Agents are hit by idiosyncratic Poisson shocks with intensity λ. The life of an agent
i is divided into “periods” by the successive realizations n of his idiosyncratic Poisson
process occurring at the stopping times τni , with the convention τ0i = 0. The agent has
a low discount factor β < 1 between the different “periods” and an instantaneous dis-
count rate ρ within each “period”. Importantly, the agent cannot borrow against his fu-
ture non-financial or human wealth accruing in any future “period”. In other words, for
τni ≤ t < τni +1 , agent i cannot borrow against any future non-financial income or human
wealth accruing after τni +1 . We assume that the discount factor β < 1 is sufficiently low
that agents are up against their borrowing constraints between two “periods”, so that in
equilibrium, agents always choose not to bring in any financial wealth from one “period”
to the next and hence that aiτ i = 0 for all n ≥ 0 and i ∈ [0, 1], where ait denotes the
                                     n +1
financial wealth of agent i at time t. The parameter λ can then be thought of as indexing
the frequency of binding borrowing constraints.
    The problem of an individual agent at date t with financial wealth ait and who is in
“period” nt is therefore given by

                                                   ∞           Z τi

                                                       t


The individual consumption function is the policy function for consumption at date t and
is given by
                                                                       Z ∞                     Rs

                                                                       0

Note that this policy function is independent of the “period” n because the idiosyncratic
Poisson process is memoryless. It depends only on expected future income {Yte+s } but
not on current income Yt because of the continuous time assumption.
    The law of motion for ait is given by the actual (as opposed to expected) budget con-
straints

       dait
            = (rt + λ) ait + Yt − c∗ ( ait ; {rt+s }, {Yte+s })                  for   τni t +n ≤ t + s < τni t +n+1 ,

                                                            a0i = Vt ,

and the borrowing constraints
                                                      aiτn = 0       ∀n ≥ 1.

Aggregate state variable. The model also features an aggregate state variable as in Sec-
tion 2.2: the wealth distribution Ψt = { ait }. The law of motion for Ψt is entirely deter-
mined by the laws of motion for individual financial wealth ait . However as we shall see
below, this aggregate state variable is not required to characterize the aggregate equilib-
rium.


Reduced-form aggregate consumption function.          The reduced-form aggregate con-
sumption function is obtained by aggregating over i the individual consumption function

                                                                 28

C ({rt+s }, {Yte+s }) = 0 c∗ ( ait ; {rt+s }, {Yte+s })di and imposing the asset market clearing
condition ait di = Vt , where Vt is given by the no-arbitrage condition (7). This yields
            R

                                          Z ∞                Rs                    Z ∞                         Rs
  C ({rt+s }, {Yte+s })   = (ρ + λ)[            δYte+s e−    0    rt+u du
                                                                            ds +         (1 − δ)Yte+s e−        0 (rt+u + λ ) du   ds].
                                           0                                       0

    Just like the individual consumption function, and for the same reason, the reduced-
form aggregate consumption function depends only on expected future income {Yte+s }
but not on current income Yt . More importantly, the aggregate consumption function is

the value of Lucas trees Vt , is still discounter at rate e− 0 rt+u du . This is intuitive since
borrowing constraints limit the ability of agents to borrow against future non-financial
income but does not prevent them from selling their assets when they are borrowing
constraints.16 The representative-agent model can be obtained as the limit of this model
when the frequency λ of binding borrowing constraints goes to zero.


Equilibrium characterization. For concreteness, we briefly characterize the various equi-
libria in the context of this particular model. Given beliefs {Yte }, and given the path for
interest rates {rt }, {rt , Yt } is a temporary equilibrium if and only if the path for aggregate
income {Yt } is given by
                        Z ∞               Rs                 Z ∞                          Rs
       Yt = (ρ + λ)[          δYte+s e−   0 rt+u du   ds +          (1 − δ)Yte+s e−        0 (rt+u + λ ) du   ds]    ∀t ≥ 0.
                          0                                   0

Similarly, given the path for interest rates {rt }, {rt , Yt } is an REE if and only if the path
for aggregate income {Yt } satisfies the fixed point
                        Z ∞               Rs                 Z ∞                          Rs
       Yt = (ρ + λ)[          δYt+s e−    0 rt+u du   ds +          (1 − δ)Yt+s e−         0 (rt+u + λ ) du   ds]    ∀t ≥ 0.
                          0                                   0
  16 Note  that this requires financial assets to be liquid. Financial income (dividends) from partly illiquid
assets should be discounted at a higher rate. For example, suppose that a fraction of trees can be sold while
others cannot (or at a very large cost). Illiquid trees should thenR be treated like non-financial income. The
                                                                      s
financial income of illiquid
                          Rs
                             trees should be discounted at rate e− 0 (rt+u +λ)du while that of liquid trees should
be discounted at rate e− 0 rt+u du . In essence, introducing illiquid trees is isomorphic to a reduction in δ.




                                                             29
Finally given an initial REE {rt , Yt } and a new interest rate path {r̂t }, the level-k equilibria
{r̂t , Ŷtk } satisfy the following recursion over k ≥ 0:
                         Z ∞                  Rs                  Z ∞                        Rs
     Ŷtk   = (ρ + λ)[         δŶtk+−s1 e−    0 rt+u du   ds +         (1 − δ)Ŷtk+−s1 e−   0 (rt+u + λ ) du   ds]   ∀t ≥ 0.
                         0                                        0

with the initialization that Ŷt0 = Yt for all t ≥ 0.
   We now turn to the computation of the different interest rate elasticities of output
around a steady state REE { Rt , Yt } Yt = Y > 0 and rt = r for all t ≥ 0 with

                                                              ρ+λ    ρ+λ
                                              1 = (1 − δ )        +δ     .
                                                              r+λ     r

Later when we derive comparative statics with respects to variations in λ, we vary ρ at
the same time to keep the interest rate constant at r.


Monetary policy at different horizons under RE. We start with the RE case, where we
use the selection limt→∞ Yt = Y as we perform the comparative statics underlying the
computation of the interest rate elasticities of output.

Proposition 4 (Perpetual youth model of borrowing constraints, RE). Consider the perpet-
ual youth model of borrowing constraints with logarithmic utility σ = 1 and rational expectations.
For t > τ the interest rate elasticities of output are zero et,τ = 0. For t ≤ τ, they depend only on
the horizon τ − t and are given
                                               et,τ = 1.

They can be decomposed as et,τ = et,τ  PE + e GE into PE and GE elasticities e PE and e GE . For t > τ
                                             t,τ                              t,τ      t,τ
                             PE = e GE = 0. For t ≤ τ, they are given by
these elasticities are zero et,τ   t,τ


                   PE               ρ + λ −(r+λ)(τ −t)    ρ + λ −r ( τ − t )
                  et,τ = (1 − δ )        e             +δ         e
                                    r+λ                       r
                                    ρ+λ                           ρ+λ
                   GE
                  et,τ   = (1 − δ )      [1 − e−(r+λ)(τ −t) ] + δ      [1 − e −r ( τ − t ) ].
                                    r+λ                             r

    A remarkable result in this proposition is that the interest rate elasticity of output et,τ
is completely independent of the frequency λ of binding borrowing constraints

                                                            ∂et,τ
                                                                  = 0,
                                                             ∂λ

and is therefore exactly identical to its counterpart in the representative-agent model as
described in Proposition 1 adapted to continuous time in Proposition 3. In other words,

                                                                  30
the incompleteness of markets introduced in the perpetual youth model of borrowing
constraints is irrelevant for the aggregate effects of monetary policy. This is essentially
a version of the incomplete markets irrelevance result of Werning (2015). Although the
result also holds for any δ > 0, the intuition is conveyed most transparently in the case
of no outside liquidity δ = 0 because in this case ρ = r is independent of λ (otherwise
we have to vary ρ so as to keep r constant when we vary λ). The PE effect is weaker, the
higher is λ, so that
                                PE
                              ∂et,τ
                                    = −(τ − t)e−(r+λ)(τ −t) < 0.
                               ∂λ
This is because for a given path of output, a higher frequency λ of borrowing constraints
leads to more discounting of future interest rate cuts, and hence to a response of con-
sumption to a future interest rate cut in partial equilibrium. But the GE effect is stronger,
the higher is λ, leading to a complete offset

                                                                 GE
                                                               ∂et,τ    ∂e PE
                                                                     = − t,τ > 0.
                                                                ∂λ       ∂λ

This is because the aggregate marginal propensity to consume ρ + λ = r + λ increases
with the frequency λ of borrowing constraints, and hence so does the general equilibrium
Keynesian multiplier.17


Monetary policy at different horizons under level-k.                                           We now turn to the level-k case.

Proposition 5 (Perpertual youth model of borrowing constraints, level-k). Consider the
perpetual youth model of borrowing constraints with logarithmic utility σ = 1 and level-k think-
                                                                  k = 0. For t ≤ τ, they depend
ing. For t > τ the interest rate elasticities of output are zero et,τ
only on the horizon τ − t and are given by the recursion

                −r ( τ − t )                  −(r +λ)(τ −t)            R τ −t      −1

                         0 = 0. This simplifies in the extreme cases of no outside liquidity δ = 0
with the initialization et,τ
and very abundant outside liquidity when δ goes to 1:

                                    k
                                   et,τ = e−(r+λ)(τ −t) Ectk ((r + λ)(τ − t))                    when     δ = 0,

                                   et,τ = e−r(τ −t) Ectk (r (τ − t))                when     δ → 1.
  17 Note that this property holds despite the existence of a countervailing effect that arises because the

increase in human wealth associated with the general equilibrium increase in output is lower when λ is
higher because human wealth is more discounted.


                                                                            31
    Unlike in the rational-expectations case, under level-k, the interest rate elasticity of
          k depends of the frequency λ of binding borrowing constraints, breaking the
output et,τ
irrelevance-of-incomplete-markets result in Werning (2015). Indeed, there are now sim-
ilarities but also important differences between Proposition 5 and its counterpart in the
representative-agent model as described in Proposition 2 adapted to continuous time in
Proposition 3.

          k now depends on the frequency λ of binding borrowing constraints as long
    But et,τ
as δ < 1, and as a result differs from its value in the rational-expectations case, where
we vary ρ to keep the interest rate r constant as we vary λ. For simplicity, we focus on
the case with no outside liquidity δ = 0 where r = ρ, which leads to very transparent
formulas. For any k, et,τk decreases with λ so that more frequent borrowing constraints

lead to stronger mitigation of the effects of monetary policy

Moreover, for any k, ∂τt,τ decreases with λ so that more frequent borrowing constraints
lead to stronger horizon effects of monetary policy for small enough horizons

These effects disappear in the rational-expectations case which obtains in the limit where
k goes to ∞. These effects also disappear when outside liquidity is very abundant in the

limit where δ goes to 1 since then et,τ             ct
   This can be seen most clearly in the case k = 1 where when δ = 0, we get

                                                       1
                                                     ∂et,τ

                                                      ∂τ

so that the strength of the mitigation and horizon effects is r + λ instead of r in the
representative-agent case. As a result, the mitigation and horizon effects are plausibly
much stronger than in the representative-agent case, even if the interest rate is very low.
If the annual interest rate is r = 5%, then the effects of monetary policy decrease at rate
5% per year with a half life of 14 years if λ = 0 as in the representative-agent case, but


                                                32
decrease at rate 15% per year with a half life of 5 years if λ = 10%; if the annual interest
rate is 1% the effects of monetary policy decrease at rate 11% per year with a half life of 69
years if λ = 0 as in the representative-agent case, but decrease at rate 11% per year with a
half life of 6 years if λ = 10%. In the limit of very abundant outside liquidity when δ goes
                                       ∂e1
                         1 = e−rt and t,τ = −re1 as in the representative-agent case and
to 1 instead, we have et,τ               ∂τ         t,τ
independently of λ.
    The results for a finite k are in striking contrast to the rational-expectations bench-
mark, which obtains in the limit where k goes to ∞. Level-k thinking leads to a mitigation
of the effects of monetary policy so that interest rate changes have less of an effect on
output. Level-k thinking also leads to a horizon effect of monetary policy so that interest
rate changes have less of an effect on output, the further in the future they take place.
The mitigation and horizon effects that arise with level-k thinking are stronger, the more
frequent are borrowing constraints, i.e. the higher is λ. This illustrates a profound interac-
tion between level-k thinking and incomplete markets. This interaction disappears in the
limit where outside liquidity is very abundant when δ goes to 1.
    There is a simple intuition for all these results in terms of the decomposition of the
effects of monetary policy into PE and GE effects. As already explained in Section 3, the
PE effect features mitigation—the effect of interest rate changes is lower than the full ef-
fect under rational expectations because the latter is the sum of the GE and the PE effect.
It also features horizon—for a fixed path of output, interest rate changes affect partial
equilibrium consumption less, the further in the future they are. Under rational expec-
tations, the GE effect eliminates the mitigation effect by adding to the PE effect, and also
eliminates the horizon effect because the GE effect features an anti-horizon effect. With
level-1 thinking, monetary policy coincides with the PE effect and features mitigation and
horizon. In the rational-expectations limit when k goes to ∞, the mitigation and horizon
effects disappear. Intermediate values of k interpolate smoothly and monotonically be-
tween these two extremes.
    The effects of the frequency λ of binding borrowing constraints can be understood
as follows. The horizon and mitigation effects of the PE effect are stronger, the higher
is λ because of higher discounting of non-financial (human) wealth. Under rational ex-
pectations, the GE effect offsets this dependence on λ because the aggregate marginal
propensity to consume ρ + λ and hence the Keynesian multiplier increase with λ. At
level-1, monetary policy coincides with the PE effect and the horizon and mitigation fea-
tures are stronger, the higher is λ. In the rational-expectations limit where k goes to ∞, the
dependence of the mitigation and horizon effects on λ disappears. Intermediate values of
k interpolate smoothly and monotonically between these two extremes. This also explains


                                             33
why the interaction between bounded rationality and incomplete markets disappears in
the limit where outside liquidity is very abundant when δ goes to 1, since it is only non-

5    The Bewley-Aiyagari-Huggett Model of Borrowing Con-
     straints and Precautionary Savings
In this section, we consider a standard Bewley-Aiyagari-Huggett model of incomplete
markets. This model features not only occasionally binding borrowing constraints like
the perpetual youth model of borrowing constraints developed in Section 4 but also pre-
cautionary savings. As a result, individual consumption functions are no longer linear
but are instead concave, linear aggregation does not obtain, and the wealth distribution
becomes a relevant aggregate state variable.
    There is a unit mass of infinitely-lived agents indexed by i distributed uniformly over
[0, 1]. Time is discrete with a period taken to be a quarter. Agents have logarithmic utility
σ = 1 and discount factor β.
    Agents face idiosyncratic non-financial income risk yit (1 − δ)Yt . There is a unit supply
of Lucas trees capitalizing the flow of dividends δYt . The idiosyncratic income process
is log(yit ) = ρe log(yit−1 ) + eti , where eti is i.i.d. over time, independent across agents
and follows a normal distribution with variance σe2 and mean E[eti ] = −σe2 /2 so that
R ei
  e t di = 1.
    Agents can borrow and lend subject to borrowing constraints. We assume that the
borrowing contracts have the same form as the Lucas trees. We also assume that the
borrowing constraints take a simple form, namely that agents cannot have a negative
position asset position. These choices ensure that under rational expectations, the irrele-
vance result of Werning (2015) holds, and the interest rate elasticity of output coincides
with that of a complete-markets or representative agent model et,τ = 1.


Individual problem. We first describe the individual problem. We proceed as in Section
3.1 to formulate the individual problem given the aggregate paths {Yt , Yte , Rt } directly in
terms of total financial wealth ait as long as Lucas trees satisfy the no-arbitrage conditions
(6).
     The problem on an at date t with financial wealth ait is

The policy function for consumption at date t is the individual consumption function and
is given by c∗ ( ait , yit ; { Rt+s }, Yt , {Yte+s }). The law of motion for ait is given by the actual (as
opposed to expected) budget constraint ait+1 = Rt [(1 − δ)yit Yt + ait − c∗ ( ait , yit ; { Rt+s }, Yt , {Yte+s })].


Aggregate state variable. The model also features an aggregate state variable as in Sec-
tion 2.2: the joint distribution of wealth and income shocks Ψt = { ait , yit }. The law of mo-
tion for Ψt is entirely determined by the laws of motion for individual financial wealth
and income shocks given an initial condition Ψ0 with a0 dΨ( a0 , y0 ) = V0 , where V0 is
                                                         R
                                                R
given by the no-arbitrage condition (6) and y0 dΨ( a0 , y0 ) = 1. In contrast to the per-
petual youth model of borrowing constraints developed in Section 4, this aggregate state
variable is required to characterize the aggregate equilibrium.


Reduced-form aggregate consumption function.          The reduced-form aggregate con-
sumption function is obtained by aggregating over i the individual consumption function
                                                      Z 1
            C ({ Rt+s }, Yt , {Yte+s }, Ψt )     =           c∗ ( at , yt ; { Rt+s }, Yt , {Yte+s })dΨt ( at , yt ).
                                                        0

Temporary equilibria, RE equilibria, and level-k equilibria are then defined exactly as in
the general reduced form model described in Section 2.

Monetary policy at different horizons. This model cannot be solved analytically, and
so we rely on simulations instead. We consider a steady state {Y, R, Ψ} of the model with
a 2% annual interest rate and a corresponding quarterly interest rate of R = 1.005. We
take ρe = 0.966, and σe2 = 0.017 for the idiosyncratic income process as in McKay et al.
(2016) and Guerrieri and Lorenzoni (2015). For our baseline economy, we take V       Y = 1.44
for the fraction of outside liquidity to output, exactly as in McKay et al. (2016).18 The
values of β = 0.988 and δ = 0.035 are calibrated to deliver these values of R and V    Y . The
fraction of borrowing-constrained agents in the steady state is then 14.7%.
    Figure 1 depicts the proportional output response of the economy to a 1% interest rate
cut at different horizons, or in other words, the interest rate elasticity of output e0,τk at

different horizons τ, for different values of k, comparing the incomplete-markets baseline
economy with the complete-markets or representative-agent version of the same econ-
omy.
    The top panel illustrates the strong mitigation and horizon effects brought about by
the interaction of incomplete markets and bounded rationality, by comparing the econ-
omy with k = 1 and incomplete markets, the economy with k = 1 and complete markets,
and the economy with rational expectations which obtains in the limit when k goes to
∞ where the degree of market incompleteness becomes irrelevant by construction. It
also shows how these mitigation and horizon effects dissipate as we increase the level of
reasoning k, moving towards rational expectations. In the present simulation, the conver-
gence to rational expectations is quite fast, resulting in outcomes that are close to rational
expectations for values k ≥ 2. However, the simulation is only illustrative and fast con-
vergence is not a general property. In addition, very low levels of k, including k = 1, are
perhaps realistic as descriptions of household behavior when confronted with unusual
monetary policy announcements.19
    Figure 2 illustrates how these effects change as we move away from the baseline econ-
omy by varying the discount factor β and the amount of liquidity δ while keeping the
steady-state annual interest rate constant at 2%. These different calibrations can be under-
stood as representing different degrees of market incompleteness since they lead to dif-
ferent values for the fraction of borrowing-constrained agents in the steady state and for
the aggregate marginal propensity to consume. The model approximates the complete-
markets model in the limit where this fraction goes to zero.
  18 This value for the fraction of outside liquidity to output V
                                                             = 1.44 is meant to capture the value of liquid
                                                                Y
(as opposed to illiquid) wealth in the data.
   19 We are suggesting that level-k thinking may be higher in other contexts. For example, in financial

markets, deeply invested traders may undertake much higher rounds of thinking. In the present model it
is consumption decisions by households that matter, making low levels of k more relevant.


                                                       36
    Once again the figure powerfully illustrates the strong interaction of incomplete mar-
kets and bounded rationality: For a given finite value of k, the mitigation and horizon
effects are much stronger when markets are more incomplete in the sense that the steady-
state fraction of borrowing-constrained agents is higher; furthermore, the convergence to
rational expectations is slower when markets are more incomplete.
    Overall, in this calibrated Bewley-Aiyagari-Huggett economy with occasionally bor-
rowing constraints and precautionary savings, there are powerful interactions between
bounded rationality and incomplete markets. This reinforces the analytical results that
we obtained in the perpetual youth model of borrowing constraints developed in Section
4 which features borrowing constraints but no precautionary savings.


6    Sticky Prices and Inflation
So far, we have abstracted from inflation by assuming that prices are fully rigid, or equiv-
alently by focusing on the response of the economy to changes in the path of real interest
rates. In this section, we study the role of inflation by departing from the assumption of
fully rigid prices. We modify the model of Section 5 to incorporate monopolistic competi-
tion and staggered time-dependent pricing a la Calvo, as well as explicit labor supply and
labor demand decisions. To do so, we assume that a perfectly competitive sector produces
a final good by combining different varieties of intermediate goods produced by monop-
olistic firms facing Calvo frictions in price adjustment. We maintain a specification such
that the irrelevance result of Werning (2015) holds so that under rational expectations,
the responses of output and inflation to a monetary policy shock are independent of the
incompleteness of markets.


Monetary policy. With sticky but imperfectly rigid prices, specifying a path for nominal
interest rates still leads to a unique level-k equilibrium for any value of k, but is no longer
sufficient to ensure the convergence of the sequence of level-k equilibria to a rational-
expectations equilibrium when k goes to ∞. To obtain this property, we must consider
paths of interest rate rules Rt (Πt ) specifying nominal interest rates as a function of the
inflation rate Πt = Pt /Pt−1 of final goods prices (inflation for short). In what follows we
often write simply write { Rt } to denote the path of interest rate rules.
    It is important to realize that this interest rate rule plays a very different role in level-k
equilibria compared to its standard role in rational expectations equilibria. In rational
expectations equilibria, sufficiently reactive interest rate rules are required to ensure the
local determinacy of the equilibrium by ensuring that alternative candidate equilibria

                                               37
feature explosive dynamics and hence do not remain in the vicinity of the equilibrium be-
cause of the commitment to the rule by the monetary authority. Essentially, what matters
is that the off equilibrium commitment of the central bank. In contrast, in level-k equi-
libria, there is a unique global equilibrium for any k. The interest rate rule results in an
endogenously different nominal interest rate path for different values of k. If the interest
rate rule is responsive enough, then the equilibrium converges to a rational expectations
equilibrium when k goes to infinity. What matters is the interest rate path in equilibrium
for different values of k and not any off equilibrium commitment on the part of the central
bank.

Aggregate variables and beliefs. These modifications change the relevant aggregate
variables. In particular, we now need to track not only the path of nominal interest rates
{ Rt } and the paths of output {Yt } and beliefs about output {Yte }, but also the paths of
aggregate real profits { Xt } and beliefs about profits { Xte }, the paths of wages {Wt } and
beliefs about wages {Wte }, the paths of prices of final goods { Pt } and beliefs about prices
of final goods { Pte }, as well as the paths of prices of intermediate goods { P̂t } and beliefs
about these prices { P̂te }. We define Ωt = (Yt , Xt , Wt , Pt , P̂t ), and Ωet = (Yte , Xte , Wte , Pte , P̂te ).
    We assume that at every date t, beliefs about future wages, prices of final goods, and
prices of intermediate goods ate date t + s are scaled by Pt /Pte so that they are given by
Wte+s ( Pt /Pte ), Pte+s ( Pt /Pte ), and P̂te+s ( Pt /Pte ). This scaling allows the agents to incorporate
the accumulated surprise inflation differential Pt /Pte that has already been realized but
leaves unchanged beliefs about future relative prices Wte+s /Pte+s and wages P̂te+s /Pte+s as
well as beliefs about future inflation Πet+s .

returns to scale. Decreasing returns to scale can be thought as arising from an underly-
ing constant returns production function featuring capital and intermediate goods with
strong frictions to the adjustment of capital, a standard assumption in the New Keyne-
sian literature. The different varieties of intermediates are produced from effective labor

Individual firm price setting. The monopolistic firms producing the different varieties
of intermediate goods are subject to a price setting friction a la Calvo. They only get a
chance to change their price with probability 1 − λ at every date, and these opportunities
are independent across firms. A firm that gets a chance to change its price at date t − 1

where zit is an idiosyncratic productivity shock and zit ñit is effective labor. We assume
that this shock follows the process log(zit ) = ρe log(zit−1 ) + eti where eti is i.i.d. over time,
independent across agents, and follows a normal distribution with variance σe2 and mean
E[eti ] = −σe2 /2.
   We assume that the share αit of aggregate real profits Xt from the monopolistic inter-
mediate goods sector received by any given agent is proportional to its equilibrium labor
income zit nit . This means that profits are rebated lump sum so that agents take the profits
accruing to them as given when they make their labor supply decisions since deviations
from equilibrium leave αit unchanged. As in Section 5, we assume that the borrowing
contracts have the same form as the Lucas trees, and that agents cannot borrow. Taken
together, these choices ensure that under rational expectations, the irrelevance result of
Werning (2015) holds, and the interest rate elasticity of output and inflation coincide with
those of a complete-markets or representative-agent model.
   We denote the policy function for consumption by c∗ ( ait , zit ; { Rt+s }, Ωt , {Ωet+s }) and
the policy function for labor by n∗ ( ait , zit ; { Rt+s }, Ωt , {Ωet+s }). As in Section 5, the law of
motion for ait is given by the actual (as opposed to expected) budget constraints.


Temporary, RE, and level-k equilibria. We denote by Ψt = { ait , zit } the joint distribution
of wealth and productivity shocks. The law of motion for Ψt is entirely determined by
the laws of motion for individual financial wealth and income shocks given an initial
condition Ψ0 with z0 dΨ( a0 , z0 ) = 1 and a0 dΨ( a0 , z0 ) = V0 , where V0 is given by the
                    R                      R

no-arbitrage conditions (8).
    Temporary equilibria, RE equilibria, and level-k equilibria are defined in a similar way
as in the the general reduced form model described in Section 2. The main differences are
that in each of these constructions, we must ensure not only that the goods market clears

                                                                                        1

with initial condition P̂0 = P̂. In addition, because of the optimality condition of final
goods producers, we must have

                                                (1 − δ) P̂t Yt

                                          Nt = ∆t (Yt ) 1−δ ,

where ∆t is an index of price dispersion which satisfies the difference equation

                                                        "             #     θ

                          ∆t = λΠθt ∆t−1 + (1 − λ)                               ,

with initial condition ∆0 = 0, which encapsulates the efficiency costs of misallocation
arising from inflation.
    The changes required to handle these differences involve the definition of a reduced-
form aggregate consumption function and of a reduced-form aggregate effective labor
supply function along the lines of the above equations. They also involve the definition
of a reduced-form aggregate price of intermediate goods function, of a reduced-form ag-
gregate price of final goods function, and of a reduced-form aggregate wage function,
along the lines of the above equations. The necessary steps are somewhat tedious but
conceptually straightforward and so we omit them in the interest of space.


Effects of monetary policy at different horizons. To compute the effects of monetary
policy at different horizons around a steady state with no inflation Π = 1 and with nom-
inal interest rate R, we consider the following perturbations of monetary policy indexed
by ∆Rτ with fixed interest rates up to τ and reactive enough rules after τ: Rt (Πt ) = R
for t < τ; Rτ (Πt ) = R + ∆Rτ ; and Rt (Πt ) = RΠt for t > τ. We then compute
                                                           φ

et,τ = lim∆Rτ →0 −( R/Y )(∆Yt /∆Rτ ) and et,τΠ = lim
                                                      ∆Rτ →0 −( R/Π )( ∆Πt /∆Rτ ).
    The model cannot be solved analytically, and so we rely on simulations. We consider
the same parameter values for R, ρe , σe , δ, and β as in Section 5. In addition we set γ = 2
to match a Frisch elasticity of labor supply of 0.5. We set θ = 6 to generate a desired
markup of 1.2 and λ = 0.85 which implies an average price duration of about 6 quarters

                                                  41
as in Christiano et al. (2011). Finally we pick the coefficient in the interest rate rule to be
φ = 1.5.
    Figure 3 depicts the proportional output and inflation responses of the economy to a
1% interest rate cut at different horizons, or in other words, the interest rate elasticity of
         k and inflation eΠ,k at different horizons τ, for the baseline incomplete-markets
output e0,τ                 0,τ
economy and for the complete-markets or representative-agent version of the same econ-
omy, under level-k bounded rationality for different values of k.
    Comparing Figures 1 and 3, we verify numerically the analytical result that that for
k = 1, the response of output is identical when prices are rigid and when they are sticky,
simply because at this level of reasoning, agents do not expect any inflation even if prices
are sticky. It features mitigation and horizon effects. With sticky prices, the response of
inflation also features mitigation and horizon effects. These effects are stronger for the
incomplete-markets economy than for the complete-markets economy.
    As k increases, the responses of output and inflation converge monotonically to their
rational-expectations counterparts. In the rational-expectations limit when k goes to ∞,
by construction, the responses of output and inflation become the same in the incomplete-
markets economy and in the complete-markets economy in our model. Comparing low
values of k and especially k = 1 with high values of k therefore demonstrates that the
complementarity between incomplete markets and bounded rationality that we uncov-
ered in the case with rigid prices considered in Section 5 is robust to the introduction of
inflation.
    For high enough values of k, these responses acquire anti-horizon effects in the sense
that the response of current output and inflation increase with the horizon of monetary
policy. This is unlike the case with rigid prices considered in Section 5 where the rational-
expectations equilibrium features no horizon effect. These anti-horizon effects arise be-
cause of a feedback loop between output and inflation whereby higher output now and
in the future up until the horizon of monetary policy generates higher inflation now and
in the future, which reduces real interest rates and further increases output now and in
the future, etc. The higher the level of reasoning k, the more rounds in the feedback loop,
and the stronger its effects. And for a given k, the longer the horizon of monetary policy,
the longer the time horizon over which this feedback loop plays out, and the stronger its
effects.
    Figure 4 illustrates how these effects change as we move away from the baseline econ-
omy by varying the discount factor β and amount of liquidity δ while keeping the steady-
state annual interest rate constant at 2%. These different calibrations lead to different
values for the fraction of borrowing-constrained agents in the steady state and for the


                                              42
aggregate marginal propensity to consume.
    Once again the figure powerfully illustrates the strong interaction of incomplete mar-
kets and bounded rationality: For a given finite value of k, the mitigation and horizon
effects are much stronger when the steady-state fraction of borrowing-constrained agents
is higher; furthermore, the convergence to rational expectations is also slower. In fact,
comparing Figures 2 and 4 for intermediate values of k shows that this complementarity
is amplified when moving from rigid to sticky prices.20
    Overall, incorporating sticky prices and inflation worsens the “forward guidance puz-
zle” under rational expectations: The rational-expectations equilibrium features anti-horizon
effects so that the effects of monetary policy on output and inflation strongly increase with
the horizon of monetary policy. Incomplete markets alone does not change these prop-
erties since the aggregate properties of our model are invariant to the degree of market
incompleteness under rational expectations. Level-k bounded rationality alone mitigates
and for low values of k reverses these effects. But even for k = 1, the horizon effects
remain very weak, exactly as in the case of rigid prices considered in Section 5. Level-k
bounded rationality and incomplete markets together generate powerful horizon effects,
exactly as in the case of rigid prices considered in Section 5. The complementarity be-
tween incomplete markets and bounded rationality that we identified in the case of rigid
prices remains and is even strengthened with sticky prices.


7      Conclusion
We have demonstrated a strong interaction between two forms of frictions, bounded ra-
tionality and incomplete markets. In economies with nominal rigidities, this interaction
has important implications for the transmission of monetary policy, by mitigating its ef-
fects, the more so, the further in the future that monetary policy change takes place. This
offers a possible rationalization of the so-called “forward guidance puzzle”. We con-
jecture that these conclusions generalize to other shocks and policies. We pursue these
directions in ongoing work.
    20 There
           is another effect at play in this model with sticky prices that is absent in the model where all
prices are rigid. Under our formulation with sticky prices for intermediate goods and flexible prices for
final goods which combine intermediate goods with capital, increasing the share δ of capital in final goods
production essentially reduces the share of prices that are sticky, and hence makes the prices of final goods
more flexible, which amplifies the feedback loop between output and inflation and hence the effects of
monetary policy. We are currently working on a different model which eliminates this effect by specifying
that intermediate goods are produced from capital and labor and have sticky prices, and that final goods
are produced directly from intermediates and have flexible prices.

8.1    Proofs of Propositions 1 and 2
We consider an initial REE { Rt , Yt } which is a steady state with Rt = R and Yt = Y for
all t ≥ 0. This only requires that βR = 1. We consider a change { R̂t } in the path for the
interest rate ∆Rτ at date τ so that R̂τ = R + ∆Rτ and R̂t = Rt for t 6= τ.
    We start by computing the new new REE { R̂t , Ŷt }. Because the aggregate model is
purely forward looking, we can immediately conclude that for t > τ, Ŷt = Y and so
∆Ŷt = 0. And we guess and verify that for t ≤ τ, Ŷt = Y (1 + ∆R
                                                                R )

Similarly, given the path for interest rates {rt }, {rt , Yt } is an REE if and only if the path
for aggregate income {Yt } satisfies the fixed point
                   R∞            Rs            R∞               Rs

                                         0        t+u



Finally given an initial REE {rt , Yt } and a new interest rate path {r̂t }, the level-k equilibria
{r̂t , Ŷtk } satisfy the following recursion over k ≥ 0:
                   R∞                Rs            R∞                   Rs

          Ŷtk =   0
                                    R ∞ − R s [(1−σ)(r +λ)+σ(ρ+λ)]du                        ∀t ≥ 0.
                                     0 e                                ds
                                             0        t+u



with the initialization that Ŷt0 = Yt for all t ≥ 0.
   We now turn to the computation of the different interest rate elasticities of output
around a steady state REE { Rt , Yt } Yt = Y > 0 and rt = r for all t ≥ 0, where the
steady-state interest rate r is given by

                                                               δ 1−δ
                             1 = [(1 − σ )(r + λ) + σ (ρ + λ)][ +    ],

so that r = ρ in the limit where the frequency of binding borrowing constraints λ goes to
0.

   These expressions can be simplified in three special cases. The first case is when σ = 1
and is treated in the main body of the paper.
   The second case is when the frequency of binding borrowing constraints λ goes to 0,
where we get
