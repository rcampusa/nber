This paper investigates whether preschool children exposed to Sesame Street when it began in
1969 experienced improved educational and labor market outcomes subsequently. We exploit
geographic variation in broadcast reception derived from technological limitations, including
distance to a broadcast tower and UHF versus VHF transmission. We relate this variation to
Census data on grade-for-age status, educational attainment, and labor market outcomes in 1980,
1990, and 2000, respectively. The results indicate that Sesame Street improved school readiness,
particularly for boys and children living in economically disadvantaged areas. The estimated
impact on ultimate educational attainment and labor market outcomes is inconclusive.

I. INTRODUCTION

         In recent years, early childhood education, designed to improve subsequent life outcomes

for students who participate, has received considerable attention. Programs like Perry Preschool,

Head Start, universal pre-kindergarten, and others have taken center stage. Academic research

has generally supported the role that early childhood education can play in improving outcomes

for disadvantaged children, as reviewed by Duncan and Magnuson (2013), and that has led to

specific proposals from those in the policy community (cf. Cascio and Schanzenbach, 2014).

Both sides of the political spectrum have promoted its benefits (cf. Council of Economic

Advisers, 2015; and Stevens, 2015).

         For all of this attention, it is surprising that perhaps the biggest, yet least costly, early

childhood intervention, Sesame Street, has largely been left out of this policy and research

conversation. This show initially aired in 1969; its fundamental goal was to reduce the

educational deficits experienced by disadvantaged youth based on differences in their preschool

environment. It was a smash hit immediately upon its introduction, receiving tremendous critical

acclaim and huge ratings. It cost pennies on the dollar relative to other early childhood

interventions. Well-designed research studies conducted at that time, reviewed in detail below,

indicate that the show had a substantial and immediate impact on test scores, comparable in size

to those observed in early Head Start evaluations. Yet, we know little else regarding its

effectiveness, particularly over the long-term.1


1
 Fisch and Truglio (2001) review the research exploring the impact of Sesame Street. In terms of short-term effects,
Bogatz and Ball (1971) provide a major contribution to this literature, finding substantial improvements in academic
achievement within the context of an experimental setting. Diaz-Guerrero, et al. (1976) find similar results regarding
the introduction of Sesame Street in Mexico. Paulson (1974) also uses random assignment, finding that the show
                                                                               Early Childhood Education by MOOC
                                                                                         Kearney and Levine, Page 2


         An analysis of the effectiveness of Sesame Street can potentially also inform current

discussions regarding the ability of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) to deliver

educational improvements, in particular for younger children. In essence, Sesame Street was the

first MOOC. Although MOOCs differ in what they entail, Sesame Street satisfies the basic

feature of electronic transmission of online educational material. Both Sesame Street and

MOOCs provide educational interventions at a fraction of the cost of more traditional classroom

settings. Most (but not all) MOOCs today exist at the level of higher education, which clearly

differs from a preschool intervention. Our knowledge of the ability of MOOCs to improve

outcomes for its participants is so limited, though, that any proper evaluation of the impact of

electronic transmission of educational content is beneficial.2

         Additional evidence on the impact of Sesame Street can also inform a discussion

regarding the potential ability of television to have a positive impact on society. Typically,

commentary on the role of television in society focuses on the potential for negative effects.3

Recent evidence, however, has indicated some beneficial social effects of the introduction of

television (Gentzkow and Shapiro, 2008; Jensen and Oster, 2009).4 In other research, we have

shown that the depiction of teen motherhood on the MTV reality TV series, 16 and Pregnant, led


improved social outcomes like cooperation. Some research has examined longer-term effects, but that work focuses
on differences in outcomes between those who watch versus those who do not, without accounting for the selection
into groups (cf. Huston, et al., 2001). This leaves the question of a causal impact open.
2
  Marcus (2013) raises this issue regarding the lack of evidence examining the effectiveness of MOOCs (Hart, et al,
2015, is a recent exception). Sinha (2011), president of Khan Academy, writes that their own evaluation supports an
effect despite their inability to provide experimental evidence. Luzer (2014) reports that an experimental
investigation of Khan Academy, funded by the Department of Education, is to be conducted in 2015-16. Whether
Khan Academy is a MOOC also remains an open question (Akanegbu, 2013). For our purposes, we are concerned
with the general idea of student responses to low cost, electronic educational content and less focused on the specific
definition of a MOOC.
3
  When Sesame Street was first introduced, Brown (1969) wrote: “Not until the closing weeks of 1969 did television
offer a program series that really answered the long-standing criticism of the medium – namely that it takes a
viewer’s time without giving anything in return – and held out hope for a more substantive future.”
4
  In contrast, Olken (2009) presents evidence indicating that access to television in Indonesia was harmful to social
capital.
                                                                 Early Childhood Education by MOOC
                                                                           Kearney and Levine, Page 3


to a sizable reduction in teen childbearing (Kearney and Levine, 2014). Sesame Street is another

possible example of television that may provide social benefits in the form of improved

educational performance, particularly for disadvantaged children. Whether it accomplished this

is a matter of evaluating the evidence.

       The purpose of this paper is to inform these issues by conducting a large-scale

examination of the impact of the introduction of Sesame Street on early educational performance

measures and to additionally consider longer-term educational and labor market outcomes. Our

methodological approach exploits limitations in television technology, which restricted access to

Sesame Street to about two-thirds of the population when it first aired in 1969 (Davis, 2008). As

we describe in more detail below, Sesame Street mainly aired on stations affiliated with the

Public Broadcasting System (PBS), which often broadcast on UHF (ultra-high frequency)

channels. UHF reception was inferior to reception on VHF (very high frequency) channels for

physical reasons and because many television sets at that time did not have the capability to

receive a UHF signal (McDowell, 2006). Transmission distance also restricted access for some

households. Our analysis takes advantage of the county-level variation in viewer’s ability to

watch Sesame Street generated by these technological constraints that existed when the show

was introduced in 1969.

       We combine this geographic variation in broadcast exposure with differences across birth

cohorts in terms of children’s ages at the time of the show’s introduction. Children who were

already beyond first-grade at the time of the show’s introduction would not have been exposed

during early childhood and hence would generally not have been affected by its introduction.

Essentially, we investigate whether the educational outcomes among birth cohorts who were age

6 and under in 1969 and who lived in locations where broadcast reception for the show was high
                                                                               Early Childhood Education by MOOC
                                                                                         Kearney and Levine, Page 4


improved relative to older cohorts and those who lived in locations with limited broadcast

reception. Improved relative outcomes for the prior group would strongly suggest a causal

impact of exposure to the show. We implement this approach mainly using data from the 1980,

1990, and 2000 Censuses.5 We augment our main analysis with an exploration of additional data

from the 1980 High School and Beyond survey.

         The results of our analysis provide evidence that Sesame Street’s introduction generated a

positive impact on educational outcomes through the early school years. More specifically,

exposed cohorts of students with better reception capabilities were 14 percent more likely to be

attending the grade that is appropriate for their age. This effect was particularly pronounced for

boys, black, non-Hispanic children, and those living in economically disadvantaged areas. When

we extend the lens farther, however, we are unable to detect statistically significant effects on

ultimate educational attainment or labor market outcomes. The small estimated impact on wages

in adulthood, though, is consistent with forecasts based on the estimated improvements in test

scores and grade-for-age status brought about by the show’s introduction.

II. BACKGROUND

A. History of Sesame Street

         The early 1960s marked a change in thinking among child psychologists and educators,

who began to reject the notion that cognitive ability was completely heritable (cf. Hunt, 1961).

This sparked interest in early childhood interventions like Perry Preschool and Head Start, which

were meant to improve academic preparation among young children. Sesame Street followed this

legacy. It was first proposed in 1967 (Cooney, 1967) and first aired on November 10th, 1969. Its

stated purpose was “to foster intellectual and cultural development in preschoolers” (p. 20).

5
 Cascio (2009) uses a similar technique tracking cohorts across successive cohorts in her analysis of the introduction
of kindergarten in school districts in the 1960s and 1970s.
                                                                 Early Childhood Education by MOOC
                                                                           Kearney and Levine, Page 5


       Following its introduction, Sesame Street was mainly broadcast on PBS channels; of the

192 stations airing the show, 176 of them were affiliated with PBS. The majority of these

stations (101) were broadcast on UHF channels rather than VHF channels, which introduced

technological constraints that limited exposure to the show. As we detail below, only around

two-thirds of the population lived in locations where Sesame Street could be received on their

televisions.

       Despite this technological constraint, Sesame Street immediately became a huge success.

By January of 1970, over five million households tuned in to a typical episode (Clausen, 1970).

Among those between ages 2 and 5, Cook, et al. (1975) estimate that between 28 and 36 percent

watched Sesame Street in 1970; between 33 and 42 percent did so in 1971. To put its popularity

in perspective, roughly one-third of the entire United States population watches the Super Bowl

today. These numbers are even more remarkable within the context of the technological

limitations that prevented around one-third of the population from watching it.

       Sesame Street was really the first children’s television programming explicitly focused on

educational content. Popular shows among children at that time included Captain Kangaroo

(CBS), Mister Rogers Neighborhood (PBS), Romper Room (locally produced), cartoons (e.g.,

The Jetsons, The Flintstones), and sitcoms (The Andy Griffith Show). Earlier shows prior to

Sesame Street that explicitly targeted children include Looney Tunes, Tom and Jerry, Howdy

Doody, and Kukla, Fran, and Ollie, among others. Some shows, like Mister Rogers

Neighborhood, did focus on teaching social skills, such as getting along with others, but none

focused on academic content in the way that Sesame Street did.

       It is also important to recognize that at the time Sesame Street was introduced, preschool

attendance was the exception, rather than the norm. According to our calculations using the 1970
                                                                              Early Childhood Education by MOOC
                                                                                        Kearney and Levine, Page 6


Census, only 9 percent and 19 percent of children ages 3 and 4, respectively, attended

preschool.6 Among children age 5, 57 percent attended school (presumably kindergarten), but, at

the time, kindergarten generally only lasted half a day. Many of those children would still have

had the chance to watch Sesame Street (if they lived in a home that could receive the necessary

broadcast signal) after school, since stations typically broadcast the show both in the morning

and later in the afternoon.7

B. Television Technology/History of UHF

        Early access to Sesame Street was limited by broadcast technology at the time of the

show’s introduction. The most important reason for limited access was that in some places,

Sesame Street was broadcast on a UHF signal, as noted above.8 For the television viewer, the

most straightforward distinction is that VHF channels are those between 2 and 13 and UHF

channels are those greater than 13. A UHF broadcast meant lower rates of reception for two

reasons. First, signals broadcast over VHF travel farther and their reception is less affected by

mountains, buildings, and other obstacles. A household with a television capable of receiving

both signals is more likely to be able to receive a VHF signal than a UHF signal.

        In addition, in the time period under consideration, many television sets were not

equipped to receive a UHF signal. Before 1952, there were no UHF channels broadcasting,

initially because there were enough VHF channels to meet demand and, subsequently, because of

World War II (the military wanted the rights to those frequencies) and a resulting Federal

6
  These estimates are comparable to those provided by Gibbs, Ludwig, and Miller (2013). Cascio (2009) describes
the institutional background regarding the introduction of kindergarten across school districts in the United States,
detailing its limited availability during this period.
7
  Based on 1980 Census data that we describe below, we calculate that 29 percent of children lived in locations
where Sesame Street was broadcast only in the morning, 11 percent only in the afternoon, and 59 percent both in the
morning and in the afternoon. We experimented with taking advantage of this variation in the data, but found
insufficient power to identify differential effects.
8
  Webbink (1969) and Rothenberger (2004) provide useful discussions of the history of UHF broadcast technology
and related public policy.
                                                                         Early Childhood Education by MOOC
                                                                                   Kearney and Levine, Page 7


Communications Commission (FCC) moratorium on granting new station licenses.9 When the

moratorium was lifted in 1952, strong demand for additional stations led the FCC to expand

channel options to include those broadcasting in UHF. Even then, television manufacturers

typically did not build sets that included UHF tuners. With no tuners, original programming was

limited; with no original programming, there was no demand for the tuners.

        This changed when the “All Channel Receiver Act” became law in 1962. This act, which

took effect in 1964, required manufacturers to produce television sets that could receive both

UHF and VHF signals. Televisions were expensive, though, costing roughly $700 for a state-of-

the-art 25-inch color set in 1966 (TV Guide, 1966), compared to the median family income of

$7,436 in that same year (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1968). This resulted in a slow diffusion of

UHF signal receipt. In 1969, 95 percent of households owned television sets, but only 54 percent

of those households had one that could receive a UHF signal (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1970).

We describe below how we use these constraints to identify the effect of potential exposure to

Sesame Street programming on children’s subsequent outcomes.

C. ETS Study of Sesame Street’s Impact

        Educational Testing Service (ETS) was hired right from the initial development of

Sesame Street to design and implement an analysis that would examine whether children who

watched the show performed better on a range of educational activities (Bogatz and Ball, 1971).

Ex-ante, the design used in the first year following the show’s introduction was a good one.

Disadvantaged children in a number of locations were identified and randomly assigned to

treatment and control groups, where treatment included explicit encouragement to watch the

9
 After World War II, in response to strong demand for new channels and the need to insure that signals from
neighboring communities would not interfere, the moratorium was imposed to develop a viable licensing system.
This moratorium is an important element in Gentzkow and Shapiro’s (2008) analysis of preschool age exposure to
television on children’s standardized test scores.
                                                                            Early Childhood Education by MOOC
                                                                                      Kearney and Levine, Page 8


show.10 Clearly, the evaluators had no idea Sesame Street viewership would be so high. The

experimental design failed because so many members of both the treatment and control groups

watched it.

        ETS adopted a different approach in the second year evaluation. This evaluation is based

on experiences in Winston-Salem, NC and Los Angeles, CA and relies on viewing constraints

among low-income households. In Winston-Salem, NC, cable television (in its infancy at this

time) was just being introduced, enabling subscribers to watch Sesame Street in a location where

reception would have been limited otherwise. But low-income households were unlikely to be

able to afford cable service. ETS randomly assigned families with pre-school age children to

control and treatment groups, where treatment group families were provided with cable

television and the children in those households were encouraged to watch the show. In Los

Angeles, Sesame Street was available on a UHF channel only and many low-income households

did not have a television that could receive a UHF signal. In that location, ETS provided

treatment group households with UHF converters for their television, enabling them to watch the

show; again, children in treatment group households were encouraged to watch it.

        The results of this ETS analysis provided support for a strong effect of Sesame Street.

Positive effects were observed on a number of specific outcomes. Among their many results,

they find a sizable impact of the show on the Peabody Picture Vocabulary (PPVT) test, which is

standardized and frequently used as a general test of cognitive performance. Their PPVT

findings imply that the treatment group experienced a 0.36 standard deviation relative increase in




10
 The component of encouragement is one that Cook, et al. (1975) criticize, arguing that doing so can highlight the
importance of academic skills, which can have an impact on its own even in the absence of Sesame Street content.
                                                                              Early Childhood Education by MOOC
                                                                                        Kearney and Levine, Page 9


PPVT scores.11 This effect can be interpreted as the equivalent of around an additional full year

of learning.12

         Our study complements this experimental evidence by broadening the scope to the

population level and considering how an entire generation of children were impacted. Although

the value of randomized controlled trials is unquestioned, it is based on the behavior of a few

hundred children in two specific locations. Our study applies the approach of a well-identified

quasi-experiment based on hundreds of thousands of exposed cohorts of children nationwide. In

addition, we consider the question of long-term outcomes. Cook, et al. (1975) note in their

critique of the ETS study, “we could find no data of any reasonable quality to assess the crucial

question of the long-term effects of viewing ‘Sesame Street’ on both learning and social

development.” This has remained a gap in the literature, which we attempt to fill in with this

paper.

D. Sesame Street and Head Start

         Along many dimensions, Sesame Street is a comparable intervention to Head Start. Both

shared a common heritage, incorporating new ideas during the 1960s about the role that early

childhood interventions can play in improving educational outcomes for disadvantaged children.

Both had demonstrated evidence of short-term effectiveness. Gibbs, et al. (2013), Duncan and

Magnuson (2013), and Shager, et al. (2014) report that the literature assessing the impact of

Head Start on early childhood cognitive test scores yield similar effect sizes to those reported in

Bogatz and Ball (1971) regarding Sesame Street. In fact, policy makers and analysts who were

11
   Bogatz and Ball (1971) report that the “encouraged” group experienced gains in PPVT scaled scores of 1.7 points
between the beginning and end of the year. Members of the “not encouraged” group saw their scores fall by -3.7
points (see p. 105). Cook, et al. (1975) reports that the PPVT is designed to have a mean of 100 and a standard
deviation of 15. The difference between the two groups of 5.4 points reflects 0.36 of a standard deviation increase.
12
   This translation is based on Hill, et al. (2008), which indicates that an effect size of 0.20 on nationally normed
standardized tests is roughly equivalent to six additional months of learning.
                                                                             Early Childhood Education by MOOC
                                                                                     Kearney and Levine, Page 10


focused on early childhood education at the time specifically compared the two programs, noting

that Sesame Street appeared to generate improvements in cognitive skills comparable to those of

Head Start for a fraction of the cost.13

        It is important to keep in mind, though, that the two interventions are actually

substantively different from each other, not only in the nature of the intervention, but in their

stated goals. Head Start was designed to be a comprehensive program with a variety of services

beyond typical preschool education, including, for example, medical and dental services and

family outreach. It certainly included a component designed to increase children’s cognitive

development as Sesame Street did, but it went far beyond that to address social and emotional

development, improve self-confidence, address health deficiencies, and improve family

functioning (Cooke, 1965). The initial goals of the Sesame Street program were more narrowly

focused, extending beyond academic achievement only to address cultural development (music

and the arts) and the awareness of basic emotions, including aggression and fear (Cooney,

1967).14 Because of these fundamental design differences it is not clear that we would expect

similar long-term effects from the two programs.

III. METHODS AND DATA

A. Overview



13
   Zigler and Muenchow (1994) state that Nixon administration officials argued “we can get Sesame Street to reach
poor kids by spending sixty-five cents per child … Why should we spend over a thousand dollars per child on Head
Start?” (p. 165). Cook, et al. (1975) similarly state: “why pay teachers more money, run programs such as Head
Start, build new schools, and experiment with complex teaching machines when there already is a relatively
inexpensive, easily expandable approach? … Clearly, unless the ‘Sesame Street’ approach really is efficacious, there
is the concern that the swell of enthusiasm for it could drown out other educational efforts to improve human
resources.” (p. x in the foreword).
14
   Edward Zigler, Director of the Office of Child Development (which oversaw Head Start) in the Nixon
Administration responded to the White House’s comparison of Sesame Street and Head Start by stating: “how long
would a poor child have to watch Sesame Street to get his or her teeth filled? When nobody could answer, that was
the end of the meeting.” (Zigler and Muenchow, 1994). The point was that Head Start did much more than just try to
impact educational skills.

       As described earlier, only two-thirds of households reportedly were able to receive the

signal broadcasting Sesame Street when the show began in 1969. The general framework of our

empirical approach is to determine the variation in “coverage” (likelihood of being able to

receive the signal) across locations (counties). We then examine whether outcomes improve as

coverage improves for those children who were of preschool age in 1969 relative to those who

had already started school at that time. The latter group should have received little or no effect

from the show. These coverage rates are largely determined by the distance to the closest

television tower broadcasting Sesame Street and whether that tower transmits using UHF or

VHF. Since the location of the television towers and the channel assigned to a station are

functions of FCC decisions made years before Sesame Street aired, they should be unrelated to

any subsequent changes in outcomes that occurred right after Sesame Street was introduced, but

for the impact of the show. The remainder of this section provides the details regarding our

implementation of this approach.

B. Calculating Sesame Street Coverage Rates

       A critical data component of our empirical strategy is a measure of Sesame Street

broadcast coverage rates across geographical areas. We need to know: (a) which television

stations broadcast Sesame Street in a given area and (b) what share of households in a given area

could receive that station’s broadcast signal. Data from Children’s Television Workshop

(undated) indicate which stations aired Sesame Street in 1969/1970. Estimating what share of

households in a given area could receive the signal from that station requires that we impute

coverage based on supplementary data sources.
                                                                              Early Childhood Education by MOOC
                                                                                      Kearney and Levine, Page 12


        For this purpose we rely heavily on data reported in the 1968-1969 edition of a trade

publication, TV Factbook (Television Digest, Inc., 1968-1969).15 This data source provides a

listing of every television station – including both commercial and non-commercial –

broadcasting in the United States, along with its technical specifications: channel number (which

captures UHF/VHF), latitude and longitude of its broadcast tower, height of the tower, and

transmission signal power. For all commercial stations, the publication also lists surrounding

counties and coverage rates, as defined by the fraction of television households who have the

ability to receive the signal from each station.16

        Using this sample, we regress county-level coverage rates on the technical specifications

of each channel – including UHF/VHF status, distance between the broadcast tower and the

population centroid of each county, transmission power, and height of the tower – to establish

the empirical relationships between those technical specifications and the coverage rate among

commercial stations. We then apply those estimated relationships to the specifications of the

non-commercial stations to obtain a simulated coverage rate at the county level for those

stations. We assign to each county the station that provides the highest simulated coverage rate

and use that rate as our measure of the percentage of households in that county that can watch

Sesame Street in their homes. In the end, our process generates a national coverage rate of 65

percent, which aligns closely to national estimates of Sesame Street coverage made at that time.17



15
   Data Appendix I gives more details about our data procedure to estimate coverage rates.
16
   Reported coverage rates are categorical (greater than 50 percent, 25 to 50 percent, and 5 to 24 percent). We
linearize these rates, assuming the categories reflect 90 percent, 40 percent, and 20 percent coverage, respectively.
We have also experimented with alternative assumptions and non-parametric specifications, but the results based on
these alternatives were consistent with our linearized approach. We focus on this approach because of the greater
simplicity in estimation and interpretation.
17
   Clausen (1970) reports that the coverage rate was 69.4 percent the week of January 19-25 of 1970. The coverage
rate data that we use refers to 1968-69, which is likely slightly lower than this level because some households
upgraded their television sets over this interval, acquiring the ability to view UHF signals.
                                                                 Early Childhood Education by MOOC
                                                                         Kearney and Levine, Page 13


       Note that actual coverage rates for stations (commercial or non-commercial) are a

function of technological factors as well as the share of households with a television that has a

UHF tuner. One concern with using the actual measure of coverage would be that wealthier

households are more likely to have UHF tuners in 1968. But, our measure of coverage is

simulated based on the relationship between broadcast technology factors and observed coverage

rates for commercial stations. Since we are not using actual coverage, but rather simulated

coverage (which is based on the average relationship between signal receipt and technological

factors like UHF transmission and distance to the tower), the variation across counties in our

simulated measure of coverage is only a function of technological factors, not county-level UHF-

television ownership rates. This is an advantage of using this simulated measure.

        The regression results from estimating coverage (using the observed actual coverage

rates from commercial stations) as a function of technological characteristics make clear the

importance of UHF versus VHF in determining coverage. Coverage rates for a UHF station in

the same county as the television tower are 42 percentage points lower than they are for a

comparable VHF station in that county. This roughly corresponds to the limited number of

televisions that could receive UHF signals at that time. Coverage in the county falls around

another 20 percentage points for a UHF station if it is 100 miles away from the tower.

       Figures 1 and 2 display all the stations that broadcast Sesame Street, distinguishing them

by VHF/UHF status, and simulated county-level coverage rates. Figure 1 indicates that Southern

California, Ohio, and the District of Columbia represent examples of heavily populated areas

where Sesame Street was only accessible via a UHF signal. Figure 2 shows that these areas have

very low rates of simulated coverage as well, reflecting the fact that UHF transmission

substantially reduced access to the show.
                                                                          Early Childhood Education by MOOC
                                                                                  Kearney and Levine, Page 14


        We also compare our simulated coverage rates to additional data on Sesame Street

Nielsen ratings to provide further evidence that our measure of coverage adequately captures

constraints on audience size. Local ratings data for children between the ages of 2 and 5 when

Sesame Street was introduced are available for 28 metropolitan areas (Haydon, 1973).18 We link

these areas to our constructed county level coverage data. Figure 3 presents a scatter plot of this

relationship. It shows that coverage and ratings are positively related; the correlation coefficient

between them is 0.48. The slope also provides informative data. For every percentage point

increase in coverage, ratings among 2 to 5 year olds increase by 0.58 percent. If preschool age

children are proportionally distributed across counties, this result would suggest that over half of

the children who have the technological capability to watch Sesame Street watch the show.

C. Empirical Specifications

        Our main identification strategy relies on variation across cohorts and geography

(counties) in children’s potential exposure to Sesame Street programming. We focus on cohorts

born between 1959 and 1968, who ranged in age from 1 to 10 years of age when Sesame Street

was introduced in 1969. Another way to think about this cohort variation in exposure to the show

is that individuals born between 1959 and 1963 would have been age 6 or older, and already in

elementary school, at the time the show first aired. Individuals born between 1964 and 1968

would have been age 5 and below, and would have been exposed to the program during their

preschool age years. The other dimension of variation in access to the show comes from the

county-level Sesame Street coverage rate, defined (as described in detail above) to be the share




18
 The data in Haydon (1973) report the number of viewers between the ages of 2 and 5 who watch Sesame Street in
each reported metropolitan area. We combine these data with population counts from the 1970 Census for this age
group to generate the percentage of viewers.
                                                                                       Early Childhood Education by MOOC
                                                                                               Kearney and Levine, Page 15


of television households in the county who were able to receive a signal over which Sesame

Street was broadcast.

       Our empirical strategy is to observe whether outcomes differ for cohorts of individuals

who would have had preschool-age exposure to the show as compared to older cohorts and

individuals who lived in counties with limited broadcast coverage. Any difference along these

dimensions could reasonably be considered to be evidence of an impact of the show on

educational outcomes.

Within this framework, the specific models we estimate take the following forms:

    Outcomeijc  0  1 *  preschool 69ic * SSCov j   2 Policy jc  3 X ijc   c *  s   j   ijc (1)

                             1973/74
      Outcomeijc   0                  c *   c * SSCov j    2 Policy jc   3 X ijc   c *  s   j   ijc (2)
                            c 1967/68



where the dependent variable, Outcomeijc, represents different educational and labor market

outcomes for individual i, in county j, in cohort c. The subscript s indexes states. Sesame Street

coverage rates, SSCovj, are only indexed by county; that variable is time-invariant and captures

the technological constraints to watching the show that existed just before it was introduced. All

reported standard errors are clustered at the county level.

       In Equation (1), we estimate a difference-in-difference specification where 1 captures

the causal effect of interest. Birth cohorts are distinguished by those who would be preschool age

when the show began in the fall of 1969 (preschool69ic). We include county fixed effects (𝛿𝑗 ) to

capture time-invariant differences in outcomes across counties. We also include state*birth

cohort fixed effects (c*s) to capture time varying changes in outcomes across states, including

state-level policy variation like the introduction of Medicaid and welfare generosity. The model
                                                                               Early Childhood Education by MOOC
                                                                                       Kearney and Levine, Page 16


also controls for a series of individual covariates, captured by Xijc: race/ethnicity, age, and, when

it is available, socioeconomic status.

         A potential source of omitted variable bias would occur if other policies or environmental

conditions that would affect the educational outcomes of young children changed at the county

level around the same time as Sesame Street was introduced. Two potential candidate policy

changes that could lead to an omitted variable bias include the introduction of the Food Stamp

program and increased expenditures on the Head Start program. The Food Stamp Program was

introduced across counties in the U.S. between 1961 and 1975. Our model includes an indicator

for having the Food Stamp Program in operation in the county in a given year, as measured by

Hoynes, Schanzenbach, and Almond (2012). Our model also controls for Head Start

expenditures in 1968 and 1972, as recorded by Ludwig and Miller (2007).19 These are the policy

variables to which we refer in equations 1 and 2.

         In Equation (2), we relax the pre-assignment of treatment and control groups by cohort,

allowing for the effect of Sesame Street coverage to differ by grouped birth cohorts. We

aggregate individuals from neighboring birth years to increase the power of this analysis. This

provides a specification check to see if the “treatment effect” really starts with the appropriate

groups of birth cohorts. In both cases, we also estimate models separately by race/ethnicity and

gender.20


19
   We are grateful to Diane Schanzenbach for providing us with this Food Stamp program indicator. We are also
grateful to Jens Ludwig for providing the Head Start data. Those data provide Head Start expenditures by county in
1968 and 1972; we linearly interpolate to fill in values between the two years. Since Head Start largely enrolls four-
year-olds and school entry is at age 6, we treat these data as affecting 6 year olds in 1970 through 1974. We linearly
interpolate to fill in values between the two years.
20
   We are unable to disaggregate individuals by socioeconomic status because of data limitations. The only feasible
measure of SES is maternal education, but that only exists in our 1980 Census subsample for those individuals still
living with their mothers. We include maternal education along with a missing value indicator for those who no
longer live with their mother as explanatory variables, but the sample selection issues introduced by splitting the
sample in this way are more difficult to overcome.
                                                                             Early Childhood Education by MOOC
                                                                                     Kearney and Levine, Page 17


        Our primary measure of interest is access to Sesame Street broadcasting, not actual

viewership of the show. In this sense, our approach identifies an “intent to treat” relationship, not

a “treatment on the treated.” If we had better ratings data, we could pursue an approach that

would help us address the impact on the marginal viewer. As noted earlier, though, ratings data

are only available for a limited subset of counties that are encompassed by 28 metropolitan

areas.21 As a result, the question that we are best able to address with our analysis is what is the

impact of making a show like Sesame Street more readily available to children, not what impact

does it have on an individual child watching the show.

D. Overview of Census Data

        Our main sources of individual-level data used to estimate equations (1) and (2) are

microdata from the 1980, 1990, and 2000 U.S. Census of the Population, available from IPUMS-

USA (Ruggles, et al., 2010). We restrict our Census samples to individuals born between 1959

and 1968; these individuals would have entered first grade from around 1965 until 1974

(depending on exact birthdates and state laws regarding age of school entry), just before and after

Sesame Street was introduced.

        Table 1 eases the interpretation of cohorts advancing through these censuses, indicating

points in the lifecycle of those in the analysis sample as they age. First, we use the 1980 Census

to examine elementary school performance as captured by “grade-for-age” status; this measure

indicates whether a child is enrolled in school – or graduated high school for those over age 18 –

at a grade appropriate for his or her age.22 We use data on quarter of birth available in the 1980

21
   We have experimented with using an instrumental variables strategy to estimate this model with these restricted
data – instrumenting for ratings with coverage – but the small sample size reduced the statistical power of the
analysis to a point where it is not informative.
22
   Grade-for-age is an educational outcome that has been used by others, including Oreopoulos, Page, and Stevens
(2006). It reflects a stock; falling behind could have taken place several years ago. Our analysis of data from the
1980 Census of those born between 1962 and 1974 (school-age at that time) indicates that many students fall behind
                                                                                  Early Childhood Education by MOOC
                                                                                          Kearney and Levine, Page 18


Census along with the school entry requirement laws listed in Cascio and Lewis (2006) to refine

our estimates of the year students would be expected to start school.23 The birth cohorts in our

sample would be between the ages of 12 and 21 in the 1980 Census. Second, we use the 1990

Census to measure ultimate educational attainment (high school dropout, high school graduation,

or attended any college), as these birth cohorts would be between ages 22 and 31 in 1990 (it is

not possible in the 1990 Census to distinguish high school graduation from GED attainment).

And third, we use the 2000 Census to measure labor market outcomes (employment, hourly

wage, and poverty status) when these birth cohorts would have been between the ages of 32 and

41, presumably established in the labor market, if working.

         An important issue to address regarding the use of Census data is migration. Ideally, we

would know the state and county of residence in which an individual resided in 1969, when

Sesame Street began, but this information is not available. For these birth cohorts, a reasonable

alternative would exist if we knew the state and county of birth since they would all be very

young in 1969 and mainly living in the same place. State of birth is, in fact, available in these

Censuses, but county of birth is not.

         To circumvent this problem we restrict our samples to those individuals whose recorded

state of residence in the Census is the same as their state of birth. This sample restriction assumes

that interstate mobility since birth is unrelated to Sesame Street coverage in 1969. For this

subsample, we assign county of residence in the Census year to be the county of birth. The


in first through fourth grades. As Deming and Dynarski (2008) document, purposely holding children back from
starting first grade at age six (“red-shirting”) is a more recent phenomenon. Our data on grade-for-age status is
consistent with that reported by Hauser (2004). Cascio (2005) indicates that grade-for-age is an imperfect proxy for
grade repetition.
23
   Where necessary, we make the most generous assumptions possible to increase the likelihood of a child being in
the appropriate grade level. For instance, a child born in the 3 rd quarter in a state where children are supposed to
enter 1st grade in September of the year they turn age 6 is treated as if he or she is still age 5 in that year; his or her
birthday could have been in August.
                                                                  Early Childhood Education by MOOC
                                                                          Kearney and Levine, Page 19


assumption that we maintain in this assignment is that individuals who live in the same state

where they were born are likely to remain in a county close to where they were born and,

importantly, in the same television market with similar broadcast reception.

       Table 2 provides some evidence suggesting that our sample decisions regarding

migration are reasonable. For this purpose, we first examine mobility data from the Census and

compare it to the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79), which provides more

geographic detail. Respondents in the NLSY79 were born between 1957 and 1964, comparable

to the birth cohorts we examine with Census data (1959 to 1968). First, we explore interstate

mobility between birth and 1980, 1990, and 2000 using the Census, and then using NLSY79

interstate mobility between birth and the same years. The results in Table 2 provide evidence

indicating interstate mobility in the Census and NLSY79 are quite comparable; around 77

percent, 67 percent, and 65 percent of respondents lived in the same state in 1980, 1990, and

2000, respectively, in the two datasets. If we restrict the NLSY79 sample in each year to those

who lived in the same state as they were born, we also see that over 80 percent lived in a county

within 60 miles of their birth county.

       We also used the NLSY79 data to estimate regression models comparable in format to

that described by Equation (1) except that the dependent variable is an indicator of state

outmigration. The results reported in the bottom panel of Table 2 do not provide evidence of

selective state outmigration between birth and 1980 or 1990. Those young enough to have seen

Sesame Street when it first came out in areas where more residents could see it are not

significantly differentially likely to live in a state different from where they were born. We also

find no evidence of a relationship between Sesame Street exposure and movement to a county

outside a 60 mile radius from the county of birth for those who never left their home state. Those
                                                                            Early Childhood Education by MOOC
                                                                                    Kearney and Levine, Page 20


who did move, however, will generate some attenuation bias in our Census analysis resulting

from measurement error in Sesame Street exposure. We will address this issue further when we

describe the results of our analysis.

           Using Census data to estimate our equations of interest requires one additional sample

restriction. County of residence is only identified for those individuals in sufficiently heavily

populated counties. This eliminates roughly half the sample. Those included in the 1980 Census

live in just 349 counties, for instance. The location of these counties is documented in Figure 4,

which demonstrates the focus on more heavily populated areas.

           A beneficial result of this data constraint is that identification in our statistical model is

not driven by comparisons of urban and rural locations. In fact, using data from the 1970 Census,

we show in Table 3 that among counties with available data in the 1980 Census, those

distinguished by the quality of reception are generally quite similar both in 1970 and in changes

since 1960.24 Those counties not in the sample are quite a bit smaller and poorer than the others.

This makes sense since the reason they are not separately identified is because they are too small,

and, at the time, rural poverty was an even greater issue. Differences, though, between strong and

weak reception counties (defined below) among those separately identified are rather limited; t-

tests comparing them are unable to distinguish the observed differences from random variation.

Certainly this analysis does not prove that these groups are randomly selected, but it does

indicate that no obvious selection differentiates these two sets of counties.

IV. RESULTS

A. Graphical Analysis



24
     These data come from the 1962 and 1972 County and City Data Book, which is available from ICPSR.
.
                                                                  Early Childhood Education by MOOC
                                                                          Kearney and Levine, Page 21


       Before presenting our formal results from estimating Equations (1) and (2), we first

present Figures 5 through 8, which are designed to illustrate our identification strategy and guide

the interpretation our subsequent findings. For this analysis, we distinguish counties by their

distance to the closest tower broadcasting Sesame Street and whether that broadcast was UHF or

VHF. We define “strong reception” counties to be those within 60 miles of one of those towers

and broadcasting in VHF. All other counties are defined to be “weak reception” counties because

they violated at least one of those conditions. Based on our estimated coverage rates and data

from the 1980 Census, these categories roughly split our sample in half, with coverage rates of

83 and 55 percent, on average, in strong and weak reception counties.

       We then trace out differences in our outcome measures (grade-for-age status, educational

attainment, and labor market outcomes) by exact cohort between those who live in strong and

weak reception areas. This approach mimics a simplified reduced form version of the analysis

we report below. Here we aggregate counties’ reception capabilities rather than use them

continuously in our full econometric analysis.

       Figure 5 compares grade-for-age status across these categories for several birth year

cohorts. The horizontal axis is distinguished by cohort and is designed to identify those who may

have been affected by Sesame Street’s introduction. In the 1980 Census, quarter of birth data is

available and we use that to better determine school start year. In other Census years, we rely on

the year a child turned age 6. If Sesame Street had an effect on educational or labor market

outcomes, we would expect to the see the effect for the birth cohorts who started school (in the

1980 Census) or turned 6 (in the 1990 and 2000 Census) in 1970 or later. These children would

have been preschool age when the show was introduced. Those who started school or were older
                                                                   Early Childhood Education by MOOC
                                                                           Kearney and Levine, Page 22


than age 6 in 1968 or earlier would not have been as directly affected by its introduction, since

the show targets preschool age children and academic skills most relevant to school entry.

       We view those individuals who were supposed to start school in 1969 – those who were

typically age 6 at the time – as a transitional cohort. Although a show designed to improve first

grade readiness should not have a large impact among those who were already in first grade,

some children in this cohort may not have started school yet. Others may have started school, but

were not doing well in first grade. Since Sesame Street was shown in most locations during after

school hours, these students may have benefited from its availability as well. We do not expect

any effect on them to be as large as for the younger cohorts, but we recognize the possibility of

an intermediate effect.

       The results of this simple analysis regarding grade-for-age status reported in Figure 5

support the hypothesized patterns. For cohorts who should have started school in 1968 and

earlier, there is not a large difference in grade-for-age status between those in stronger versus

weaker reception counties. For cohorts who should have started school in 1970 and later, there is

a clear positive difference in rates of grade-for-age between those in the two areas. As a whole,

those in the strong reception counties are 1.5 to 2 percentage points more likely to be at the grade

level appropriate for their age in 1980. Differences in grade-for-age status for the 1969 school

start year cohort are positive, but smaller than those for subsequent cohorts, as expected. Overall,

this figure provides evidence supportive of an effect on grade-for-age brought about by exposure

to Sesame Street.

       We extend this analysis to consider whether the show’s impact is greatest among more

disadvantaged children. As we described earlier, however, we do not have a good way to

measure socioeconomic status in the census data available to us. Instead, we augment the census
                                                                             Early Childhood Education by MOOC
                                                                                     Kearney and Levine, Page 23


data with additional data from the 1970 Census distinguishing locations by different levels of

disadvantage. This approach focuses on the relative disadvantage of an area, not the individual.

In this analysis, we focus on the percentage of the county population that has less than a high

school degree, splitting counties by those that are above and below the median value.25 The

results of this analysis, reported in Figure 6, indicate that the impact of Sesame Street’s

introduction on grade-for-age status is considerably greater in more disadvantaged areas. Cohorts

who were of pre-school age at the time the show began were roughly 3 percentage points more

likely to be at the appropriate grade level for their age if they lived in an area with strong

reception. This is perhaps twice the estimated effect for the population as a whole.

        The results regarding educational attainment and labor market outcomes, reported in

Figures 7 and 8, are less compelling. We chose the likelihood of graduating high school

(including those who attend college) as our indicator of educational attainment and the

percentage of the population that is employed (the “employment rate”) as our indicators of labor

market performance. In neither case is there anything resembling a positive break from trend

around the 1969 school entry cohort, defined by the year a child turned age 6.

B. Econometric Results: Grade-for-Age

        Table 4 presents our estimation results reflecting the models represented by Equations 1

and 2 above. For the full sample, from the top panel of the table, reporting results from

estimating Equation 1, we find that children who were preschool age in 1969 and who lived in

areas with greater simulated Sesame Street coverage were statistically significantly more likely

to be at the grade level appropriate for their age. To interpret the magnitude of the coefficient, we

25
  In subsequent analyses, we also use these data to distinguish counties by the percentage of families headed by a
female head, the percentage of families with incomes below $5,000 in 1970, and the percentage of the population
that is black. Results for the present analysis using high and low values of these other measures are comparable to
those reported here.
                                                                             Early Childhood Education by MOOC
                                                                                     Kearney and Levine, Page 24


consider the impact of a 30 percentage point increase in coverage rates, which is tantamount to

moving from a typical area with weak reception to an area with strong reception. The

hypothetical case of moving from no coverage to complete coverage is out of sample and thus an

inappropriate basis of comparison. A 30-point increase in coverage rates would generate a 3.2

percentage point (0.3*0.105 = 0.032) increase in the rate of grade-for-age. With 20.3 percent of

the sample behind their appropriate grade in school, this estimate implies that moving from a

weak to strong reception county would lower that rate by around 16 percent.26

        This effect on grade-for-age status is particularly pronounced among boys. The estimated

effect is largest (in absolute terms) for black, non-Hispanic children, but the estimated

coefficients are not statistically significantly different across race/ethnic groups. For boys, grade-

for-age status is estimated to jump 3.8 percentage points (0.128*.3) between weak and strong

reception counties. This reflects a similar 16 percent reduction in the likelihood of being below

grade level, because this is one of the groups that has the most room for improvement in grade-

for-age status. For black, non-Hispanics, grade-for-age status is similarly estimated to jump by

3.2 percentage points (0.105*.3), which reflects a 10.8 percent reduction in being behind in

school. The impact for white, non-Hispanics is still sizable; grade-for-age status is estimated to

rise by 2 percentage points (.068*.3), reducing the dropout rate by 11.9 percent. Coefficient

estimates by gender are significantly different from each other.

        As a point of comparison, Currie and Thomas (1995) report estimates from sibling

difference models indicating that white children are 47 percent less likely to repeat a grade if

they attended Head Start relative to a sibling who did not. They did not find a statistically


26
  The fact that this estimate is somewhat larger than what one would expect from Figure 5 is attributable to
including state*birth cohort fixed effects. In a more traditional difference-in-difference analysis including birth
cohort and county fixed effects, our results are very similar to what we observe in Figure 5.
                                                                             Early Childhood Education by MOOC
                                                                                     Kearney and Levine, Page 25


significant effect for African-Americans. We find that white and black children who were age 5

or younger when Sesame Street was introduced and who lived in an area with strong reception

were 8.3 and 13.7 percent, respectively, less likely to be below the grade level appropriate for

their age relative to children in weak reception areas. Recall that coverage rates are 28 percent

higher in strong reception areas than in weak reception areas (83 versus 55 percent). For

purposes of comparison we simulate what would happen if we moved from no coverage to

complete coverage (admittedly an out-of-sample prediction). This generates the prediction that

the rate of being behind grade-level in school falls 29.6 percent for white, non-Hispanics and 49

percent for black, non-Hispanics. These results suggest that the introduction of Sesame Street for

white and black, non-Hispanic children had similar effects on elementary school performance as

did participation in the Head Start program.27

        The bottom panel of the table reports the results of the more descriptive model in

Equation 2. To obtain more power, we aggregate birth cohorts into two year intervals. Because

we want the interaction between coverage and the 1969 school start year cohort to enter the

model separately as a possible transition year, we move 1970 to form a 1970 through 1972

aggregated birth cohort. Again, the results of this analysis strongly correspond to the patterns

reported in Figure 5. For those scheduled to start school prior to 1969, we see no significant

difference in outcomes. For those cohorts that started school in 1970 and afterwards, we see a

27 We also perform a simple simulation exercise to compare the size of our grade-for-age effects with the PPVT
findings of Bogatz and Ball (1970). To do this, we used data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (1979)
to regress grade-for-age status at ages 15 and 16 on PPVT scores at ages 3 to 5, controlling for mother’s education,
race/ethnicity, and sex. This regression suggests that a one-point increase in PPVT scaled score increases the
likelihood of being grade for age by 0.22 percentage points. Recall that Bogatz and Ball (1979) found that exposure
to Sesame Street increases PPVT scores by 0.36 of a standard deviation, or 5.4 points in the scaled score. Based on
the simple NLSY regression, a 5.4 point increase in PPVT scaled score would increase GFA by (5.4*0.22) 1.2
percentage points. Our main estimates indicate that a 30 percent increase in Sesame Street coverage increased the
likelihood of being grade-for-age by (0.097*.3) 2.9 percentage points. This seems to suggest that the impact of
Sesame Street on educational progress goes beyond what we would expect just from improved PPVT. We think this
is intriguing, but given its crudeness, we are not inclined to make too much of this comparison.
                                                                               Early Childhood Education by MOOC
                                                                                       Kearney and Levine, Page 26


statistically significant (at least at the 10% level) increase in grade-for-age status associated with

greater Sesame Street coverage. For the 1969 school start year cohort, we see an effect between

the younger and older groups, as hypothesized. These results support the interpretation of a

causal effect. Again, the estimated impact is particularly large for boys, and the point estimates

suggest for black, non-Hispanic children.

         We extend this analysis to consider whether the show’s impact is greatest among children

from more disadvantaged areas. To do this, we augment the census data with additional data

from the 1970 Census obtained from the 1972 County and City Databook, which distinguishes

locations by different levels of disadvantage. This approach focuses on the disadvantage of the

area, not the individual. The indicators we use are the percentage of the county population that

has less than a high school degree, the percentage of families headed by a female head, the

percentage of families with incomes below $5,000 in 1970, and the percentage of the population

that is black. The top row of Table 5 indicates mean values for these indicators.

         The remainder of Table 5 presents regressions results that are largely of the same form as

Equation 1, except that they also introduce an additional interaction term between a measure of

county-level economic disadvantage and the indicator variable for those who would be of

preschool age after 1969 in counties with different predicted Sesame Street coverage rates.28 In

each case, we find that the ability of Sesame Street to increase the rate at which children are at

grade level is greater in areas characterized by greater disadvantage. For instance, a county

where two-thirds of the households are headed by high school dropouts (compared to the mean
28
  The reader should note that this is a restricted version of a more general triple-difference estimation strategy, as
described in Gruber (1994). The main difference is that our model restricts the coefficients on the interactions
between cohort fixed effects and county characteristics to be zero. When we relax this restriction, we find that our
data are not sufficiently powerful to separately identify all of the effects without a sizable impact on the standard
errors of our variables of interest. With the restriction imposed, bias would result if children from more
disadvantaged counties experienced differential educational outcomes well-timed to the introduction of Sesame
Street. This is an unlikely, but not impossible scenario.

                                                                                       Kearney and Levine, Page 27


rate of 44.6 percent) would experience about a 5.8 percentage point increase in grade-for-age

status if Sesame Street coverage rose from a low level to a high level [0.3*(66.7*.0046-.115)].

This compares to the average effect of 3.2 percentage points calculated earlier.

C. Econometric Results: Educational Attainment and Labor Market Outcomes

         We now move on to consider later life outcomes, including ultimate educational

attainment and labor market outcomes. We estimate completely analogous models to those

reported earlier other than changing the dependent variable and the specific Census data on

which we estimate the models. The measures of educational attainment (high school dropout,

high school graduate, or attending any college) come from the 1990 Census. Measures of labor

market outcomes (log hourly wage, employment status, and poverty status) come from the 2000

Census.

         The results of this analysis are reported in Table 6; the top panel reports models of the

form represented in Equation (1) and the lower panel breaks out these effects by specific birth

cohort, as described by Equation (2). Estimates are reported for each educational attainment and

labor market outcome for the full sample (each cell represents the results from a separate

regression). The results in the first three columns regarding educational attainment provide no

evidence of changes in these outcomes. Parameter estimates are small, statistically insignificant,

and inconsistent with the expected pattern across cohorts (in the bottom panel).29



29
  The lack of any impact on educational attainment may be considered surprising in light of the positive effect on
grade-for-age status that we identified earlier. However, whether a student falls behind in school at a young age does
not have a very strong predictive relationship with whether he or she ultimately graduates high school. To formalize
the strength (or lack thereof) of the relationship between grade-for-age status in 1980 with educational attainment in
1990, we collapsed data from the two Censuses to generate rates of each type of outcome by birth cohort and state
and county of birth (noting our earlier discussion regarding geographic distinctions in the data). The correlation
coefficient between rates of grade-for-age status in 1980 with the high school dropout rate in 1990 for the same birth
cohort is -0.44. This is a substantial correlation, but also makes clear the possibility that Sesame Street may have
improved grade-for-age status without reducing the subsequent high school dropout rate for the same cohort.
                                                                               Early Childhood Education by MOOC
                                                                                       Kearney and Levine, Page 28


         The results in the last three columns regarding labor market outcomes are less clear.

Parameter estimates all take on the expected signs (positive for employment and wages, negative

for living in poverty). The estimated impact on employment is statistically significant at the 5

percent level and the other two estimates are just above and below the threshold of statistical

significance at the 10 percent level. Following cohorts, the estimated effects reveal the predicted

patterns as shown in the bottom of the table and the employment effects are statistically

significant for the preschool cohorts in 1969.

         The magnitude of these effects, though, is small.30 Our standard for interpreting

magnitudes has been to evaluate the impact of moving from a weak reception county to a strong

reception county, characterized by a 30 point increase in coverage. These results predict that

employment would rise by about one percentage point (0.3*0.034). Similarly, wages would be

predicted to rise by 0.93 percent (0.3*0.31; note that wages are measured in natural logs).

         Perhaps we should not expect to see large labor market effects driven by early childhood

exposure to Sesame Street. To put these small estimated magnitudes into context, we consider

what we might have expected to see given the magnitude of effects on early childhood test scores

and grade-for-age status. To pursue this simulation exercise, we relate gains in test scores and

grade-for-age status to wages, and then multiply this relationship by the estimated effects of

Sesame Street on these two measures. Previous estimates suggest that a 0.1 standard deviation

increase in reading test scores is associated with a 0.6 percent wage increase (Levine and

30
  One potential concern with the longer term estimates for educational attainment and labor market outcomes as
compared to the grade-for-age results is the possibility of greater attenuation bias in the 1990 and 2000 Censuses
than in the 1980 Census. In the mobility results we reported in Table 2 using the NLSY, this would appear in the
greater likelihood of a more distant inter-county move within states over time (attenuation bias in interstate mobility
is not an issue based on our decision to examine just those who live in the same state as they were born). We used
those data to simulate what would happen if 5.3 percent of the sample moved out of the area around their county of
birth and we re-assigned them randomly to other locations. This amount is the difference in inter-county mobility
observed between 1980 and 2000. The impact on our point estimates was minor, implying that greater attenuation
bias cannot explain the stronger results in grade-for-age status than in educational or labor market outcomes.
                                                                              Early Childhood Education by MOOC
                                                                                      Kearney and Levine, Page 29


Zimmerman, 2010).31 The estimates from Bogatz and Ball (1971) indicate that Sesame Street

increased reading test scores of viewers by 0.36 standard deviations. Our simulation is based on

a 30 percentage point increase in exposure associated with greater reception. This would

generate a prediction of a 0.65 percent (0.3*0.36*0.6) increase in wages. This is actually

somewhat smaller than what we observe in the wage data.

         To consider what our estimated effects on grade-for-age status would imply, we need to

document the relationship between this outcome and wages. Using data from the 1979 National

Longitudinal Study of Youth (NLSY), we regress the natural log of wages in 2010 on grade-for-

age status in 1979 among those born in 1962-1964 (who should still be in school in 1979),

controlling for race/ethnicity, gender, living arrangements, and parental education. The results

indicate that students who are in the appropriate grade in high school earn 27 percent more than

those who are behind. Our analysis of 1980 Census data, reported earlier, indicates that those in

strong reception areas are 3 percentage points more likely to be in the appropriate grade relative

to those in weak reception areas. This suggests we should find a 0.81 percent increase in wages

associated with living in a strong reception area. This is in the same vicinity as the wage effect

that we estimated.

         What we can conclude from this analysis is that the results do not provide strong

evidence of substantive improvements in labor market outcomes. This is not to say that exposure

to Sesame Street had no effect; the fact that we are not able to strongly distinguish our estimates

from zero may reflect limited power, even using large Census samples.


31
  Based on a review of past studies estimating the relationship between test scores and wages, Krueger (2003)
concludes that “a plausible assumption is that a one SD increase in either math or reading scores in elementary
schools is associated with about 8 percent higher earnings.” The estimate we use is similar to this, but it is likely
more relevant since it is based on test scores at young ages in an American context (using the NLSY), which is not
true of the other studies.

                                                                       Kearney and Levine, Page 30



V. ANALYSIS OF HIGH SCHOOL AND BEYOND DATA

       One limitation of our analysis so far is that it cannot capture specific mechanisms that

have been explored more recently in thinking about longer-term effects of educational

interventions (cf. Heckman, 2006). Interventions may be effective in improving narrower

measures of academic achievement (“cognitive outcomes”) and/or improving a child’s level of

socio-emotional development (sometimes referred to by economists as “non-cognitive

outcomes”). Census data do not allow us to distinguish between these types of intermediate

outcomes because no measures of non-cognitive outcomes are available.

       To overcome this limitation, we augment the analysis above with an analysis of data

available in the longitudinal survey, High School and Beyond (HSB). These data are obtained

from a school-based survey of around 60,000 students who were high school sophomores and

seniors in 1980. This data source contains extensive data on a range of outcomes including test

scores, school grades, and self-reported measures of self-esteem and locus of control. In our

analysis below, we have standardized test scores, measures of self-esteem, and locus of control

so that each has a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. The National Center for

Educational Statistics (NCES) in the U.S. Department of Education does not provide access to

any geographic identifiers with HSB data, not even with a restricted use agreement. However, a

contextual file is available through ICPSR that provides details regarding county level

unemployment rates, employment growth rates, and the like. We make use of those data to

reverse engineer the HSB data to identify the county locations of the school. Data Appendix 2

describes the procedure we used.

       There are two cohorts of students in the HSB data who would have entered first grade

right before and after the introduction of Sesame Street. High school seniors in the spring of
                                                                  Early Childhood Education by MOOC
                                                                          Kearney and Levine, Page 31


1980 who advanced on target through the educational system mainly would have been born in

1962; sophomores would have been born in 1964. This provides the possibility of within-school

controls since sophomores, but not seniors, would have been exposed to Sesame Street before

starting first grade. Comparing the two groups across areas that differ by Sesame Street coverage

rates provides a plausible method of identifying the effects of the show.

       Despite the significant advantages of these data for our purposes, they do possess some

limitations. First, as suggested by earlier discussions in this paper, a substantial minority of

students do not advance through the educational system on pace with their birth cohort. Many

students will have fallen behind by tenth grade. This weakens the experimental design because

those sophomores who had fallen behind may have been born before 1964 and, thus, would not

have been exposed to Sesame Street before entering school. This amounts to a contamination of

the treatment, introducing a bias towards zero in our analysis.

       A second limitation is generated because the school-based nature of the data omits those

students who had dropped out already. Although dropout rates prior to 10th grade are reasonably

rare, by 12th grade they are not. As such, sample selection plagues the control group in a way that

is not replicated in the treatment group. To address this problem, we restrict our sophomore

sample to those who begin their senior year two years later in 1982, making for a fair comparison

between the remaining sophomores and seniors. It does, however, restrict the scope of our

analysis to those who survive the educational system through the end of high school. We also

find that very few students who make it to twelfth grade fail to graduate high school. Despite

these limitations, the HSB data provide a useful opportunity to examine specific intermediate

outcomes, and we proceed accordingly.
                                                                   Early Childhood Education by MOOC
                                                                           Kearney and Levine, Page 32


       The results of our analysis are reported in Table 7. The top panel focuses on measures of

12th grade academic achievement, including test scores in math, vocabulary, and reading, along

with high school grades (an indicator for receiving mostly A’s and B’s in school). The bottom

panel focuses on measures of socio-emotional development, including locus of control, self-

esteem, behavior problems, and work ethic measured in each cohort’s senior year. We estimate

IV models comparable in form to those described earlier using Census data, though we include

school fixed effects, rather than county fixed effects, in this specification. The key explanatory

variable is the interaction between the predicted coverage rate in one’s county with cohort

(sophomore or senior in the initial survey). We also include state by cohort fixed effects and a

series of other explanatory variables, which include basic demographics along with greater detail

on socioeconomic status, like family income.

       The results from this analysis do not support the conclusion of an impact of watching

Sesame Street on academic of socio-emotional development by the end of high school for these

students. Although some of the outcomes are estimated to improve for the treated group

(sophomores) with higher coverage rates, these effects are generally not statistically significant

(the effect on self-esteem is significant at the 10 percent level). This finding is not the result of

low power. Consider, for instance, the estimated impact on math test scores, which has a

standard error of 0.060. We would be able to reject the null hypothesis of no effect if the

coefficient was around 0.12 at the 5 percent level. This coefficient would indicate that moving

from a low coverage state to a high coverage state would increase math test scores of the

exposed cohort (sophomores in 1980) by 0.036 of a standard deviation. One potential

interpretation is that any effect of the show in either dimension had completely faded by the time

one reached the latter stages of his or her high school career.

VI. DISCUSSION

        This paper has documented the effects of exposure to Sesame Street programming

content on indicators of early school performance, ultimate educational attainment, and labor

market outcomes. Well-conducted randomized control trials at the time Sesame Street was

initially introduced provided evidence that watching the show generated an immediate and

sizeable increase in test scores. Building on this existing body of early, targeted evidence, our

large-scale analysis finds positive impacts on the educational performance of the generation of

children who experienced their preschool years when Sesame Street was introduced in areas with

greater broadcast coverage. Specifically, such children achieved relative increases in grade-for-

age status. This outcome largely represents improvements in academic progress in elementary

school, when students at that time were more likely to fall behind their appropriate grade level.

This effect was particularly pronounced for boys and black, non-Hispanic children, along with

those children who grew up in counties characterized by greater economic disadvantage. In that

regard, Sesame Street satisfied its goal of preparing children for school entry, especially for black

and disadvantaged children.32 Remarkably, the show accomplished that at a cost of around $5 per

child per year (in today’s dollars).

        The data do not provide conclusive evidence of longer-term effects on ultimate

educational attainment or labor market outcomes. As described earlier, though, the small effects

on wages are consistent with the magnitude of our estimated effect of Sesame Street on grade-




32
  Recent research has also explored the ability of newer educational programming (Martha Speaks, Super Why!, and
others) developed by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to improve test scores of preschool and kindergarten
students in random assignment experiments (Linebarger, et al., 2009 and 2010). These analyses also find sizeable
effects of viewing the shows. None of these interventions have been going on long enough to examine long-term

for-age status, as well as earlier estimates of the impact of the show on early childhood test

scores.

          What then could help boost that impact to produce substantive effects beyond elementary

school? Although our analysis does not address this question, we offer two possibilities. From

the academic side, interventions that are longer-lasting in nature may help. Again, exposure to

Sesame Street represents a one-time intervention with nothing intentional to follow. Students

reach 1st grade better able to begin a reading curriculum, for instance, but at some point all

students will have accomplished that goal. One interpretation of weak longer-term effects is that

educational interventions need to be maintained and continuous so that students can build on the

gains they have already attained to keep the momentum going.33

          Alternatively (or in addition), perhaps more emphasis needs to be concurrently placed on

socio-emotional development and academic skills. Among the types of early childhood education

interventions that were introduced during this period in the late 1960s (including Head Start and

Perry Preschool), Sesame Street was perhaps the most narrowly targeted at the objective of

improving educational achievement at its origin. This targeting is clear in the original stated

objectives of the show (Cooney, 1967). Those objectives go beyond only an emphasis on

academic achievement, incorporation of cultural development (arts and music) and awareness of

basic emotions, but their broader focus on socio-emotional development is rather limited.34 Other

interventions at that time and those introduced in the intervening years (including universal pre-

kindergarten) contain far greater emphasis on both academic achievement and socio-emotional

development.

33
   Regarding MOOCs, an intervention like Khan Academy has that potential, for instance, to satisfy this concern,
since it is not just a one-time intervention in a specific school grade.
34
   Over time, Sesame Street has broadened its focus to include greater emphasis on socio-emotional development
(Davis, 2008), but those changes are not assessed here.
                                                                 Early Childhood Education by MOOC
                                                                         Kearney and Levine, Page 35


       The role played by socio-emotional development is frequently emphasized in research

regarding the impact of early childhood education, including that on Head Start, Perry Preschool,

and Project Star (cf. Carneiro and Heckman, 2005, and Chetty, et al., 2011). Interventions that do

not emphasize the importance of this form of development may be limited in their ability to

generate long-term effects. If so, then perhaps a blended learning environment incorporating both

electronic communication of educational content and the human element to affect the “soft

skills” may be preferable, and cost-effective. An understanding of the importance of these (or

potentially other) alternatives is critical in designing future efforts to improve subsequent

economic circumstances through early childhood education. As research and policy discussions

continue to focus on early childhood education, the results of this analysis suggest that the

impact of Sesame Street deserves to be included along with Perry Preschool, Head Start and

other programs.

Notes: A unit of observation in this analysis is a county. Not-in-sample counties are those that are not uniquely
identified in the 1980 Census. Weak reception counties are those where the closest station broadcasting Sesame
Street is UHF or where the closest station is more than 60 miles away. Strong reception counties are the remainder.
Population weights are used in all models other than total population. None of the differences between strong and
weak reception counties are statistically significant.

with county fixed effects, state*birth cohort fixed effects, demographic characteristics (race/ethnicity, gender, mother’s level of
education, and an indicator for whether mother was present in household at time of Census), and county level policy variables
(presence of Food Stamp program and expenditures on Head Start). Standard errors are estimated using a two-step bootstrap
procedure where sampling is clustered at the station level in the first step and at the county level in the second step.

Notes: Each column within the top and bottom panels is a separate regression. Test scores, locus
of control and self-esteem, are demeaned and standardized within each cohort. Controls include
gender, race, parental education, urbanicity, 1980 family income, single parent households,
county level Food Stamp availability, county level Head Start per capita expenditure, and school
fixed effects (which eliminate the main effect of the coverage rate). Sample composed of all
1980 sophomores who were enrolled in 12th grade in the 1982 survey and all 1980 seniors.
Standard errors are estimated using a bootstrap procedure where sampling is clustered at the
school level.

        An important determinant of the potential influence of Sesame Street upon its

introduction was the ability of households to receive its broadcast. Indications at that time

suggest that only around two-thirds of households could do so (Davis, 2008). For the purposes of

this research project, identifying which areas of the country had greater access than others is a

critical issue.

        Obtaining that information, however, is a difficult task. Since its inception, Sesame Street

has been commonly broadcast on non-commercial television stations that were members of the

Public Broadcasting Service (PBS). A major reason for television networks to study the number

of households in an area watching their shows is to set the price of advertising time. Non-

commercial networks, by definition, do not sell advertising time, providing them with less of an

incentive to pay the expense of regularly obtaining location-specific reception capabilities and

audience size.

        These data are available, however, for commercial networks and we take advantage of

them to simulate county-level estimates of Sesame Street coverage rates. During the early years

of the television industry, the periodic publication, TV Factbook, provided categorical data on

“net weekly circulation” by county for every commercial television station in the country. This

statistic measures the percentage of television households in that county that viewed any show

broadcast by a nearby station at least once over the course of a week. By 1969, 95 percent of all

households owned at least one television set (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1970), so television

households closely approximate all households. With limited station options (three major

networks and very limited cable television), viewing any show broadcast by a particular station

at least once in a week is a strong indicator of the ability of the household to receive that
station’s signal. We interpret this statistic as the station’s “coverage rate,” in a county. Counties

are identified as those in which the coverage rate from a nearby station is 5 to 24 percent, 25 to

50 percent, or greater than 50 percent. We take advantage of the data from this source from 1968,

before Sesame Street was introduced (Television Digest, Inc., 1968).

       The TV Factbook also provides additional detail that is critical for our analysis, namely

the technical specifications of every television station in the country. These specifications

include the exact location (latitude and longitude in seconds) of every broadcast tower, the height

of the tower above the ground, the channel number of the station, and the power of the broadcast

signal. Importantly, these data are available for every station, commercial and non-commercial,

including those that were members of the National Educational Television (NET) network in

1968, which would become PBS when it was formed in 1969.

       The approach that we use to simulate Sesame Street coverage rates by county is to

determine the empirical relationship between commercial stations’ broadcast tower and the

county level coverage rates using each station’s technical specifications. We then apply that

relationship to the technical specifications of all stations, including those that were non-

commercial, to simulate county level coverage rates. That statistic will be the key explanatory

variable in our analysis.

       An important component of this empirical coverage relationship is the distance between

the television tower and the nearby counties. The TV Factbook provides us with information on

the latitude and longitude of the tower. To determine how far away nearby counties are, we use

data on the latitude and longitude of the population centroids of those counties in 1970 (U.S.

Bureau of the Census, 1974). We can construct the distance between the tower and the county

using these latitude and longitude statistics. We define “nearby” counties to be those that are
within 200 miles of the television tower. Inspection of the data suggests that television reception

outside of that range is sufficiently uncommon that we can ignore it. Although distance is a

fundamental component of broadcast signal reception, the other technical specifications available

for each station should matter as well. The higher the television tower is, the further away the

signal should be received. Signal strength should play a similar role.

       Another factor that is important is the frequency of the broadcast, particularly whether it

is very high frequency (VHF) or ultra-high frequency (UHF). VHF stations can be identified as

those with channel numbers of 2 through 13 and UHF stations are those with channel numbers

above 13. It is well-known that reception of UHF stations at the time was considerably inferior to

that of VHF stations. This was partly attributable to technological limitations of UHF

transmission and partly because UHF receivers in television sets were inferior or even non-

existent (McDowell, 2006). In fact, as of January 1969, only 55 percent of households owned a

television that could receive UHF channels (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1970). This means that

whether the station broadcast in VHF or UHF played a large role in determining its coverage rate

in the area. Many PBS stations broadcast in UHF (including Washington, DC and Los Angeles),

contributing to their coverage limitations.

       In determining the relationship between coverage, distance, and technical specifications,

a unit of observation is a county/commercial station pair. We restrict our analysis to those pairs

where we have complete data, including coverage rates in nearby counties and the coordinates of

the population centroid in the covered county because of the importance of distance in this

analysis. Using these data, we further restrict the sample to county/station pairs within a 200 mile

distance. Finally, we restrict the sample to exclude those stations that are satellites of another

because it complicates the computation of distance from the receiving county and the
transmission tower. In the end, the sample of county/station pairs used in estimation totals

14,397.

       In our empirical model, the dependent variable is the coverage rate and the explanatory

variables reflect the technical specifications of the commercial stations. Recall that the available

coverage rates are categorical (5-24 percent, 25-50 percent, and over 50 percent). To linearize

the relationship, we assume an average coverage rate within categories of 20, 40, and 90 percent.

       The results of our empirical exercise are reported in Appendix Table A1. The results are

consistent with what we would have predicted, particularly regarding the role of distance and

UHF reception. A county that is 100 miles away from the tower has about a 50 percentage point

lower likelihood of receiving the signal. Stations that broadcast over a UHF channel experience

coverage rates that are 42 percentage points lower than a VHF channel even in the immediate

vicinity of the broadcast tower. That deficit increases 10 percentage points for a UHF channel if

the county is 100 miles away from the broadcast tower. In essence, it is very unlikely for UHF

signals to be received beyond 100 miles from the tower.

       We then apply these parameters to the technical specifications of the non-commercial

stations to simulate coverage rates by county for their broadcast signals. We have two indicators

that these estimates provide a good approximation of coverage rates for PBS and Sesame Street,

as we have described earlier in this appendix and in the text of the paper. First, the national

coverage rate from these county level estimates is very similar to previously reported coverage

rates for Sesame Street. Second, when we aggregate these data by metropolitan area and compare

estimated coverage rates to Nielsen ratings in those areas, they correlate strongly.

              Identifying States and Counties in High School and Beyond Data

       No public or restricted release version of the High School and Beyond (HSB) survey

contains state or county identifiers. A contextual data file, however, was released at one point

(currently available through ICPSR), which included supplemental local labor market indicators,

containing data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and the Bureau of Economic Analysis

(BEA). We used these data and “reverse engineered” them to generate state and county level

identifiers. This appendix details our approach.

       The BLS component in the local labor market supplement contains 21 measures of

employment growth, unemployment and wages including the state, county and Standard

Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA) annual unemployment rates for 1980, 1981, and 1982 as

well as employment growth rates that were constructed from the civilian labor force and

employment variables. In addition, the annual hourly average wage for manufacturing is

provided at the state and SMSA level for these same years. Variables that were reported in

levels, such as the number participating in the labor force, number employed, and number

unemployed were dropped in order to maintain anonymity.

       The BEA component of the local labor market supplement contains 30 measures of

annual per capita personal income, total personal income annual growth, employment to

population growth ratios, and within sample population quartile indicators for the years 1980 and

1981. Once again, variables reported in levels, such as total personal income and population

were dropped for confidentiality. Although unique identifiers (such as population or number of

unemployed workers) were not provided, the combination of these local labor market variables

can be used to accurately identify the states and counties of all of the HSB survey schools.
       With these data, we found that the combination of state unemployment rates for 1980,

1981, and 1982 uniquely identifies each state and the District of Columbia. We then kept only

the state observations and merged the BLS state level unemployment data onto the HSB school

level state unemployment rates for the corresponding years using the 1980-1982 unemployment

rates as identifiers. All 1,015 schools merged, thus identifying the state each school is located in.

       After linking each school to a state, we found that the combination of state and the BEA

county level per capita personal income for the years 1980 and 1981 uniquely identify every

county in the United States. In other words, at the state level, county per capita personal income

from 1980 and 1981 uniquely identifies all U.S. counties. We then merged the BEA personal

income data onto the HSB data using state, and 1980-1981 per capita personal income as unique

identifiers. Once again, all 1,015 schools were successfully linked to a county in their previously

determined state. In short, we use a two-step process of first identifying the state of each school

by BLS state level unemployment data, then identifying the county of each school by BEA

county level per capita personal income and the state. This method links every school in the

HSB survey to its corresponding state and county, allowing us to use the county level television

reception data for identification.

       In order to check the validity of our match, we considered the match quality of 1980 and

1981 county level total personal income annual growth (CTPIAG) and per capita personal

income as a percent of the national average, as well as state level total personal income growth,

per capita personal income as a percent of the national average, and state level per capita

personal income, which we had obtained and were included in the HSB data.                 Using the

matching method described above, we found that all but 1981 CTPIAG exactly matched the

HSB data. The 1981 CTPIAG matched on all but 7 state-county observations. Upon additional
inspection, we found that in each of these cases our value was exactly 1 unit higher, the result of

a rounding difference between the two datasets. 99.31% of the data matched exactly, and 100%

matched after correcting for this difference in rounding. As an additional validity check, we use

the HSB provided Census Region for each school, and found that all of our reverse engineered

states fall within the correct Census Region.
