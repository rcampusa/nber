              INTEGRATION OF THE INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL MARI<ETS:
                 THE SIZE OF GOVERNMENT AND TAX COORDINATION


                                  ABSTRACT




     International-capital market integration has become a key
policy issue in the prospective integration of Europe of 1992.
In this context this paper provides a theoretical analysis of
the effects of relaxing restrictions on the international flow
of capital on the fiscal branch of government:     the optimal
provision of public goods, the structure of taxation and
income redi.sributioa policies.     Concerning issues cf
interdependent economies the paper analyzes the scope of tax
coordination.     The major findings are:        (a)  with no
administrative barriers to capital flows the optimal policy is
to tax income from investment abroad and from investments at
home at the same time; (b) the cost of public funds falls and
the supply of public goods rises if restrictions on
international capital flows are relaxed:(c) the amount of
income redistrjbutjons increases with the international-
capital market liberalization; (d) some minimal degree of tax
coordination      (such as origin-based or source-based tax
schemes) is essential for the existence of an equilibrium in
an integrated world economy.

I. Introduction

     International capital market integration has become the subject of

a major     theoretical   and   practical    Interest in recent times.
Policymakers are becoming more and more aware of the potential benefits

accruing from such integration, which allows more efficient allocations

of investment between the domestic and the foreign market.             In

particular, with the prospective comprehensive integration of capital

markets in Europe in 1992, some key policy issues arise.'

     The financial, monetary and exchange rate management          policy
implications of capital market integration have been widely discussed in

the context of the European Monetary System (EMS); see, for instance,

the survey by Micossi (1988). However, capital market integration has

also profound effects on the fiscal branch of each country separately

and on the scope of tax coordination among them. These issues have not

been dealt with extensively so far.         The present paper attempts to

contribute to the economic analysis in this area.2

     The opening up of an economy to international capital movements

affects, as expected, the size and the structure of the fiscal branch of

its government.    Capital flows influence both the optimal structure of

taxes, on domestic and foreign-source income, and the welfare cost of

taxation.    As a result, the optimal size of government (the optimal

provision of public goods) and the magnitude of its redistribution

(transfer) policies are affected as well. In this context the paper

analyzes the effects of relaxing restrictions on the international flow

of capital on the fiscal branch of government.

     The optimal size of government, or more precisely the optimal

provision of public goods, must be determined by an appropriate
                                   -2-




cost-benefit    analysis. Such analysi rnplies that the marginal cost of

public funds must be equated to the marginal utility from public goods.

Accordingly,    in order to find the effect of liberalization in the

international capital markets on the optimal quantity of public goods we

study here the effect of such a liberalization on the cost of public

funds.    This is done in section V in which we also distinguish between

constant and variable internal terms of          trade   associated with
nontradables.

     In calculating the cost of public funds, one must take into account

the optimal response of the structure of taxation (on incomes from all

sources) to the liberalization policy because the cost of public funds

is derived from a process of a tax optimization. Therefore, we also

analyze the effect of liberalization on the structure of taxation.    Of

course, entangled with the structure of taxation is also the issue of

the optimal size of income redistribution.   For this reason we also
analyze in section VI the effect of international capital market

liberalization on the optimal redistribution (transfer) policy of the

government.

     Finally, integration of capital markets brings up the issue of

international tax coordination. It turns out that perfect mobility of

capital necessitates some minimal degree of coordination among the tax

authorities. This is discussed in section VII.

    We present in section II the analytical framework that serves for

our analysis.      Sections III and IV discuss alternative regimes of
                                  .3-




international capital mobility. Concluding remarks are included in the

final section.



II. The Analytical Framework

     Consider a stylized two-period model of a small open economy with

one composite good, serving both for (private and public) consumption

and for investment.      In the first period the economy possesses an

initial endowment of the composite good.   Individuals can decide how

much of their initial endowments to consume in the first period and how

much to save. Saving is allocated to either domestic investment or

foreign investment.    In the second period, output (produced by capital

and labor) and income from foreign investment are allocated between

private and public consumption. For the sake of simplicity, we assume

that the government is active only in the second period. The government

employs taxes on labor, taxes on income from domestic investment, and

taxes on income from investment abroad in order to finance optimally

(taking into account both efficiency and equity considerations) both its

(public) consumption and a (uniform lump-sum) subsidy for redistribution

purposes.

     For simplicity, while still capturing real-world basic features, we

assume that government spending on public goods does not affect

individual demand patterns for private goods or the supply of labor.

That is, only the taxes that are needed to finance these expenditures

affect individual demands and supplies, but not the expenditures
                                       -4-




themselves. Formally, this feature is obtained by assuming that the

utility function is weakly separable between private goods and services,

on the one hand, and public goods and services, on the other. That               is,
individual h's utility is:



(1)
          uh(clh, C2h, Lh, C) —      uh(clh,   C2h, L.a) +     mh(G),



where uh and          are the private and public components of the utility

function, respectively;                          and                are first-period
                             Clh,       C2h                  L.
consumption, second-period consumption and (second-period) labor supply,

respectively; and C is (second-period) public consumption.3

      Denote saving in the form of domestic capital by K. and saving in

the form of foreign capital by Bh. The aggregate saving in the form of

domestic capital is equal to the the stock of capital in the second

period, since we assume for concreteness, without affecting the results

of the paper, that the patterns of capital flows are such that the

country is a capital exporter (i.e.                    0).        Hence, the budget
constraints of individual h are:



(2)
          Clh+Kh+Bh_Ih

(3)       C2h —   Kh(l+r(lt)J   +
                                    Bh[l+r*(lt)1       +   (l-O)wL + S'
                                           -5-




where:

t    -     tax   on capital income from domestic sources;

     -     tax   on capital income from foreign sources;

8    - tax       on labor income;

S'   -
           lump-suni subsidy;
r    -   domestic rate of interest;
     -
           foreign      rate of interest (net of taxes levied abroad);

w    -
         wage rate;
     -     initial      (first-period) endowment.

     Obviously, in the absence of (quantity) restrictions on capital

flows, individuals must earn the same net return on both forms of

investments, that is r(l-t) —             r* (l-t').   With restrictions on capital

flows the latter equality does not have to hold. In such a case there

is an infra-marginal profit on foreign investment, resulting from the

net interest differential. (This differential is equal to the capital

export tax rate which is equivalent to the quota on capital exports.)

One possibility is for this profit to accrue to the individual

investors. Another possibilty is for the government to fully tax away

this profit. (This is the equivalent capital-export tax version of the

capital-export quota.) We adopt the second possibility, namely that the

government chooses the level of the tax on income from foreign

investments (t') so as to eliminate any infra-marginal profits.               This

.Lnplies         that     whether or not there are restrictions on foreign

Investment, the government chooses t' so as to maintain the equality
                                              -6-




r(l-t) —   r*(lt)                 That is, the rate of tax on income from foreign
                      4
investment is equal to


                     *
             —
                 r       -
                              r(l-t)
                             r*

      Under this tax scheme, the individual is indifferent between

investing at home                  or abroad (Bh) caring only about the level of

total investment '<-h +                        Thus, at equilibrium, the size of the
                                       Bh).
aggregate domestic capital is determined by the demand for capital by

domestic firms.              The latter is determined by the standard equalization

of the marginal product of capital to the domestic rate of interest, r.

      We can consolidate the two budget constraints into a single

(present-value) constraint:



(4)        C1+q2C2_I+qL.fl+S
where

(5)        q2 - [1 +          (l-t)r]
is the consumer (after-tax) price of second-period consumption,



(6)          — (l-O)w[l +              (l-t)r]
                                            -7-




is the consumer price of labor and S —                           is the present value of
                                                         q2S'
the subsidy. Maximization of the utility function h subject to the

budget constraint (4), yields the consumption demand functions

and the utility obtained from these demand and supply functions, namely,

the indirect utility function:

                   vh(q2, q


       Domestic output        (Y) is produced In the second period by capital

and labor, according to a constant-returns-to-scale production function



(10)        Y — F(K, L),



where K —           is   the stock of domestic capital and L —
                                                                           EhLh

aggregate supply of labor.

       The resource constraints of this economy require that

and

(lib)       Y + (1 +      r*)B    + K —            + C,
                                             C2



where I —        EI     is   aggregate first-period endowment, B — E.Bh                                    is

aggregate investment abroad, C1 —                             is aggregate consumption in the
                                                    EClh
first period and                 C2 — EhC2h         is aggregate consumption in the second

period.

        Substituting (2), (7), (8),                 (10) and the first-period resource

constraint (ha) into the second-period resource constraint (lib) yields

the equilibrium condition:



             F(I -                                           + S)          -
                                                                               B,

Observe that aggregate consuxnptions, C1 and C2, depend not only on

aggregate income, but also on its distribution.



III. International Capital Flows: Alternative Regimes

        We consider two alternative regimes.                              In the first regime the

government sets quantity restrictions on capital exports. In I2

regime,     there are no restrictions on capital exports and                                        3   I ius
determined by market clearance.
                                   -9-




      The optimal tax/transfer policy and provision of public goods are

obtained as a solution to the program of maximizing the indirect social

welfare function



(13) W(q2, q I + S.... "H + S) —                           +



subject to the resource constraint (12). In this setup, common in the

public finance literature, the government does not directly operate on

private sector quantities, but rather on prices (through taxes) which

affect these quantities. The government tax policy focuses on
                                                                    q2,
and S as the control variables. In the first regime we treat B as a

parameter. In the second regime, B         is also a control endogenous
variable.   Notice, however, that this does not mean that the government

directly determines the level of investment abroad;            rather, the

government, through its tax policy, affects total savings (K+B) and

domestic investment (K) and    B   is determined as a residual (the
difference between total savings and domestic investment).

      Notice that, by Walras Law, the government budget constraint is

satisfied. Also, the wage rate (w) and the domestic rate of interest (r)

are determined by the standard marginal productivity conditions: F1 —     r
and    F2 — w.     Given q2 and          we can solve for the tax rates, t

and 9, by using (5) and (6).
                                               -10-




IV. Efficient Capital Flows

        Since there are distortionary. taxes as part of the optimal program,

obviously the resource allocation is not Pareto-efficient:                                  the

intertemporal allocation of consumption, the leisure-consumption choice,

and      the       private-public consumption tradeoffs are all distorted.

Nevertheless, the fully optimal program (namely, the second regime where

no restrictions on B                    exist) requires an efficient allocation of

capital between investment at home and abroad, so that F1 —                          r*.   That

is, the marginal product of domestic capital must be equated to the

foreign rate of return on capital (net of foreign taxes).

        To see this, observe that the endogenous variable B does not

appear in the objective function (13), so that the                                 first-order

conditions for               optimality require that the derivative of the resource

constraint (12) with resPect to B, i.e.                    -
                                                               F1
                                                                    +   (l4r*)l,   be equal to

zero.          Hence, F1 —      r   .    Evidently,   this is an open economy variant of

the aggregate efficiency theorem in optimal tax theory (see Diamond and

Mirrlees (1971), Sadka (1977), and Dixit (1985)).

        Notice also that this production-efficiency result implies also

that there should be no differential tax treatment of foreign and

domestic sources of income, namely:



               t   —   t'.
                                   -11-




     However, in the presence of restrictions on capital exports the

production efficiency result does not necessarily hold: the return to

capital at home may be lower than the net (after foreign taxes only)

return on investment abroad.

     We turn next to the study of the effects of relaxing the
restrictions on investments abroad.



V.   The Cost of Public Funds in an Open Economy

     In the presence of distortionary taxes, the social cost of an

additional dollar raised by taxes (namely the marginal cost of public

funds) may exceed one dollar, due to the existence of excess-burden

(deadweight loss) of taxation. The optimal provision of public goods is

determined by equating their marginal benefit with the marginal cost of

public funds.     In this section we directly examine the effect of

relaxing the restrictions on B on the optimal level of C.       Since we

have assumed that the marginal benefit from           C is diminishing (a

concave m), it follows that the optimal G increases if and only if

the marginal cost of public funds declines. Thus, we indirectly analyze

the effect of a liberalization of the international capital markets on

the marginal cost of public funds.

     For this purpose, we treat B         as a parameter and examine the

effect of changing      B      on the optimal quantity of the public good.

Specifically, the optimal level of the public good is a function of    B,

denoted by      G(B). We then look for the sign of dG/dB in the region
                                            -12-




where F1 —       r   <   r,        so that increasing   B      enhances production

efficiency and, thus, social welfare.

       We proceed as follows.               For given levels of C and B, let us

maximize the private component of W in (13),                (namely, E.-yhvh(q2,

   +   S)) subject to the resource constraint (12). Denote the value of
the maximand by               N(B, C).     Then, for a given B, the optimal C is

determined by solving



(14)        max(N(B,G) + M(G)),
             C



where M(C) —
                     E-m(C).
       The first-order condition is



(15)       N2 + M'— 0



and the second-order condition is



(16)       N22 + M"           0.


       Totally differentiating (15) with respect to B yields



                 —       N12
(17)
            dB       - (N22 + M")
                                    -13-




       By (16), the denominator in (17) is positive. Hence,

       To proceed further, at this point, we first abstract            from

redistribution considerations.

1. Efficiency Considerations

       Suppose that all individuals are alike so that we may consider a

single representative individual and drop the index h. (Alternatively,

we may assume that redistribution can be done via nondistortionary

means.)     Alleviating the constraint on foreign lending affects the

optimal size of government through two channels. First, increasing       B

generates an additional source of revenues for the government, thereby

allowing lower taxes on existing sources.       This tends to lower the

marginal cost of public funds (and raise the size of government).

Second, increasing B may adversely affect the internal terms of trade

(associated with      nontradable     factors   or goods) for government

expenditures. This effect can raise the marginal cost of public funds

(and lower the size of government). To highlight these two effects we

consider first in the next subsection the pure income effect.



a. Constant internal terms of trade

       Assume a linear production function, yielding constant real factor

prices:         ( r*) and         for   capital and labor, respectively. In
                                                 -14-




this case we can unambiguously show that N12 >                                0      and consequently,

that dG/dB > 0.

        The function N(B,G) is defined in this case by:



(19)         N(B,C) — Max
                                 v(q2,
                                                      I +   S))

                   s.t.: i[I -
                                         C1(q2,
                                                             I + S)       -
                                                                              B] +   'i L(q2,   I-4-S)


                         +     (I   -
                                        C1(q2,
                                                        I + S)        -
                                                                          B) +    (l+r*)B
                          -                           + S)    -   C   — 0.
                                C2(q2,


       Hence, by the envelope theorem, we obtain



(20)         N2(B,C) —    -)(B,G)          0,


where      A(B,G)        0          is the Lagrange multiplier associated with the

constraint in (19).

From (20):



(21)         N21(B,G) —       -A1(B,G).


       Similarly, equation (19) (using the envelope theorem) yields



(22)         N1(B,G) — .X(B,C) (r* -             r)     0.
                                            -15-




Therefore:



                                        -
(23)          N11(B,G) —   A1(B,G)(r*


       One can show (see Appendix A) that N(.,.) is concave. Hence, N11

< 0,   and it follows from (23) that                    <   0.     Thus,   (21) implies that

N21 >    0.      Therefore,      dG/dB >           0.            That is, the relaxation of

international capital controls, in the absence of adjustment in the

internal terms of trade, lowers the marginal cost of public funds and

increases the optimal size of government.

b. Variable internal terms of trade

       To analyze the effect of variable internal terms of trade on

government's expenditures in a simple manner, we assume that labor, the

nontradable factor of production,                   exhibits           diminishing   marginal

productivity and that government's expenditures are used entirely to

hire labor. Specifically, we continue to assume constant internal

intertemporal terms of trade, that is, r is constant (at the level

r). However, in the second period consumption can be provided in that

period (in addition to being transferred from the first period) by a

concave production function, f(L), using labor alone. The rent (pure

profit) generated by such a technology is assumed to be fully taxed by

the government. The government hires LG units of labor in the second

period at the prevailing wage,                     w —           f';   the government does not

purchase any quantity of the consumption good. We thus replace G                            by

Lc.
                                                     -16-




        In this case, the function N(B, LG) is defined by:



(19a)       N(3, L) — max              v(q2,
                                                            I + S)
                            (q2Pqs)
            s.t. :        r[I -
                                  C1(q2,
                                                     I + S)      -
                                                                     B) +   f[L(q2,   LL; I+S) -   L]
            +    I   -
                         C(q2,        I + S)          -   B +   (1 + r)B
             -                    I + S) — 0.
                 C2(q2,


        Following the same procedure as in the preceding subsection, we

conclude that



(21a)       N21(B, Lc) —          - 1(B,        LG)w
                                                   dw
                                           ..    )


        The first term in the expression for N21 is similar to (21).                                    As

before, it is straightforward to show that                                    < 0, so that this term

contributes toward making N21 positive, i.e., to increase the size of

government in response to alleviating controls on foreign lending (see

equation (17)). However, the second term will usually work in the

opposite direction:               the pure income effect of raising B tends to

increase the consuintion of leisure, thereby increasing the cost of labor

that the government hires. Thus, the optimal                                 LG (namely, the real

magnitude of government's consumption) may at the end decline in

response to a liberalization of the international capital market.
                                           -17-




2. Redistribution Considerations

       Now, let us return to the framework of sub-section (la) and

reintroduce the redistribution motive.

       To simplify the exposition, suppose that the economy consists of

two individuals (or two classes of individuals), denoted by indices                     A

and      B.     We further simplify the analysis by assuming a fixed labor

supply (and dropping it altogether from the model). Thus, we are left

only     with    intertemporal       decisions and tax-induced intertemporal

distortions. Still, to proceed further, we employ a log-linear utility

function, in order to keep the analysis tractable.

       To emphasize the equity issues, we consider the extreme case of a

max-mm social welfare criterion, that is, we assume for the social

welfare function in (13) that                     — 0       and       — 1 (where 'A <

The function N, the maximized value of the private component in the

social welfare function W, is defined in this case by:



(24) N(B,C)      Max(a log[cz(IA +
                 t,S
                                     S)] +        (la)log[(la)(I+S)(l-4i(lt))])
                 s.t.: (l+i[(IA +          B)(la)       -
                                                             2aS]
                      -
                          (l-a)(l + (lt))(IA +               TB
                                                                  + 2S)

                      +   (r* ) B C — 0,
                             -         -




where the log-linear individual utility function is given by
                                                  -18-




(25)       u(C1, C2)— alog C1 + (l-a)log C2.



       Employing the constraint to eliminate S, we can reduce (24) to:



                                             + t(1a)(IB -
(26) N(B,G) —   Max(log[2I(l+r)
                     +     (r     -
                                       r)B    -
                                                  C]

                      -
                           log[l      + r(l -          (l-a)t)]
                     + (1-a)log[l+r(1-t)J + constant)

                     — Max H(t,B,C).
                            t

       The first-order condition for t is



(27)         H1(t, B, G) —      0,


while the second-order condition is



(28)         H11(t, B, C)       0.



       By the envelope theorem:



             N1(B,C) —    H2(t,       B, C)



and hence:
                                         -19-




(29)       N12 — H21         + H23.


       Total differentiation of (27) with respect to B yields:


                     H
           dt         13
                      11



       Hence, from (29) and (30) we obtain the expression for N12 as

follows.



                 H12H13 - H23H11

                              11



       Since H11< 0 (by 28), it follows that



(32)       Sign(N12) — Sign(H12 H13 - H23 H11).



       Using the definition of H (namely, equation (26)) to find the

partial derivatives                   we substitute these derivatives into (32).

This substitution yields



(33)
           Sign(H12 H13 - H23 H11) —        Sign{
                                                    [l+r(l-t)]
                                                                 2
                                                                     -


                                                                         [1+r(1-(l-a)t)]
                                                                                           2

(see Appendix B).

       Since 0 < 1    -   a < 1, it follows that (33) is positive and hence
dG/dB >
VI. Tax      Structure   and Redistribution in an Open Economy

       In this section we examine the effects of relaxing some of the

controls on international capital flows on the structure of taxation and

the size of redistribution.          We continue to adopt the simplified

framework of subsection V.2. Assume further that public component in

the utility function mG is equal to Slog C.              In this case, the

optimal policy is the solution to the following problem:



(34)           Max (H(t, B, C) + SlogG},
              (t,G)



where H(.) is defined in (26).

       As before,         B   is a parameter and we consider the relationships

between this parameter and the optimal values of t and C (denoted by

t(B) and C(B), respectively). In doing so, we find also the effect of

changing B on t' and S, as will be shown later.

       The   first-order   conditions are:



(35)          H1(t, B, C) —   0,


(36)          H3(t, B, C) + — 0.



       Total differentiation of (35)-(36) with respect to B yields:
                                             -21-




              —
(37)              (-H12H33 + H13H23 + H126/G2),


where A is positive by the second-order conditions for the solution to

(34)6 In Appendix B we show that



(38)                                     0
            -H12 H33 + H13 H23 —
and

(39)       H12 < 0.



       Hence, dt/dB < 0.

       Thus, relaxing the controls on investments abroad reduces the

optimal rate of tax on income from domestic investment.                 This is a
natural result in view of the fact that relaxing the controls improves

welfare. Since t' —
                            *
                           [r   -
                                    (1   -
                                             t)rl/r* it
                                               -
                                                    ,     follows that t'   should

be lowered too.         That is, the optimal response to relaxing the
restrictions on investments abroad is to lower the tax on income from

such investments.

       To find dS/dB, recall that the constraint in (24) was employed in

order to solve for S in terms of t, B and C:


                                             *-
                  rt(l-Q)(IA+IB) + (r -r)B - C
(40)        S—
                    2(l+r[l-(l-cx)t])
                                            -22-




       We have already concluded that an increase in B raises                G         and

lowers t.        These changes have conflicting effects on S, as can be seen

from (40). We employed numerical calculations to demonstrate the effect

of raising          B      on the optimal S. These calculations suggest that

raising B increases the size of the deinogrant S. Again, this result

is natural in view of the fact that relaxing the restrictions on

international capital flows improves the efficiency of total investment,

thereby enabling the economy to devote more resources for redistribution

of income.

       The results of the numerical calculations are given in Table 1.

             Optimal Supply of the Public Good (C), on the Tax

VII. Capital Mobility and International Tax Coordination

     Capital market integration between two large countries brings out

the issue of tax coordination between them.          When residents of one
country     invest in the other country, one must reckon with the

possibility of tax arbitrage that may undermine the feasibility of

integration.         It is quite obvious that some coordination between

countries may in general improve the welfare of both countries. In the

case of tax coordination, however, we show that coordination is

essential for a sensible world equilibrium (with nonzero interest rates)

to at all exit.

     To highlight this issue, consider a two-country world with perfect

capital mobility. Denote the interest rates in the home country and the
                               *
foreign country by r and r , respectively. In principle, the home
country may have three different tax rates applying to interest income:

(1) t - the         tax rate levied on domestic residents on their

                domestic-source income;

(ii) tRF - the tax rate levied on domestic resident on their foreign-

                source income

(iii)tN,    -    the tax rate levied on non-residents on their interest

                 income in the home country.

The foreign country may correspondingly have three tax rates which we

denote by                   and tNRD. Furthermore, let us assume that these

rates apply symmetrically for both interest earned and interest paid

(i.e., full deductibility of interest expenses, including tax rebates).
                                              -24-




       A complete integration of the capital markets between the two

countries (including the possibility of borrowing in one country in

order to invest in the other country) requires, due to arbitrage

possiblities, the fulfillment of the following conditions:



(41)       r(l -     t) — r*(l           tNRD) (1 - tRF)

and

(42)       r(l -
                     tNRD)

The first condition applies to the residents of the home country and it

requires that they be indifferent between investing at home or abroad.

Otherwise, they can borrow an infinite amount in the low (net of tax)

interest rate country in order to invest an infinite amount in the high

(net of tax) interest rate country.                      The second condition similarly

applies to the residents of the foreign country.

                                                                                               tRF),


the only solution to the linear system of equations (41)-(42) is a zero

rate of interest in each country:



            r — r*    —   0.
                                             -25-




Thus, some international tax coordination is needed in order to satisfy

(43)   and yield a sensible world equilibrium.
       Somewhat    surprisingly, the two most common polar schemes of

source-based or origin-based taxation are examples of workable tax

coordinations (although, by no means globally efficient arrangements)

even when the two countries do not adopt the same scheme.             Consider

first the case in which both countries adopt the source-based tax

scheme.     In this case income is taxed according to its source,

regardless of the origin of the taxpayer. This implies that



(44)        t     —
                      tNRD,    tRD
                                      —
                                          tNRD tRF — tRF
                                                           —




so     that (43) is satisfied and we can have a world equilibrium with

positive rates of interest.

       Similarly, consid              the case where both countries adopt the

origin-based tax scheme: income is taxed according to the origin of the

taxpayer, regardless of its source. This Implies that


                              *         *            *
(45)        t     —
                      tP,.r   tRD —    tRF    tNRD — tNRD   —




so that, again, (43) is satisfied.

       Next, consider the case in which one country adopts one tax scheme

while the other adopts another one. Suppose, for instance, that the

home country adopts the origin-based tax scheme, while the foreign
                                               -26-




county adopts the source-based tax scheme. In this case we have



                 —                     — 0,
           tRD       tRFI       tNRD

(46)
            *
               —
                  *     *
           tRD   tNR1P tRF — 01



and, again, (43) is satisfied.

       However, if the two countries do not stick to one or the other of

the two polar schemes, then (43) need not hold in and no sensible world

equilibrium exists. Suppose, for instance, that each country levies the

same tax rate on its residents (irrespective of the source of their

income) and also all non-residents investing in that country. In this

case, we have



(47)        t    —
                     tRF
                            —
                                tjjl        tD — tRF   —
                                                           tNRD•



Hence, unless (l-t) (1                  -
                                              tw)     —
                                                           1,      which is just a sheer

coincidence, condition (43) is violated.

       Thus, some tax coordination is essential for a full capital market

integration. Any mutually beneficial tax coordination must satisfy the

tax arbitrage condition (43).

VIII. Conclusion

    We     analyzed   in this paper the policy implications of the

integration of the international capital markets. Special attention was

paid to the effects on the marginal cost of public funds, a crucial

factor in the determination of the optimal size of government and the

magnitude of income redistribution. Inherent in the determination of

the cost of public funds is the design of the structure of taxation (on

labor income, domestic-source capital income and foreign-source capital

income).

     In the context of a world economy with integrated capital markets,

there arises the issue of international tax coordination.    This issue

has two aspects.      First, the elementary problem of what international

tax arrangements are at all viable in the wake of capital market

arbitrage possiblities.      This issue was dealt with in this paper. A

second, yet to be investigated, aspect is the determination of mutually

beneficial international tax arrangements from the set of viable

arrangements.

                                          APPENDIX A



       In this appendix we prove that N(B, C) is concave.                                  Recall that

N(B, C) is defined by (19). Since there is only one individual and a

lump-sum tax/subsidy is allowed, it follows that the government can

choose any bundle (C1, C2, L) which is feasible (i.e., which satisfies

the resource constraint in (19)). Thus, N may be equivalently defined

by



(Al)         N(B, C) —   Max
                                  u(C1, C2, L)
                       C1, C2

                          s.t.: (I -             C1
                                                       -
                                                            B) + wL +   I   -
                                                                                C1
                                  +   r   B -
                                                 C2
                                                       -    C   0.

       We have to show that



             N(aB' +   (1-a)B",    aG' +        (1-a)G")
               aN(B', C') +     (l-a)N(B",            C")



for all (B', C'), (B", C") and 0 a                              1.

       Suppose the bundle. (C1, C, L) is a solution to (Al) for (B,C) —

(B',   G') and the bundle (CI.. C;1 L) is a solution to (Al) for (B, C)

—    (B",    C"), namely: N(B , C          )    — u(C1, C2, L )             and      N(B    G )   — u(C1,

       L).

       By being solutions to optimum problems, the bundles (C1, C2, L)

and (C;i C, L) satisfy the constraint in (Al), namely:
                                                    -29-

                   V                —V                     *   '        I           I

                                                                       C2
                                                                            - G         >0
and
           —                        —
                                                "          *   "        "
           r(I-C1-B ) + wL" + I-C1 + r B - C2                                   C       0.
                                                                            -
(A3)



       Hence, upon multiplying (A2)                            by the factor a and (A3) by the

factor (1-a) and adding them together, it follows that:

(A4)       i(I -                + (l-a)C1] - jaB               + (l-a)B])
                       [aC1
           + w[aL+ (l-a)L] + I - [aC1 + (l-a)c1)

           + r jaB + (l-a)B ]                - [aC2        + (l-a)C21

           -jaG + (l-a)G ]                 0.



       Thus, the bundle (aC1 +(l-a)C1,                                  + (1-a)C, aL + (l-a)L)
is feasible for (B, C) — (aB                    + (l-a)B , aG               + (l-a)G ).      Therefore:


(A5)       N(aB + (l-a)B, aG + (l-a)G)

           u(aC1 + (l-a)C1, aC; + (l-a)C2, aL + (l-a)L)

               au(C,C, L') + (la)u(c;, ;,                              L)
           — aN(B       ,   C   )   +   (l-a)N(B , C ),




where    the first inequality in (AS) follows from the definition of

N(,•) as the value of the maximand in (Al). and the second inequality

follows from the concavity of u.                                   This completes the proof of the

concavity of N.

       In   this appendix we verify the expressions of (33) and (38)-(3t').

       The function H (see (26)) is given by:

                               FOOTNOTES

    In a recent paper Micossi (1988) provides a succint survey of the

    proposed institutional arrangements for     the   1992      Europoean

    integration. He writes:
    "The European integration entails the elimination of restrictions
    and discriminatory regulations    and   administrative   practices
    concerning:   (i)   the right of establishment  and acquisition of
    participations by foreign institutions in domestic      financial
    markets;      (ii)   permitted operations of foreign-controlled
    financial institutions;    (iii) cross-border   transactions   in
    financial services.    The first two items basically involve the
    freedom to supply services in EC national markets, the third, the
    freedom to move capital throughout the Community."

    For   an earlier discussion of the interaction among taxes,

    government consumption, and international capital flow, see Razin

    and Svensson (1983).

    To ensure diminishing marginal rates of substitution between

    private and public commodities we assume, as usual, that uh       and

    mh are strictly concave.

    An equivalent policy to taxing away the infra-marginal profits
    (resulting from the net interest differential) is to auction off

    the quotas on investment abroad.
