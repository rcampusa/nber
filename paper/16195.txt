                                             ABSTRACT

With the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1994, Mexico entered
a bilateral free trade agreement which not only lowered its own tariffs on imports but also lowered
tariffs on its exports to the U.S. We find that women’s relative wage increased, particularly during
the period of liberalization. Both between and within-industry shifts also favored female workers.
With regards to between-industry shifts, tariff reductions expanded sectors which were initially female
intensive. With regards to within-industry shifts, we find a positive association between reductions
in export tariffs (U.S. tariffs on Mexican goods) and hiring of women in skilled blue-collar occupations.
 Finally, we find suggestive evidence that household bargaining power shifted in favor of women.
 Expenditures shifted from goods associated with male preference, such as men’s clothing and tobacco
and alcohol, to those associated with female preference such as women’s clothing and education.

I. Introduction


         Gender equality, along with ending hunger and poverty, is one of the eight stated goals in

the U.N. Millennium Development Goals Report (UN, 2009). Given that many developing

countries have adopted trade reforms, an important question is whether trade liberalization

policies will further or hinder the goal of gender equality. Furthermore, equity concerns aside,

the effect of liberalization policies on gender outcomes may be of interest from the point of view

of economic growth since there is now growing evidence that empowering women promotes

education and better children’s outcomes (Thomas (1990), Duflo (2000), Qian (2008)). Quoting

from a recent paper by Duflo (2011), “empowerment [of women] can, in other words, accelerate

development.”

         In this paper we examine the impact of tariff reductions associated with the signing of the

North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) on gender outcomes in Mexico. Relative to

the existing literature, our paper makes the following contributions. While most papers focus on

the gender wage gap, our paper also examines employment as well as wage changes.2 Using the

labor demand approach taken to study U.S. wage inequality (Katz and Murphy (1992), Berman,

Bound, and Griliches (1994)), we decompose the overall increase in female employment and

wage bill shares into “between” and “within” industry components, and link these changes to



2
  Papers which examine the gender wage gap include Brown, Pagan, and Rodriguez-Oreggia (1999) which
decomposes the gap into the component due to differences in characteristics between men and women and the
component due to discrimination. Pagan and Ullibarri (2000) find that the gender gap is larger for older workers,
larger in smaller firms, large in the informal sector, and larger at the border. Sanchez and Pagan (2001) find a large
earnings gap between female and male-owned micro-enterprises which is partly explained by lower levels of
education and experience of female owners although surprisingly, not much is explained by differences in sectoral
composition of female and male-owned businesses. Oostendorp (2004) presents cross-country analysis relating the
gender gap to measures of trade and FDI. The paper finds that trade and FDI inflows reduce the gender gap among
low skilled occupations while results are mixed for high skilled occupations. A recent volume, Bussolo and De
Hoyos (2009) also examine the link between trade liberalization and poverty through the channel of women’s labor
market outcomes.


                                                           2
tariff changes across sectors. Finally, ours is the first paper we are aware of that examines

household expenditure patterns to assess changes in women’s well-being as well as income.

         What are some possible theoretical links between trade liberalization policies and gender

outcomes? If men and women are imperfect substitutes in production, the labor demand

framework that has been used for skill demand can be applied to discuss and quantify relative

demand for female workers.3 In this framework, industries utilize male and female workers in

different intensities, and trade liberalization, by affecting the relative size of industries, will

generate demand shifts by gender. For this to be an important channel, we should observe

substantial labor re-allocation towards those sectors which are female-intensive.4

         Another channel through which trade liberalization policies can affect gender outcomes is

through technology. In an effort to explain rising wag inequality within industries as result of

trade liberalization, recent theoretical papers in trade have built models with product

differentiation, increasing returns, and heterogeneity across firms (Melitz (2003), Yeaple

(2005)). In these models, tariff reductions encourage the more productive firms to enter the

export sector. Verhoogen (2008) and Bustos (2011) show that these exporting firms also

upgrade quality and technology, thereby increasing the demand for skilled workers. While most

of the focus in the literature has been on the impact of technology on skill demand, technology

upgrading may also complement female workers by being complementary with cognitive skills

and reducing the demand for physical skills.5 Juhn, Ujhelyi and Villegas-Sanchez (2012)


3
  See for example, Katz and Murphy (1992), Bound and Johnson (1992), Berman, Bound, and Griliches (1994).
This framework is adopted by Acemoglu, Autor, and Lyle (2004) who examine the impact of WWII mobilization
rates on female labor supply and consequently on their relative wage. Their estimates of the elasticity of substitution
between men and women suggest that “men and women are close but far from perfect substitutes.”
4
  Alternatively, one may assume that men and women are perfect substitutes in production but women have lower
levels of skill. This is the assumption, for example, in Bussolo and De Hoyos (2009) ). There is little evidence,
however, that trade liberalization raised relative wages and employment of less skilled workers.
5
  Galor and Weil (1996) and Welch (2000) explore the notion that women have advantage in cognitive vs. physical
skills and that advances in technology increase the relative demand for women over time. Using U.S. data,


                                                          3
consider a model where men and women differ in terms of their capacity to perform physically

demanding tasks. In their model, the introduction of new technology lowers the need for

physical skills thereby benefitting women. They find that firms which upgraded technology also

shifted towards hiring more female workers in blue-collar jobs, but not white-collar jobs. To the

extent that exports and technology upgrading is an important channel, we should observe shifts

towards female labor within sectors, and this type of activity should be concentrated in sectors

with larger export tariff reductions.

        A third channel is through the reduction of discrimination brought about by foreign

competition. Building on the insight of Becker (1957), Black and Brainerd (2002) report that

U.S. industries which were subject to more competition through trade experienced greater

reductions in the gender wage gap.6 A recent paper by Ederington, Minier, and Troske (2010)

find that trade liberalization in Colombia increased employment of women relative to men in

blue-collar occupations—a change the authors attribute to increased product market competition

and reductions in employer discrimination. This channel suggests that we should observe a

systematic relationship between reductions in import tariffs and female wages and hiring. We

examine each of these channels in our empirical work.

        To summarize our findings, we find that trade liberalization policies improved women’s

labor market outcomes in Mexico. First, relative wages of women increased even as employment

rates increased, and this pattern is particularly pronounced during the trade liberalization period,

1990 to 2000. In contrast to studies conducted in the U.S. (Berman, Bound and Griliches (1994))

and Mexico in an earlier period (Revenga (1997), Hanson and Harrison (1999)), we find

Weinberg (2000) shows that female employment growth is positively related to computer-use across industries and
occupations. Also using U.S. data and Dictionary of Occupation Titles (DOT) Rendall (2010) shows that
occupations which are more “brain” intensive have expanded over time, favoring female workers.
6
  Artecona and Cunningham (2002) employ the same methods for Mexico but do not find a significant relationship
between tariff changes and reductions in the gender wage gap across industries .


                                                       4
evidence of substantial labor reallocation across industries, shifting employment towards initially

female-intensive sectors. Between-industry shifts, usually thought to be consistent with trade-

based explanations, account for up to 40 percent of the increase in wage bill share of women

from 1990 to 2000. Comparing across industries, we find that tariff reductions were positively

related to industry growth and concentrated in initially female-intensive industries. We also find

evidence that within-industry shifts favored women. Using establishment-level data for the

manufacturing sector we find that larger declines in export tariffs (U.S. tariffs on Mexican

goods) are associated with larger increases in wage bill shares of women in skilled blue-collar

occupations. This result suggests that the exports and technology channel emphasized in the

recent trade literature may be important for explaining gender outcomes as well as skill

premiums. We find a much weaker relationship between reductions in import tariffs and female

wage bill shares, however, suggesting that reductions in discrimination brought about by trade

liberalization played a relatively minor role in the Mexican case.

       Women’s relative earnings increased but are they necessarily better off? We end with

suggestive evidence that women’s bargaining power within the household improved along with

their relative earnings. Household expenditures shifted from goods associated with male

preference, such as men’s clothing and tobacco and alcohol, to those associated with female

preference such as education and women’s clothing.

       This paper is organized as follows. Section II briefly describes the trade liberalization

policies behind the signing of NAFTA. Section III examines aggregate changes in relative

wages and employment of women. Section IV examines between and within industry shifts and

their associations with tariff changes. Section V reports the results on household expenditure

patterns. Section VI concludes.

II. Mexico’s Trade Liberalization under NAFTA



        Mexico implemented unilateral tariff reductions in the 1980s to join the GATT in 1986.

By 1987, the highest tariff was reduced to 20% and the tariff structure was simplified to include

only 5 different rates: 0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%. Starting in 1990, Mexico’s opening strategy

switched to pursuing bilateral free trade agreements, with the most important being the North

American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with U.S. and Canada which took effect in 1994.

NAFTA reduced tariff rates with the U.S. from a maximum of 20% to zero in 15 years and many

of the reductions to zero took immediate effect (Zabludovsky, 2005). Figure 1 shows trends in

effective tariff rates separately for U.S. and other non-NAFTA countries. Table 1 reports tariff

changes by industry. Columns (1) and (2) show Mexican import tariffs in 1993 before NAFTA

as well as the change in tariffs from 1993-2000. Columns (3) and (4) report U.S. tariff levels in

1993 and the change from 1993-2000.7 The table illustrates the bilateral nature of the agreement

where reductions in Mexican tariffs were accompanied by corresponding reduction in U.S.

tariffs. “Textiles” and “Clothing” are especially notable in that NAFTA abolished relatively high

tariffs in these industries on both sides of the border.8 Since more than 80% of the trade occurs

with the U.S., the decline in effective tariffs resulted in dramatic increases in trade flows. Figure

2 shows the trends in exports and imports as fractions of GDP. The figure shows that while the

unilateral tariff reductions had some impact in the 1980s, trade flows accelerated in the 1990s.

  The Mexican tariff data are from the volume published by Ministry of the Economy (formerly SeCOFI),
Fracciones Arancelarias y Plazos de Desgravacion, Tratado de Libre Comericio de America del Norte (1994). The
U.S. tariff data are from John Romalis, as described in Feenstra, Romalis, and Schott (2002). For both Mexican and
U.S tariffs, we begin with 8-digit harmonized tariff system categories and aggregate up to 3-digit SCIAN97
(NAICS) categories using initial import and export shares. Details of the construction of the tariff data are in the
data appendix.

  The correlation of Mexican and U.S. tariffs changes reported in the table is approximately 0.3.


                                                         6
Interestingly, trade flows appear to have stagnated again in the 2000s mostly likely due to a

recession in the U.S. and China’s entry into the WTO.




III. Changes in Women’s Relative Wage and Employment before and after NAFTA


A. Women’s Relative Wage


        Figure 3 documents changes in relative wage of women during the period 1984-2004.

We use multiple rounds of a representative household survey, Household Income and

Expenditure Surveys (ENIGH) and the 10% samples of the Mexican Population Census of 1990

and 2000 available from the Census IPUMS. Our wage sample consists of men and women who

are 15-64 years old, who reported working full-time (30 hours or more), and who either did not

have self-employment earnings or reported that they were not self-employed. Additionally, since

we are calculating means in figure 3, we are wary of outlier observations and proceed by deleting

the top and bottom 1 percent of observations by gender.9 Details of the data construction and

sample selection statements are in the data appendix.

        Figure 3a graphs the mean female-male wage ratio. Using multiple rounds of the ENIGH

household survey, we estimate annual rates of change in the female-male wage ratio for three

separate periods, 1984-1989, 1989-2000, 2000-2004, by regressing the female-male wage ratio

on a linear spline with break points in 1989 and 2000. In figure 3a, we graph the predicted value

as well as the actual female-male mean wage. We estimate an annual rate of decline of 1.1

percentage points in 1984-89, an increase of .4 percentage points annually during 1989-2000,

and a decline of .5 percentage points annually during 2000-2004. All but the last estimate is

9
 We experimented with various alternative cutoffs and other measures such as medians and log wage differences
and found similar trends in relative wages.


                                                       7
statistically significant.10 The Census data indicate that female-male wage ratio increased

approximately 2.7 percentage points from 1990 to 2000. Note that figure 2 showed accelerated

increase in trade flows during 1990-2000 in comparison to either before or after. Similarly, in

figure 3a, we estimate a rising trend in the female-male wage ratio during the 1990-2000 period,

and declining trends in periods before and after.

        One concern is that women’s education levels may have increased relative to men and

this may be driving the above changes in relative wages. Figure 3b addresses this issue by

calculating mean wage ratios holding the composition of workers fixed across age and education

categories.11 Figure 3b illustrates that correcting for compositional changes makes little

difference. In figure 3c we examine whether deleting self-employed workers substantially biases

our results. We include self-employed workers in figure 3c and find similar trends. Finally, in

figure 3d we examine the most inclusive sample by including self-employed workers and part-

time workers. We report hourly wages by dividing weekly wage by hours worked per week. We

find that women are paid slightly better than men on an hourly basis (the ratio is often greater

than 1) and moreover, both in the ENIGH and the Census, hourly wages of women increased

relative to wages of men during the 1990s. This suggests that we may be slightly understating

wage gains of women by focusing on full-time wage and salary workers. The basic message we

take away from figure 3 is that women’s relative wage increased slightly and certainly did not

decrease during the period of trade liberalization, 1990 to 2000.



B. Employment and Female Share of the Labor Force


10
   We define our regressors as s1=min(year-1984,5), s2=max(0,min(year-1989,11)), and s3= max(0,year-2000) and
graph the predicted values from the regression.
11
   In order to hold composition across education and age constant, we first calculated average wages by single-year
age and education categories and aggregated over these groups using a fixed distribution across all years.


                                                         8
        We next examine changes in employment to population ratios of women and men as well

as changes in the female share of the labor force. Table 2 reports the employment to population

ratios of women (top panel) and men (bottom panel) who are 15-64 years old. Employment rates

(especially of women) are much lower in Mexico than the rates observed in developed countries.

For example, the ratio for comparable women in the U.S. during this period would be .60 and

higher, while in Mexico the rate is still only .44 in 2004. Employment rates did rise rapidly for

women, however, over the entire period, while employment of men increased much more

modestly. Over the 1990s, the employment-population ratio of women increased 12.3

percentage points (ENIGH) and 13.4 percentage points (Census) in the two surveys.

        Table 3 describes the changes in female share of the labor force. Top panel reports

shares based on the ENIGH while the bottom panel refers to data from the Census. Panel A

reports female share of total hours worked. Panel B reports labor shares in efficiency units.12

Focusing on the Census-based results in the bottom panel, the table shows that both measures of

female labor share increased by approximately 5 percentage points with the change in hours

shares being slightly larger.

        The decline in the female/male wage ratio from 1984 to 1989 is consistent with the

increase in the relative supply of women where rapid entry of women led to a decline in own

wage. Over the period, 1989-2000, relative wage of women increased even as their labor share

increased. Taken together, the evidence on the gender wage gap and relative supplies suggest

that relative demand for women must have increased. In the special case of Cobb-Douglas

production where the elasticity of substitution between male and female labor equals one, we

can interpret changes in female wage bill share as an increase in relative demand for female labor


12
  To calculate shares in efficiency units, we weight hours by the group specific average wage which is fixed over
years. In addition to men and women, we define 10 five-year age groups and 5 education groups.


                                                         9
(see Autor and Katz (1999)). Wage bill shares are reported in Panel C and the table shows that

wage bill shares of women also increased by approximately 5 percentage points.13 The evidence

on the last period, 2000-2004, is mixed. On the one hand, relative wage declined. Table 3

shows, however, that women’s labor share increased most rapidly over this period and taken

together, wage bill share also increased. Interestingly, the increase in wage bill share since the

year 2000 was entirely due to educated women, those with at least 12 years of schooling. Wage

bill shares of women with less than 12 years of schooling actually declined 2000-2004.



IV. Women’s Labor Market Outcomes and Trade Liberalization



A. Between-Industry Shifts in Female Wage Bill Share

         Table 4 reports labor shares across broad industry classes using Census data. The most

significant change reported in the table is the declining share of agricultural employment

throughout the period. Agriculture’s share fell from 12.5 percent in 1990 to 7.7 percent in 2000.

As indicated in column (3) female labor share in agriculture in 1990 was only 2.9 percent. Since

predominantly men work in agriculture in Mexico, we would expect this to negatively impact

men relative to women. Somewhat surprisingly, the manufacturing sector also decreased

modestly. Instead, several services sectors registered large growth, such as professional services,

education, hotel and restaurants, and other services.

13
  In calculating wage bill shares, we also allow group specific wages to vary by year . More specifically, we define
10 five-year age groups and 5 education groups. We use our wage sample to calculate average wage of group j in
                                              Wageinc          it

          Table 5 disaggregates the manufacturing sector further and shows that while

manufacturing employment was flat overall, there have been winners and losers within

manufacturing. Female-intensive sectors (based on initial female share in 1990) such as

“clothing” and “computers and electronics” grew while predominantly male-intensive sectors

such as “petroleum and coal products,” “chemicals” and “primary metal” declined.

“Transportation equipment” which includes car assembly, on the other hand, grew over this

period.

          One method of summarizing these changes is to calculate within and between-industry

changes in employment and wage bill shares of female workers. Between-industry changes in

women’s wage bill share would be consistent with trade based explanations. For example, tariff

reductions associated with NAFTA may have increased the relative size of textiles and clothing

sectors which more intensively utilizes female labor. These types of changes would be captured

by between-industry shifts and we view gauging the importance of between-industry shifts as the

first step towards assessing the role of trade liberalization policies.

          We decompose the change in the female share into two components according to the

following formula:

                           Eitf1      E          Eitf     Eit
Female _ sharet                  *   it     
                                                            *             (1)
                       i   Eit 1      Et      i  Eit      Et

            Eitf1                                          E
The term           is the share of women in industry i and  it is total employment growth of
            Eit 1                                          Et

industry i. The first term corresponds to the “between” component and captures the extent to

which growth in female share was due to differential growth across industries. The second term

reflects within-industry changes in female share. We use 69 industry classifications which we

can consistently match across the 1990 and 2000 Census.


                                                        11
        The top panel of table 6 reports changes in employment shares (in efficiency units) as

well as changes in wage bill shares for all sectors. We distinguish 4 different groups, less

educated (<12 years of schooling) males and females, and more educated (>=12 years of

schooling) males and females. We also report all women’s wage bill share in the last row. The

table shows that the wage bill share of women increased 5.3 percentage points overall between

1990 and 2000. Between-industry shifts account for 40 percent (2.1/5.25) of the total change.

Between-industry shifts account for a smaller (32 percent) but still substantial share of the

change in employment share suggesting that employment shifts across industries were important.

        The middle and bottom panels of table 3 show similar results for the 29 industries in the

tradeables sector (including agriculture) and for 21 industries in the manufacturing sector. Taken

together, approximately between one-third and up to 40 percent of the rise in female wage bill

share can be attributed to between-industry shifts. These results stand in sharp contrast to

Attanasio, Goldberg, and Pavcnik (2004) who find stable employment patterns across industries

in Colombia and also Revenga (1997) and Hanson and Harrison (1999) who examine an earlier

period in Mexico. These authors conclude that trade liberalization impacted industry wage

premiums rather than reallocated labor across sectors. Our finding here is that labor reallocation

is an important part of the story in Mexico during the 1990s. It is also important to keep in mind

that the lack of detail in our industry categories is likely to under-estimate the true shift in

employment across industries thus giving us a lower bound of the importance of between-

industry shifts.

        Can these between-industry shifts be linked to trade liberalization policies? Note that the

“between industry” shift consists of the following expression from equation (1):

to the change in industry level tariff rates from 1993-2000 for the 29 industries in the tradeables

sector.14 As illustrated in figure 4, larger tariff reductions are positively related to industry

growth.15 It is interesting to note that this is contrary to the predictions of the standard

Heckscher-Ohlin (HO) trade model, which would predict contraction among sectors that

experienced a decline in their output price (due to tariff reductions). We find that tariff

reductions from 1993-2000 are positively related to industry growth. Although it is not clear

why Mexico would have protected industries in which it has a comparative advantage, the

coincident reduction in tariffs by the U.S. likely had a large effect especially in the most

impacted industries such as textiles and clothing. In addition, recent papers have pointed out

that trade liberalization not only reduces output prices but also the prices of imported

intermediate products. Tariff reductions could lead to the expansion of domestic firms by

reducing cost of existing imports as well as by allowing firms to increase scope and expand to

14
   These are the industries for which we are able to match both across Census years and also to the tariff data using
the Sistema de Clasificacion Industrial de America del Norte 1997 (SCIAN97). We do not utilize establishment
level data from the ENESTyC in this section for two reasons. First, the ENESTyC includes only manufacturing
firms and we would lose the agricultural sector. Second, the ENESTyC oversampled small firms in 2000 but we do
not have clear details of the oversampling. Since our objective in this section is to get a representative overview of
the tradeables sector, we rely on household data instead.
15
   Figure 4 also shows that the agricultural sector is an outlier which may be due to the fact that tariff changes in
agriculture were slowly implemented with the last of the reductions scheduled to go into effect in 2008. In
preparation, however, the government implemented land reforms and began to dismantle price supports and
subsidies which resulted in a steep decline in agricultural employment well before the tariff reductions. Running the
regression without agriculture results in a coefficient equal to -.001 with t-stat of -1.86.

new product varieties (Amiti and Konings (2007) and Goldberg, Khandelwal, Pavcnik, and

Topalova (2010)).

        The next question is whether tariff changes were concentrated in initially female-

intensive industries. In figure 5, we graph initial female share in the industry in 1990 against

tariff changes. The figure shows that the largest declines in tariffs were concentrated in initially

female-intensive industries, with “clothing” playing an important role in terms of both female

share and tariff declines.16



B. Within-Industry Shifts in Female Wage Bill Share

        While table 6 showed that up to 40 percent of the increase in female wage bill share was

due to between-industry shifts, the table also showed that majority of the increase occurred

within industries. In this section we examine what may account for the rise in female wage bill

share within industries. To examine this question, we use establishment level data, Encuesta

Nacional de Empleo, Salarios, Tecnologia y Capacion (ENESTyC). ENESTyC is a survey of

establishments in the manufacturing sector and was carried out in 1992, 1998, and 2001. We use

the 1992 and 2001 samples in our analysis which refer to the years 1991 and 2000.17 Table 7

provides a summary of the main variables. Particularly notable is the increase in the number of

exporting firms from 43 percent in 1991 to 55 percent 2000.

        To investigate the link between within-industry shifts in female wage bill share and trade

liberalization policies, we consider the following regression at the establishment level:

16
   The relationship is still negative although somewhat weaker without the “clothing” industry. If we exclude
“clothing,” the regression coefficient is reduced to -.007 with t-stat of -1.79.
17
   We drop micro establishments (those with 15 employees or less) from the analysis since micro establishments
were oversampled in 2001 but we do not have clear details of the oversampling. We would like to thank INEGI
officials for granting on-site access to the establishment level data used in this study under the commitment of
complying with the confidentiality requirements set by the Mexican Laws and in particular, to Maria Luisa Meza
Leon, Lizi Ivette Gonzalez Jimenez and Gabriel Romero Velasco.



                                                        14
Female _ Share jit    T 1Tariffit   X X jit  t  i   jit                                 (2)



where Female _ Share jit represents the female wage bill share in establishment j in industry i in

year t, Tariffit refers to industry tariff levels in 1991 and 2000, Xjit refer to various establishment-

level controls, and ηt and λi refer to year and industry fixed effects. While all tariffs are

expected to be eventually reduced to zero under NAFTA, not all industry tariffs had been

reduced to zero by 2000, and one concern is that the actual timing of the changes may be

endogenous and subject to more political pressures and contemporaneous industry performance.

We therefore use initial tariff levels in 1991 interacted with 2000 year dummy as our main

regressor. We estimate the following equation:



Female _ Share jit    T 1 Init _ Tariffi * 2000 _ Dummy   X X jit  t  i   jit            (3)



In the above specification the coefficient βT1 compares female wage bill shares in 2000 across

industries with different initial tariff levels, controlling for industry fixed effects, λi. Since

industries with higher initial tariff levels experienced larger declines, we expect the sign of βT1 to

be positive. Unlike the previous sections where we were limited to 3-digit industry

classifications, we have more detailed industry information, 6-digit level of the Mexican

Classification of Activities and Products system (CMAP), available in the establishment level




                                                      15
data. Tariff data, both Mexican tariffs on imports (import tariffs), as well U.S. tariffs on

Mexican exports (export tariffs), were merged at the CMAP level.18

         Table 8 reports the results from estimating equation (3). The top panel refers to export

tariffs while the bottom panel refers to import tariffs. Column (1) reports the results for overall

female wage bill share, while columns (2)-(5) examine various subcategories such as white-

collar (column 2), blue-collar (column 3), “specialized blue-collar” (column 4), and “general

blue-collar” (column 5). While the coefficients are generally positive, indicating that larger

declines in export tariffs lead to greater increase in female wage bill share, most of the

coefficients are not significant at the 5 percent level. The one exception is female wage bill

share in “specialized blue-collar” category, the skilled blue-collar occupations.19

         What is the channel which links reductions in export tariffs to increases in female wage

bill share? Recent papers have emphasized productivity differences between exporting and non-

exporting firms (Bernard and Jensen (1999), Verhoogen (2008), and Bustos (2011)). In

particular, Bustos (2011) shows that in the aftermath of the regional free trade agreement

between Argentina and Brazil, the MERCOSUR, the number of exporting firms increased. In a

paper that builds on a model of firm heterogeneity and worker heterogeneity along gender and

skill dimensions, Juhn, Ujhelyi and Villegas-Sanchez (2012) find that reductions in export tariffs

increased the number of exporting firms and these firms adopted technology which appears to be
18
   We thank Leonardo Iacovone for providing us with the tariff data. Tariff data were available originally at the 8-
digit Harmonized System (HS) classification and was matched to the Mexican CMAP class classification as
explained in Iacovone and Javorcik (2010).
19
   Since maquiladoras were not subject to import duties or tariffs even before the trade liberalization, it is not clear
how tariff reductions would impact this type of activity. For this reason, we exclude maquiladoras and firms who
earned more than 50% of their income from maquiladora activity from our analysis. Additionally we include in our
sample those firms who are in size categories 1 and 2 (greater or equal to 100 employees) and hire at least one
female employee. The size restriction is due to the fact that the ENESTyC oversampled small firms in 2000 but we
were unable to obtain clear details regarding sampling weights. Restricting the sample to larger firms ensures
comparability across the two years. Our results are qualitatively similar although slightly weaker without these
restrictions. Additional controls in the regression include age of firm, age squared, log(Capital/Value Added),
log(Value Added), R&D expenditures as share of total income, share of white-collar workers, and foreign dummy
which is equal to one if at least 10 percent of assets is foreign-owned.


                                                           16
more complementary with female blue-collar workers. While we show only the reduced

relationship between tariffs and female wage bill share in table 8, our results are broadly

consistent with this technology based explanation.

       Finally, another channel is the role of competition and discrimination. The bottom panel

of table 8 addresses this issue by using the same specification as (3) but using Mexican tariffs

(import tariffs) as the independent variable. While the coefficients are positive, table 8 shows

that the relationship between import tariffs and female share is much weaker. These results

suggest that increased competition and reductions in discriminatory hiring practices were most

likely of secondary importance in Mexico.



V. Household Expenditures and Shifts in Household Bargaining



       We have shown that during the period of trade liberalization women’s wage remained

stable while they worked more (at least in the non-household sector). This brings us to the

question of whether women’s well-being improved as a result. Recent papers on household

bargaining have rejected the common preference model of the household. Using a policy change

in Britain where child allowance was transferred from the husband to the wife as a natural

experiment, Lundberg, Pollack and Wales (1996) show that an exogenous shock to wife’s

income altered household expenditures towards “women’s clothing” and “children’s clothing” at

the expense of “men’s clothing” and “tobacco and alcohol.” The exogenous shift in relative

incomes altered the bargaining position of the wife and shifted household expenditures towards

goods reflecting her preferences. Bobonis (2009) also finds that cash transfers to the wife in the

Mexican Progressa program shifted expenditures towards children’s goods. In this section, we




                                                 17
examine changes in household expenditure patterns to see if bargaining position of married

women increased to reflect the increase in their relative earnings.

       We use two rounds of the Mexican Household Income and Expenditure Survey

(ENIGH), 1992 and 2000. Our sample consists of married households with children where the

husband and the wife are between 18 and 54 years old. Different households are interviewed in

each round, thus we are unable to follow the same household over time. Households report total

expenditures as well as expenditures in various categories covering the third quarter of the year

previous to the survey. We deflate expenditures by the national consumer price index published

by the Bank of Mexico with 2000 as the base year. We divide by total expenditures to obtain

shares and run the following OLS regression:



Shareitk    1Kids _ Youngit  2 Kids _ Oldit  3 Kidsit  4Tot expit   t  uit   (4)



where Shareitk refers to expenditure share of good k in total expenditures for household i in year t.

We also control for total expenditures, number of children younger than 3, number of children

aged 3-5 and total number of children. The year dummies in the above regression indicate

whether expenditure share of good k increased in 2000 relative to 1992.

       Results are reported in table 9. The coefficients on the 2000 year dummy indicate that

expenditures on male clothing fell over time while expenditures on female clothing increased.

The survey only reports expenditures on “infant and toddler clothing.” Expenditures in this

category fell over time. “Education” expenditures which are typically associated with female

preference increased while “alcohol and tobacco,” associated with male preference, fell over

time. The bottom three rows investigate the change in the ratio of expenditures. Children’s



                                                    18
clothing fell relative to male clothing if we include families with older children where clothing

may be handed down from older siblings. When we look at families with young children only,

we find no significant change in the ratio of children’s to male clothing. The ratio of female to

male clothing, however, increased from 1992 to 2000. The table offers suggestive evidence that

women’s bargaining power within the household improved along with their relative earnings

over the 1990s. Household expenditures shifted from goods associated with male preference,

such as men’s clothing and tobacco and alcohol, to those associated with female preference such

as education and women’s clothing.



VI. Conclusion



       Some view rising wage and income inequality in Latin America as an unacceptable

consequence of following more efficient market-oriented policies. The impact of trade

liberalization and foreign direct investment on domestic wage structure, therefore, is of central

policy concern. The evidence in this paper suggests that rather than immiserizing women, trade

liberalization improved women’s labor market outcomes. Particularly during the reform period,

1990 to 2000, the gender wage ratio increased while employment of women increased. This

suggests that the relative demand for women must have increased over this period. We find that

both between and within-industry shifts favored female workers. With regards to between-

industry shifts, we find that tariff reductions expanded industries which were initially female

intensive. With regards to within-industry shifts, we find that declines in export tariffs are

positively associated with increased hiring of women in skilled blue-collar occupations. This

suggests that the exports and technology channel emphasized by recent papers to explain skill

premiums (Yeaple (2005), Verhoogen (2008), and Bustos (2011)) may be as important for


                                                 19
explaining gender outcomes. Finally, the increased earnings power of women appears to have

translated into increased bargaining power within the household. Examining household

expenditure data, we find that expenditures shifted from male-oriented goods such as male

clothing and tobacco and alcohol to female-oriented goods such as women’s clothing and

children’s education.

A. Household Surveys (Census, ENIGH)

        We use data from 9 rounds of the Household Income and Expenditure Surveys (ENIGH),

a nationally representative survey which spans the period 1984-2004. We also use data from the

10% samples of the Mexican Population Census of 1990 and 2000 available from the Census

IPUMS. Unlike the ENIGH, statistical inferences using the larger Census samples are

significant at the two-digit industry level (92 categories) and at the state level (32 states).

Appendix Table 1 provides summary statistics of the data.

        For calculating wages we construct a wage sample consisting of men and women who are

15-64 years old, who worked at least 30 hours during the survey week and reported no self-

employment income. Wages are reported wage and salary earnings last month converted to a

weekly wage by dividing by 4.33. Earnings were deflated by the national consumer price index

published by the Bank of Mexico with 2000 as the base year.

        For reporting quantities of labor by education and by industry, we construct a sample of

15-64 year olds who report positive hours during the survey week, including the self-employed.

We report hours-weighted employment shares and employment shares in efficiency units of

labor. To calculate efficiency units of labor, we first calculate average wages (fixed across all

years) by 2 gender, 10 age and 6 education categories. We weight hours by these average wages

to calculate efficiency units of labor. All our calculations are weighted by the household

weights to make the sample nationally representative.




                                                  24
B. Data on Tariffs, Exports, and Imports

       We match industry classifications available in the 1990 and 2000 Census samples to the

Sistema de Clasificacion Industrial de America del Norte 1997 (SCIAN97 and also called the

NAICS in the U.S.). Tariff, export, and import data for 1993-2000 were obtained from the

Ministry of the Economy (formerly SECOFI), international trade statistics

(www.economia.gob.mx). Tariffs, exports and imports are reported in “facciones arancelarias”

which is a classification system for products. There are more than 34,000 products. For tariff

schedules we used the book Fracciones Arancelarias y Plazos de Desgravación, Tratado de Libre

Comercio de América del Norte (1994), published by the Ministry of Economy. The book

publishes each product with the 1993 tariff rates (0,5,10,15,20%) along with a code, A, B, C, D

or B6 which describes the rate at which the tariff is reduced to zero. For example, Code A

corresponds to a tariff which is reduced to zero in 1994. We aggregated products and tariff

schedules up to the SCIAN97 industry codes using the 1993 import shares as weights. U.S tariff

data come from John Romalis (http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/john.romalis/more/) with the

description and documentation available in the NBER Working paper 9387. We aggregate the 6

digit harmonized tariff schedules available in the Romalis data up to the 3-digit SCIAN97

categories using the 1993 shares of Mexican exports to the U.S. These matched tariff data are

available from the authors upon request.



C. Establishment Surveys (ENESTyC)



   The establishment-level data come from Encuesta Nacional de Empleo, Salarios, Tecnologia

y Capacion (ENESTyC). The samples in ENESTyC are representative cross sections of




                                               25
establishments in the manufacturing sector for the years 1992, 1998, and 2001. We use the 1992

and 2001 samples in our analysis which refer to the years 1991 and 2000. We drop micro

establishments (those with 15 employees or less) from the analysis since these smaller

establishments were oversampled in 2001 but we do not have clear details of the oversampling.

“Value added” is defined as the value of output minus materials. We deflate output by the

producer price index (PPI) at the industry level and materials by the materials price index (MPI)

provided by the Central Bank of Mexico. Wage bills are deflated by the consumer price index

(CPI). “Capital” is value of total assets deflated by PPI. “R&D Share” refers to share of income

devoted to research and development. To construct female wage bill share, we first aggregate

wage bills of workers in different white and blue collar categories, supervisors, clerical workers,

special production workers, and general production workers, all of which are reported separately

by gender. Some categories have missing values in which case we replace with zeros before

adding. The wage bill shares refer to basic salary for full time workers and exclude payment for

extra hours or contributions to social security. We also exclude part time workers, hourly

employees, and subcontractors from wage bill calculations. “Foreign” refers to establishments

where 10 percent or more of the assets are foreign-owned. “Exporter” refers to establishments

with positive exports. “Foreign exporter” refers to establishments which fulfill both conditions.
