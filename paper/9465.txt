Rain or Shine: where is the Weather Effect?

                                           ABSTRACT

        Saunders (1993) and Hirshleifer and Shumway (2001) document the effect of weather on
stock returns. The proposed explanation in both papers is that investor mood affects cognitive
processes and trading decisions. In this paper, we use a database of individual investor accounts to
examine the weather effects on traders. Our analysis of the trading activity in five major U.S. cities
over a six-year period finds vistually no difference in individuals propensity to buy or sell equities
on cloudy days as opposed to sunny days. If the association between cloud cover and stock returns
documented for New York and other world cities is indeed caused by investor mood swings, our
findings suggest that researchers should focus on the attitudes of market-makers, news providers or
other agents physically located in the city hosting the exchange. NYSE spreads widen on cloudy
days. When we control for this, the significance of the weather effect is dramatically reduced. We
interpret this as evidence that the behavior of market-makers, rather than individual investors, may
be responsible for the relation between returns and weather.

       Some of the most interesting empirical evidence in behavioral finance is the

recent documentation of astronomical and weather effects on stock market returns.

Saunders (1993) shows that the NYSE rises more on sunny days in New York City.

Hirshleifer and Shumway (2001) replicate Saunders’ study out of sample and extend it to

the major stock markets around the world. Dichev and James (2001) and Yuan, et al.

(2001) both find that investors are affected by lunar cycles. While these effects might at

first seem implausible, researchers cite convincing evidence from the psychology

literature that the weather and the moon can affect human emotions. If stock prices are

driven by investor actions based upon mood rather than upon reason, it suggests two

things about the price formation process. First, that mood affects individual investment

decisions, and second, and more importantly, mood affects actions of the marginal

investor, i.e. the investor setting prices. While it is not difficult to believe that emotion

plays a role in the individual decision-making process, it is striking, in light of the

efficient market theory, that valuation by rational investors does not compensate for the

irrationality of others. If the marginal investor is one whose outlook for the stock market

depends on the weather or the phases of the moon, then the market is plainly not efficient

– or else frictions and other factors prevent the profitable exploitation of irrational

behavior.

       The possibility that the weather is salient in the price formation process actually

affords the opportunity to explore whether investors in any specific part of the country

are the price-setters. The implicit assumption in both Saunders (1993) and Hirshleifer and

Shumway (2001) is that the marginal investors are in New York City, or the city in which

the exchange is located. While this may be plausible for some countries with few large




                                                                                           1
cities, or one financial center, the individual and institutional ownership of stocks in the

United States is geographically dispersed. In this paper, we use a panel database of

individual investor accounts that is coded geographically to investigate the basis for the

weather effect. We confirm the findings of Saunders (1993) and Hirshleifer and

Shumway (2001) for New York weather. On the other hand, our analysis of the trading

activity in five major cities (New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago and

Philadelphia) over a six-year period finds virtually no difference in the propensity to buy

or sell equities on cloudy days as opposed to sunny days. We also show that in our

sample investors’ net fund flow into individual equities is only weakly related to the S&P

500 index, which indicates that investor trading in individual securities does not

significantly impact asset prices in our sample. If the association between cloud cover

and stock returns documented for New York and other world cities is indeed caused by

mood swings, our findings suggest that researchers should focus on the attitudes and risk-

aversion of market-makers, news providers or other agents physically located in the city

hosting the exchange.

       Our dataset contains trades of individuals not institutions. Thus there is the

possibility that institutional traders are emotionally affected by the weather, while

individuals are not. If this were true, it would contradict most assumptions about the

relative sophistication of these two groups. Ruling out individual traders and institutional

traders are the source of the weather effect leaves us with one other set of candidates for a

behavioral explanation for the association between weather and returns: market-makers.

NYSE market making is not a fully competitive mechanism. Thus, when spreads widen,




                                                                                           2
no short-term competitive mechanism exists to tighten them up. Thus, we might expect to

see persistent, behavioral-based anomalies in this setting.

       To investigate whether market-maker behavior might be the source of the weather

effect, we examine the relationship between liquidity and weather. We find that the

change in the average daily bid-ask spread for the NYSE stocks in the S&P 100 over the

period of our study widens on cloudy days and narrows on sunny days. The weather

effect on returns becomes insignificant after we control for weather-related liquidity

changes. One potential explanation is that on cloudy days, market makers become less

active or more risk-averse, and that this, in turn, affects market prices.

       The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the data and outlines the

methodology; Section 3 shows that individual propensity to buy stocks is not influenced

by local weather; Section 4 establishes the correlation between individual fund flow into

different asset classes and the NYSE index returns; Section 5 documents how market

liquidity changes are influenced by local weather, and can in part explain the weather

effect; and Section 6 concludes.



2. Data and methodology

       Our investor trading record extends from January, 1991 to November, 1996 and is

obtained from a large U.S. discount brokerage firm. Our data contains information on

anonymous investor characteristics, trade date, securities identification, trade quantity,

and price. Investor location is determined by the home zip code provided in a file on key

investor characteristics from the same source. We present a summary of trade and

investor characteristic data in Table 1. We focus in this study on investors living in five

large U.S. metropolitan areas. These five metropolitans are New York, Los Angeles, San


                                                                                         3
Francisco, Chicago and Philadelphia. These five cities have a total population of more

than 20 million, which offers a good representation of U.S. urban residents. Our sample

also constitutes about 40 percent of all our individual trade records in the entire database,

making it a fair sample of national individual investors. Another advantage of our sample

is that it includes cities from the eastern and western U.S, which have quite different

weather patterns.

         The weather data is obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric

Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce (www.noaa.gov) and contains hourly

weather condition of 221 stations throughout the U.S. between 1990 and 1995. The data

contains hourly readings of the Total Sky Cover (SKC), which is defined as the total

amount of sky dome (in tenths) covered by clouds. SKC ranges from 0 (none of the sky is

covered by clouds) to 10 (all of the sky is covered by clouds).

         We calculate the daily sky cover in a manner similar to Hirshleifer and Shumway

(2002). We first compute the daily Total Sky Cover (SKC) of each city by taking the

average SKC of each day’s trading hours.1 Since there are seasonal weather patterns, we

compute the SKC of each month as the average of SKC of all days during the month. We

then compute the average SKC for each month of the year (January through December)

as averages of the 6 observations on SKC for that particular month of the year during our

6-year sample. We present the seasonal pattern of SKC for these cities in Figure 1.

Finally, we compute the daily seasonally-adjusted SKC (SASKC) as the SKC of a

particular day minus the SKC of the month to which it belongs (All SKC hereafter is

season-adjusted SKC (SASKC)). This generates a measurement of a particular day’s

1
 We also compute the daily SKC as average of SKC of all 24 hours of every day. The correlation
coefficient between these two measures is greater than 0.9. We do not report the results for this daily SKC
measure in our study.


                                                                                                              4
weather relative to the average seasonal weather, which captures the “unexpected”

component of that day’s weather change.

        We measure the individual tendency to buy relative to sell in both shares and

volume. The net buy in shares (NBS) of a particular day is defined as the total number of

shares of stocks bought minus the total number of shares of stocks sold by our sample

individuals on that day. Positive/negative NBS means that local individuals are net

buyers/sellers during a particular day. We compute a city’s NBS as above for all trades

made by investors from that city.

        Similar to Hong and Kumar (2002) and Zhu (2002), we define the buy-sell

imbalance (BSI) in dollar value as the dollar value of the buying trades minus the selling

trades, relative to the daily average of total value of stocks traded by sample investors.

Positive/negative BSI means individuals are net buyers/sellers during a particular day. In

particular, buy-sell imbalance (BSI) is defined as:

                   VBit - VS it
        BSI it =                                               (1)
                    ADTVi

where

        VBit = Dollar value of all stocks purchased during day t by investors from city i;

        VS it = Dollar value of all stocks sold during day t by investors from city i;

        ADTVi, = Daily average dollar value of buying and selling trades made by

investors from city i.




                                                                                             5
3. Weather and individual investment

Regression of NYSE index return on SKC of New York City

        We first explore whether the weather effect documented in previous studies

obtains for our 1991 to 1995 sample period. Saunders (1993) shows that the relationship

between stock market return and Wall Street weather weakened in the second half of his

study period. We also have a shorter period than previous studies, which may also bias

against our finding the weather effect.      Similar to Saunders (1993), we also regress

NYSE index daily return on New York City’s sky cover (SKC). In addition, we also

include the one-day lag NYSE index return, a Monday dummy and a January dummy to

control for price movement persistence, the Monday effect, and the January effect.

       In Table 2, the coefficient for total sky cover (SKC) is negative and significant at

the 1 percent level. We thus confirm previous findings that the stock return is indeed

higher in sunny days and that these results are robust to the period of study. Consistent

with previous studies, the NYSE index return is weakly higher on Monday. The

coefficients for all other variables are insignificant and the regression R-square is only 1

percent. Having shown that the weather effect is significant during our sample period,

we next investigate whether individual investor behavior is responsible for the

phenomenon.



Weather and individuals’ propensity to buy

       We first present the descriptive statistics for NBS on cloudy and sunny days for

the five cities in Table 3. We define cloudy days as those on which SKC is positive

(when more sky dome is covered by clouds than the monthly average) and sunny days as




                                                                                          6
those on which SKC is negative (when less sky dome is covered by clouds than the

monthly average). For the 5 studied cities, there are a total of 4,274 sunny days and 4,726

cloudy days.

       The null hypothesis, that the net buy in shares (NBS) on sunny and cloudy days is

equal, cannot be rejected for any of the five cities or for the pooled data. We also report

the results of the univariate regression of NBS on SKC in Table 4. No SKC coefficient is

significant and the explanatory power of all regressions is close to zero. Weather does not

have a significant impact on our sample of investors’ decision to buy or sell stocks.

       The results are similar for the buy-sell imbalance (BSI) in dollar value. In Table 5,

the BSI on sunny days is no different than on cloudy days for four out of the five cities --

the BSI during sunny days is weakly larger for Philadelphia.

       We next perform a univariate regression of BSI on SKC and report the results in

Table 6. The coefficients for SKC are insignificant for all 5 cities, which offers additional

evidence that total sky cover does not influence individual investors’ decisions to buy or

sell stocks. How about differences between sunny and cloudy cities in general? We take

Philadelphia, Miami, and Portland as proxies for moderate, mostly sunny and mostly

cloudy weather, respectively. We present the seasonal weather patterns for these three

cities in Figure 2. The results in Table 7 show that investors from cities with mostly

sunny days, do not tend to make more purchases relative to sales in general, or on sunny

days in particular. Again, we find little association between weather and individual

investment decisions.




                                                                                           7
Weather and local trading volume

        Another way that weather could potentially influence the stock market is through

trading volume. Lee and Swaminathan (1998) find a relationship between trading volume

and the momentum effect. Chordia et al. (2001) use trading volume as a proxy for market

liquidity and find changes in trading volume are negatively correlated with market

returns. If the behavioral assumptions suggested in Hirshleifer and Shumway (2002)

indeed hold, the trading volume by individual investors could be significantly different

on sunny days vs. cloudy days.

        Our empirical results, however, do not support this hypothesis. We compare the

total dollar value of trades made by our sample individuals during sunny and cloudy days

for the five cities and report the result in Table 8. The trading volume during sunny days

is not significantly greater than during cloudy days for all five cities. For Chicago the

trading volume in sunny days is actually significantly smaller than that during cloudy

days, which offers direct counter evidence that individuals trade more on sunny days.

        We further perform a univariate regression analysis of total trading volume in

dollars (TTV) on SKC in Table 9. The results are consistent with Table 8: with the

exception of Los Angeles, the coefficient for SKC is insignificant. The R-squares of these

regressions are extremely low, indicating that weather has little explanatory power for

variations in the total dollar value of trades.



4. Individual investor investment flow and market performance

        Another assumption implicit in Saunders (1993) and Hirshleifer and Shumway

(2002) is that it is the marginal investors, the investors setting the prices, who are likely




                                                                                           8
to be influenced by exchange weather. To examine this assumption, we next consider the

evidence in our sample on the question of whether the aggregate fund flow of individual

investors can move aggregate stock prices (c.f. Goetzmann and Massa, 2001). In

particular, we divide our data into fund flow into individual securities, equity mutual

funds and bond mutual funds (no individual security fixed income flow is available). Our

sample contains a total of 1,851,131 trades on common stocks, 223,282 on equity funds

and 40,565 on bond funds. For each asset class, we implement the buy-sell imbalance

measure described in Equation (1).

          For each asset class, we regress the daily NYSE index return on fund flow, one-

day lagged fund flow, and the lagged NYSE index. We report the results in Table 10. For

flow into common stocks, the order imbalance coefficient is negative and significant at

the 1 percent level. The coefficient on one-day lagged fund flow is positive and

significant at the 10 percent level, suggesting that some impact of individual order flow is

temporary and reversed the next day. Although previous studies using similar data (Hong

and Kumar, 2002; Zhu, 2002) find that individuals tend to be contrarians around events

such as analyst recommendation changes and earnings announcements, it is still

somewhat surprising that individual fund flow into the equity market is strongly

negatively related to equity market return.

          One trading mechanism could potentially explain this contrarian finding. Since

individuals make infrequent trades in our sample, it is possible that the negative relation

we observe is due to “stale” limit orders, that is limit orders that individuals have made

but are not careful enough to cancel.2 When there are sharp increases in stock prices,

limit orders to sell are triggered and vice versa, which could conceivably lead to the
2
    We thank Terry Odean for this suggestion.


                                                                                          9
observed contrarian pattern. We perform a simple test to control for potential limit orders.

We argue that limit orders are more likely to take place at round dollars or half dollars.

The rationale is that, compared to market orders, investors are more likely to use

rounding when setting limit orders, which is easier for them to conceptualize.

Presumably, it is difficult to be extraordinarily precise about absolute security valuation.

We therefore exclude all equity trades made at round dollar prices or half dollar prices

and re-run the analysis. The coefficients for order imbalance and lagged order imbalance

are still negative but much smaller in magnitude and insignificant, confirming our

conjecture. Therefore, we conclude that the link between individuals’ flow into common

stocks and overall stock market return for non-limit orders is weak.

       For equity mutual funds, the pattern is quite the opposite. The coefficient for the

equity fund order imbalance is positive and significant at the 1 percent level. This

provides some support for the Brown et al. (2002) argument that daily mutual fund flows

may proxy for investor sentiment. The contrast between individuals flow into equities vs.

equity funds suggest that individual trading based on beliefs about the market per se can

have a market impact. For particular stocks, however, individual trades based on security-

specific information have no apparent net effect, and on balance, orders based on security

valuation are effectively contrarian on days when the market moves significantly.

       Is the mutual fund flow influenced by weather? Again, we compare the buy-sell

imbalance in equity funds for investors from the five cities. The results in Table 11 and

12 show that the net flow into equity funds is not influenced by local weather, either. The

NBS and BSI of equity funds are not significantly greater on sunny than cloudy days in

all of the five cities, which re-confirms our finding that individual trading is not




                                                                                         10
influenced by local weather. Weather and flow are unrelated, and this is not due to the

confounding effects of stale limit orders. The coefficient for bond fund flow is positive

but insignificant, indicating that individual investors’ bond flow has little impact on the

stock market or vice versa. The R-square for all 4 specifications is low.



5 Weather and market maker behavior

       Thus far, we have established that individuals do not have stronger tendency to

buy on sunny days. We have also shown that trading in individual equities do not have a

significant impact on aggregate asset prices. Even New York City investors are not

influenced by New York weather. Therefore, we turn to other market participants for an

explanation of the weather effect.

       As we argue above, institutions are unlikely candidates for two reasons. First,

they are typically assumed to be more sophisticated and less susceptible to behavioral

biases than individuals. The findings of Grinblatt and Keloharju (2000) and Shapira and

Venezia (2001) suggest that fund manager trading decisions are less irrational than the

decisions of individuals. Also, like individual investors, institutional investors are located

across the entire country, so that they should also be less influenced by the local weather

of New York City.

       Market makers located at the New York Stock Exchange might, on the other

hand, be influenced by the weather there. There is little doubt that market makers can

have a potentially critical impact on stock market prices. Also, since market markers do

not work in a fully competitive environment, there is the possibility that they can deviate

from rational behavior. One important way that market makers can influence the stock




                                                                                           11
market is through the bid-ask spread, which is the most widely-used measure of market

liquidity. Recent research also suggests that liquidity, as measured by the bid-ask spread,

is priced. For example, Chordia et al, (2001) show with comprehensive trade and quote

(TAQ) data that returns are negatively related to changes in liquidity.

       If market-maker behavior is the mechanism by which weather changes influence

stock returns, we presumably should detect this in changes in liquidity. Our test is

straightforward: we examine the daily relation between the average bid-ask spread

change and the New York City weather for the period of our sample. Since spreads are

highly serially correlated, we follow Chordia (2002) and examine the change in the

spread rather than the spread itself. We first ask whether the overall market spread

change is associated with total sky cover (SKC). Since no finance theory has suggested

that market liquidity should respond to exchange weather, our null hypothesis is that the

total sky cover (SKC) has no significant influence on market liquidity.

       We use Trade and Quote (TAQ) data to compute the daily spread change. We first

compute the daily spread of each of the S&P 100 stocks listed in NYSE. The daily spread

for each stock is computed as the average of all bid-ask spreads within a trading day. We

then compute the market spread as equal-weighted average of the spread of the S&P 100

stocks. We use the equal-weighted instead of value-weighted average, because the equal-

weighted average of the spread better reflects the average market marker’s behavior.

Since the TAQ data goes back only to 1993, we focus on observations between 1993 and

1995, the last year that we have weather data. Two reasons motivate us to focus on

aggregate market spread. First, since we are interested in exploring the weather effect of

the market index, it serves our purpose perfectly to study the overall market spread. In




                                                                                        12
addition, previous studies (c.f. Easley et al., 2002) have shown that asymmetric

information can play an important role in an individual stock’s liquidity and expected

return. The market makers of particular stocks are concerned about information-based

trades. Asymmetric information should be largely alleviated at the aggregate market

level, which enables us to isolate the relation between spread change and local weather.

       We first regress the daily spread change on the sky cover. The results are shown

in specification (1) of Table 13. Surprisingly, the coefficient for SKC is positive and

significant at the 5 percent level, which implies that the spread increases on cloudy days

and decreases on sunny ones. In Specification (2), we include the current index return.

Since the market return is known to be negatively correlated with liquidity changes (c.f.

Chordia et. al., 2001), we must control for it in our analysis of SKC’s impact on spread

change. The coefficient for SKC remains largely unchanged and is still significant at the

5 percent level. Consistent with Chordia et al. (2001), the spread change and the market

return are significantly negatively correlated. We next include the one-day lag of the

NYSE index return and the spread change in specification (3) and the main results

become even stronger. The four independent variables can explain 16 percent of the

variation in the spread change. We also include an interaction term, the product of SKC

and NYSE index return, to control for the fact that market returns are higher on sunny

days. Our main findings still hold. Finally, we include Monday and January dummy

variables to examine whether spread change varies during a particular day of week or

month of year. Both coefficients are negative and insignificant, indicating limited

Monday and January effect on spread change during our sample.




                                                                                           13
        We next examine whether systematic shifts in the spread change on sunny vs.

cloudy days can explain the weather effect. We first regress the market return on the total

sky cover (SKC) of New York between 1993 and 1995 in (1) of Table 14. The coefficient

for SKC is negative and significant at the 5 percent level. This confirms all previous

findings of the weather effect with our data. We then include the lagged return in

specification (2) and the coefficient for SKC is negative and still significant. Consistent

with short-term price momentum, the coefficient for lagged return is positive and

significant at the 1 percent level.

        In specifications (3) and (4), we add market liquidity changes and the product of

market liquidity changes and total sky cover (SKC). Since we have found that the spread

widens on cloudy days, we suspect that it is partly responsible for lower market returns

on cloudy days. In both specifications, the coefficients of SKC become much smaller and

less significant than they were in specification (1) and (2). For specification (4), the

coefficient of SKC becomes insignificant. This confirms our hypothesis that spread

change, which itself may be affected by exchange local weather, in part drives the

weather effect on returns documented in the literature. The coefficient for DQSP is

negative and significant at the 1 percent level, indicating that the spread change, at least

in part, explains the weather effect.



Conclusion

        In this paper we take a deeper look at the weather effect documented in Saunders

(1993) and Hirshleifer and Shumway (2001). Contrary to expectations, it does not seem

to be driven by weather-induced mood swings of individual investors. However the




                                                                                         14
effect is plainly there in the data. We consider another potentially interesting behavioral

mechanism for the result: weather-induced changes in the risk-aversion of the NYSE

specialist. We document a significant relation between liquidity as measured by bid-ask

spread, and the cloud cover in New York City. When included as an explanatory variable

in a regression of returns on weather, the previously documented weather effect is greatly

reduced. Following previous researchers, we conjecture that the association between

weather and liquidity may be due to weather-induced mood swings. However, rational

explanations for such behavior are also possible. It is plainly not a “vacation” effect in

which market makers take off early on sunny days, because that would lead to a

relationship of opposite sign. Perhaps, instead market-makers are more apt to depart the

city early to beat the rush out of town on rainy days. In any case, whether the relationship

we identify is due to market-maker irrationality or is simply a rational response to the

information-generating process – or even New York City traffic – is a matter for further

conjecture.
