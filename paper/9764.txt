                                           ABSTRACT

We introduce a neoclassical growth economy with idiosyncratic production risk and incomplete
markets. Each agent is an entrepreneur operating her own neoclassical technology with her own
capital stock. The general equilibrium is characterized in closed form. Idiosyncratic production
shocks introduce a risk premium on private equity and reduce the demand for investment. The steady
state is characterized by a lower capital stock due to entrepreneurial risk and a lower interest rate
due to precautionary savings as compared to complete markets. The private equity premium is
endogenously countercyclical: the anticipation of low savings and high interest rates in the future
feed back to high risk premia and low investment in the present. Countercyclicality in risk taking
slows down convergence to the steady state and amplifies the magnitude and persistence of the
business cycle. These results, which contrast sharply with those obtained in Bewley models,
highlight the macroeconomic significance of missing markets in production and investment risk.

1. Introduction

Undiversifiable entrepreneurial and investment risks are paramount not only in the
developing world, but also in the most advanced economies. In a recent study of US
private equity, Moskowitz and Vissing-Jørgensen (2002) document that entrepreneurs
and private investors face a “dramatic lack of diversification” and an extreme dispersion
in returns.1 The survival rate of private firms is only 34 percent over the first 10 years,
and returns on investment vary widely among surviving firms. These undiversifiable
risks are potentially important for macroeconomic performance because entrepreneurs
and firm-owners control a large fraction of savings and investment. For instance in the
United States, private companies account for about half of production, employment,
and corporate equity.
    Idiosyncratic production risks are not limited to owners of private firms. In publicly
traded corporations, the tenure and compensation of executives are closely tied to the
outcome of the investment decisions they make on behalf of shareholders. Similarly,
labor income often includes returns to education, learning-by-doing, or some form of
human or intangible capital. Idiosyncratic risks thus influence a large class of investment
decisions and potentially have substantial aggregate eﬀects.
    The standard neoclassical growth model (Cass, 1965; Koopmans, 1965; Brock and
Mirman, 1972) assumes complete markets, implying that private agents can fully di-
versify any idiosyncratic risk in their labor and production choices. Following Bewley
(1977), a large literature has investigated the macroeconomic impact of uninsurable
shocks in exogenous income but not in investment returns.2 The precautionary or
buﬀer-stock motive leads agents to over accumulate capital in the steady state as com-
pared to complete markets (Aiyagari, 1994) and has no quantitatively important eﬀect
on business-cycle dynamics (Krusell and Smith, 1998). Bewley models also predict
that improvements in borrowing limits or risk sharing reduce capital accumulation and
medium-run growth, which contradicts the positive correlation between financial so-
phistication and economic development documented in a large literature (e.g. King and
Levine, 1993; Levine, 1997).
    This paper departs from the Bewley paradigm by considering idiosyncratic risk in
investment. We introduce a neoclassical economy with decentralized production and
incomplete insurance markets, in which the equilibrium dynamics are characterized in
   1
      Moskowitz and Vissing-Jørgensen (2002) also observe: “About 75 percent of all private equity
is owned by households for whom it constitutes at least half of their total net worth. Furthermore,
households with entrepreneurial equity invest on average more than 70 percent of their private holdings
in a single private company in which they have an active management interest.”

(2000, ch. 14) for a review.

closed form. Each agent is an entrepreneur operating her own neoclassical technology
with her own capital stock. Production is subject to firm-specific uncertainty, which
generates idiosyncratic risk in entrepreneurial income.
    Missing markets have strikingly diﬀerent implications than in Bewley-type models.
Idiosyncratic production shocks introduce a risk premium on private equity, which re-
duces the demand for investment at any given interest rate. Uninsurable income risks
also encourage the precautionary supply of savings, implying a lower interest rate in
the steady state as compared to complete markets. The reduction in investment de-
mand dominates the eﬀect of a lower interest rate and leads to the under accumulation
of capital for reasonable elasticities of intertemporal substitution.3 The negative eﬀect
of idiosyncratic risk on investment thus contrasts with the over accumulation of capital
obtained in Bewley-type models from precautionary savings. Our model also predicts
that improvements in entrepreneurial risk sharing, induced for instance by financial lib-
eralization or the introduction of new hedging instruments, will have a positive eﬀect
on savings and medium run growth.
    Undiversifiable production risks generate a novel amplification and propagation
mechanism over the business cycle. This result hinges on the property that the risk
premium on private capital is endogenously countercyclical. The expectation of a re-
cession in the near future implies a low willingness to take risk in the present, which in
turn discourages current investment, amplifies the recession and hinders the recovery.
This partially self-fulfilling mechanism increases the persistence and magnitude of the
business cycle. Any model in which risk premia increase in anticipation of an economic
slowdown is likely to produce similar eﬀects.
    In our economy, the countercyclicality of the risk premium originates in the neg-
ative eﬀect of future borrowing costs on current risk taking. Figure 1 illustrates this
mechanism in an economy hit at date t = 0 by an unanticipated negative shock to ag-
gregate wealth. The solid lines represent transmission under complete markets. Agents
smooth consumption by reducing current investment, which results in low wealth, low
savings and high interest rates in later periods. This is the fundamental propagation
mechanism in the RBC paradigm. In the presence of idiosyncratic production risk, the
traditional channel is complemented by the endogenous countercyclicality of risk pre-
mia, as illustrated by the dashed arrows in the figure. Anticipating high interest rates in
the near future, agents become less willing to engage in risky production activities and
further reduce investment at date t = 0, which amplifies the recession in later periods.
Countercyclicality in the risk premium thus amplifies the impact of the shock and slows
down convergence to the steady state.
    The mechanism identified in this paper originates in the incomplete risk sharing of
   3
    Our model thus complements earlier research investigating the impact of aggregate production risk
on investment and diversification (e.g. Acemoglu and Zilibotti, 1997).


                                                 3
private investment and entrepreneurial income. Our approach thus complements, but
also diﬀers from, the literature examining the macroeconomic eﬀects of credit-market
imperfections and wealth heterogeneity (e.g. Bernanke and Gertler, 1989, 1990; Baner-
jee and Newman, 1993; Galor and Zeira, 1993; Kiyotaki and Moore, 1997; Aghion,
Banerjee and Piketty, 1999). This earlier research has focused on the eﬀect of wealth
and borrowing constraints on the individual ability to invest in productive capital. We
show that incomplete markets also aﬀect the willingness to invest, and has novel implica-
tions for capital accumulation and business cycles. To illustrate these points, we derive
our results in an economy in which agents face no borrowing constraints and wealth
heterogeneity has no impact on aggregate dynamics. In particular, we assume that
agents have constant absolute risk aversion (CARA), which renders equilibrium prices
and macro aggregates independent of the wealth distribution. This allow us to overcome
the “curse of dimensionality” and characterize the general equilibrium in closed form,
which, to the best of our knowledge, is new to the incomplete-market growth literature.
    The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the economy and Section
3 analyzes the individual decision problem. In Section 4 we characterize the general
equilibrium in closed form. Section 5 analyzes the steady state and Section 6 discusses
the propagation mechanism arising from idiosyncratic production risk. All proofs are
in the Appendix.

2. A Ramsey Economy with Idiosyncratic Production Risk

Time t ∈ {0, 1, ...} is discrete and infinite. The economy is populated by a continuum
of agents, indexed by j ∈ [0, 1], who are born at t = 0 and live forever. Each individual
is a producer, or entrepreneur, who operates her own production scheme using her own
capital stock. In every period, agents can borrow and lend from each other at the market
interest rate but cannot diversify their idiosyncratic risks.

2.1. Technology and Idiosyncratic Risks

In each period t, the gross output of agent j is given by Ajt f (ktj ), where ktj is her capital
stock at the beginning of the period, Ajt is her random total factor productivity (TFP),
and f is a neoclassical production function. The function f is common across households
and satisfies f 0 > 0, f 00 < 0, limk→0 f 0 (k) = +∞, and limk→+∞ f 0 (k) = 0. The
individual controls ktj at date t − 1, but only observes the idiosyncratic productivity Ajt
at date t. The return on capital investment is thus subject to idiosyncratic uncertainty.
    For comparison with production shocks, we find it useful to also introduce endow-
ment risks. The individual receives an exogenous idiosyncratic income ejt , which is
outside her control and does no eﬀect investment or production opportunities. For in-
stance, ejt corresponds to acts of God, or to the wages that the agent receives for renting

                                               4
labor to an unmodeled outside firm.4 The overall non-financial income of household j
in period t is
                                 ytj = Ajt f (ktj ) + ejt .                    (2.1)
Note that Ajt and ejt respectively introduce a multiplicative and an additive shock to
income. Ajt captures idiosyncratic entrepreneurial or capital-income risk, whereas ejt
captures endowment risk.
    We assume for simplicity that idiosyncratic production and endowment risks are
Gaussian, mutually independent, and IID across time and individuals:5

                               Ajt ∼ N (1, σ 2A ),       ejt ∼ N (0, σ 2e ).

The averages EAjt = 1 and Eejt = 0 are simple normalizations. The standard deviations
σ A and σ e parsimoniously parameterize the magnitude of the uninsurable production
and endowment shocks. Under complete markets, σ A and σ e are both equal to zero.
Bewley economies consider idiosyncratic labor-income risk but no idiosyncratic capital-
income risk, which here corresponds to σ e > 0 but σ A = 0. This paper focuses instead
on the case σ A > 0.

2.2. Financial Markets and Preferences
Agents can buy and sell a riskless asset or short-term bond. One unit of the bond
purchased at date t yields 1 + rt units of the good with certainty at date t + 1. In
equilibrium, the interest rate rt clears the period-t bond market. We rule out default,
borrowing constraints, and any other credit-market imperfections. Without loss of gen-
erality, the riskless bond is in zero net supply.6 We assume that agents can trade no
other financial assets, and interpret Ajt and ejt as the undiversifiable components of
idiosyncratic risks.7
    Let cjt , ijt and θjt denote the consumption, capital investment, and bond purchases
of agent j in period t. The individual is subject to the budget constraint

                                cjt + ijt + θjt = ytj + (1 + rt−1 )θjt−1 ,                          (2.2)
   4
     Introducing an explicit labor market would slightly complicate the exposition, but would not alter
our qualitative results.
   5
     Although we assume for tractability that idiosyncratic shocks are serially independent, we will mimic
persistence in numerical simulations by adjusting the length of the time period.
   6
     Ricardian equivalence holds in our model because agents have infinite horizons and can freely trade
the riskless bond. Therefore, as long as public debt is financed by lump-sum taxation, there is no loss
of generality in assuming that the riskless bond is in zero net supply.
   7
     When agents can also trade risky financial assets, σ A and σe are the standard deviations of the
uninsurable components of the entrepreneurial and endowment risks. See Angeletos and Calvet (2000)
for details. The endogenization of the asset structure is beyond the scope of this paper, and could be
pursued following the methodologies of Townsend (1982), Banerjee and Newman (1991), Kocherlakota
(1996), and Alvarez and Jermann (2000).

where ytj is the non-financial income defined in (2.1). Capital depreciates at a fixed rate
                                                                 j
δ ∈ [0, 1], and is determined by the accumulation equation kt+1     = (1 − δ)ktj + ijt . To
simplify notation, we conveniently rewrite the budget set in terms of stock variables.
The agent’s total wealth or cash-in-hand at date t is

                        wtj ≡ Ajt f (kt ) + (1−δ)ktj + ejt + (1 + rt−1 )θjt−1 .                      (2.3)

We then restate the budget constraint (2.2) as
                                         cjt + kt+1
                                                j
                                                    + θjt = wtj .                (2.4)
                                                                             P+∞ t
   The model is most tractable when agents have identical expected utility E0 t=0 β u(ct ),
where
                               u(c) = −Ψ exp(−c/Ψ).
In numerical simulations, it will be useful to distinguish between intertemporal substitu-
tion and risk aversion. For this reason, we assume more generally that agents have iden-
tical non-expected utility of the Kreps-Porteus/Epstein-Zin type. The function u(c) =
−Ψ exp(−c/Ψ) characterizes intertemporal smoothing, and v(c) = − exp(−Γc)/Γ spec-
ifies preference over risky choices.8 A high Ψ corresponds to a strong willingness to
substitute consumption through time, while a high Γ implies a high degree of risk aver-
sion. When Γ = 1/Ψ, the Bernoulli utilities u and v are equal and the preference reduces
                           P
to the expected utility E0 ∞       t
                              t=0 β u(ct ).


2.3. Equilibrium
An incomplete-market equilibrium is an interest rate sequence {rt }∞          t=0 and a collection
of state-contingent plans ({cjt , kt+1
                                   j
                                       , θjt }∞  )
                                              t=0 j∈[0,1] such that: (i) the plan {cjt , kt+1
                                                                                          j
                                                                                              , θjt }∞
                                                                                                     t=0
maximizes the utility of each agent j; and (ii) the bond market clears in every date and
        R
event: j θjt = 0.
    Idiosyncratic risks are independent in the population and cancel out in the aggre-
gate. As a result, we will show that there exists an equilibrium in which the aggregate
dynamics are deterministic. The next section characterizes optimal individual behavior
for an exogenous interest-rate sequence. In Section 4, we aggregate across individuals
and characterize the general equilibrium of the economy.

3. Decision Theory

For notational simplicity, we drop in this section the index j from all decision variables.
Given a deterministic interest rate sequence {rt }∞
                                                  t=0 , the household chooses a contingent
   8
    A stochastic consumption stream {ct }∞                                                 ∞
                                            t=0 generates a stochastic utility stream {xt }t=0 according to
                                                                 −1
the recursion u(xt ) = u(ct )+βu[CEt (xt+1 )], where CEt xt+1 ≡ v [Et v(xt+1 )] is the certainty equivalent
of xt+1 under v conditional on period t information.


                                                    6
plan {ct , kt+1 , θt }∞
                      t=0 that maximizes expected life-time utility subject to (2.4). Since
idiosyncratic risks are uncorrelated over time, individual wealth wt fully characterizes
the idiosyncratic state of the household in period t. For expositional simplicity, we
temporarily assume that the agent has an expected utility function (Γ = 1/Ψ). The
value function Vt (w) satisfies the Bellman equation:

                        Vt (wt ) =      max            u(ct ) + βEt Vt+1 (wt+1 ),
                                     (ct ,kt+1 ,θt )

where the maximization is subject to the budget constraint (2.4). Given the CARA-
normal specification, an educated guess is to consider an exponential value function and
a linear consumption rule:

                          Vt (w) = u(at w + bt ),                    at w + bbt ,
                                                                ct = b                   (3.1)

           at > 0 and bt , bbt ∈ R are non-random coeﬃcients to be determined.
where at , b
   By (2.3), individual wealth is Gaussian with conditional mean and variance:

                       Et wt+1 = f (kt+1 ) + (1 − δ)kt+1 + (1 + rt )θt ,
                              Vart (wt+1 ) = σ 2e + f (kt+1 )2 σ 2A .

The value function has expectation Et Vt+1 (wt+1 ) = Vt+1 [Et wt+1 − Γ2t Vart (wt+1 )], where
Γt ≡ Γat+1 measures absolute risk aversion in period t with respect to wealth variation
in period t + 1. We henceforth call Γt the eﬀective degree of risk aversion at date t.
    Taking the first-order conditions (FOCs) with respect to kt+1 and θt , we obtain the
key condition for optimal investment:

                            rt + δ = f 0 (kt+1 )[1 − Γt f (kt+1 )σ 2A ].                 (3.2)

In the absence of idiosyncratic production shocks (σ A = 0), the agent equates the net
marginal product of capital with the interest rate: rt = f 0 (kt+1 ) − δ. This is a familiar
result in complete-market or Bewley-type economies. On the other hand when σ A > 0,
the return on investment is adjusted for risk. The expected marginal product of capital
diﬀers from the risk-free rate by Γt f (kt+1 )f 0 (kt+1 )σ 2A , which measures the risk premium
on private equity. Note that the premium is proportional to the eﬀective risk aversion
Γt and the marginal contribution of investment to wealth risk.
    The optimal level of savings is determined by the Euler equation u0 (ct+1 ) = βRt
Et u0 (ct+1 ), or equivalently:
                                                                   Γ
                        Et ct+1 −ct = Ψ ln[β(1 + rt )] +             Vart (ct+1 ),       (3.3)
                                                                   2

Eﬀective risk aversion is thus inversely proportional to the price of a perpetuity deliv-
ering one unit of the consumption good in every period s ≥ t + 1. In particular, we
note that eﬀective risk aversion is an increasing function of future interest rates. Higher
interest rates in the future raise the cost of smoothing intertemporally any uninsurable
adverse consumption shock, which increases eﬀective risk aversion and discourages risk
taking in the present.

Proposition 1 (Individual Choice) Given any interest rate path {rt }∞
                                                                    t=0 , the de-
    mand for investment is given by
                                              £                  ¤
                          rt + δ = f 0 (kt+1 ) 1−Γt f (kt+1 )σ 2A .         (3.5)

      Consumption and savings are characterized by the Euler equation

                   Et ct+1 −ct = Ψ ln[β(1 + rt )] + Γ2t [σ 2e + f (kt+1 )2 σ 2A ]/(2Γ).   (3.6)

    Conditions (3.4) and (3.5) define optimal investment as a function of the idiosyn-
cratic production risk and current and future interest rates: kt+1 = k(σ A , rt , rt+1 , ...).
An increase in the contemporaneous interest rate raises the cost of capital and reduces
the demand for investment. Under incomplete markets, investment demand is inde-
pendent of endowment risk σ e but is negatively aﬀected by the production risk σ A .
Moreover when σ A > 0, an increase in future interest rates raises the risk premium on
private equity and thus reduces investment.
    The supply of savings is characterized by the Euler condition (3.6). The sensitivity
of the growth rate to consumption risk is governed by the risk aversion Γ, while sen-
sitivity to the interest rate depends on the intertemporal substitution Ψ. Endowment
risk unambiguously increases the wealth variance Vart (wt+1 ) = σ 2e + f (kt+1 )2 σ 2A . The
eﬀect of production shocks, however, seems to be generally ambiguous because the op-
timal investment kt+1 and thus risk exposure fall with σ A . We check this intuition in
the Appendix by showing that an increase in the standard deviation σ A can reduce the
variance of wealth and thus precautionary savings.

4. General Equilibrium

We now characterize in closed form the general equilibrium of the economy. Let Ct and
Kt denote respectively the population averages of consumption and capital in period

                                                8
t. Because agents have CARA preferences and face no borrowing constraints, private
investment is independent of individual wealth. As a result, the wealth distribution does
not aﬀect the aggregate dynamics and the equilibrium path is easily characterized:9

Proposition 2 (General Equilibrium) There exists an incomplete-market equilib-
    rium in which the macro path {Ct , Kt+1 , rt }∞t=0 is deterministic and agents choose
    identical levels of productive investment. For all t ≥ 0, the equilibrium path sat-
    isfies
                               Ct + Kt+1 = f (Kt ) + (1 − δ)Kt ,                     (4.1)
                                                £                  ¤
                            rt + δ = f 0 (Kt+1 ) 1−Γt f (Kt+1 )σ 2A ,                (4.2)
                                                    £                    ¤
                Ct+1 − Ct = Ψ ln[β(1 + rt )] + Γ2t σ 2e + f (Kt+1 )2 σ 2A /(2Γ),     (4.3)
       where eﬀective risk aversion is inversely proportional to the contemporaneous price
                                      P
       of a perpetuity: Γt = Γ/[1 + +∞                 1
                                         s=1 (1+rt+1 )...(1+rt+s ) ].

Condition (4.1) is the resource constraint of the economy; it is equivalent to the sum of
individual budget constraints when the bond market clears. Conditions (4.2) and (4.3)
characterize the aggregate demand for investment and the aggregate supply of savings.
    Under complete markets, equations (4.2) and (4.3) reduce to the familiar conditions
rt + δ = f 0 (Kt+1 ) and u0 (Ct )/ u0 (Ct+1 ) = β(1 + rt ). In the presence of uninsurable
risks, the precautionary motive increases the aggregate consumption growth and the
supply of savings. This tends to reduce the risk-free rate and stimulate investment, as
is well-known in Bewley models (e.g., Aiyagari, 1994). Idiosyncratic production and
capital-income shocks, however, introduce a risk premium on private equity and reduce
aggregate investment for any given risk-free rate. When σ A > 0, this may lead to
both a lower capital stock and a lower risk-free rate than under complete markets.
Moreover, an anticipated increase in future rates raises the premium on private equity
and thereby decreases the aggregate demand for investment. This feedback, which
is absent from Bewley-type models, may induce persistence and amplification in the
transitional dynamics.
   9
    Aggregation is further simplified by the following assumptions: (i) idiosyncratic shocks are serially
uncorrelated, and (ii) preferences, technology and the structure of risks are identical across agents.
The first hypothesis implies that individual investment and precautionary savings are independent of
contemporaneous idiosyncratic shocks; the second makes investment and precautionary savings identical
across agents. Both assumptions could be relaxed without altering our results, but at the cost of
complicating the solution of the model.




                                                   9
5. Steady State

We now analyze how undiversifiable idiosyncratic production risks aﬀect the capital
stock in the medium run.10 A steady state is a fixed point (C∞ , K∞ , r∞ ) of the dynamic
system (4.1)-(4.3). We easily show

Proposition 3 (Steady State) The consumption level is C∞ = f (K∞ ) − δK∞ . The
    interest rate and the aggregate capital stock satisfy
                                             £                ¤
                           r∞ + δ = f 0 (K∞ ) 1−Γ∞ f (K∞ )σ 2A ,          (5.1)
                                                Γ2∞ £ 2                 ¤
                             ln[β(1 + r∞ )] = − 2ΨΓ  σ e + f (K∞ )2 σ 2A ,                     (5.2)
      where Γ∞ = Γr∞ /(1 + r∞ ). When the steady state is unique,11 the capital stock
      K∞ increases with the endowment risk σ e , but is ambiguously aﬀected by the
      production risk σ A .

The first equation corresponds to the aggregate demand for productive investment, and
the second to the aggregate supply of savings. We note that 1 + r∞ = 1/β under
complete markets (σ A = σ e = 0), but 1 + r∞ < 1/β in the presence of undiversifiable
idiosyncratic risks (σ A > 0 or σ e > 0). The property that the risk-free rate is below the
discount rate under incomplete markets has been proposed as a possible solution to the
low risk-free rate puzzle (e.g., Weil, 1992; Huggett, 1993).
    Endowment and production risks have very diﬀerent eﬀects on the steady state.
Consider first the case σ e > 0 and σ A = 0, as in a Bewley economy. A higher σ e implies
a higher consumption risk, increases the precautionary supply of savings, and reduces
the interest rate. Since investment is still determined by the equation r∞ + δ = f 0 (K∞ ),
the capital stock necessarily increases with σ e . This is precisely the eﬀect considered by
Aiyagari (1994). Consider next the case σ A > 0. Production risk aﬀects both the savings
supply and the investment demand. As previously, a higher σ A tends to encourage the
precautionary savings and stimulate investment. On the other hand, a higher σ A also
increases the private risk premium and reduces the demand for investment at any level
of the interest rate. There is thus a conflict between the savings and the investment
eﬀect.
    Intuition suggests that the investment channel dominates in two cases. First, when
agents have a weak precautionary motive, a higher production risk increases the vari-
ance of consumption but has little eﬀect on savings. Second, when real returns have
  10
     Consistent with a large literature, we view medium-run growth as the steady state of the economy
for a given level of technology. The analysis of long run growth caused by endogenous technological
progress is outside the scope of this paper.
  11
     The steady state is unique when markets are complete and, by continuity, when σA and σe are
suﬃciently small. We checked that uniqueness holds in the numerical simulations of Sections 5 and 6.


                                                 10
a strong impact on long-run savings (the steady-state supply of savings is very elastic
with respect to r∞ ), an increase in precautionary savings only has a small eﬀect on the
equilibrium interest rate. In either case, the new steady state is mainly determined by
the reduction in investment demand. Note that these arguments hinge on the sensi-
tivities of savings to consumption risk and interest rates. In our framework, they are
both valid when the coeﬃcient Ψ is suﬃciently high. The numerical simulations will
demonstrate that K∞ decreases with σ A unless the elasticity of intertemporal substi-
tution is implausibly low. Therefore, while Aiyagari (1994) suggests that the economy
over invests under incomplete insurance, we instead conclude that under investment is
the most likely scenario.

Calibration and Numerical Simulation
We obtained a tractable model by assuming serial uncorrelation in idiosyncratic shocks.
Empirically, however, production and investment risks are highly persistent — especially
under broad definitions that include education, human-capital formation and R&D. To
capture persistence in the simulations, we interpret the length of a time period, T , as
the horizon of an investment project or the average life of an idiosyncratic shock. The
production function is Cobb-Douglas: f (K) = K α with α ∈ (0, 1). The standard devia-
tions of the uninsurable risks are measured as percentages of GDP.12 We finally choose
parameters Γ and Ψ that match a given relative risk aversion γ and a given elasticity
of intertemporal substitution ψ at the complete-markets steady state. This allows us to
control for the dependence of the local transitional dynamics on the consumption-capital
ratio (see Appendix for the details). Overall, a calibrated economy is parameterized by
E cal = (T, β, γ, ψ, α, δ, σ A , σ e ), where T is the length of an idiosyncratic shock, β the
yearly discount factor, γ the relative risk aversion, ψ the elasticity of intertemporal
substitution, α the income share of capital, δ the yearly depreciation rate, and σ A and
σ e the idiosyncratic production and endowment risks as percentages of GDP.
     We now verify the intuition that idiosyncratic production risks lead to the underaccu-
mulation of capital in the medium run unless the elasticity of intertemporal substitution
is very low.

Proposition 4 (Comparative Statics) As we move away from complete markets, an
    increase in production risk σ A reduces the interest rate r∞ . The capital stock K∞
                                                       h                        i
                                                                   T
                                                                     [1−(1−δ)T ] −1
    also decreases if and only if ψ > ψ, where ψ ≡ 12 1 + (1−α)β(1−β   T
                                                                         )
                                                                                    .

For all parameter values, the lower bound ψ is smaller than 1/2, and is thus substantially
lower than the elasticity of intertemporal substitution ψ ≈ 1 suggested by empirical
  12
    For instance, σ A = 0.25 and σe = 0.50 imply that the standard deviation of gross output and the
standard deviation of the endowment represent 25% and 50% of mean production.


                                                11
evidence. The most likely scenario therefore is that uninsurable production risks have
a negative impact on capital accumulation.
     Although accurate estimates of σ A are not readily available, idiosyncratic risks in
production, entrepreneurial, and investment are known to be very substantial. Moskowitz
and Vissing-Jørgensen (2002) show that households with entrepreneurial equity invest
more than 70% of their private holdings in a single company, which suggests to calibrate
σ A on the returns of a single firm. The empirical evidence points towards high values of
σ A . The survival rate of a new private firm is only 34% after 10 years. The distribution
of returns to entrepreneurial activity is extremely wide even conditionally on survival.
For example, Moskowitz and Vissing-Jørgensen report that the average and median re-
turns of a single private diﬀer by as much as 121%. They also assess that a portfolio
of private firms has a standard deviation well above 40%. Since the portfolio diversifies
away much of the idiosyncratic risk, we conclude that a value for σ A above 50% and
perhaps close to 100% is a plausible guess.
     In Figure 2, we illustrate the impact of production risk on the steady-state capital
stock and interest rate for plausible parameter values.13 The length of an idiosyncratic
shock is 5 years, the discount and depreciation rates are 5% per year, relative risk
aversion is 4, and the elasticity of intertemporal substitution is 1. Panel A corresponds
to a broad definition of capital (α = 70%) and Panel B corresponds to a narrow definition
(α = 35%). The eﬀect of σ A on K∞ is very strong. At σ A = 100%, the capital stock
is 30% of its complete-market value if α = 0.35 (Panel B), and only 15% if α = 0.70
(Panel A). Hence, in contrast to Aiyagari (1994), incomplete markets imply both a low
risk free rate and low aggregate savings. Furthermore, the risk-free rate can be a very
poor proxy for the marginal productivity of capital. In Panel B of Figure 2, for example,
the marginal productivity of capital is 18% per year at σ A = 100%, as compared to a
yearly interest rate of 4%.
     The simulations also provide useful insights on the interaction between endowment
and production risks. In Figure 2, the dashed lines correspond to σ e = 50%, whereas
the solid ones to σ e = 0. The value σ e = 50% probably represents an upper bound
for labor income risk (e.g. Aiyagari, 1994), but is useful for comparison with σ A . The
steady state becomes less sensitive to σ e as σ A increases. This is because when σ A is
large, individuals already hold a buﬀer stock that can be used to self-insure against
either production or endowment risks. We also note that when σ e and σ A are equal, the
impact of production risk on capital stock is prevalent. In Figure 2, for example, K∞ is
well below its complete-markets value for σ A = σ e = 50%. Since 50% is a lower bound
  13
    The numerical results of Figures 2 and 3 are not very sensitive to changes in ψ and γ. A higher
ψ weakens the eﬀect of σA on r∞ and strengthens its impact on K∞ , because it increases the interest
elasticity of savings. On the other hand, γ tends to have a small ambiguous eﬀect, since a higher γ
increases both the precautionary motive and the risk premium on investment.



                                                12
for private production risk and an upper bound for labor-income risk, we conclude that
under-accumulation of capital is the most likely scenario.

6. Transitional Dynamics and Propagation

Idiosyncratic production risks have novel implications for the business cycle and medium-
run growth. We illustrate these eﬀects in Figure 1 for an economy hit at date t = 0 by
an unanticipated negative shock to aggregate wealth. Consider the impact of the shock
under complete markets. Consumption and investment fall, interest rates rise, and the
economy converges monotonically back to the steady state, as illustrated by the solid
lines in the figure. The transition takes some time under complete markets only because
agents seek to smooth consumption.
    When production is subject to uninsurable idiosyncratic shocks, the standard tran-
sitional dynamics are complemented by the countercyclicality of risk-taking. The antic-
ipation of high interest rates at t = 1 leads to an increase in the risk premium at t = 0
and hence a further reduction of investment at t = 0. Similarly, the anticipation of
higher interest rates in any period τ > 1 feeds back to even higher risk premia and even
lower investment in earlier periods. The feedback from interest rates to risk premia and
investment is illustrated by the dashed lines in Figure 1.
    The combination of the consumption-smoothing channel (solid lines) and the risk-
premium channel (dashed lines) generates a dynamic multiplier. The fall in current
investment further reduces aggregate income and increases interest rates in the future,
which in turn amplifies the fall in current investment, and so on. The endogenous
countercyclicality of the private risk premium thus amplifies the impact of the exogenous
shock on investment and output and slows down convergence to the steady state as
compared to complete markets.
    We make several remarks on this mechanism. First, it hinges on the eﬀect of idiosyn-
cratic uncertainty on production and investment, and is thus not present in Bewley-type
economies (e.g., Aiyagari, 1994; Krusell and Smith, 1998) that only consider endowment
risks. This explains why this earlier research did not find the eﬀect identified in this
paper.
    Second, incomplete markets generate a particular form of pecuniary externality. In
the presence of uninsurable production shocks, risk-taking depends on future interest
rates. When private agents decide how much to save and invest in a future period, they
do not internalize the impact of their choices on future interest rates and therefore on
current investment.
    Third, the pecuniary externality generates a dynamic macroeconomic complemen-
tarity. Because interest rates are endogenous and influence risk-taking, the anticipation
of low aggregate investment in the future feeds back into low aggregate investment in


                                           13
the present. Low levels of investment can thus be self-sustaining for long periods of
time. This dynamic macroeconomic complementarity is the basis of amplification and
persistence over the business cycle. The reader may be familiar with a standard ex-
ample of macroeconomic complementarity — the production externalities considered by
Bryant (1983) and Benhabib and Farmer (1994).14 In this literature, an individual’s
marginal productivity is assumed to increase in the aggregate stock of capital, which
generates a complementarity in investment. Note that this type of production external-
ity is exogenous and ad hoc. In contrast, the complementarity in our model is a genuine
general-equilibrium implication of a market imperfection.
    Fourth, the macroeconomic complementarity between future and current investment
may generate multiple steady states and endogenous cycles. An earlier version of the
paper (Angeletos and Calvet, 2000) establishes that our model can generate self-fulfilling
equilibria, such as poverty traps and endogenous fluctuations. Our work thus contributes
to the literature on equilibrium indeterminacy (e.g., Benhabib and Farmer, 1994). Such
phenomena, however, only occur when idiosyncratic risks are very large or agents are
very impatient. Thus, they do not arise for the plausible parameter values considered in
the simulations. For this reason, this paper focuses on the eﬀects of incomplete markets
in economies with a unique stable steady state.
    Finally, the propagation mechanism is likely to extend to any framework where the
private risk premium on investment is higher at the onset of an economic downturn.
This premise is obviously much more general than our specific model. Consider for
instance an economy with both incomplete insurance and credit-market imperfections.
We expect that a risk-averse agent will take less risk and thus invest less in the present
when he anticipates a higher borrowing rate, a higher probability to use credit, or a
higher probability to face a binding borrowing constraint at a future date. As long as
credit conditions worsen during recessions, the anticipation of a downturn in the near
future will raise risk premia and discourage investment in the present, thus making the
recession partially self-fulfilling. Note that this eﬀect occurs whether or not current
investment is financially constrained.

Local Dynamics and Numerical Simulation
The local dynamics around the steady state can be approximated by (Kt+1 − K∞ ) =
λ(Kt − K∞ ), where λ is the stable eigenvalue of the Jacobian of the dynamic system
(4.1)-(4.3) evaluated at the steady state. The quantity 1−λ gives the rate of convergence
to the steady state. Incomplete insurance slows down convergence if 1 − λ decreases
with σ A .
    In Figure 3 we illustrate the impact of idiosyncratic production risk on the conver-
gence rate for the same numerical example as in Figure 2. We also report the half-life of

      Cooper (1999) provides an overview of macroeconomic complementarities.


                                                 14
an aggregate wealth shock.15 The convergence rate decreases rapidly with σ A . With a
narrow definition of capital (α = 0.35, Panel B), the half-life of a shock almost doubles
as σ A increases from 0 to 100%. The eﬀect is even stronger when incompleteness aﬀects
both physical and human capital (α = 0.7, Panel A).16
    These results suggest that production risk could generate additional persistence over
the business cycle in standard RBC models with aggregate uncertainty (e.g. Kydland
and Prescott, 1982). Furthermore, the magnitude of uninsurable productivity shocks
appears as a potential determinant of both the steady state and conditional convergence.
Cross-country variation in the degree of risk sharing may thus help explain the large
diversity of productivity levels and growth rates around the world (e.g. Barro, 1997;
Jones, 1997).

7. Concluding Remarks

This paper examines a standard neoclassical growth economy with heterogeneous agents,
decentralized production, and uninsurable production and endowment risks. Under a
CARA-normal specification for preferences and risks, we obtain closed-form solutions for
individual choices and aggregate dynamics. Uninsurable production shocks introduce a
risk premium on private equity and reduce the aggregate demand for investment. As a
result, the steady-state capital stock tends to be lower under incomplete markets, despite
the low risk-free rate induced by the precautionary motive. Moreover, the endogenous
countercyclicality of private risk premia amplify the impact of an exogenous aggregate
shock on output and investment, slows down convergence to the steady state, and
increases the persistence of the business cycle.
    The tractability of our setup easily generalizes to multiple sectors. For instance,
each agent can have access to two private technologies: one with high risk and high
mean return, and another with low risk and low return. We can also consider several
forms of investment, such as physical, human or intangible capital. In such an envi-
ronment, incomplete risk sharing distorts not only the aggregate levels of savings and
investment, but also the cross-sectoral allocation of capital and labor. This additional
eﬀect reduces aggregate productivity and implies a further reduction in steady-state
capital and income.17 The anticipation of stringent future credit conditions in the near
  15
     The half-life τ of a deviation from the steady state is defined by λτ = 1/2, or τ = − log2 λ.
  16
     Figure 3 also demonstrates the asymmetry between production and endowment risk. While en-
dowment risk does not introduce a dynamic macroeconomic complementarity, the precautionary motive
tends to boost savings above the steady state and thus speed up convergence in an initially poor econ-
omy. The convergence rate thus tends to decrease with σA but increase with σe . When σA and σe are
equal, the investment eﬀect dominates and the convergence rate is lower than under complete markets.
  17
     A multi-sector extension of our paper would thus complement the endogenous-growth literature
examining the eﬀect of uninsurable investment risks on the allocation of savings across diﬀerent invest-



                                                  15
future induces agents to forego the high-risk high-return investment opportunities. The
economy thus shifts to safer but less productive technologies during downturns, which
further increases the persistence and the amplitude of the business cycle.
    Wealth heterogeneity, credit-market imperfections and non-convexities in production
have been viewed by many authors as a source of macroeconomic persistence. Although
these departures from the neoclassical growth model are not considered here, we find
that incomplete risk sharing alone is suﬃcient to generate underinvestment and intro-
duce a powerful propagation mechanism. The presence of uninsurable production risks
reduces the individual’s willingness to invest. Introducing borrowing constraints would
in addition restrict the ability to undertake risky projects and increase the sensitivity
of risk premia and investment demand to future credit conditions. While CARA pref-
erences rule out wealth eﬀects on risk taking, the private equity premium is likely to
be even more countercyclical when risk taking increases with wealth.18 The impact of
credit constraints and wealth on risk premia could thus reinforce the steady-state and
business-cycle eﬀects identified in this paper.
    In conclusion, we anticipate that the impact of risk premia on investment repre-
sents a source of amplification and persistence that is much more general than our
specific model. The next step is to construct a full-fledged RBC model with isoelastic
preferences, decentralized production, borrowing constraints, and both aggregate and
idiosyncratic production uncertainty. This extension would permit a careful quantita-
tive evaluation of the interaction between risk premia and business cycles. It would also
help us reassess the impact of wealth heterogeneity on aggregate dynamics. Idiosyn-
cratic entrepreneurial and capital-income risk may also have important implications for
asset pricing.19 We leave these questions open for future research.

production (Greenwood and Jovanovic, 1990; Obstfeld, 1994), or physical and human capital (Krebs,
2002).

investment is then complemented by the impact of future wealth.
   19
      As long as some agents hold both private and public equity, anticipated financial conditions are
likely to aﬀect the market price of risk. This intuition is consistent with the empirical evidence in
Heaton and Lucas (2000) that proprietary income risk has a strong impact on portfolio holdings.

Appendix
Proof of Proposition 1 (Individual Choice)
    In the main text, we solve the decision problem of an agent with expected utility (Γ =
1/Ψ). We derive here the optimal choice choice of an Epstein-Zin agent. An educated
guess is that the agent has linear value function Jt (w) = at w + bt , and consumption
policy ct = ât wt + b̂t . Since wt is normal, the certainty equivalent of Jt+1 (wt+1 ) is
Jt+1 (Et wt+1 − Γ2t Vart wt+1 ). The agent solves in period t the optimization problem:
                                                ·     µ                     ¶¸
                                                                 Γt
              u[Jt (wt )] = max u(ct ) + βu Jt+1 Et wt+1 − Vart wt+1 .                 (7.1)
                            (cjt ,ktj ,θjt )                     2

We know that Et wt+1 = f (kt+1 )+(1−δ)kt+1 +(1+rt )θt and Vart wt+1 = σ 2e +f (kt+1 )2 σ 2A .
It is convenient to consider the function G(kt+1 , Γt ) ≡ f (kt+1 ) + (1 − δ)kt+1 − Γt [σ 2e +
f (kt+1 )2 σ 2A ]/2. The agent thus maximizes

                        u(ct ) + βu{ Jt+1 [(1 + rt )θt + G(kt+1 , Γt )] },               (7.2)

subject to ct + kt+1 + θt = wt . The FOCs with respect to kt+1 and θt give

             u0 (ct ) = βu0 (Jt+1 ) at+1 {1 − δ + f 0 (kt+1 )[1 − Γt f (kt+1 )σ 2A ]},
             u0 (ct ) = βu0 (Jt+1 ) at+1 (1 + rt ).

Dividing these equalities yields 1 + rt = 1 − δ + f 0 (kt+1 )[1 − Γt f (kt+1 )σ 2A ].
    We now write the envelope condition: u0 [Jt (wt )]at = u0 (ct ), or equivalently ct =
                                     at = at and bbt = bt − Ψ ln at . We then rewrite the FOC
at wt + bt − Ψ ln at . We infer that b
with respect to θt as
                                      ·     µ                         ¶¸
                                                        Γt

                                                        2
                                   µ                                                  ¶

                 = β(1 + rt )u at+1 Et wt+1 − at+1 Vart wt+1 + bt+1 − Ψ ln at+1 .
                                                 2

      at+1 = at+1 and bbt+1 = bt+1 − Ψ ln at+1 , the FOC reduces to
Since b

                       u0 (ct ) = β(1 + rt )u0 [Et ct+1 −ΓVart (ct+1 )/2] ,

which implies Euler condition (3.6).
                                                                     at )wt −kt+1 −bbt .
   The budget constraint and the consumption rule imply that θt = (1−b
Since b
      at = at , we infer from the Euler condition (3.6) that

   at wt + bt = at+1 (1 − at )wt +
                       h                          i
                +at+1 G(kt+1 , Γt+1 ) − kt+1 − bbt + bt+1 − Ψ ln[βat+1 (1 + rt )/at ].

                                                17
Since this linear relation holds for every wt , we conclude that at = at+1 Rt (1 − at ) or
equivalently at = 1/[1 + (at+1 Rt )−1 ]. Iterating forward yields (3.4).
     We now turn to the comparative statics. Since Vart (wt+1 ) = σ 2e + σ 2A f (kt+1 )2 ,
we infer that ∂Vart (wt+1 )/∂σ 2e > 0. On the other hand, ∂Vart (wt+1 )/∂σ 2A = f (kt+1 )2 +
[2σ 2A f (kt+1 )f 0 (kt+1 )](∂kt+1 /∂σ 2A ) has an ambiguous sign. Consider the special case f (k) =
√                               p                        p
  k. The FOC rt + δ = (2 kt+1 )−1 (1 − Γt σ 2A kt+1 ) implies kt+1 = [Γt σ 2A + 2(δ + rt )]−2 .
                                j
We conclude that Vart (wt+1         ) = σ 2e + σ 2A /[Γt σ 2A + 2(δ + rt )]2 is a single-peaked function
of σ A . QED

Proof of Proposition 2 (General Equilibrium)
    We now derive the equations characterizing general equilibrium. First, note that
(3.4) implies ajt = at and Γjt = Γt for all j, t. We infer from the optimality condition
            j
(3.5) that kt+1   = Kt+1 for all j. Equation (3.5) then reduces to (4.2) and the Euler
equation (3.6) can be rewritten as

                                                      Γa2t+1 2
                     Et cjt+1 − cjt = Ψ ln(βRt ) +          [σ e + f (Kt+1 )σ 2A ].
                                                        2
We aggregate these equalities across agents and infer (4.3). Finally, the aggregation
of budget constraints yields (4.1). Existence and local determinacy are examined in
Angeletos and Calvet (2000). QED

Proof of Proposition 3 (Steady State)
    A. Existence. The steady state is defined by the system (5.1) − (5.2). The second
equation implies r∞ ≤ β −1 − 1. The transversality condition imposes that r∞ > 0
and Γ∞ > 0. The interest rate r∞ therefore belongs to the intervals (0, β −1 − 1]. Since
r∞ > 0, the first equation implies f 0 (K∞ ) > δ, or equivalently K∞ < K        b ≡ (f 0 )−1 (δ).
The capital stock K∞ is thus contained in the interval [0, K).    b
    Each steady-state equation implicitly defines the interest rate as a function of the
capital stock. Consider for instance equation (5.2). It is useful to define the functions
X : (0, β −1 − 1] → [0, +∞), X(r) ≡ 2Ψ           1 2        1                  b         2 2
                                          Γ (1 + r ) ln[ β(1+r) ], and V : [0, K) → [σ e , σ e +
   b 2 σ 2 ), V (K) ≡ σ 2e + f (K)2 σ 2 . We observe that X is decreasing in r and V is
f (K)    A                              A
increasing in K. The steady state equation (5.2) is equivalent to X(r) = V (K). For
              b the equation X(r) = V (K) has a unique solution, r2 (K) ≡ X −1 [V (K)],
each K ∈ [0, K),
which maps [0, +∞) onto (0, X −1 (σ 2e )] ⊆ (0, β −1 −1]. Similarly, the steady state equation
(5.1) implicitly defines a decreasing function r1 (K), which maps (0, K]     b onto [0, +∞).
The steady state K∞ is given by the intersection of r1 and r2 .
    Consider the function ∆(K) ≡ r2 (K)−r1 (K). When K → 0, we know that r1 (K) →
+∞ and r2 (K) is bounded, implying ∆(K) → −∞. Since ∆(K)              b = r2 (K)b > 0, there
exists at least one steady state for any (σ A , σ e ). Under complete markets, the steady


                                                 18
state is unique since the function r2 is constant and r1 is decreasing. By continuity, the
steady state is also unique when σ A and σ e are suﬃciently small.
      B. Comparative Statics. Consider the functions r1 and r2 defined in the proof
of Theorem 2. Observe that r1 (K) and r2 (K) are both decreasing. We know that
|r10 (K∞ )| > |r20 (K∞ )| when the steady state is unique. An increase in σ e leaves the
function r1 (K) unchanged and pushes down the function r2 (K). The steady state is
therefore characterized by a lower interest rate and a higher capital stock. An increase
in σ A reduces both r1 (K) and r2 (K), reflecting the fact that σ A enters in both the
investment demand and the savings supply. σ A can therefore have ambiguous eﬀects,
as verified in simulations. QED

Calibrated Economies
    We now examine in detail the calibration of Γ and Ψ, which allows the comparison
between our CARA economy and the standard isoelastic setup used in RBC models.
Relative risk aversion at the steady-state consumption level is ΓC∞ . We restrict the
incomplete-market economy so that ΓC∞ remains invariant at a fixed level γ.
    We next consider Ψ. The elasticity of intertemporal substitution (EIS) is equal to
Ψ/C∞ at the steady state consumption level. Similar to the calibration of risk aversion,
we could restrict Ψ/C∞ to remain constant at a fixed level ψ. In Angeletos and Calvet
(2000), we adopted this method and the additional restriction Ψ = 1/Γ (expected
utility). We found that typically idiosyncratic production risks strongly reduce the
convergence rate to the steady state, confirming the predictions contained in Section 4.
    In this paper, however, we propose a more elaborate calibration method that stems
from the following observation. Consider a complete-market Ramsey economy with
                      P
intertemporal utility +∞      t
                         t=0 β u(ct ), where u is a smooth strictly concave function. Gross
output is Φ(K) = f (K) + (1 − δ)K. The local dynamics around the steady state are
approximated by (Kt+1 − K∞ ) ≈ λ(Kt − K∞ ), where λ is the stable eigenvalue of the
linearized system. It is easy to show that20
              ½                                  r                                ¾
            1           −1                  1                                   4
        λ=      1 + β(β − 1 + δ)M∞ + − [1 + β(β −1 − 1 + δ)M∞ ]2 −                  ,
            2                               β                                   β

where M∞ quantifies the relative curvatures of the production and utility functions:

                                               f 00 (K∞ )/f 0 (K∞ )
                                      M∞ =                          .
                                               u00 (C∞ )/u0 (C∞ )

The eigenvalue λ is thus fully determined by (β, δ) and M∞ . With a Cobb-Douglas
production f (K) = K α and a CARA utility u(C) = Ψ exp(−C/Ψ), the ratio M∞
 20
      Cass (1965) derives a similar result for continuous time economies.



                                                    19
reduces to (1 − α)Ψ/K∞ . Under complete markets, the convergence rate g = 1 − λ is
thus fully determined by the parameters (α, β, δ) and the ratio Ψ/K∞ .
    When we move from complete to incomplete markets, two phenomena aﬀect the
eigenvalue λ. First, the transitional dynamics are aﬀected by new terms in (4.2) and
(4.3): the risk premium in the investment-demand equation and the consumption vari-
ance in the Euler equation. Second, changes in the steady state aﬀect the relative
curvature Ψ/K∞ and thereby the eigenvalue λ. This second eﬀect reflects the shift of
the steady-state to diﬀerent points on the production and utility functions. It is thus
purely mechanical and sheds little light on the impact of incomplete risk sharing on the
transitional dynamics. For this reason, we prefer to neutralize this eﬀect by keeping
Ψ/K∞ (or equivalently M∞ ) invariant at a prespecified level as we vary σ A and σ e .21
This in turn requires an appropriate calibration of Ψ/K∞ . When markets are complete,
we impose that the intertemporal elasticity Ψ/C∞ be equal to a given coeﬃcient ψ.
This allows us to choose a value of ψ that matches empirical estimates of the EIS. A
simple calculation also implies C∞ /K∞ = Y∞ /K∞ −δ, where Y∞ /K∞ = (β −1 −1+δ)/α.
Therefore, Ψ/K∞ = ψC∞ /K∞ = ψ[(β −1 −1+δ)/α−δ] under complete markets. When
markets are incomplete, we keep Ψ/K∞ invariant at its complete-market level. Our cal-
ibration thus disentangles the dynamic eﬀect of financial incompleteness from purely
mechanical changes in the relative curvatures of the production and utility functions.22
    To summarize, a calibrated economy E cal = (T, β, γ, ψ, α, δ, σ A , σ e ) is thus an incom-
plete market economy E = (β 0 , Γ, Ψ, f, δ 0 , σ 0A , σ 0e ) such that β 0 = β T , 1 − δ 0 = (1 − δ)T ,
ΓC∞ = γ, Ψ/K∞ = ψ[(β 0−1 − 1 + δ 0 )/α − δ 0 ], f (k) = kα , σ 0A = σ A , and σ 0e = σ e f (K∞ ).

Proof of Proposition 4 (Calibrated Steady State)
    We consider E cal = (T = 1, β, γ, ψ, α, δ, σ A , σ e ), and without loss of generality derive
the proof in the case T = 1. Let q∞ = f (K∞ )/K∞ = K∞                  α−1 denote the output-

capital ratio in the steady state. The marginal productivity can then be rewritten
as f 0 (K∞ ) = αq∞ , and the consumption-capital ratio as C∞ /K∞ = q∞ − δ. When
markets are complete, the interest rate is r∗ = β −1 − 1 and the output-capital ratio is
q ∗ = (β −1 − 1 + δ)/α. For any economy, the calibration imposes that ΓC∞ = γ and
  21
      The alternative calibration method, which keeps constant the EIS Ψ/C∞ at ψ but lets Ψ/K∞ vary,
also implies a very substantial increase in persistence when σA increases from zero. But, because K∞
typically decreases with σA , the change in Ψ/K∞ tends to reduce persistence. For large production
risks, the convergence rate g = 1 − λ is then slightly non-monotonic in σA in some simulations, but
remains far below the complete market value.
   22
      Our calibration method also has the following alternative interpretation. Instead of adjusting the
EIS around the incomplete-markets steady state, we can set it at a predetermined level Ψ/C∞ = ψ, but
assume that the production function is exponential rather than Cobb-Douglas: f (K) = 1 − exp(−φK).
We calibrate the coeﬃcient φ by setting the income share of capital equal to α in the complete-market
steady state. This specification exactly the same calibrated steady state and convergence rate.



                                                  20
Ψ/K∞ = ψ(q ∗ − δ). The steady state system (5.1) − (5.2) can then be rewritten:

                                                                  γx2∞ 2
          r∞ + δ = f 0 (K∞ )(1 − γx∞ σ 2A ), ln[β(1 + r∞ )] = −       (σ + σ 2e ),   (7.3)
                                                                  ψz∞ A
               q∞                       ∗
where x∞ =           r∞
              q∞ −δ 1+r∞   and z∞ = 2 qq∞−δ
                                         −δ . When σ A = σ e = 0 (complete markets),
                                 ∗
we know that x∞ = (1 − β) q∗q−δ and z∞ = 2. When σ 2A is positive but close to
0, the first-order variations in r∞ and K∞ are obtained by diﬀerentiating the system
                                                2
(7.3). The second equation implies dr∞ = − γx         2
                                              2ψβ d(σ A ). We then infer from the first

equation that f (K∞ )dK∞ = dr∞ + γx∞ f (K∞ )d(σ A ) or equivalently f 00 (K∞ )dK∞ =

                               ψ=                         .
                                     2[1 − β + βδ(1 − α)]

It follows that dK∞ /d(σ 2A ) < 0 if and only if ψ > ψ. QED

FIGURE 2. We present a numerical simulation of the steady state. The time period (the life of an
idiosyncratic production shock) is five years, the discount and depreciation rates are 5% per year, the
degree of relative risk aversion is 4, and the elasticity of intertemporal substitution is 1. The income share
of capital is 70% in Panel A and 35% in Panel B. The solid lines correspond to σe = 0 (no idiosyncratic
endowment risk) and the dashed ones to σe = 50% of steady-state GDP. We plot the steady-state levels of
the capital stock, the interest rate, and the marginal product of capital (MPK), as idiosyncratic production
risk σA varies between zero and 100% of steady-state GDP.
