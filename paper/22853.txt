                                          ABSTRACT

Recent research has documented that delaying the commencement of Social Security benefits
increases the expected present value of retirement income for most people. Despite this research,
the vast majority of individuals claim Social Security at or before full retirement age. Claiming
Social Security early is not necessarily a mistake, as delaying Social Security commencement
requires forgoing current income in exchange for future income. The decision to claim early
could therefore rationally be driven by liquidity constraints, mortality concerns, bequest motives,
a high time discount rate, or a variety of other preference related factors. However, for some
individuals, delaying Social Security offers a significant arbitrage opportunity because they can
defer Social Security and have higher income in all future years. Arbitrage exists for most
primary earners who either purchase a retail-priced annuity or opt for a defined benefit annuity
when a lump sum payout is offered, while forgoing the opportunity to defer Social Security.
These individuals are essentially buying an expensive annuity when a cheaper one is available,
and their decision to claim Social Security early is almost certainly a mistake. The magnitude of
the mistake can reach up to approximately $250,000.

    1. Introduction

        Social Security retired worker benefits can be claimed at any age between 62 and 70. Individuals

who claim later receive higher monthly benefits, an actuarial adjustment that is supposed to account for

the fact that they will collect benefits for fewer total months. Delaying Social Security is equivalent to

purchasing an inflation-indexed life annuity, as individuals who delay forgo current benefits in exchange

for higher future benefits plus cost-of-living adjustments. A growing literature suggests that delaying

Social Security increases the expected present value of retirement income for most primary earners and

singles (e.g., Meyer and Reicherstein 2010; Munnell and Soto 2005; Shoven and Slavov 2014a,b).

However, it is very difficult to say whether any given individual should defer Social Security. Individual

preferences could be such that delaying Social Security actually lowers utility (e.g. due to poor health,

liquidity constraints, high time discounts, or bequest motives).

        In contrast to this literature, we are able to make much stronger positive statements. In this

paper, we find that many people have the opportunity to make an arbitrage profit by selling (implicitly)

an expensive annuity, and using the proceeds to purchase a cheaper supplemental Social Security

annuity by delaying commencement of Social Security benefits. This arbitrage opportunity is available to

individuals who are considering either purchasing a retail-priced annuity or taking a defined benefit

annuity when a lump sum settlement is offered by their employer. Taking advantage of the arbitrage

opportunity involves forgoing the defined benefit annuity and taking the lump sum payout instead, or

forgoing the purchase of a retail-priced annuity. The funds from either the lump sum payout or the

forgoing of the retail annuity would be used to delay the commencement of Social Security benefits.

        Classic arbitrage occurs when one can simultaneously buy and sell the same asset and earn a

riskless profit from differences in the market price of the asset. A more general definition of an arbitrage

opportunity is a strategy whose payout in every state of the world and every period is non-negative, and

whose payout in at least one state of the world is strictly positive. Arbitrage opportunities are usually


                                                     2
small and fleeting in competitive financial markets, but this is not necessarily so when prices are set by

the government. Such is the case for Social Security inflation-indexed life annuities, which are priced by

federal government legislation and which co-exist with more expensive private annuities. If an individual

can strategically plan Social Security claiming so as to achieve an arbitrage profit but ignores this

opportunity, we can confidently say that the individual is making a mistake.

        The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the prior research and explains

our contribution to the literature. Section 3 provides institutional background on Social Security and

pension payout choices. Section 4 presents some illustrative examples. Section 5 generalizes the

arbitrage argument. Section 6 discusses tax considerations. Section 7 presents empirical evidence on the

extent to which individuals forgo arbitrage opportunities. Section 8 provides a discussion and concludes.



    2. Related Literature

        A number of papers have demonstrated that the expected value of deferring Social Security is

positive for a large subset of individuals (e.g., Meyer and Reichenstein 2010; Munnell and Soto 2005;

Sass, Sun, and Webb 2007, 2013; Coile et al. 2002; Mahaney and Carlson 2007; Shoven and Slavov

2014a,b). Studies that focus on more recent cohorts have generally found larger expected gains from

delay (Meyer and Reicherstein 2010; Munnell and Soto 2005; Shoven and Slavov 2014a,b). In particular,

Shoven and Slavov (2014a,b) show that when today’s historically low interest rates are taken into

account, the majority of individuals can gain from delay. Measured in terms of expected utility, the gains

from delay are even larger due to the length-of-life insurance that Social Security provides (Sun and

Webb 2009). Delaying Social Security is of greatest benefit to primary earners in married couples, since

the secondary earner can continue to receive these benefits if she or he is widowed. Thus, delay has the

added benefit of reducing widow poverty (Sass, Sun, and Webb, 2013).




                                                    3
        In all of these expected monetary value and expected utility calculations, Social Security deferral

reduces income initially. This means that deferral does not increase expected utility for individuals with

sufficiently high time discount rates or mortality risks, or for individuals who face liquidity constraints or

have strong bequest motives. 1 Similarly, regardless of ex ante preferences, delay does not increase

realized utility in states of the world where the individual dies much earlier than expected. Thus, in

order to argue that people are making a mistake by not delaying, one needs to be certain that one is

using the correct utility function. We contribute to this literature by showing that some individuals are

absolutely better-off by changing how they use their private pension assets and also choosing to delay

the commencement of Social Security, receiving the same or higher income in all periods and states of

the world. For these individuals, delaying Social Security is a good choice regardless of mortality risk,

time preference, bequest motives, or liquidity.

        A related strand of literature examines individuals’ decisions to annuitize income. One key

theme in this literature is that many individuals fail to annuitize income even though annuitization

would appear to increase expected utility (e.g., Yaari 1965; Mitchell et al. 1999; Brown, Casey, and

Mitchell 2007). Some studies have specifically examined determinants of the choice to annuitize income

from employer-based defined benefit plans (e.g., Hurd, Lillard, and Panis 1998; Bütler and Teppa 2007;

and Mottola and Utkus 2007) or defined contribution plans (e.g., Brown 2001). Our work also

contributes to this literature by jointly examining the lump sum versus annuity choice and the Social

Security claiming decision. We provide the insight that annuitizing pension wealth can be suboptimal for

an individual who also claims Social Security early.

        Several other studies have documented situations in which individuals appear to be forgoing

arbitrage profit. For example, Choi, Laibson, and Madrian (2011) examine data from a set of companies


1
 Indeed, some empirical studies have demonstrated a correlation between actual or perceived mortality risk and
early claiming (Hurd,Smith, and Zissimopoulos 2004; Glickman and Hermes 2015; Beauchamp and Wagner 2012;
Waldron 2002; Goda et al. 2015).

                                                       4
and document that more than one third of employees aged 59½ or older contribute less to their 401(K)

plans than the amount that would maximize their employer-provided matching contribution, despite the

fact that they are immediately vested in the matching contribution and can make penalty-free

withdrawals. The magnitude of the forgone income is around $500 per year for the years between age

59½ and retirement, and the total arbitrage profit amounts to $3,250 for those retiring at age 66.

Amromin, Huang, and Sialm (2007) show that more than a third of households could realize tax

arbitrage gains from contributing to a tax-deferred retirement account and paying off their mortgage

more slowly. These arbitrage gains amount to roughly $400 per year, over the years remaining in the

mortgage. At the upper end of the range, if 30 years remain for repayment, the arbitrage gains can

reach $15,000. Finally, Li and Smith (2010) show that around half of the individuals in their sample could

realize arbitrage gains on the order of $200-$275 per year by using 401(k) loans to pay off credit card

debt. An upper bound estimate of the total arbitrage profit is $13,750 over a 50-year horizon. Compared

to these studies, the potential arbitrage gains we find are much larger. For low-income individuals aged

69, arbitrage gains can amount to about $9,000. For individuals with average earnings in their early 60s,

the gains are greater than $100,000. For those with high earnings, arbitrage gains can reach $250,000.



    3. Institutional Background

         An individual can begin Social Security retirement benefits at any age between 62 and 70, with

100% of the retirement benefit (referred to as the primary insurance amount, or PIA) payable at the full

retirement age (which is 66 for individuals born between 1943 and 1954). Claiming benefits before the

full retirement age results in a reduced monthly benefit. 2 An early claim by the higher earner in a

married couple also reduces the survivor benefit paid to the lower earner of the couple in the event that


2
 Individuals who claim before full retirement age but continue to earn above a threshold income level are subject
to the earnings test, which effectively forces them to delay part of their benefit, receiving the actuarial adjustment
described in this paragraph.

                                                          5
the higher earner dies first. 3 Similarly, claiming benefits after age 66 and up to age 70 (the maximum

deferral age) results in a higher monthly benefit for both the individual and the surviving spouse. For

claims prior to full retirement age, the monthly benefit is reduced by 5/9ths of one percent of PIA for

each month between 1 and 36 months and 5/12ths of one percent of PIA for each additional month. For

claims after full retirement age, the monthly benefit increases by 2/3rds of one percent of PIA per

month up to 48 months. Although many individuals appear to link retirement timing to the

commencement of Social Security benefits, the two decisions can be made independently.

         Retirees with an employer-based defined benefit plan are usually offered an option to receive

their benefit in the form of a life annuity (single-life or joint and survivor annuities are typically offered).

Many plans also offer the option to take all or part of the benefit as a lump sum. 4 The IRS provides the

interest rates and mortality rates that employers must use to calculate the lump sum cash-out value

(see appendix A for the most current interest and mortality rates). 5 Retirees with defined contribution

plans or other forms of retirement savings can purchase annuities, either from an insurance company in

the retail market or by choosing to annuitize a portion of their retirement savings (e.g., through a TIAA-

CREF plan). Alternatively, retirees can choose not to annuitize, a decision that can be thought of as

taking the defined contribution funds or other savings as a lump sum. Yakoboski (2013) shows that

around 40 percent of TIAA-CREF retirees choose to annuitize their defined contribution balances.

  The widow receives the larger of the deceased spouse’s actual benefit and 82.5% of the deceased spouse’s PIA
(see Weaver 2002 for additional details). In the arbitrage calculations that follow we do not take into account the
82.5% floor on widow benefits. We simply assume the widow receives the deceased spouse’s actual benefit. In
situations where the 82.5% floor applies (when the primary earner claims before 63 and 5 months), delaying Social
Security is not equivalent to a 100% joint and survivor annuity. Therefore, strictly speaking, the arbitrage argument
cannot be made. However, we believe this difference is likely to be small – i.e., something very close to an
arbitrage opportunity exists.
4
  According to Bureau of Labor Statistics data from 2010 (the latest available), 24% of private sector workers in
traditional defined benefit plans and 98% of workers in non-traditional defined benefit plans had a full or partial
lump-sum option at normal retirement age. (See Bureau of Labor Statistics, National Compensation Survey: Health
and Retirement Plan Provisions in Private Industry in the United States, 2010, Table 33.)
5
  Employers may use different discount rates but the lump sum value cannot be below the value calculated when
using the IRS rates. A more generous lump sum only strengthens our arbitrage argument.

                                                         6
         In the analysis below we show that choosing to collect defined benefit or retail annuities while

also choosing to claim Social Security early is dominated by the option of taking the retirement savings

as a lump sum and using it to defer Social Security. That is to say, the first choice is a “can’t win strategy”

relative to the alternative option. Switching from the annuity to the lump sum and deferring the

commencement of Social Security produces either the same or higher income in all years and states of

the world. Other combinations of decisions regarding pension accumulations and Social Security

claiming (such as choosing to defer Social Security and annuitizing retirement savings, or taking

retirement savings as a lump sum and claiming Social Security early) are not dominated by other options

and the value of these strategies depends on the health, time discount rate, liquidity, and other

preferences of the individual (and his or her spouse).



    4. Illustrative Examples

         A few simplified examples will illustrate the various arbitrage opportunities we examine.

Consider John, who is single and at age 66 claims an annual Social Security benefit of $12,500. John also

uses his retirement savings to purchase an inflation-indexed, single-life retail annuity that pays him

$1,000 annually, starting immediately. The cost of this annuity is $22,290, or $22.29 per $1 of annual

lifetime income. 6 All told, John pays $22,290 out of pocket, and enjoys $13,500 in inflation protected

lifetime annual income.

         We would argue that John has made a costly mistake. Given John’s age, he has the opportunity

to delay claiming Social Security. If he delays by one year, his Social Security benefit increases by 8

percent. In this case, delaying a year increases John’s annual benefit from $12,500 to $13,500. Thus,

after the delay period, John’s income is exactly the same as it was under his original strategy. During the

first year, John’s income is even higher as he has access to the $22,290 that he would have used to

6
 In these examples, all annuity prices refer to Principal Life quotes retrieved on August 23, 2016. Principal Life was
used because their annual CPI adjustment process most closely follows the Social Security process.

                                                          7
purchase the annuity. By deferring Social Security, John can increase his annual real lifetime income by

$1,000 for a one-time cost of $13,500. In effect, Social Security is offering to sell John an inflation-

indexed annuity for $13.50 per $1 of annual lifetime income, much lower than the retail annuity cost of

$22.29 per $1 of annual lifetime income

        This example highlights two key points. First, deferring Social Security is equivalent to

purchasing an annuity. In this case, the deferral based annuity costs $13.50 per $1 of income. Second,

since the deferral annuity is cheaper, there is a clear arbitrage opportunity. Compared to John’s original

strategy, the new strategy that eschews the retail annuity purchase (an implicit annuity sell), and

purchases the Social Security annuity (an annuity buy) earns a risk free arbitrage profit of $8,790. Note

that, by itself, purchasing the retail annuity is not necessarily a mistake. Moreover, claiming Social

Security at age 66 could also be justified under certain conditions. However, the combination of

purchasing of a retail annuity and claiming Social Security at age 66 is clearly a mistake in that there is an

alternative strategy that replicates the payouts at a lower cost.

        This same basic argument can be applied to other situations. For example, if John is a married

primary earner, then an increase to his Social Security benefit last for as long as either John or his

spouse is alive. John could also buy this type of income boost in the retail market by purchasing an

inflation-indexed annuity with a 100% joint and survivor provision. Assuming his spouse is also 66, the

cost of a retail annuity that provides $1,000 in annual income is $28,547, or $28.55 per $1 of annual

lifetime income. But the cost of the Social Security annuity is still $13,500 – a better than half off sale! In

this case, avoiding the retail annuity and purchasing the Social Security annuity earns a risk free gain of

$15,047.

        Very few people purchase inflation protected annuities, so what happens if someone purchases

a nominal annuity instead? Suppose John is single and purchases a nominal annuity paying out $1,000

per year. The cost of this annuity is $15,268. Does unwinding this purchase and delaying Social Security


                                                      8
for a year offer an arbitrage profit? The answer is yes. John is paying $15.27 per $1 of nominal income,

and he could purchase $1 of real annual income from Social Security for $13.50. With a retail annuity,

John can spend $15,268 and receive an extra $1,000 in nominal annual income for life. By deferring

Social Security, John can spend $13,500 and receive an extra $1,000 in inflation indexed annual income

for life.7 The Social Security annuity income costs less, and its cash flows are higher if there is positive

inflation and the same if there is zero inflation or deflation. 8 The difference in prices, $15,268 - $13,500

= $1,768, represents the arbitrage profit in this case. If John were married, a 100% joint and survivor

nominal annuity would cost $18,797. Since John can buy a Social Security joint and survivor real annuity

for the same price as the single-life annuity ($13,500), he would again be absolutely better off deferring

Social Security and forgoing the retail annuity.

           In the unmarried example, the arbitrage profit when John purchased a retail real annuity was

$8,790. When John purchased the retail nominal annuity, the arbitrage profit dropped to $1,768. The

arbitrage profit in the case of real retail annuity is higher because the cash flows from the real retail

annuity exactly match the cash flows from the Social Security deferral annuity. Thus, the value

difference between the strategies was concentrated in the immediate arbitrage profit. However, when

John buys a nominal annuity, the future payouts do not match exactly due to inflation, where the Social

Security payouts are equal or larger than the retail nominal annuity payouts. In this case, the total value

of deferral is split between an immediate arbitrage profit of $1,768 and later value from increased

payouts when there is positive inflation. Since we want to identify situations in which deferral yields

higher payouts in all possible states of the world - including states with zero inflation or deflation - we

focus on the immediate arbitrage profit. However, it should still be noted that significant additional

value is often available from Social Security deferral above and beyond the arbitrage profit.



7
    Note that because the indexing occurs annually, real and nominal payouts are equivalent in the first year.
8
    Nominal Social Security benefits do not decrease in the event of deflation.

                                                           9
        The same logic applies to a cash-out opportunity from a corporate defined benefit plan. Suppose

John is a married primary earner, and he is eligible for a defined benefit pension that offers an annual

$1,000 nominal joint and survivor annuity. John also has the option of taking a lump sum cash-out of

$16,275. 9 While we cannot say for sure what John’s optimal strategy is, we can say that taking the

$1,000 defined benefit annuity and claiming Social Security at age 66 is a mistake. As in the examples

above, John could take the $16,275 lump sum, receive an extra $1,000 per year (in real terms) by

deferring Social Security for one year, and come out ahead by $16,275 - $13,500 = $2,275. The real

$1,000 per year Social Security annuity also is more valuable than the nominal $1,000 defined benefit

annuity.

        If John were single, the lump sum for the $1,000 annual pension payment would only be

$13,771 and yet it is still higher than the cost of the incremental $1,000 from Social Security, costing

$13,500. However, we note that the arbitrage profit is small, and a slight increase in the IRS minimum

present value segment rates could shift this number below the cost of the Social Security annuity. If that

were to occur, we could no longer be certain that John’s current strategy is inferior, since John would

need to pay out-of-pocket the difference between the defined benefits lump-sum value and $13,500.

John may still be much better off using the deferral strategy, since inflation protection is very valuable.

However, this situation would not qualify as an arbitrage opportunity.

        To provide intuition for the arbitrage opportunity, we have focused on the benefit from a single

year deferral of a conveniently sized Social Security payout ($12,500). However, in many cases the

arbitrage benefit can be quite large. To get a rough idea of the maximum arbitrage benefit, assume John

is a 62-year-old primary earner and earned the maximum taxable amount in each year of his career. He

is entitled to an annual Social Security benefit of $24,000 at age 62.10 John can maximize his annual


9
 This amount is calculated using the IRS mortality tables and discount rates described above.
10
  This is slightly more than 75% of the maximum full retirement benefit in 2016 which is $23,751. We use the
higher number to ease the exposition and to reflect a possibly higher PIA since John is only 62 in 2016.

                                                       10
payment from Social Security by deferring until age 70. At age 70, John would receive $42,240 from

Social Security, an $18,240 increase. John could also receive $42,240 each year during the delay period if

he used $337,920 of his retirement savings. 11 If instead of the Social Security deferral, John purchased

an inflation protected joint and survivor annuity that paid out $18,240 annually, it would cost him

$586,325. In this example, if John switches from purchasing the annuity to deferring Social Security, he

can earn an immediate arbitrage profit of $248,405, quite a large risk-free opportunity indeed! 12

         But only six percent of workers covered by Social Security earn more than the maximum taxable

amount. 13 To explore further the arbitrage gains for more typical workers, we begin with a set of stylized

workers whose career average earnings are equal to 45%, 100% and 160% of the national average wage

   This assumes John has access to a riskless investment that earns a 0% real return. The arbitrage argument is
strengthened if John can earn a positive real return.

   We choose to use a retail annuity quote by an A+ rated insurance company. We could have taken a cheaper
annuity by an A rated company, which would take down gains to just below $215,000.

   Benefit amounts for these stylized earners are given in Table V.C7 of the 2016 Social Security Trustees Reports.
The workers in the table are in the 1951 birth cohort and turn age 65 in 2016. For our analysis, however, we
assume that each deferral under consideration (e.g., from age 62 to age 70) takes place this year.

                                                         11
gains for these cases are listed in table 1 above. These calculations assume a spouse of the same age

as the primary earner. If the spouse is considerably younger, then the gains would be even higher

because the retail annuity cost would increase while the cost of delaying Social Security remains the

same. These arbitrage gains can be used to buy additional real annual income equivalent to 18% of

the total annual income (for those at age 62).

        The above examples give the intuition for the arbitrage argument, but they abstract away from

several important factors. As we saw, the number of deferral years can dramatically impact the

arbitrage profit. Moreover, there can be significant tax implications associated with shifting income from

an annuity payout to a Social Security payout. Finally, the Social Security annuity price varies in a

somewhat haphazard way across the relevant ages. At age 66, we showed that the Social Security

annuity price was $13.50 per $1 of annual lifetime income. However, the annuity price depends on the

Social Security formula for increasing benefits. For example, the price is $16 per $1 of annuity payout at

age 62 and $13 per $1 of annuity payout at age 63. In the rest of this paper, we generalize the arbitrage

argument to consider the universe of deferral options. In addition, we review the tax implications of the

arbitrage strategy and argue that the arbitrage profits are present even after taking taxes into account.




    5. Generalizing the Argument

        We now generalize the arbitrage argument that we sketched in the previous section. We

consider first the case of defined benefit pensions. Since defined benefit annuities are cheaper than

retail annuities, the arbitrage argument will hold for retail annuities whenever it holds for defined

benefit annuities.

        The examples in the previous section were constructed in such a way that the increase in Social

Security benefits from deferral was exactly equal to the defined benefit annuity. This ensured that the

cash flows after the deferral period were identical (under the assumption of zero or negative inflation),


                                                    12
allowing us to establish dominance by comparing income during the deferral period. If the defined

benefit annuity is greater than the annuity available from deferring Social Security, then deferring Social

Security will not be able to fully cover the defined benefit annuity payment and the individual may be

worse off in some states of the world.

         We can get around this problem by assuming that the individual can choose a partial defined

benefit lump sum, which allows him or her to give up exactly the amount of defined benefit annuity

income that will be offset by the increase in Social Security benefits. 15 This creates the same situation

we saw in the examples, where the cash flows of the two strategies are identical (again, assuming zero

or negative inflation) from the moment Social Security benefits are claimed, allowing us to simply

compare the cash flows from the two strategies during the delay period. As we discussed in the previous

section, the presence of positive inflation only increases the attractiveness of deferral. While not all

employers offer partial lump sums, there is no additional accounting cost in doing so. Thus, in cases

where employers do not offer a partial lump sum, our analysis suggests that the employer and

employee are jointly forgoing an attractive arbitrage opportunity.

         We consider both primary earners and single individuals. For primary earners, we assume the

spouse is the same age as the primary earner. Single individuals are assumed to take a single life defined

benefit annuity, while primary earners are assumed to take a 100% joint and survivor defined benefit

annuity. With these assumptions and applying the IRS rules (see appendix A), we calculate the defined

benefit lump sum value for all ages (in months) from age 62 through 69.

         When comparing cash flows for deferral periods longer than one year, we use interest rates to

discount the forgone cash flows from the Social Security and defined benefit annuity payments. We

discount the Social Security payments using the real interest rates on Treasury Inflation Protected


15
  In these calculations we are implicitly assuming that the defined benefit annuity is at least as large to allow for
the delay in Social Security. Delaying for several years will require large defined benefit annuities, but delays of a
few months can be financed with small defined benefit annuities.

                                                           13
Securities (TIPS) as of August 2016. A real interest rate is appropriate here since Social Security benefits

increase with inflation (adjusted once a year). Since defined benefit annuity payments are generally not

inflation adjusted, we discount these by the nominal risk free CD rates over appropriate horizon. The CD

and TIPS rates used in this analysis are given in Appendix C. Both cash flows are discounted annually.

Discounting the payments allows us to determine whether we can take the defined benefit lump sum,

invest it in an appropriate portfolio of CDs and TIPS, and replicate the forgone Social Security and

defined benefit annuity payments during the delay period. If this is possible, then there are arbitrage

gains from deferring Social Security and taking a partial lump sum. After the delay period, the cash flows

are, by construction, the same with zero or negative inflation, and higher for the deferral strategy if

there is positive inflation.

        Consider an individual aged 𝑎 who claims Social Security immediately and takes a defined

benefit annuity. We compare this strategy to the alternative of deferring Social Security from age 𝑎 to

age 𝑎 + 𝑑 and taking a partial lump sum. Both a and d are measured in months, since Social Security

benefits are actuarially adjusted on a monthly basis. We analyze the net cash flows from the deferral

strategy for every possible value of 𝑎 and 𝑑. The results are presented in the top row of Figure 1 for

primary earners and singles. Note that for defined benefit pensions, the gender of the individual does

not matter as the IRS rules for calculating lump sum payments are gender neutral.

        In each graph in this figure the x-axis depicts the number of deferral months and the y-axis

depicts the primary earner’s age (in years). Each black cell indicates the presence of arbitrage gains from

the deferral strategy. Dark grey indicates that arbitrage gains do not exist, but the difference between

the forgone Social Security income and the defined benefit lump sum is below 5% of the lump-sum

value. That is to say that an individual choosing to take the lump sum and use the funds to delay Social

Security will need to supplement the lump sum by up to 5%. Despite the absence of arbitrage gains,

paying this cost may be worth it as the individual is exchanging a nominal annuity for a real annuity. The


                                                    14
next lighter shade of grey indicates that the difference between the forgone Social Security income and

the defined benefit lump sum is between 5% and 10% of the lump-sum value.

        For married primary earners (the top-left graph) there are arbitrage gains from deferring at

most ages. For singles (the right graph) opportunities for arbitrage gains are limited but still exist for

some ages. In particular, for those aged 63, there are arbitrage gains from deferring at least to age 64.

And for those aged 66, there are arbitrage gains from deferring by a couple of months.

        We emphasize, however, that the absence of arbitrage gains does not necessarily mean that

deferral is the wrong strategy; it simply means that the choice to defer depends on the individual’s

health and preferences. As we see in the graph, for couples, choosing the deferral strategy may be a

good deal at any age since even when arbitrage is not possible, the cost of exchanging the nominal

defined benefit annuity for the real Social Security annuity is less than 10% of the present value of the

defined benefit lump sum.

        Next we consider two types of retail annuities, nominal annuities and CPI-adjusted annuities,

and we calculate the arbitrage gains for primary earners and single men. We obtain annuity quotes from

the Immediate Annuities website (www.immediateannuities.com; additional details are provided in

Appendix B). Male and female primary earners face the same retail annuity prices for joint and survivor

annuities, since the same amount is paid out until the second person in the couple dies. However, retail

annuity prices are lower for single males relative to single females due to higher life expectancy for

females. Since Social Security annuities cost the same for females and males, when the arbitrage

argument holds for a single male, it will hold for a single female. For this reason, we obtain quotes for

single males.

        Retail annuity quotes vary by state of residence since some states tax annuities. To abstract

from this complication, we request annuity quotes applicable in Texas, the biggest (in terms of

population) state with no income tax. We again use nominal CD interest rates to discount the cash flows


                                                   15
of the nominal retail annuities during the deferral period and we use TIPS rates to discount the cash

flows of the CPI adjusted annuities and Social Security.

          Results for nominal retail annuities are presented in the second row of Figure 1, and results for

retail CPI adjusted annuities are presented in the third row. As before, black cells indicate pure arbitrage

gains that can be made choosing the deferral strategy. Dark grey cells indicate that the cost of the

deferral strategy is up to 5% of the annuity cost, and light grey cells indicate that the cost is 5%-10% of

the private annuity cost.

                            Figure 1: Presence of Arbitrage Gains from Deferring Social Security




Notes: Each cell in the top triangle of each graph represents a combination of age and number of deferral months. Black cells
indicate the presence of arbitrage gains from the deferral strategy relative to the option of taking the defined benefit annuity or
buying the private annuity and commencing Social Security immediately. Dark grey indicates that arbitrage gains do not exist,
but the difference between the forgone Social Security income and the alternative private sector annuity cost is below 5% of
the private sector annuity cost. Light grey indicates that the difference between the forgone Social Security income and the
private sector annuity cost is between 5 and 10% of the private sector annuity cost. Defined benefit lump sums are calculated
based on IRS rules. Private sector annuity costs are based on quotes retrieved from Immediate Annuities.




                                                               16
        There are several interesting results observed in these graphs. First, couples have larger

arbitrage gains opportunities relative to singles, and there are larger arbitrage gains from choosing the

deferral strategy over retail annuities compared to defined benefit annuities. Second, the primary

earner in a couple should never choose to claim Social Security before age 70 and buy a retail annuity

(nominal or CPI adjusted), since for all ages the area is black (see left graphs in the second and third

row). Third, even for singles, choosing to buy a retail annuity and not defer Social Security is almost

always a dominated strategy. Real retail annuities are dominated by the deferral strategy in all

circumstances. For nominal annuities, even where there are no arbitrage profits, the additional cost of

the deferral strategy is in most ages less than 5% of the retail nominal annuity cost.



    6. Tax Implications

        Up to this point, our analysis has focused on pre-tax dollars. In reality, however, the two

strategies we analyze have different tax implications. Our baseline case concerns a couple that is

receiving Social Security income as well as taxable income from an annuity source. Our alternative

strategy assumes the annuity is either not purchased or, in the case of a corporate DB pension, cashed

out. The proceeds are then used to cover costs during the Social Security deferral period. Compared to

the baseline, the alternative strategy has less Social Security income during the deferral years, and more

Social Security income in the later years. In addition, the alternative concentrates non-Social Security

income in the deferral years. The net tax implications of this strategy change are indeterminate and

depend primarily on how much other income a household enjoys.

        Table 2 illustrates the after-tax benefit a married couple receives from deferring Social Security

from age 62 to 66 instead of purchasing a real annuity. For this analysis, we quantify the benefit by

matching after-tax income during the deferral stage, and then calculating the increase in income once

the deferral stage is over. In this example, John and his spouse claim Social Security at age 62, and are


                                                    17
receiving $20,000 and $10,000, respectively, in benefit payments. To augment their income, John has

used money from a traditional individual retirement account (IRA) to purchase a real annuity that pays

out $5,000 per year. John’s household also receives $30,000 in annual income from other sources. Given

this situation, the household receives $30,000 in Social Security, but only $11,100 of the Social Security

is taxable income. 16 The aggregate taxable income is $46,100, and the total Federal taxes owed amount

to $5,993. Adding up income and subtracting taxes implies the after-tax income for the household is

$59,008.

    The real annuity is assumed to cost $32.15 per $1 of annual income.




                Suppose John considers an alternative strategy where he buys a smaller annuity, and uses the

money he saves to augment his income while he defers Social Security from age 62 to age 66. If John

wants to exactly maintain his after-tax income during the deferral stage, how much less of an annuity

should he purchase? Table 2 answers that question. If John reduces his annuity purchase from $5,000 to

16
  To determine how much Social Security is taxable, a side calculation is required to determine the couple’s
“combined income.” Combined income generally consists of non-Social Security income plus 50% of Social Security
income. The amount of Social Security subject to taxation varies based on combined income, but never exceeds
85% of the total Social Security income.

                                                                                  18
$1,722, he will find that he exactly replicates his original after-tax income during the deferral period. He

has less Social Security during this period, and substantially higher “other income” owing to the fact that

he is spending $26,349 each year from his IRA. The net effect, however, is that John’s after-tax income

during the deferral period is $59,008 in either case. John begins taking his Social Security at age 66. At

this point, his Social Security and after-tax income is higher. To find out if deferral was advantageous, we

calculate the after-tax income after the deferral. In this case, the after-tax income per year is $3,873

higher using the deferral strategy compared to the original strategy. In after-tax dollars, John is equally

well off between age 62 and 66. After age 66, John’s household enjoys an after-tax income increase of

$3,730.

          This $3,730 of additional income represents a 6.3% increase relative to the $59,008 of baseline

after-tax income. However, the baseline income is highly dependent on the assumption that other

income was $30,000. To better capture the opportunity afforded from Social Security deferral and to

normalize across scenarios, we report the income increase as a percentage of the primary benefit that is

being deferred. In this case, the increase in after-tax income is 19% of the $20,000 primary benefit that

was deferred. A significant advantage of deferring Social Security is that a surviving spouse also receives

an increased payout. In this example, the surviving spouse enjoys an after-tax income increase of

$4,196, or 21% of the primary benefit.

          The taxation implications of the alternative strategy depend on the amount of other income the

household receives. To explore this aspect of the strategy, we repeat the analysis from Table 2 and vary

the amount of other income from $0 to $100,000. The top panel in Figure 2 summarizes the results. For

a married couple, the after-tax income boost ranges from 14% to 20% of the primary benefit. For a

single individual, the boost range is 10% to 18%. At higher income levels, the married income increase is

roughly 40% larger (14% vs. 10%) than the single income increase. This is due to the fact that a joint and

survivor annuity is substantially more valuable than a single life annuity. The general pattern is an


                                                    19
upward trend across lower incomes followed by a sharp reduction towards a constant percentage

increase at higher income levels. This pattern is primarily caused by the Social Security taxation rules. At

low income levels, Social Security is not taxable income. At high income levels, 85% of Social Security is

treated as taxable income. The transition creates anomalously high marginal tax rates that the

alternative strategy helps avoid. For example, suppose the household is in a 30% tax bracket, and then

receives a marginal $1 in extra income. The tax on this $1 would normally be $0.30. However, an extra

$1 in income could cause up to $0.85 of Social Security to transition from non-taxed to taxable income.

The $1 in additional income would then create a total tax increase of $0.555, $0.30 for the normal tax

bracket, and an additional tax of $0.255 in tax due to higher Social Security taxable income. The

marginal tax rate is 55.5%! In this income region, the alternative strategy converts highly taxed annuity

income into more lightly taxed Social Security income 17, and that benefit is captured by the upward

trend in the top graph in Figure 2. At sufficiently high income, Social Security is maximally taxed

irrespective of the strategy, so the benefit peak dissipates into a plateau.

        The second graph in Figure 2 repeats the analysis for a nominal annuity purchase. The same

general pattern emerges although the income boosts are uniformly lower. For this situation, the

alternative strategy still represents an arbitrage opportunity at all income levels for both couples and

singles, but the benefit for a married couple ranges from 6% to 14%, and for singles it ranges from 1% to

12%. At high income levels, the benefit to a married couple is approximately 7% compared to 2% for the

single individual. It should be again noted that the arbitrage analysis assumes the worst possible

outcome for the alternative strategy, which in this case is either no inflation or deflation. If there is any

inflation, the alternative strategy would generate even larger benefits.

        The last graph in Figure 2 considers the after tax implications of a defined benefit cash-out. Here

the arbitrage results are mixed. For a married couple, the arbitrage results hold, but for a single person

17
  Recall that only 50% of Social Security income enters the calculation for determining how much Social Security
income is taxed.

                                                       20
there is no arbitrage opportunity since the post-deferral income change is negative at many income

levels. The overall benefit to the alternative strategy is significantly reduced owing to the lower implicit

annuity prices offered as a defined benefit cash-out. While after-tax arbitrage is not available to singles

in this case, the alternative strategy can still represents a highly desirable opportunity. For a fairly

modest cost, a nominal corporate annuity can be exchanged for a government inflation protected

annuity. Indeed, if cumulative inflation ever exceeds a few percent, the alterative strategy will have

higher payouts.

        There are many dimensions of the U.S. tax code, and an exhaustive tax analysis is far beyond the

scope of this paper. However, we have considered the main tax components for the important case

when an individual is considering deferring Social Security from age 62 (the earliest eligibility age) to age

66 (the full retirement age). Our after-tax results corroborate the pre-tax analysis. Namely, there is a

large and ubiquitous arbitrage opportunity when a real annuity is purchased and a smaller but still

widely available arbitrage when a nominal annuity is purchased. When a defined benefit cash-out is

considered, married couples generally have an arbitrage opportunity. For singles, there likely is not an

arbitrage although they are still likely to be better off cashing out their defined benefits plan to defer

Social Security. Given the consistency with which the after-tax results track the pre-tax results and the

fact that the alternative strategy often conveys tax advantages, we believe that the arbitrage results are

generally robust to after-tax considerations. The results in this section are also consistent with Mahaney

and Carlson (2012), who document tax advantages from replacing IRA income with Social Security

income through delaying Social Security.

Notes: These calculations assume baseline Social Security income of $20,000 for the primary earner and single, and
$10,000 of Social Security income for the secondary earners. Both couples and singles are assumed to receive a
private sector annuity of $10,000.

     7. Empirical Evidence from the Health and Retirement Study

        We use data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) to get an idea of how many

individuals may be using the dominated strategy of claiming Social Security early and at the same time

taking a defined benefit pension annuity or buying a retail annuity. The HRS is a panel survey conducted

every other year that is intended to be representative of the U.S. population age 50 and older. We

utilize all 11 waves of the survey, from 1992-2012. Our analysis is conducted at the person-wave level. 18

        As we cannot observe how much individuals earned relative to their spouses, we restrict our

sample to married men, who are more likely to be the primary earner in the couple. We also exclude

singles, since our analysis suggests that arbitrage opportunities are limited for singles. Finally, we

exclude anyone who has ever had a disability episode, as deferral opportunities are more limited for

disability benefits.

        We tabulate, at each age, the fraction receiving income from Social Security retirement,

employer-sponsored pensions, and other annuities. 19 These results are shown in table 3. The full

retirement age for the majority of individuals in our sample is 65. By age 66, 85% of the sample has

claimed Social Security. Since HRS income figures refer to the previous calendar year, these are likely to

be individuals who claimed at their full retirement age. At the same age, almost 40% receive income

from employer-sponsored pensions and another 3% receive income from other annuities. The last two

columns of the table suggest that more than a third of the population, by age 66, have claimed Social

Security and are receiving pension or annuity income.

        There are two caveats to this analysis. First, income from employer-sponsored pensions is

derived from questions about “income from retirement pensions” that specifically instruct individuals to

exclude lump sum payments. These variables include defined benefit and defined contribution

18
   We use the RAND version of the HRS, which is a cleaned dataset containing a subset of the variables from the
original survey.

   Pension income is based on the RAND variables r1ipen-r11ipen. Annuity income is based on the RAND variables

annuities. However, they may also include withdrawals from defined contribution pensions, and the

annuities may not be joint and survivor annuities. Thus, the fractions in the final column of the table

represent upper bounds on the fraction of the population receiving both Social Security and joint-and-

survivor annuity income. Second, it is not clear what fraction of these individuals had a lump sum (or

partial lump sum) option in their pension. Again, this suggests that our fractions represent upper

bounds on the fraction of people who are missing arbitrage gains. However, even if these individuals

were not offered partial lump sums, we can say that these individuals and their employers have jointly

missed a potential arbitrage opportunity.

         Defined benefit pensions have declined in popularity over time; thus, it is possible that the

fraction missing an arbitrage opportunity has also declined. Table 4 shows the same results as table 3,

    8. Conclusions

         Economists are hesitant to call observed consumer behaviors “mistakes” as different

preferences can justify lots of different behaviors. However, by focusing on cases that are more clear-

cut, we have shown that it is possible for retirees to make big mistakes with their choices regarding

annuitization of retirement resources and claiming of Social Security. Many American retirees have an

arbitrage opportunity of effectively selling a more expensive life annuity and exchanging it for an

equivalent or superior life annuity that is cheaper. Up to 25 percent of retirees may be receiving

income from both Social Security and private annuities in their mid-60s. These individuals and their


                                                              25
employers (if they do not offer a lump sum option) are collectively forgoing an arbitrage opportunity.

The arbitrage gains are around $100,000 for married primary earners with average earnings, and can

reach about $250,000 for those with high earnings. Taking Social Security early and annuitizing income

wastes this money. While taxes complicate the argument, our general findings are robust to the

inclusion of taxes.

        We have not taken up the question of why so many people are making these big monetary

mistakes, but that is a topic worth further research. There are several possible explanations to be

explored. First, many individuals may not have access to partial lump sum options in their defined

benefit pensions. However, that explanation merely shifts the puzzle to the level of the employer.

Employers may prefer not to offer a lump sum option for their defined benefit plans because they

believe cashing out of the plan is inferior to taking an annuity. However, in many common situations,

the opposite is true, and it suggests that employers are forgoing an opportunity to pass on arbitrage

gains to their retirees. For example, employers could help employees integrate their pensions with

Social Security deferral by offering annuities that provide higher payments through age 70 and lower

payments thereafter. While some public sector employers do offer such “Social Security leveling,” the

lower payments often kick in at age 62 under the assumption that individuals will claim Social Security

at that point (Clark, Hammond, and Morrill 2016). Second, Social Security rules are complicated and life

annuities are probably not well understood by most Americans. Faced with this complexity, people may

treat the Social Security claiming and annuity purchase decisions separately, rather than integrating

them. Third, individuals may make claiming decisions according to simple rules of thumb. For example,

even though retirement and claiming Social Security need not occur simultaneously, individuals may link

the two decisions and believe they should claim when they retire (see, e.g., Nyce et al. 2015). There is

also a strong tendency to claim at whatever age is designated the full retirement age (e.g., Behaghel

and Blau 2012). Fourth, sophisticated hyperbolic discounters may prefer to receive income in the form


                                                  26
of an annuity rather than a lump sum, as the annuity is less liquid. Finally, if financial advisers are not

aware of these arbitrage gains, they may not be integrating their advice regarding employer-sponsored

pensions and Social Security claiming.

A: Calculation of the Defined Benefits Cash-Out Value
         To calculate the defined benefit lump sum value we use the interest rates and mortality rates as

defined by the IRS. The values and sources are detailed as follows:

         The IRS rules allow us to calculate the present value of defined benefits annuities for each age

in months (the “lump sum cash-out value”). In table A3 we present the simulated defined benefits cash-

out value for each $1 of annual defined benefits income calculated at the birthday month of the

individual.

B: Retail Annuity Quotes
        We retrieved retail annuity quotes from Immediate Annuities website on August 23rd, 2016 for a

$100 monthly annuity (the minimum annuity), for all ages between 62-69, for couples and singles, for

annuities with and without cost of living adjustment (COLA). The COLA option chosen is the CPI

adjustment factor. The quotes presented below are the cheapest quotes provided for each age and

marital status, converted to value of a $1 annual annuity.

C: Interest Rates
         In our calculations we discount Social Security benefits and CPI-adjusted retail annuities based

on the market rates for TIPS as of August 23rd 2016. We use the TIPS with coupons of 0.125 and

interpolate the rates to correspond to maturities of 1 to 7 years. We discount defined benefit and

nominal retail annuities’ cash flows based on the highest CD rates for balances with at least $1,000 at

nation banks as of August 23, 2016. The rates for TIPS and CD’s are presented in table C1 below.
