Reexamining the Cyclical Behavior of the Relative Price of Investment

                                              ABSTRACT

The cyclical behavior of the relative price of investment goods plays an important role in many modern
macroeconomic models. In this paper we examine the behavior of several measures of the relative
price of investment goods for the U.S. economy over the last fifty years. In particular, we examine
whether there are robust cyclical patterns, whether results differ by sub-sample and whether the nature
of the deflator matters. Our main result is that there is no robust evidence that this relative price is
countercyclical in the data. In fact, for the recent (post-Volcker) period, the relative price of investment
appears predominantly procyclical. When looking at more disaggregated series, most measures are
 procyclical, a few acyclical, and only the price of equipment is significantly countercyclical for some
periods and measures. The procyclical behavior of the relative price of aggregate investment is also
shown to characterize six other countries of the G7.

1         Introduction
In this paper, we re-examine the cyclical behavior of the relative price of investment. A com-
monly held view within the macroeconomic profession is that this relative price is strongly
countercyclical. We find somewhat surprisingly little robust support for this view in the data.
We summarize our main results in Table 1, where we use three definitions of aggregate invest-
ment (total private investment, business investment, household investment), two measures
of the price of consumption (the numéraire used to compute relative prices), two measures
of the business cycle (output and hours worked), and two samples. For all the measures,
the relative price of investment is procyclical over the recent (post-Volcker) period, and al-
most always significantly so. When considering a longer sample, it is rarely countercyclical
and never significantly so. We show in the paper that similar results hold for the other G7
countries. Also, the choice of the consumption price, which has not been discussed in the
literature, has important effects on the results: using a core deflator makes the relative price
of investment much more procyclical.
        The cyclical behavior of the relative price of investment is an indicator of the relative
importance of demand and supply shocks in the investment market, an important question
given that investment is the most volatile component of output. A long-lasting view, dating
back at least to Keynes, emphasizes the role of investment demand by forward-looking en-
trepreneurs. Modern incarnation of this theory include the literature on news shocks about
the future profitability of investment goods, for example Beaudry and Portier [2004], [2011]
and Beaudry, Collard, and Portier [2011]. Such models based on demand-driven fluctua-
tions predict a countercyclical relative price of investment.1 A more recent branch of the
literature, pioneered by Greenwood, Hercowitz, and Huffman [1988] and extended by Fisher
[2006] and Justiniano, Primiceri, and Tambalotti [2010], puts forward supply shocks arising
from investment-specific changes in technology as important drivers of the cycle. As those
shocks affect the efficiency of investment production, they are associated with countercyclical
movements in the relative price of investment.
        The question of the origin of investment fluctuations has regained interest over the last

        sumption expenditures on non-durable and services (benchmark) or the same price
        excluding ‘Gasoline and other energy goods’ (core). Variables are HP-filtered with

thirty years, Although asset prices boomed in each of those three expansions, the evolution of
the relative price of different categories of investment has been less documented, the consensus
among macroeconomists being that the relative price of investment is strongly countercyclical
because of investment-specific technological shocks. As productivity has become less and less
procyclical2 , investment-specific technology shocks also appear as a powerful way to generate
investment booms in DSGE models. For example, the investment-specific technology shock
is one of the three main drivers of output fluctuations in Smets and Wouters [2007].
       In this paper, we contribute to the debate between these competing theories by estab-
lishing the main stylized facts about the cyclicality of the relative price of investment. We
adopt a purely descriptive approach based on unconditional correlations between HP-filtered
series.3 This procedure allows us to discuss issues that have been little studied, such as
instability in the cyclical patterns over time or the crucial role of the consumption deflator
in shaping the properties of the relative price of investment.
   2
      This fact is documented by Galı́ and van Rens [2014]. According to McGrattan and Prescott [2014],
the countercyclicality of labor productivity during the 1990s technology boom and in the Great Recession is
likely to be the consequence of a mismeasurement of GDP. If investment in intangible capital is not counted
as investment but as intermediate consumption, it is left out of GDP. As this investment is procyclical, GDP
in underestimated in expansion and overestimated in recession, creating a spurious countercyclicality of labor
productivity and TFP.
    3
      The use of VARs would allow to study conditional correlations, at the cost of potentially controversial
identification issues. In this paper, we aim at being as close as possible from an agnostic description of the
data.


                                                      3
   There are already some papers that study the cyclical behavior of the relative price of
investment, and the main conclusion so far is that it is countercyclical. Using annual data
from 1947 to 1988, Murphy, Shleifer, and Vishny [1989] correlate the prices of consumer
durables and producer equipment deflated by the GDP price with the growth rate of the
unemployment rate and find negative correlations. Christiano and Fisher [1998] find that
both the relative prices of investment, measured as the price of fixed investment plus durable
over the price of nondurable goods and services over the 1947-1995 sample, and equipment
are countercyclical, while Christiano and Fisher [2003] highlight the puzzling fact that stock
market prices are procyclical while the prices of equipment goods are countercyclical. They
reconcile this facts in a model with investment-specific technological change and adjustment
costs to the growth rate of investment (and not capital). Greenwood, Hercowitz, and Krusell
[2000] also document a countercyclical relative price of investment, but consider only the rel-
ative price of equipment. Fisher [2006] considers four relative investment prices, constructed
using a consumption deflator corresponding to nondurable and service consumption, the ser-
vice flow from consumer durables, and government consumption. Specifically, he uses the
Gordon [1990] and Cummins and Violante [2002] (GCV) equipment deflator, the price of
total investment constructed by merging the GCV deflator with the NIPA deflators for non-
residential and residential structures, consumer durables, and government investment, as well
as the NIPA counterparts to these two prices. The sample period is 1955-2000. The cyclical
correlation of the relative equipment price with output is negative, while the one of total
investment (not reported) is “somewhat weaker, but still significantly negative” (p. 428). By
considering a longer sample, clarifying the role of the consumption deflator, and documenting
how the cyclical patterns of relative investment prices vary over time, we update these results
and reach different conclusions.
   The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the time series used in our
empirical analysis. Section 3 contains our main results about the cyclical behavior of the
relative price of investment. As explained above, in addition to the usual aggregate national
account series, we clarify the properties of disaggregated investment series over different
subperiods, and using different deflators. We also study other G7 countries. Section 4
concludes.

2     Data and methodology
In this section, we present the U.S. time series we use in our benchmark empirical analy-
sis. We need to define investment, its price, as well as the price of the relevant numéraire.
Throughout, we rely on standard national accounting sources, namely the Bureau of Eco-
nomic Analysis’ NIPA. Appendix A provides a comprehensive description of our dataset. We
also describe our empirical strategy.

2.1      Dataset

We follow Fisher [1999] in considering a broader definition of investment that the BEA’s. We
define total private investment as the sum of fixed investment and consumer expenditures on
durable goods. On the other hand, we exclude changes in private inventories and government
investment from our aggregate measure. We decompose total private investment into busi-
ness investment and household investment. Business investment corresponds to the BEA’s
nonresidential investment measure: it includes firms’ expenditures on structures, producer
equipment, and intellectual property products. Household investment corresponds to the
sum of residential investment and consumer expenditures on durables. For our benchmark
analysis, we use NIPA data and follow the BEA’s chain aggregation method to construct
aggregates when needed. Later, we consider alternative investment measures that have been
constructed in the literature to control for a potential lack of quality adjustment by the BEA.
    For our baseline numéraire, we take the index of consumer expenditures on nondurable
goods and services. Therefore, we compute the relative investment price by dividing the
investment price by the price index for nondurable and service consumption. Below, we show
that the choice of this numéraire is a crucial input in the analysis of the cyclicality of the
relative price of investment by considering an alternative consumption price excluding energy
goods.
    Our sample runs from 1960Q1 to 2013Q4, and we consider results based on a sample split
in the early 80’s. Indeed, as discussed by Fisher [2006], that time coincides with significant
changes in the relative investment price’s average rate of decline (which accelerates, from
−0.9% per year in the 1960-1983 sample to −1.7% per year after 1984 for total private
investment), the conduct of monetary policy (1983 is the end of Paul Volcker’s first tenure

as chairman of the Federal Reserve, which was largely devoted to fighting inflation), and
macroeconomic stability (beginning of the Great Moderation). Moreover, as mentioned in
the introduction, investment booms and busts seem more prevalent after 1983 than before.
To deal with all these issues in a simple fashion, we let the first sample end in 1983Q4 and
the second start in 1984Q1. Our conclusions are not sensitive to reasonable variations in this
break date.
   Table 2 reports nominal GDP shares accounted for by the various components of in-
vestment, which are very stable across subperiods. The broadest investment measure, total
private investment, accounts for one fourth of nominal GDP. It can be in turn decomposed
into business and household investments for one half each. Within business investment,
equipment is the most important component, before structures and intellectual property
products. Within household investment, expenditures on durable goods represent twice as
much as residential investment.
   Figure 1 plots log per-capita investment quantity series together with their HP trends.
Shaded bands represent NBER recession dates. Unsurprisingly, the long-run evolution of
investment quantities is dominated by the presence of upward trends. This is especially true
of aggregate measures such as total private investment, business investment, or household
investment. As can be seen by looking at the component series, the rise in total private invest-
ment comes from the strong upward trends in producer equipment and household durables.
On the other hand, structures and residential investment display no clear growth pattern,
but instead varying upward and downward trends over shorter subperiods.


                                                6
        Contrasting the remarkable stability in nominal GDP shares with the apparent hetero-
geneity in quantity series, it must be that relative prices for different investment measures
have evolved differently over the 1960-2014 sample. This is indeed what we see from Fig-
ure 2, which provides log relative investment prices. Mirroring the large rise in equipment
and durables quantities, the relative prices of these two classes of investment goods display
pronounced negative trends. This fact was first documented by Gordon [1990] and is often
interpreted as signaling investment-specific technological change (Greenwood, Hercowitz, and
Krusell [1997]). On the contrary, the relative prices of structures and residential investment
are non trending. However, the relative prices of aggregate investment measures such as total
private investment inherit downward trends from the prices of equipment and durables.

2.2         Empirical approach

The above discussion shows that the long-run properties of both investment quantity and
relative price series are dominated by trends and low-frequency fluctuations. These phe-
nomenon have little to do with business cycles and prevent a cyclical analysis based on the
series in levels. Therefore, we use the Hodrick-Prescott with a smoothing parameter 1600
to isolate the business-cycle components of the series and report instantaneous and dynamic
correlation patterns between these cyclical components and an indicator of the business cy-
cle.4 We consider two such measures: the cyclical components of real per-capita GDP and
per-capita hours worked in the private nonfarm business sector. We include hours worked
because they provide an alternative index of the business cycle that is not as affected by
productivity shocks as output is.


3         Business cycle analysis
This section presents our main empirical findings about the cyclical behavior of the relative
price of investment. As far as quantities are concerned, it is well-established and robust that
investment is procyclical and more volatile than output, so that we delegate the corresponding
discussion to Appendix C.
    4
        Our findings are robust to using instead a BP(6,32) filter to isolate cyclical components of the data.

3.1    Benchmark analysis for the U.S.A.

We start with our benchmark analysis of U.S. data. The top rows in Tables 3 and 4 display
the contemporaneous correlations between the relative prices of investment and our two
measures of the cycle, over both the full sample and the two subsamples. Figures 3, 4, and 5
provide the corresponding cross-correlograms between the relative investment prices and the
output quantity.
   Looking at Figure 3, the picture that emerges is clearly not one of strong countercyclical-
ity. Among disaggregated investment measures, the only component whose relative price is
significantly negatively correlated with output is equipment. Over the full sample 1960-2013,
it has a contemporaneous correlation of −0.31 with output and −0.23 with hours worked.
Otherwise, the relative prices of structures and durables are roughly acyclical, with respective
(non significant) contemporaneous correlations with output of 0.10 and −0.03. The relative
price of structures, though, is significantly procyclical when the business cycle is measured
by hours worked, with an instantaneous correlation of 0.32. The relative price of residential
investment is strongly procyclical, with an instantaneous correlation of 0.50 with GDP and
0.59 with hours. Turning to aggregate series, business investment is slightly countercyclical
(not significantly so), while household investment is acyclical. As a whole, we find small and
non significant correlations between the relative price of total private investment and output
(−0.10) and hours worked (0.05) along the cycle over the full sample.

3.2    Sample instability and structural change

It is instructive to compare the cyclical properties of relative investment prices over the two
subsamples, 1960-1983 and 1984-2013. As mentioned in the introduction, there is ample
evidence that the U.S. economy experienced some kind of structural break in the early 80’s,
and the narrative of business cycles in the second subperiod is often one of booms and busts
driven by asset price fluctuations and investment in capital goods. Therefore, we would
expect some changes in the correlation patterns.
   Figures 4 and 5 compare the cross-correlograms of the different relative investment prices
with output across the two subperiods. Over the first subsample, relative investment prices
are more countercyclical: with the exception of residential investment, all relative prices

are negatively correlated with contemporaneous output. In particular, the prices of both
business and total private investment are significantly countercyclical, with contemporaneous
correlations with output of −0.31 and −0.24. A similar pattern arises when the cycle is
measured using hours worked. Over the first sample, the data are therefore consistent with
a leading role for investment-specific technological shocks.
   As expected from the narrative of the last three cycles, these correlation patterns are
reversed over the second subsample. In particular, the relative prices of total private invest-
ment, business investment, and household investment all turn procyclical. Their instanta-
neous correlations with GDP range from 0.05 to 0.15 and are not significant, but as shown
in Table 4, the correlations with hours worked are much larger, ranging from 0.27 to 0.36,
and all significant. We interpret these patterns as signaling a larger role for demand shocks
in generating investment fluctuations in the 1984-2013 period.
   To summarize our analysis so far, we find that only the relative price of equipment out of
the four main subcomponents of total private investment is always significantly countercycli-
cal. Below, we show that this result largely depends on the definition of the consumption
deflator. We also document that, in the 1984-2013 sample in which investment fluctua-
tions are prevalent, relative prices of the three aggregate investment measures (total private,
business, household) are procyclical.

3.3    Consumption deflator and energy prices

One aspect that has received little attention in the literature is the choice of the consump-
tion deflator. For example, Fisher [1999] deflates investment prices by the price index of
nondurable and service consumption, while Fisher [2006] uses a broader price index based on
nondurable and service consumption, the service flow from consumer durables, and govern-
ment consumption as numéraire. Alternatively, Liu, Waggoner, and Zha [2011] deflate their
investment price by the GDP price index.
   It is important to understand how the choice of the deflator affects the cyclical behavior
of the relative investment price. In particular, the treatment of energy prices appears to be of
first importance, because its cyclical pattern has changed quite a lot. Indeed, energy prices
were countercyclical in the 70’s and early 80’s because of the successive oil shocks, and became


                                              10
procyclical afterwards as energy prices were mainly pulled by the world economic growth and
the uprising of emerging economies. Consider for instance the behavior of pc /pc,core , the ratio
between our benchmark consumption price constructed from nondurables and services, and
its core counterpart obtained by excluding the energy component. Its correlation with output
along the cycle, equal to 0.10 over the 1960-1983 subsample, jumps to 0.56 in the 1984-2013
subsample. As pc has become more procyclical because of its energy component, it follows
that pi /pc has mechanically become more countercyclical. Because such a changing pattern is
is not directly related with changes in the respective strength of shocks to investment demand
and supply, it seems relevant to remove it by computing the correlation between output and
pi /pc,core .
    This is what we do in Figures 6, 7, and 8, while instantaneous correlations are displayed in
Tables 3 and 4. Over the full 1960-2013 sample, the relative price of total private investment
becomes acyclical when compared to output (contemporaneous correlation of 0.04), but turns
procyclical when compared to hours (instantaneous correlation equal to 0.22, although not
significant). Among disaggregated series, only the relative equipment price shows a negative
correlation of −0.23 with GDP, but it is not significant. Looking at the second subsample,
we now obtain a very clear picture: for all categories of investment except equipment, and
for all aggregate investment measures, the relative prices are significantly procyclical: the
contemporaneous correlations with GDP range from 0.23 for durables to 0.63 for residential,
and those with hours worked are even larger.

3.4      Quality adjustment issues

Following Gordon’s [1990] systematic analysis of the quality bias in official NIPA price in-
dexes, the literature on investment-specific technology shocks has generally relied on quality-
adjusted investment price series. This is the case, for instance, in Greenwood, Hercowitz,
and Huffman [1988] and Fisher [2006]. We briefly show here that our findings remain valid
when the relative price of investment is constructed from such quality-adjusted series.
    We consider three quality-adjusted investment price series. The first two are from Cum-
mins and Violante [2002], who directly extend Gordon’s original measures of the quality bias
in official price indexes, and correspond to equipment and business investment. The series are


                                               11
annual, ranging from 1947 to 2000, and we construct their quarterly counterparts by cubic
spline interpolation. The third one has been kindly provided to us by Tao Zha and is referred
to in Liu, Waggoner, and Zha [2011] under the code TornPriceInv4707CV. It is computed
as a weighted average index from four quality-adjusted price indexes: private nonresidential
structures investment, private residential investment, private nonresidential equipment and
software, personal consumption expenditures on durable goods.
      Tables 5 and 6 report the contemporaneous business-cycle correlations between those
quality-adjusted price measures and output or hours worked. Clearly, our main conclusions
still hold: (i) Only the quality-adjusted relative price of equipment is significantly counter-
cyclical in the full sample. (ii) While relative investment prices are countercyclical in the
1960-1983 sample, they all turn procyclical afterwards. Therefore, the empirical facts we
document are not an artefact caused by mismeasurement of quality improvements in capital
goods.

3.5       Other G7 countries

We end our empirical analysis by examining time series for the six other G7 countries,
namely Canada, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy and Japan. Because all countries
do not publish national accounts as complete as the NIPA, we proceed in a simple and
relatively crude way. For each country, we first obtain time series for nominal and real private
consumption and nominal and real fixed investment.5 Then, we compute the consumption
and investment deflators by dividing nominal series by real ones. Eventually, we define the
relative price of investment as the ratio of these two deflators. Samples are 1981Q1-2012Q1
for Canada, 1955Q1-2013Q4 for France, 1991Q1-2012Q4 for Germany, 1955Q1-2012Q4 for
Great-Britain, 1981Q1-2011Q2 for Italy, and 1955Q1-2013Q4 for Japan.
      Contemporaneous correlations between the cyclical components of these relative invest-
ment price and output series are provided in Table 7. All correlations are positive, and
significantly so in Canada, Great Britain, and Japan (and almost in France). Therefore,
we conclude again that data do not support the view that the relative price of aggregate
investment is countercyclical in developed economies.

4         Conclusion
We document the cyclical properties of the relative price of investment. We emphasize three
results: (i) There is no empirical evidence that the relative price of aggregate investment is
significantly countercyclical. (ii) It is significantly procyclical for the recent period, as well
as the relative prices of all its subcomponents, with the exception of equipment price which
is statistically acyclical. (iii) The procyclicality of relative investment prices is stronger when
computed taking hours worked as a measure of the cycle, or when the consumption price is
purged for energy price fluctuations.
        What do these results suggest for macroeconomic theory? Definitively not that investment
specific technology shocks are irrelevant, but surely that an agnostic examination of the data
does not validate the common view that they are the main driver of investment fluctuations
and that shocks to the demand for investment are of second order importance.6 Designing a
general equilibrium model featuring these two classes of shocks and letting them compete in
a structural estimation exercise therefore seems a fruitful avenue for future research.

     We find some support for this view in the results of Justiniano, Primiceri, and Tambalotti [2011], who
evaluate the role of two distinct investment shocks in an estimated New-Neoclassical Synthesis business-cycle
model. The first shock is an investment-specific technology perturbation, identified with the relative price
of investment, while the second shock affects the transformation of savings into the future capital input.
Estimation results suggest that this second shock, affecting the marginal efficiency of investment, is the main
driver of investment fluctuations. Importantly, this shock does not imply a countercyclical relative price of
investment.

A     Data sources and construction for the U.S.A.
This appendix describes both the data sources and the construction of the actual time series
we use in the empirical analysis.

A.1     Original series

Our primary data sources are the Bureau of Economic Analysis’ NIPA tables. Specifically,
we use Tables 1.1.3, 1.1.4, and 1.1.5 to obtain the NIPA estimates for, respectively, quantity
indices, price indices, and nominal series for the following variables: Gross domestic product
(line 1), Personal consumption expenditures on durable goods (line 4), Personal consumption
expenditures on nondurable goods (line 5), Personal consumption expenditures on services
(line 6), Nonresidential investment (line 9), Investment in structures (line 10), Equipment
investment (line 11), Intellectual property products (line 12), Residential investment (line
13). From Tables 2.3.3, 2.3.4, and 2.3.5, we similarly get quantity, price, and nominal series
for the subcomponents of personal consumption expenditures on nondurable goods (lines 9–
12). We obtain total population from Table 7.1 (line 18). Finally, hours worked are the BLS
measure for Nonfarm business sector total hours, which we normalize by the population.

                                             16
A.2        Constructing aggregate investment series

We consider the following aggregate investment measures:

          Business Investment = Nonresidential Investment

                                  = Structures + Equipment + Intellectual Property Products,

        Household Investment = Durable Goods + Residential Investment,

  Total Private Investment = Business Investment + Household Investment.

We compute nominal series for these aggregates by summing the nominal values of their
subcomponents. To construct quantity and price series, we use the BEA’s chain aggregation
approach. We illustrate the method with household investment.7 Letting Dt and Rt denote
the BEA quantity indexes for expenditures on durable goods and residential investment and
PtD and PtR denote the corresponding BEA price indexes, we construct the quantity index
HIt and the price index PtHI as follows:

   • For some reference date T , normalize HI T = 1. Without loss of generality, we set
        T = 1 in our computations.

   • For all other dates, set HI t = HI t−1 × Qt , where Qt is the following Fisher index:
                             s
                                    D         R
                                  Pt−1 Dt + Pt−1 Rt       PtD Dt + PtR Rt
                       Qt =       D           R
                                                      ×                     .
                               Pt−1 Dt−1 + Pt−1  Rt−1 PtD Dt−1 + PtR Rt−1

   • Given the quantity index HI, define the price index P HI by

                                                     PtD Dt + PtR Rt
                                            PtHI =                   .
                                                          HI t

By construction, the product of the quantity and price indexes for a given aggregate is equal
to the corresponding nominal series at all dates. We use the same method to construct
business investment series by chaining original NIPA quantity and price indexes, and total
private investment series by chaining business investment with household investment.

A.3        Constructing relative investment prices

We consider two measures of the consumption price: a price index for nondurable and service
consumption obtained by chaining the corresponding NIPA series, and its core counterpart
obtained by excluding the ‘Gasoline and other energy goods’ (Tables 2.3.3, 2.3.4, and 2.3.5,
line 11) component. For any investment measure and a given consumption price index, we
then define the relative investment price as

                                                     Investment Price Index
                  Relative Investment Price =                               .
                                                    Consumption Price Index

B          Data sources and construction for other G7 coun-
           tries
For all G7 countries other than the U.S., we use series for real Gross domestic product, real
and nominal Private final consumption expenditure, and real and nominal Gross fixed capital
formation. We compute the consumption and investment deflators, Pc and Pi , by dividing
the nominal aggregates by real ones. Finally, we compute the relative price of investment as
Pi /Pc .
    For Canada, France, Germany and Great-Britain, data are extracted from the FRED
database, and samples are respectively 1981Q1-2012Q1, 1955Q1-2013Q4, 1991Q1-2012Q4
and 1955Q1-2012Q4. Real series are in chained 2002 Canadian Dollars for Canada, chained
2005 Euros for France and Germany and chained 2009 Pounds for Great Britain.
    In the FRED database, samples are much shorter for Italy and Japan (respectively
1991Q1-2013Q4 and 1994Q1-2013Q4), so that we turn to alternative sources. We obtain Ital-
ian data from Istat.it (http://dati.istat.it), with real series expressed in chained 2000 Euros.
We obtain Japan data data from the Cabinet Office Home Page (http://www.esri.cao.go.jp).
One difficulty is that the real series in chained 2005 Yen only go back to 1994Q1. Historical
series can be obtained for the period 1955Q1-2001Q1, but with a 1980 base for real ones.
Furthermore, none of the real series is seasonally adjusted. For each variable, we construct
a full sample series by merging the two original sources, adjusting the level of the chained
2005 Yen series to make sure that both original series share the same average over their
period of overlap, namely 1994Q1-2001Q1. To deal with seasonality, we filter real GDP with

                                               18
a bandpass filter removing fluctuations of periods less than or equal to 5 quarters. Because
the relative price is a ratio, it does not need further adjustment since seasonal frequencies
are eliminated. Because of this complex and potentially hazardous treatment of the data, it
is useful to note that for the seasonally adjusted chained 2005 series only, the correlation is
0.26 (p-value .02), compared to 0.18 (p-value 0.00) with the extended sample.


C         Cyclical properties of investment quantities in the
          U.S.A.
As those properties are already well documented and fairly stable over time, we report them
only for our full sample 1960Q1-2013Q4.
       The first column in Table 8 shows the volatilities of investment quantities relative to real
GDP over the business cycle 8 . Unsurprisingly, all investment series are much more variable
than GDP. Total private investment is about three times as volatile as output, and household
investment is more volatile than business investment. Among disaggregated series, residential
investment is the most variable, with a standard deviation more than six times larger than
that of GDP at business cycle frequencies. Intellectual property rights is much less variable
than other investment components, which is largely due to the specificities of immaterial
production.
       Turning to the dynamic link between investment and GDP, Figure 9 provides cross-

     As usual, we compute relative volatilities by dividing the standard deviation of the cyclical component
of log per-capita investment series by the standard deviation of the cyclical component of log real per-capita
GDP.

correlograms between investment and output quantities over the business cycle. Specifically,
the figure plots the correlation between the cyclical components of investment quantity at
date t + j and GDP quantity at date t. Shaded bands represent asymptotic 95-percent
confidence bands for estimated cross-correlations assuming a true correlation of zero 9 . As
expected, all components of investment are strongly procyclical, with contemporaneous cor-
relations with output ranging from 0.47 for structures to 0.90 for total private investment.
All are statistically different from zero. Notice that business investment lags the cycle by one
quarter since the maximum correlation is between business investment in t + 1 and GDP in t,
while household investment leads by one quarter since the maximum correlation is between
household investment in t − 1 and GDP in t. These phase shifts come from structures on
the one hand, which lag the cycle by four quarters, and residential investment on the other,
which leads by one quarter. Those individual phase shifts are masked when considering total
private investment, whose cycle is exactly synchronized with that of GDP.


D        Asymptotic distribution of sample cross-correlations
In this section, we provide the asymptotic approximation we use to construct confidence
bands for sample cross-correlations between HP-filtered series, taking serial correlation into
account.
       We adopt the following framework. Let Xt and Yt be two stationary MA processes
with respective innovations X      Y
                             t and t . In our applications, Xt and Yt represent the cycli-

cal components of HP-filtered quantity or price series. Let ρX (j) = corr(Xt , Xt+j ) and
ρY (j) = corr(Yt , Yt+j ) denote the autocorrelation functions of Xt and Yt . Also, let ρXY (j) =
corr(Xt , Yt+j ) denote the cross-correlation function between Xt and Yt and ρbXY (j) be its
sample counterpart computed from a sample of size T . Assume that {X         Y
                                                                    t } and {t } are

independent at all leads and lags, so that the distribution is constructed under the null of
zero correlation between {Xt } and {Yt }. Then, theorem 11.2.2 in Brockwell and Davis [1991]
implies that
                                                                  ∞
                        √                                         X
                            T ρbXY (j) →d N (0, V ),        V =          ρX (h)ρY (h).
                                                                  h=−∞

    We estimate the asymptotic variances of sample cross-correlations taking serial correlation into account.

econometric literature, we set q(T ) ≈ T 1/3 to optimally trade estimation bias and variance.
