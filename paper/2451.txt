                Welfare Dominance: An Application to Commodity Taxation




                                       ABSTRACT




       In this paper, we suggest a method which enables the user to identify

  commodities that all individuals who can agree on certain weak assumptions

  with regard to the social welfare function will agree upon as worth

  subsidizing or taxing in the absence of efficiency considerations. The method

  is based on an extension of the stochastic dominance criteria and is

  illustrated using data from Israel.

 I. Introduction



          A principal weakness of the theory of optimal taxation with

heterogeneous taxpayers is the dependence of the optimum tax rates on the

exact properties of the social welfare function. While other components of

the problem, such as the excess burden of the tax system, can presumably be

recovered from empirical observations on the behavior of consumers, it is

clear that estimating the social welfare function is not an easy task.

Although there have been severaL attempts to recover the social welfare

function using the revealed preferences of governments, (usually by assuming

that governments are acting optimally according to a "just" principal of

taxation, such as equal sacrifice), all of these methods require very strong

assumptions which are unlikely to command wide support.



         This problem Is especially disturbing for developing countries which

rely heavily on commodity taxes as a major policy instrument for raising

revenue and changing the income distribution. In most of these countries data

is not available even for estimating the excess burden of the tax system.

Therefore, it seems that the theory of optimal commodity taxation is not very

helpful as an input into policy formulation in this context. This problem is

even more complicated from the perspective of an economic adviser whose role

is to advise the government of a specific country. If, in an ideal case, the

government can supply him with all the necessary data, then the "cost" or the




1. See Musgrave (1959), Mera (1969), Weisbrod (1968), Piggott (1982), Yaari
    (1986).
                                        —2—

inefficiency caused by the tax system can be estimated. However, in order to

make recommendations about optimal tax design, the adviser must be aware of

the preferences of the government (or the society) involved. Without this

information the advice rendered represents only the adviser's preferences,

which need not be the same as the preferences of the government seeking

advice. Hence, it will be convenient to see whether it is possible to

overcome this difficulty by statistical analysis.



         The aim of this paper is to suggest a method which enables the user

to identify commodities that all individuals who can agree on certain weak

assumptions with regard to social policy will agree upon as worth subsidizing

or taxing in the absence of efficiency considerations. If such commodities

can be identified, then the task of advising the government on optimal

directions of tax reform will be rendered nearly value—free. In other words,

all individuals would agree that the taxation of one commodity should be

reduced in favor of heavier taxation on another, if the marginal excess burden

is equal for the two commodities.



         The specific question this paper addresses is the following: assume

that the government wants to make an equal yield change in its commodity tax

system by subsidizing one commodity and taxing another commodity by an

additional dollar ——   is   it possible to identify two such commodities such that

social welfare increases for all concave Paretian social welfare functions?

If such situations can be identified, the preferred direction of tax reform

can be located without detailed knowledge of preferences regarding inter-

personal transfers. Alternatively, If such commodities cannot be found, it
                                     —3—

will be clear that it is impossible to make recommendations in the absence of

further information about the governing social welfare function.



         The methodology which enables us to answer this question was

originally developed in the finance literature, where it is referred to as the

Second—Degree Stochastic Dominance Criteria. The main idea is to assume that

the criteria which is used to rank prospects (portfolios) is expected utility,

and that the investigator assumes only that the marginal utility of income is

non—negative and non—increasing. Based on these assumptions, rules for

ranking prospects have been developed (e. g., Hadar and Russell (1969), Hanoch

and Levy (1969)).



         Our intention is to use the methodology of stochastic dominance for

ranking taxes on different commodities. As has been demonstrated by Atkinson

(1970), there is a formal similarity between the ranking of income

distributions and the ranking of prospects. Hence, the use of stochastic

dominance rules in welfare economics is a natural development following from

Atkinson's observation. However, since taxation and in particular commodity

taxation affect social welfare in a slightly different way than the effect of

a prospect on the utility function, several changes must be made to the

methodology; we refer to these adapted rules as welfare dominance. V    The

major changes are the following:




2. This term was coined by Shorrocks (1983).
                                    —4—

(a)     In the finance literature, the main interest is to rank portfolios,

the analogy to which in our study is the ranking of income distributions. Our

goal, though, is the ranking of (taxes on) commodities, expenditure on which

is a component of total income. Therefore, we have to use conditional

stochastic dominance rules, which can be translated into the finance liter-

ature as asking whether asset A dominates asset B given that the investor has

also to hold portfolio C. In the case of welfare dominance, the same formal

question can be interpreted as whether subsidizing expenditure on commodity A

instead of expenditure on commodity B improves welfare, given that the income

distribution is C.



(b)     We are interested in dominance at the margin. The analogy to finance

is whether a small increase in the share of asset A at the expense of asset B

(given that the rest of the portfolio held is C) increases expected utility.

In the case of taxation, the same formal question can be interpreted as

whether a small decrease in tax on A financed by a small increase in tax on B,

(given that the income distribution is C), increases expected welfare.



        As we show in the next section, this question can be answered by

comparing concentration curves. The concentration curve is a diagram which is

similar to the Lorenz curve. On the horizontal axis the households are

ordered according to their income, while the vertical axis describes the

cumulative percentage of the total expenditure on a specific commodity that is

spent by the families whose incomes are less than or equal to the specified

income level. The concentration curve, like the Lorenz curve, passes through

the origin. But, unlike the Lorenz curve, it need not always be increasing,
                                     —5—

and its curvature depends on the income elasticity of the commodity. In

particular, if the curve is convex (concave) to the origin then the income

elasticity is negative (positive). i



         If the concentration curve of one commodity is above the

concentration curve of another commodity, then the first commodity dominates

the second. However, if the concentration curves intersect, then it is

impossible to show dominance. In other words, only if concentration curves do

not intersect will all social welfare functions show that the tax change

increases welfare.     We refer to these rules as Marginal Conditional

Stochastic Dominance rules (hereafter MCSD rules) and in the rest of the

paper, dominates stands for marginal conditional stochastic dominates).



         The structure of the paper is the following: the next section

provides an intuitive proof for MCSD rules. In the third section, additional,

insight is gained by relating these rules to a methodology based on the

decomposition of the Gini coefficient. Section IV uses data from Israel in

order to illustrate the methodology. The paper concludes with suggestions for

further research.




3. For a detailed analysis of the curvature of concentration curves, see
    Kakwani (1981) and Yitzhaki and 01km (1987).

4. It is worth noting that concentration curves have been used to describe
    the progressivity of taxes by many investigators. See, among others,
    Suits (1977a, 1977b), Clotfelter (1977), Kakwani (1977,1981,1984), Kiefer
    (1984), Rock (1983), Formby, Smith and Sykes (1986). However, the use of
    concentration curves to identify tax changes which are welfare dominating
    is new.

II. Intuitive Derivation of the Methodology.



         Assume that tax policies are evaluated according to an additively

separable social welfare function, which is the sum of identical individual

utility functions. All that is known about the social welfare function is

that the marginal utility of Income is positive and declining. Formally,



         w =


where I is income and P are prices and all that is known about V is



that av
     _r>O and      a2v
                         <0.
                   a'



         Now suppose that the government is considering a small increase in

the tax on commodity i and a small decrease in the tax on commodity j so that

total revenue does not change. Let x1 denote the consumption of commodity I

by the hth individual, where the individuals are arranged in a non—decreasing

order of income. Let X denotes total consumption of commodity i. Since the

change in revenue raised is zero, there is a link between the change in prices

of commodity i and j. Assuming no change in the quantities consumed or in the

producer prices, the relationship is:




5. In Yitzhaki and 01km (1987), Marginal Conditional Stochastic Dominance
    rules are developed in the context of portfolio analysis. Since the
    proofs are identical to those required in this paper, we refer the
    interested reader to that paper. In this section an intuitive proof is
   given.
                                             —7—

         dP X + dP. X. =            0

hence

 (1)    dP = — (Xi!       X1} dP3



         Consider the welfare of the poorest person in the society. Denote

his consumption of commodity i and commodity j by x1 and x1. A necessary

condition that all social welfare functions show that the suggested reform is

welfare increasing is that the reform does not worsen the utility of the

poorest individual. (Otherwise a Rawisian decision maker will judge that the

suggested reform decreases welfare). The effect of the reform on the welfare

of the poorest in the society depends on the compensation needed to allow him

to have the same utility as before. That is, it depends on the sign of


           1         1
(2)       x. dP. + x. dP.
           1    1    •]   •J




and if (2) is negative, then the welfare of the poorest person has been

increased as a result of the reform.



         Substituting for dP from equation (1), we get:



(3)      [x I X. — x'1 / XJ
                          1
                            X, dP.
           .3   .3              3       .3




Since Xj is positive, and dP is negative by assumption, the sign of (3)

depends on whether the term in the square brackets is positive. But this

expression is the difference between the poorest's individual's share of

consumption of commodity j to his share of commodity i. Hence, a necessary
                                              —8—

condItion that all social welfare functions show an increase in social welfare

is that the share of the expenditure of the poorest individual on commodity i

is lower than his share in the expenditure on commodity j. Having established

the condition for a socially acceptable reform with regard to the poorest

Individual, we next check the condition applying to the second individual.

The marginal utility of income of the second individual is lower than the

marginal utility of income of the first individual, hence all social welfare

functions will show an increase in social welfare if the gain in income for

the first individual is higher than the loss for the second individual. By

repeating the same considerations which led to (3), the condition with regard

to the second Individual is:



(4)      {[x +
               3
                   x]/X.

                                                               0



and the condition for the kth individual is



               h/X — Ek x'/X.} X. dP. < 0
(5)      (Ek
           h=1 j j    h=1 1 i.                j
         Condition   (5) is easy to interpret. In brackets is the difference

between the relative concentration curve of commodity i and the relative

concentration curve of commodity j.           The condition implies that for all social

welfare functions to show that this tax change increases social welfare it is

necessary that the concentration curve of commodity i with respect to income

is at least as high as the concentration curve of commodity j at each point in

the income distribution. Condition (5) is also a sufficient one because if

the condition is violated it is possible to construct a concave Paretian

welfare function which Indicates that the tax reform decreases social welfare.
                                    —9—

         Note that condition (5) does not constitute a complete ordering of

(commodity) taxes. That is, if two concentration curves intersect, then it

will be impossible to find a small change in the taxation of the commodities

involved that all social welfare functions judge to be an increase in

welfare. If we insist on having a complete ordering, then we have to further

investigate the concentration curves to see whether restricting the class of

social welfare function enables us to classify policies. This issue is

discussed in the next section.



         Although the ordering is not complete, it is clearly transitive: if

commodity A dominates commodity B and commodity B dominates C, then A

dominates C.     This property enables us to establish an ordering among the

subgroup of commodities in which dominance is found.



         Figure 1 presents some typical cases. On the horizontal axis of each

graph the cumulative distribution of income is plotted while the vertical axis

represents the difference between the concentration curve of commodity A and

the concentration curve of commodity B. In other words, on the vertical axis

we present the difference between the share of total expenditure on A and the

share of total expenditure on B for the poorest F families. All of the

"difference in concentration curves" (DCC curve hereafter, where the indices

indicate the commodities) include the origin and end up at [0,1]. If the

curve is above the horizontal axes then A dominates B, while if it is entirely

below the horizontal axes then B dominates A. If the curve crosses the



6. To see this, notice that if the concentration curve of A is everywhere
    above the concentration curve of B, and the concentration curve of B is
    everywhere above the concentration curve of C, then it is clear that the
    concentration curve of A is everywhere above the concentation curve of C.
                                     — 10 —



horizontal   axes then neither B dominates A nor A dominates B. In the next

section we show that the area between the difference in concentration curves

and the horizontal axis is equal to the difference in the income elasticities

of the two commodities.



         Until now, we have been interested in an increase of the subsidy to

one commodity that is financed by an increase of the tax on another

commodity. The same methodology can be used to ask whether an increase in a

subsidy that is financed by a proportional income tax Increases welfare. In

this case we treat total income as a commodity and look at the difference

between the concentration curve for commodity i and the Lorenz curve. If the

DCC10, where the index 0 Indicates the Lorenz curve, is always positive, then

commodity i dominates the proportional tax.



III. Restricting the Social Welfare Functions.



         As noted above, the MCSD rules do not form a complete ordering over

the taxable commodities. Moreover, we suspect that there are many commodities

that will be impossible to order by this method. In these cases one may wish
                                          — 11 —



to    investigate further restrictions on the set of possible welfare functions,

such as third degree stochastic dominance rules. ii



            The main problem with such rules is that their use does not ensure a

complete ordering in all cases. Therefore, their use may increase the set of

commodities over which an ordering is defined, but it does not eliminate the

problem of incomplete ordering. An alternative way that ensures a complete

ordering is to restrict ourselves to necessary conditions for stochastic

dominance. This Is the case where the analysis of tax reforms is carried out

with the use of the Cmi coefficient (Yitzhaki (1987)). This procedure

provides a complete ordering, however, it will be impossible to show that the

suggested ordering may be rejected by all social welfare functions. Another

approach which ensures a complete ordering is to use a specific welfare

function, but then we may abandon the connection to MCSD rules.



           The area below the forty—five degree line minus the area below the

concentration curve is defined as one—half of the concentration ratio. As

shown In Yitzhaki and 01km (1987), this area is also equal to:



(6)             =
                    cov(X,F(Y))   /
                                      m


where      is one half of the concentration ratio, m is the mean expenditure on

commodity i, and F(Y) is the cumulative distribution of income. In other

words, the concentration ratio is equal to twice the covariance between the

expenditure on commodity i and the cumulative distribution of income divided



7. For a definition of third degree stochastic dominance, see Whitmore
      (1970).
                                        — 12 —




by the mean expenditure on commodity i. Hence the area between the
concentration curve of commodity i and the concentration curve of commodity 3

(i.   e. between the DCC3 curve and the horizontal axis) is:



                —
(7)                 Cj = cov(X,F(Y))Im—   cov(X3,F(Y)) / m3



By dividing and multiplying equation (7) by cov(Y,F(Y)) and my, respectively,

we can rewrite (7) as:



                1
(8)                 DCC3(F) dF =    Cb/S1— b3/S3} G



where      is the Cmi coefficient of income, Si is the share of the

expenditure on X1 and



(9)        bj        cov(X1,F(Y))/cov(Y,F(Y))



is Siever's (1983) non—parametric estimator of the slope of the regression

line of Xj on Y. In our context b is a weighted mean of the marginal

propensity to spend on commodity i. As argued in Yitzhaki (1987), b/S can

be interpreted as the weighted average income elasticity of commodity i.

Hence equation (9) tells us that the sign of the area below the DCC3 curve is

determined by the difference between the weighted average income elasticities

of the commodities. Because for commodity i to dominate commodity 3 DCCjj

must be positive, it is clear that a necessary condition (but, of course, not
                                     — 13 —



sufficient)   for welfare dominance is that the income elasticity of commodity i

is lower than the income elasticity of commodity j.



          One can repeat the same argument using the extended Cmi. The

extended Cmi is a weighted integral of the area between the forty—five degree

line and the Lorenz curve. The formula for the extended Cmi is:



(10)      G(Y) =    — v cov(Y,[1—F(Y)J1) /              v>1
                                           my



where v is a parameter chosen by the investigator. The extended Cmi is

similar to the Cmi coefficient except that it uses a different weighting

scheme. The Cmi is a special case of the extended Cmi where v is 2. The

higher is v, the more the bottom of the income distribution is stressed. §1



          The above analysis using the Cmi can be carried out using the

extended Cmi. In the appendix we show that an increase in the subsidy to

commodity i that is financed by an increase in the tax on commodity j

decreases the extended Cmi inequality index, if



(11)
          j1                  (1F)2 dF >0,


where •(F) is the concentration curve. Since .(F) — 4.(F)       is the Dccm

curve, then the analysis of tax reform with the extended Cmi coefficient

provides additional necessary conditions for welfare dominance. If commodity

i dominates commodity j, then a shift from taxing commodity i to commodity j



8. See Yitzhaki (1983) for a discussion of the properties of the extended
   Cmi.
                                   — 14 —



must decrease the extended Cmi inequality index for all v, including the
standard Cmi case where v=2. These necessary conditions are useful in

empirical investigation of welfare dominance because they are fairly easy to

calculate and can be used to identify the pairs of commodities for which

welfare dominance is possible.




IV. An Illustration with Israeli Data.

        This section illustrates the methodology of MCSD rules using cross—

section data on consumption of subsidized commodities in Israel. The data set

is the Survey of Family Expenditure (1979/80) conducted by the Central Bureau

of Statistics. This Survey consists of a random stratified sample of 2271

urban households. Since we are interested in level of economic well—being,

the concept of income per standard adult is used. 2!   The households are

ordered according to total net income per standard adult, where total net

income is defined as monetary income plus imputed income from ownership of

housing and vehicles minus income and social security taxes.



         Before presenting the results, two technical points are worth




9. The concept of standard adult is an equivalence scale intended to take
    Into account the effect of the size of the household on consumption
    needs. The scale that is used is the following: Single 1.25 standard
    adults, a couple without children 2.0, a couple with one child 2.65, with
    two children 3.2, with three children 3.75, with four children 4.2, and .4
    for each additional child. It is used in many official publications of
    the National Insurance Institute and the Central Bureau of Statistics of
    Israel.

10. The sample is a weighted sample, which means that each household in the
    sample represents a different number of households in the population. The
    equations given in this paper have therefore been adjusted in a straight-
    forward way to account for this, See Lerman and Yitzhaki (1986)
                                     — 15 —




making.   In general, if there are n commodities, one would have to plot

n • (n—1)/2 pairs of concentration curves to investigate the existence of

welfare dominance. Since cross—section samples usually contain thousands of

observations, this can clearly become a cumbersome procedure when more than a

few commodities are being studied. As suggested above, comparisons of the

magnitude of the weighted income elasticities, according to the Gini or

extended Gird coefficient, yield necessary conditions for dominance, thus

reducing the number of comparisons of curves needed. The second issue arises

because of the use of a sample instead of the whole population. As shown by

Goldie (1967), sample—based Lorenz curves do converge to the population Lorenz

curve, but it is clear that our results may be affected by the sample

variability. One way to reduce the sample variability is to average

observations. Hence in what follows we plot concentration curves based on the

whole sample and also report the results when concentration curves are based

on averaging consecutive pairs of observations.



          Table 1 presents weighted average income elasticities, estimated by

using several variants of the extended Cmi coefficient. As can be seen,

there are two inferior commodities, bread and cooking oil, while the other

commodities are normal.

         As mentioned above, the higher is v the more weight that is given to

the lower portion of the income distribution. Hence, we can conclude from the

table that the income elasticity of public transportation declines as income

increases while bread tend to be less inferior, the higher the income. Since

the income elasticity of cooking oil is lower than the income elasticity of

bread for all v, the necessary conditions for cooking oil to dominate bread

are met, and it is reasonable to check whether cooking oil dominates bread.

By the same reasoning we conclude from Table 1 that, if there is dominance,

then the ordering must be: cooking oil, bread, sugar, public transportation

and finally water for household consumption. It is impossible that a good

will be dominated by another good lower in the table.
                                     — 17 —



         Figure   2 presents the curve of the difference between the

concentration curves (Dcc curve) of cooking oil and bread. As expected from

Table 1, the area above the X—axis is larger than the area below it. (The

difference between the areas is equal to the income elasticity of cooking oil

minus bread calculated by the Cmi index). Hence, we can see that the cooking

oil is more inferior than bread when the weighting scheme of the Cmi is

used. However, the curve intersects the X—axis. This implies that for the

lower two deciles of the income distribution, bread has a lower income

elasticity than cooking oil, while for the other deciles bread has a higher

income elasticity. If the social welfare function is concave only for the

lower two deciles then taxation policy should shift to subsidize bread at the

expense cooking oil. The conclusion is that cooking oil does not dominate

bread.




         Figure 3 presents the DCC curve between bread and water for household

consumption. As can be seen, the curve is always above the X—axis, and hence

bread dominates water.



         Figure 4 presents the Dcc of bread and public transportation. As in

Figure 3, except for one observation, bread dominates public transportation.




11. A close examination of the individual observations reveals that the curve
     intersects the X—axis for the very last observation, so that the share of
     the richest household in the sample, in total expenditure of bread, is
     higher than his share in the overall expenditure in water. If this
     sample exactly portrayed the population, a social welfare function that
     is linear over the whole range of the distribution and concave between
     the second richest family and the richest one would show that subsidizing
     bread at the expense of water would be welfare decreasing. However, we
     suspect that this is a result of the sampling error. If we take the
     average of two consecutive observations, then this proviso disappears.
                                      — 18 —



If   we plot the DCC averaging every two consecutive observations, then bread

dominates public transportation with no exceptions.



           This phenomenon illustrates just how strong the condition of MCSD

is. Even if the entire population is studied, the consumption patterns of the

richest and poorest members of society are critical in determining the

existence of welfare dominance.



           Figure 5 presents the DCC of bread minus the Lorenz curve. This

figure is intended to show whether an increase in the subsidy on bread that is

financed by an increase in proportional income tax increases welfare for all

additive concave Paretian social welfare functions. Because the DCC curve is

above the X—axis over the whole income range, the answer to this question is

yes.



V. Conclusions.



           Since the exact properties of social welfare functions are not known,

and it is doubtful whether they can be recovered by future research, it would

be valuable to make judgments about potential tax reforms that depend only on

uncontroversial characteristics of the social welfare function. The method-

ology provided in this paper is a first step in this direction. It states the

conditions (called marginal conditional stochastic dominance rules) required

for all individuals with Paretian concave social welfare functions to agree

that an increase in the subsidy on one commodity, which is financed by an

increase of the tax on another commodity (or a proportional income tax),
                                    — 19 —



increases social welfare. If this reform does not increase excess burden,

then all individuals will agree on the preferred direction of tax reform. An

inspection of Israeli data suggests that these conditions are quite commonly

observed in practice, making this a practically relevant point.



         One direction for future research is to apply this methodology to a

weighted combination of commodities. In this case a set of changes in taxes

and subsidies can be compared to another set in order to see whether all

IndIviduals can agree on the welfare implications of particular tax reforms.

Another interesting challenge is to introduce efficiency considerations into

the analysis. In the present setting of MCSD rules, the permissable set of

welfare functions includes welfare functions which are almost linear (constant

marginal utility). The permissability of such welfare functions means that it

will be impossible to find unanimous preference for any redistribution that

increases efficiency costs. Therefore only by limiting the set of the admis-

sible welfare functions will it be possible to find MCSD rules for costly

redistribution. One possible way of doing that is to restrict the set such

that only welfare functions with some minimum concavity are included.

                                        Appendix


             In this appendix we prove the following results:



a. The derivative of the extended Gini of overall income with respect to

        constant revenue tax changes is equal to the difference in the (weighted)

    concentration ratio of the commodities involved in the tax changes.



b. The (weighted) concentration ratio is equal to the (weighted) area below

    the concentration curve.




    Properties (a) and (b) together with equation (2) ensure that a necessary

    condition for a commodity to dominate another commodity is that the

    extended Cmi of inequality declines as a result of the tax changes.



    Proof of property (a)

            For simplicity of presentation, we assume continuous distributions,

and two commodities



(A.1)       Let y = p1 x1 +
                              P2 x2

            where p 1 is the price of commodity 1, y is income and

            x represents commodities.



            The extended Cmi of inequality is
                                   — 26 —




(A.2)    G(v) =     —v   coy (y, [1F(y)]'') /     m




        where m is mean income.



The derivative of C(v) with respect to p1, evaluated at p1 =     1   can be

interpreted as the effect of a change in the tax on commodity 1 on the

extended Cmi. Note that p1 affects both the nominator and denominator of

(A.2). Let us start with the derivative of the nominator.



         Let A(y) = l—F(y).


        Note that



          E {A V_l(y)} =     F [l—F(y)J'        f(y) dy



         and by transformations of variables with F =     F(y)


         we get



(A.3)     Ey (A1(Y)) =         (1—F)''   dF =




Using (A.3), the nominator of (A.2) can be written as


          cov(y,A"(y)) =        y (v A"'(y) - 1) f(y) dy


and again using transformation of variables where F =     F(y)
                                                  — 27 —




 (A.4)      coy (y,AV(y)) =             f y(F)     [v(i-F)1- 1] dF


 where y(F) =         inf   {y : F(y)       F)



 is the inverse of the cumulative distribution function.



Differentiating (A.4), while using (A.i) yields




(A.5)
            a   cov(y,AV(y))
                       p1
                                   =
                                        0ji x     (F) [v(1—F)"1-i] dF




and   by reversing the procedure that led from (A.2) to (A.4) we get




                    v-i
(A.6)
           3 cov(y,A               = coy         (x1, [1—F(y)]")
                      p1




Now that the derivative of the numerator is known, we can derive the

derivative of the extended Cmi with respect to a change in p1.




           3G   (v)
(A.7)                  =                           G(v)
                            S1 C(x1,y,v) — S1
                                                       — 28 —



where    S =     m    /m is   the share of x and
          1          ly                            1




         C(x1,y,v) =          —v
                                   cov(x1,[1—F(y)]")/m1


is the (weighted) concentration index.

              The effect of an equal revenue tax change on the extended Cmi can be

evaluated by using (A.7). Let                      denote the derivative of the extended Cmi

with respect to the tax reform.                  That is



               dG
                         ac (v)                3G (v)
(A.8)                =
               dR
                          9p1
                                        dp1+     ap2
                                                        dp2



and by using the restriction m1 dp1 + m2 dp2 =                          0



and (A.7) we get



(A.9)                =                    —
                         {C(x1,y,v)           C(x2,y,v)}      s1 dp1



which means that the effect of the tax changes on the extended Cmi depends on

the difference between the concentration ratios of the commodities. This

completes the proof of (a).



Proof of Property (b).



              Let x represent an expenditure on a commodity, then



(A.1O)         c(x,y,v) =          —v   cov(x,[1F(y)]') I          mx
                                                — 29 —




writing   the covariance explicitly and eliminating zeros yield



                                                                      1
(A.11)     c(x,y,v) =
                           _(v/m) E E {(x — mx)[1_F(y)}'                  f(x,y) dx dy



          Let g(y) =   E       (x1y)), then
                           1



(A.12)     c(x1,y,v) =         (!)        (g(y)—m) f(y) [1F(y)]"1 dy



and by integration by parts where



           v(y) = (g(y)         —
                                    m)   f(y)         v(y) =         (g(t)   —
                                                                                 m)   f(t) dt




           V(y) =   (1_F(y))v_l      dy           V(y) = - (v_1)(1_F(y))v             f(y) dy



and rearranging terms, we get



(A.13)     c(x,y,v) = v(v—1)                    (g(t) —   m)    f(t) dt [1—F(y)]2 f(y) dy



By transformation of variables, where F =                F(y)


                1
and (F) =           1y(F) gt f(t) dt is the concentration curve



we get
                                    — 30 —




         c(x,y,v)   = v(v—1)   .f1[$(F) —   F] [1FJ''2 dp




which means that the concentration ratio is equal to the area between the

concentration curve and the 450 line.

         Note that the difference between the concentration ratios is hence

the (weighted) difference between the concentration curves.
