                                         ABSTRACT

Prices negotiated between payers and providers affect a health insurance contract's value via
enrollees' cost-sharing and self-insured employers' costs. However, price variation across payers
is hard to observe. We measure negotiated prices for hospital-payer pairs in Massachusetts and
characterize price variation. Between-payer price variation is similar in magnitude to between-
hospital price variation. Administrative-services-only contracts, in which insurers do not bear
risk, have higher prices. We model negotiation incentives and show that contractual form and
demand responsiveness to negotiated prices are important determinants of negotiated prices.

                                               Abstract
          Prices negotiated between payers and providers affect a health insurance contract’s
      value via enrollees’ cost-sharing and self-insured employers’ costs. However, price varia-
      tion across payers is difficult to observe. We measure negotiated prices for hospital-payer
      pairs in Massachusetts and characterize price variation. Between-payer price variation is
      similar in magnitude to between-hospital price variation. Administrative-services-only
      contracts, in which insurers do not bear risk, have higher prices. We model negotiation
      incentives and show that contractual form and demand responsiveness to negotiated
      prices are important determinants of negotiated prices.



1     Introduction

High health care costs are a major public policy concern. Higher quantities and prices both
contribute to the United States’ uniquely high costs relative to other countries (Garber and
Skinner 2008, Cutler and Ly 2011). Furthermore, price variation across settings, providers,
and regions has received substantial media and policy attention. Prices for the same service
vary substantially between geographic markets and between providers in a given geographic
market (Cooper et al., forthcoming). While the recent literature has focused on between-
provider variation, negotiated prices may vary across insurers as well. In this paper, we

provide new descriptive evidence for the role of insurers and payers in setting negotiated
prices. We explore the size of price variation between insurers, how contracting incentives
affect these prices, and consequences for individuals and self-insured employers.
     We document variation in prices paid to the same provider for the same service using
data from the Massachusetts All-Payer Claims Database (APCD). We examine negotiated
payments for five well-defined services (knee and hip replacements, vaginal and cesarean
deliveries, and MRIs), in addition to overall price levels for all inpatient care. Between-
payer price variation is similar in magnitude to between-provider price variation. Across our
five clinical cohorts, the standard deviation in prices across hospitals, controlling for payer,
ranges from 17-31 percent of the mean. In comparison, the standard deviation in prices
across payers, controlling for hospitals, ranges from 16-28 percent of the mean. The most
expensive major payer is about 13% more expensive on average than the cheapest major
payer in our sample. For comparison, the highest-priced hospital system in our data is 27%
more expensive than the average of other hospitals.
     Examining variation in prices between payers at the same provider largely eliminates
quality differences as a potential explanation. Differences in bargaining between payers may
reflect underlying differences in enrollees’ demand for providers across payers, the ability of
payers to steer enrollees to specific hospitals, or bargaining ability. In our data, differences in
underlying enrollee demand across payers are unlikely to explain price differences, as demo-
graphic characteristics (e.g., income) and distance to nearby hospitals are relatively balanced
across payers. Finally, one might also be concerned that price differentials across payers could
reflect differences in underlying severity and inputs used to treat patients. Examining MRI
prices allows us to isolate a homogeneous procedure where even the “chargemaster” rate (list
price) is the same across payers within a provider.
     Variation in negotiated provider prices is important for at least two distinct reasons.
First, consumers bear part of those costs in the form of out-of-pocket spending. Second,
higher provider prices translate into higher costs for self-insured employers and, potentially,


                                                2
higher insurance premiums in the fully-insured market. While price transparency efforts
have focused on helping consumers compare prices between providers before obtaining care,
the earlier choice of which insurer to buy from will also have important effects on the health
care prices consumers face. All else equal, consumers should prefer plans offered by insurers
with lower negotiated rates. This is particularly true as the popularity of high-deductible
insurance plans grows. Moreover, because self-insured employers pay medical costs directly
at the prices their insurer (henceforth “payer”) negotiates, they should prefer lower negotiated
provider prices in administrative services only (ASO) contracts.1
       Choosing a low price instead of a high price major payer (about a 15% difference
in negotiated prices) leads to an average out-of-pocket (OOP) savings of $182 in a high-
deductible plan; an individual with more knowledge about the types of service and hospitals
they would use would experience greater price variation. The cost reduction for self-insured
employers is larger: $750-$1,000 per enrollee.2
       Given the importance of between-payer variation, we explore strategic payer behavior.
The existing literature suggests that payers will receive lower prices if they have larger mar-
ket share or greater ability to steer patients to specific providers (Sorensen 2003, Roberts,
Chernew, and McWilliams 2017, and Ho and Lee 2017).3 Our theory shows that—in addition
to these forces—the response of insurance demand to negotiated prices is a crucial determi-
nant of negotiated price levels; to our knowledge, this parameter has not been measured.
Contracting incentives are also important. In a fully-insured product, the payer bears most
of the costs of higher negotiated prices; in an ASO contract, the payer typically receives a
fixed fee and the self-insured employer bears the costs of higher negotiated prices. All else
   1
      Self-insured employers do not technically work with insurers, but with an ASO or third-party adminis-
trators who administer the plan. We use the term “payer” to refer to both these entities and to insurers.
    2
      The average commercially insured individual in Massachusetts has about $5,000 in health care spending
(Lassman et al. 2017). We observe prices that are 15-20% lower at the lowest price payer relative to the
highest. All else equal, a medium-size enterprise with 200 insurees would save $150,000-$200,000 per year
by choosing the payer with lower provider prices. While ASO contracts could offset higher provider prices
with lower administrative fees, these fees are only about 5% of claims on average making it unlikely that
they fully offset observed price variation (CHIA, 2016)
    3
      The incentives of insurers to negotiate lower prices has been identified as way to mitigate provider
pricing power (see Trish and Herring 2015 and Ho and Lee 2017).


                                                    3
equal, we predict that payers will negotiate less aggressively when they are not financially
responsible for the claim; in the data, negotiated prices at a given hospital are higher in
ASO contracts (by about 2-4%), holding payer constant. Consistent with previous studies,
we also find that managed care (HMO) plans command prices that are 3-5% lower, holding
payer constant.
         The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes relevant features of the insurer
market and related literature. Section 3 describes our data and estimation strategy. Section
4 discusses the magnitude of variation in negotiated provider prices. Section 5 discusses the
implications of this variation for the value of an insurance plan, and provides a framework
for understanding payers’ negotiated provider prices. Section 6 concludes.



2        Setting and Related Literature

Negotiation between payers and providers determines most health care prices outside of
Medicare fee-for-service. Rather than paying a posted price, payers typically negotiate “al-
lowed amounts" with providers. We focus our discussion on employer-sponsored insurance,
whichis the dominant form of private health insurance in the United States; however, our
insights are also relevant for other insurance markets.4
         Employers in the U.S. healthcare system often purchase insurance on their enrollees’
behalf. In fully-insured plans, the insurer takes on both administrative responsibilities and
financial risk. These fully-insured plans are typically purchased by small employer groups;
Cebul et al. (2011) show that the fully-insured market is characterized by high search costs
and loads. In the market for these fully-insured plans, the employer serves as a (potentially
imperfect) agent for employees.
         Alternatively, employers can self-insure through ASO contracts or third-party adminis-
trator contracts. Under these arrangements, the employer contracts with a payer to admin-
ister the benefit, but the employer remains financially responsible for claims. The contract
    4
        For example, see Garthwaite and Scott Morton (2017) on prescription drug coverage.

                                                      4
can take the form of a fixed per-enrollee fee paid by the employer to the payer. Alternatively,
the employer may pay a percentage of overall claims as a fee, or the fixed fee may depend on
a prior year’s claims (see Jeng 1996). In these contracts, the employer bears the marginal
cost of additional healthcare costs; moreover, fees based on percentage of claims can lead
payers to receive high payments as negotiated prices increase. Both features attenuate the
incentive for payers to negotiate lower prices. Large employer groups typically self-insure,
due in part to federal law.5
      Our paper is related to a literature on insurer pricing. Cooper et al. (forthcoming)
examine the role of price variation between providers. Clemens and Gottlieb (2017) show
that changes in relative prices between services tend to follow Medicare. Clemens, Gottlieb,
and Molnár (2017) show that private payers tend to deviate most from Medicare when
sufficient value is at stake. Other work examines the effect of managed care on prices.
Cutler, McClellan, and Newhouse (2000) find that HMOs have lower expenditures largely
due to lower negotiated prices, and Wu (2009) finds similar results examining hospital prices
in Massachusetts from 1993-2000 using data from a large employer.6 More recently, Roberts,
Chernew, and McWilliams (2017) examine variation in prices for outpatient office visits using
data from FAIR Health (a dataset of about 60 insurers). They find that insurers with larger
market share in a county negotiate lower prices in that county.
      Our paper is also related to the structural bargaining literature, which has not his-
torically modeled the impact of strategic insurer behavior. Most papers (from Town and
Vistnes 2001 to Gowrisankaran, Nevo, and Town 2015) model insurers as maximizing con-
sumer surplus, while Ho and Lee (2017) model insurers as maximizing the Nash product of
their own profits (premiums net of claims) and consumer surplus. The latter formulation
    5
      The Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA preempts self-insured plans from state in-
surance regulation. (See Dalton and Holland (2017) on tax motivations for self-insurance, Feldman (2012)
for a moral hazard argument, and Jensen, Cotter, and Morrisey (1995) for the role of regulation).
    6
      Wu’s results show substantial variation in the discounts the HMO plans secure relative to the fee-for-
service plan (ranging from 26-52%). However, Wu’s results also show that hospital fixed effects explain a
limited fraction of variation in prices. That is in contrast to both our results and the recent work of Cooper et
al. (2015), and may be due to the method of measuring prices (per-diem rate for all admissions, as opposed
to well-defined services).


                                                       5
nests everything from Nash Bertrand pricing to a break-even constraint for insurer, but does
not explicitly consider the negotiation incentives that result from contractual form.



3       Empirical Strategy

We explore between-payer provider price variation in the private health insurance market in
the state of Massachusetts. Using the Massachusetts All Payer Claims Database (APCD),
we analyze prices for a representative set of services commonly provided to the privately
insured. These data are ideal for our analysis for three reasons. First, the data report
the actual negotiated prices between hospitals and payers (“allowed amounts”). Second, the
data contain the universe of commercial claims in the state, including both ASO plans and
fully-insured plans. Third, we observe payer identifiers, which allow us to estimate price
differences between payers and hospitals.


3.1      Data and Price Measurement

We examine claims for 18-64 year olds at 68 acute care hospitals from 2009-2011.7 In our
analysis, we focus on the three largest payers in Massachusetts: Blue Cross Blue Shield,
Tufts Health Plan, and Harvard Pilgrim. We also analyze prices for three national payers—
UnitedHealth, Aetna, and Cigna—which are large organizations but make up only a small
fraction of the Massachusetts market.8 Our results are not sensitive to the inclusion or
exclusion of specific payers.
        We use two strategies for price measurement, one focused on precision and one focused
on generalizability. To measure prices precisely, we select narrowly-defined services with
limited heterogeneity, so that measured prices are driven by bargaining, rather than by
differences in treatment intensity or patient severity. We use five clinical cohorts: admissions
    7
    See Ericson and Starc (2015b) for discussion of hospital definitions.
    8
    We observe prices for other payers, and include them in our analyses; due to small sample sizes at many
hospitals we do not report their coefficients.



                                                    6
for hip and knee replacement (ICD 8151 and 8154), vaginal and cesarean delivery (ICD 7359
and ICD 741), and lower limb MRI (CPT code 73721). We also restrict these data on the
basis of clinical codes that might indicate especially complex cases (e.g. fractures or crushing
injuries in joint replacements, or twins in deliveries).9 We exclude anyone under 18 or over 64
years, out-of-state enrollees, and those with missing provider information. We also exclude
episodes whose prices are in the top or bottom one percent of the price distribution and the
top one percent of length-of-stay, as these cases are likely to represent measurement error
or idiosyncratically complicated admissions that may not be representative of a patient’s
expected price of care. To summarize across service lines, we create a “composite price,”
which estimates the same price index, but for all five clinical cohorts together, adding a
clinical cohort fixed-effect to the regression. Additional details can be found in Appendix
A.1.
       In an alternative analysis focused on generalizability, we construct a dataset including
all inpatient admissions. We again estimate our hospital-payer price index, now treating the
primary diagnosis as the clinical cohort fixed-effect in the regression. The sample of all inpa-
tient admissions better represents the full basket of services over which payers and hospitals
negotiate, but may contain more measurement error. In both the “composite sample” and
“all inpatient sample,” we weight cohorts and diagnoses according to their overall contribu-
tion to spending to ensure that clinical events that occur frequently but do not make up a
large portion of spending (e.g., MRIs) do not dominate the results.10


3.2     Regression Specification

Our estimating equation is given by:
   9
      MRIs include only outpatient claims (at the hospital); to avoid potential bundling with other services,
we limit our analysis to patient days with no other claims and where there is a separate professional claim
for the reading of the MRI.
   10
      All of our results are qualitatively similar when estimated without weights or using inverse propensity
scores to balance the distribution of spending across payers.




                                                     7
                          ln(priceihpt ) = βXi + λZi + θh + θp + θt + ihpt ,                             (1)


where priceihpt is the transaction price for a given patient i at hospital h paid by payer p
in sample month t. We estimate these regressions separately on a sample for each clinical
cohort, as well as on the composite sample and the sample of all inpatient admissions.
Patient age (measured in 5-year age bands) and sex are included in Xi ; for the composite
and all-inpatient admissions samples, Xi also includes fixed-effects for each cohort or primary
diagnosis code.
       We control for insurance plan characteristics in Zi , including funding type (ASO/fully-
insured) and product (e.g., HMO, PPO).11 We include hospital fixed effects θh , sample-month
fixed effects θt , and, critically, payer fixed effects θp .
       To quantify price variation across payers and hospitals, we regress raw transaction
prices onto the covariates (Xi , Zi , θh , θp , and θt ), and analyze the distribution of payer and
hospital fixed effects:



                                                                  P
                                                                    i∈p θ̂h(i)
                                θ̂p = pricep − X p β − tp θ̂t −                  .                        (2)
                                                                      Np

       These fixed-effects represent payer p’s average price pricep , less the contribution of
patient characteristics, aggregate time shocks, and the average price difference of hospital h,
weighted by the fraction of payer p’s patients who obtained care at hospital h. The analogous
measures of θ̂h can be written the same way.12
  11
     These plan characteristics are indexed by i to reflect the fact that they vary across consumers who
purchase different plans within a payer.
  12
     In separate analysis, we follow equation (2) in analyzing the variation in ln(Price) across hospitals and
payers. The results of this exercise are qualitatively similar.

4        Results: Estimated Price Variation

This section documents large variation in negotiated prices across payers for the same service
in the same hospital. Some payers are systematically more expensive than others on average
across all hospitals, and there is meaningful variation accounted for by a hospital-payer
interaction. We also find price variation within a payer-hospital pair that depends on the
characteristics of the plan type (ASO or fully-insured).
         Table 1 displays the number of observations and average prices for each clinical cohort.
Panel A reports the standard deviation of hospital fixed-effects θ̂h , and Panel B reports the
standard deviation of payer fixed-effects θ̂p , each estimated from equation (2). Each row
corresponds to a clinical cohort or composite measure; in parentheses below each estimate,
we report the standard deviation as a percent of the unconditional average price reported in
Column (2).13
         Column (3) includes no controls; these estimates are the standard deviation of unad-
justed average price levels. Column (4) controls for patient characteristics and aggregate
time shocks; Column (5) then adds payer (Panel A) or hospital (Panel B) fixed effects. We
find that prices vary across payers nearly as much as they do across hospitals. In the most
controlled specification, the standard deviation of payer fixed-effects ranges from 16 to 28
percent of the mean price for the five clinical cohorts. For hospital fixed-effects, this ranges
from 17 to 31 percent. These estimates are fairly similar across the three columns, indicating
that variation in payer price levels is not driven by the composition of hospitals its enrollees
visit, though somewhat smaller when aggregating across a broader sample of admissions.14
         Figure 1 shows, for each hospital-payer pair, the relationship among our price index
measures: prices for narrowly-defined procedures, the composite price index of these pro-
    13
      As noted by Sacarny (2018), these estimates may exhibit dispersion that is due to measurement error
rather than “true" differences in levels. To limit the potential for dispersion to be driven by such noise,
we limit to hospital-payer-cohort pairs of at least 10 cases. Our results are qualitatively similar for the
unrestricted samples.
   14
      In unreported results, we estimate alternative variance decompositions (Abowd, Kramarz, and Margolis
(1999)), which confirm that there is important price variation across both payers and hospitals.



                                                    9
cedures, and the price index measured on all inpatient admissions. There is a positive
correlation across all measures. Consistent with prior work by Cooper et al. (forthcom-
ing), these correlations are much weaker across service lines (e.g., cesarean sections and hip
replacements) than within service lines (e.g., knee replacements and hip replacements).
     Table 2 shows the estimates of equation (1) for two different samples: the composite
sample (capturing all five narrowly-defined services) and the sample of all inpatient admis-
sions. We first benchmark the between-provider variation in prices by running regressions
in Columns (1) and (4) that control for an indicator for whether a hospital is owned by
Partners (but omit Zi , θh , and θp ). Consistent with both the academic literature (Ho, 2009)
and policy reports (Coakley, 2010), Partners commands high prices relative to other hospi-
tals in Massachusetts. Transforming our coefficients into percentage changes, Column (1),
shows that Partners’ prices are on average 27.3 percent (= e0.241 − 1) higher than those for
other hospitals in the data. Columns (2) and (5) add hospital fixed effects θh and insurance
plan characteristics Zi . Consistent with previous literature exploring the impact of managed
care on negotiated prices, we find that HMOs, which typically steer consumers to specific
providers, pay prices that are lower relative to PPO plans. Columns (3) and (6) add payer
fixed effects, showing that these differences are not the result of compositional differences in
plan types across payers. In Column (3), we estimate that HMO plans pay prices that are
nearly 5.4 percent lower than PPOs, even when controlling for payer and hospital.
     We also find substantial differences in price levels across self-insured ASO contracts and
fully-insured products. Columns (3) and (6) show that ASO prices are 2.3 to 4.0 percent
higher (depending on specification) than those of fully-insured plans. Table 3 presents spec-
ifications that include hospital-by-payer fixed effects. On aggregate, we find that ASO plans
pay prices that are 2.1 to 4.3 percent higher than their fully insured counterparts, even within
the same hospital-payer pair. The magnitude of this effect is substantial: approximately half
as large as the savings associated with HMO plans.
     While we observe multiple prices for different plans at the same hospital-payer, prices


                                              10
are often negotiated at the product level rather than by funding type. For example, the
higher priced BCBS contract in Panel (c) of Figure 2 is 100% PPO and roughly 75% ASO.
The lower priced BCBS contract is roughly 86% HMO (14% other non-PPO) and only 40%
ASO. However, in multiple cases, we observe two distinct prices within a hospital-payer pair
for MRIs in which one price applies only to ASO plans and the other applies only to fully
insured plans, suggesting that funding forms the basis for distinct negotiations in at least
some bargaining settings. For example, in Panel (c) of Figure 2, Harvard Pilgrim contracts
are segmented by funding type. The higher priced contract is 100% ASO, while the lower
priced contract is 93% fully insured and 7% “other.” As we document in Appendix Table
A.6, ASO plans tend to be PPO plans. PPO prices are therefore more likely to reflect ASO
incentives than other plan types. Indeed, when ASOs are a higher share of PPO enrollment,
the difference between the “HMO” and “PPO” price is larger. We examine this issue at length
in Appendix A.2, and show that the results in Table 3 provide a likely underestimate of pure
ASO incentive differences.
       Finally, we turn our attention to the average price difference across payers. Columns
(3) and (6) of Table 2 show that there is substantial variation across payers: in Column
(3), prices negotiated by Harvard Pilgrim are an average of 6.5 percent lower than prices
negotiated by BCBS (the omitted category); Tufts’ prices are 13.2 percent lower. The
pattern in the data is somewhat surprising given BCBS’s larger market share; one natural
explanation would be that BCBS does less to steer its consumers. While this may be the
case, these gaps in negotiated prices persist even when we control for plan types. Also note
that the three national payers have the lowest prices, despite having relatively small market
share.15
       Variation across payers exists in each clinical cohort as well as in our broad inpatient
sample. In Appendix Table A.3, we estimate analogous specifications separately procedure-
  15
      In Table 2 we have aggregated the national payers into a single group. When estimated separately,
coefficients for Aetna, Cigna, and United in Column 3 are -0.060, -0.315, and -0.210, respectively. Cigna and
United’s coefficients are not significantly different from each other.

by-procedure. Consistent with the low correlations across procedures observed in Figure 1,
these specifications show that the price index hides some interesting patterns across proce-
dures. For instance, while Tufts negotiates rates 13.2 percent lower than BCBS on average
across all five services, Tufts is much “cheaper” for hip and knee replacements (about 36 per-
cent), and actually slightly more “expensive” for MRIs. The ASO effect is broadly consistent
across procedures.
       Variation in negotiated price levels across hospital-payer pairs is shown in Figure 2:
BCBS does not negotiate systematically higher or lower prices across all providers or proce-
dures. Furthermore, while there is substantial variation across hospitals and payers, variation
across bargaining dyads is also important. Consistent with the fact that the price ordering
of hospitals in one payer is quite different than others, a joint F-test reveals that adding
hospital-payer interactions to regressions of the form estimated in Table 2 always adds sta-
tistically significant explanatory power.16
       What explains these differences between payers? Observable characteristics of enrollees
are relatively balanced across payers (see Appendix Table A.2). Consumers have preferences
over networks and insurers may have different network strategies, potentially leading to
different negotiated prices; BCBS’s network is relatively broad (Ericson and Starc 2015b),
which could be a factor in BCBS’s relatively high negotiated prices.17 Moreover, brand
reputation could operate as a shift in demand for a given price, leading to higher negotiated
prices. Finally, search costs may lead to price variation (see Cebul et al. 2011).
  16
      For hip replacements, we estimate a joint F-test of F (45, 118) = 63, 852, p < 0.001. This same test is
significant at p < 0.001 for all of our clinical cohorts.
   17
      BCBS is also unique in this time period for introducing a value-based payment contract (the Alternative
Quality Contract, ACQ), in which providers bear some risk. Higher payments from BCBS could partially
be compensation for bearing risk, note that BCBS did not see a big cost increase when they introduced the
ACQ and the effect of the ACQ on spending is relatively small compared to our results (Song et al. 2011).

5     Implications

5.1     Price Variation and Consumer Value of Insurance

The financial value of a health insurance plan to an individual is often modeled as comprising
two parameters: premiums p and a cost-sharing function that translates medical expenses
into OOP costs for the consumer.18 However, the prices a plan has negotiated with providers
also affect its value, as the prices determine the amount of medical expenses incurred for using
a particular service—and, therefore, the cost-sharing that the individual faces. Let z be the
plan’s negotiated provider price level that scales up or down a claim L.19 For normalization,
let z = 1 be the average negotiated price level, so that an insurer with z = 1.5 has negotiated
provider prices that are 50% higher than average.
      For simplicity, we model cost-sharing as a constant coinsurance rate α ∈ [0, 1]: if an
individual has claims L, the insurer will pay αL. Because α characterizes the fraction of
claims the plan covers, we refer to α as the plan’s actuarial value.20
      We can then write an insurance contract as X = (p, α, z). Consider an individual with
a risk-averse utility function who faces probability π of needing a procedure that would cost
L at average prices. Their expected utility is given by


                       EU (X) = πU (w − p − (1 − α)zL) + (1 − π)U (w − p)

for some level of wealth w.21 First, note that the value of an insurance plan to an individual
   18
      Insurance plans vary on other dimensions besides financial value, including provider networks and brand
reputations. Recent work has attempted to estimate how sensitive consumers are to premiums when plans
are differentiated on these dimensions, holding constant the cost-sharing function (Ericson and Starc 2015,
Starc 2014).
   19
      A single price level is a simplification, as a payer could be cheaper than average at one hospital and
more expensive than average at another. Our empirical results show that payers differ between each other
on average, but also that there is substantial idiosyncratic hospital-payer variation.
   20
      In non-linear contracts (e.g., deductible and max OOP), effective actuarial value will vary with negoti-
ated prices. Here, we think of actuarial value α as being defined for some fixed reference level of negotiated
prices, so that a change in z will not affect α.
   21
      More generally, an individual will face a distribution F of loss sizes L ≥ 0. We assume that provider
price level does not affect underlying medical care usage (no moral hazard).



                                                     13
                                                                 ∂EU
is weakly decreasing in its negotiated provider price level z:    ∂z
                                                                       ≤ 0. Moreover, the effect of
z on individual utility depends on the degree of cost-sharing in the plan. Under full insurance
(α = 1), the individual is not affected by z; as actuarial value drops, the individual begins
to be more affected by the provider price level.


5.2    Quantifying Price Variation in a High Deductible Plan

To quantify the impact of provider price variation on the effective financial generosity of
an insurance plan, we select a sample of health care claims for a sample of working-age
adults from Truven MarketScan (details in Appendix). We apply a high-deductible insurance
plan to these claims (deductible=$5,000, coinsurance=30%, maximum OOP=$6,350). We
then simulate the OOP spending amounts under a range of price multipliers that enable
us to examine what OOP spending would be if prices were, for example, twice as high or
half as large. The average OOP spending in the data at observed prices is $1,900. In
Appendix Figure A.1, we plot the average OOP spending and actuarial value for this plan
from multipliers ranging from 0.5 to 2. The average OOP spending in the plan ranges from
$1,267 at prices 50% of observed, to $2,641 at prices that were 200% of observed.
      Across all our sampled services and providers, higher-cost payers were about 15% more
expensive than lower-cost payers. A 15% discount relative to observed prices is an average
OOP savings of $182. Individuals likely have more information about which types of services
or providers they will use (i.e., a young person might expect to have a birth at a nearby
hospital, while an older person might expect to be more likely to have a hip replacement at a
different hospital near them). We estimated price variation between insurers of about 50% for
more specific services—such as Tufts versus BCBS for births, or the national carriers versus
BCBS for MRIs. A 50% discount relative to observed prices is an average OOP savings of
$633. While we have focused on expected OOP spending, note that risk aversion will increase
the disutility from spending that comes from cost-sharing as opposed from premiums.

5.3     Insurer Incentives: Fully Insured and ASO Markets

Contractual form will affect the incentives that payers have to negotiate prices, and so a
payer’s optimal price will typically differ between the fully-insured market and the ASO
market. We lay out a brief model that identifies these incentives. We allow payers to
negotiate separate provider prices zIN S and zASO for the two markets they operate in: the
fully-insured market (INS) (e.g., health insurance exchanges, the individual market, the small
group market) and the ASO market. However, in practice, there may be reputation, legal,
and contractual barriers linking the prices in the two markets; in this case, the observed
price in product for a given payer may reflect a combination of these two prices.
       Consumer demand in the fully-insured market is given by the function DIN S (p, zIN S , α, X),
where X is the vector of other products in the market, where demand is weakly decreasing
in p and zIN S , and is weakly increasing in α. While the model in Section 5.1 shows that the
level of zIN S affects consumer welfare, the way in which zIN S affects demand is a complex
interaction between this model and a model of consumer search.
       Negotiated provider price levels also affect the value of ASO contracts. ASO contracts
typically consist of a fee paid to the payer in exchange for claims processing and access to
the payer’s negotiated provider rates. We represent an ASO contract as Y = (τ, z), where z
is the payer’s negotiated provider rates, and the fixed fee is τ . Thus, if spending per enrollee
at average prices (z = 1) is $M , then total cost per enrollee to the self-insured employer is
zM + τ . Other contractual forms—including those in which the employer pays a percentage
of overall claims as a fee —will exacerbate the issues we highlight in this section. When
the employer chooses an ASO provider, both τ and z are both important determinants of
costs. In theory, employers could trade off τ against z to make decisions only on total cost;
however, employers are unlikely to observe z as well as they observe τ , and may not value
reductions in z fully.22 Let ASO demand is given by DASO (τ, zASO , α, X), with demand
  22
    It is likely that z is harder to observe because there are many different prices in the market at the
payer-provider level and no publicly available source of information on them.




                                                   15
weakly decreasing in τ and zASO .
        Payers can exert costly effort eIN S and eASO to reduce negotiated prices (see e.g. Gren-
nan 2014). The cost of effort for each price is given separately by a convex function c, with
                                             dzi
c(0) = 0, c0 > 0, c00 > 0. We assume         dei
                                                   = −1 for each contract type i, which is without loss
of generality because the cost of effort function c can be re-scaled.23 We let the expected
amount of medical care per enrollee be M at z = 1 prices,24 and assume that there are no per
beneficiary costs other than medical care consumed. We assume payers choose negotiation
effort, premiums p, and administrative fees τ to maximize total profits,25 which can then be
written as:


                      ΠIN S = (p − αzIN S M ) DIN S (p, zIN S , α, X) − c (eIN S )

                     ΠASO = τ DASO (τ, zASO , α, X) − c (eASO ) .


                                                                  ∂DIN S            ∂DASO

investigate   ∂p
                   (the response of demand to premiums),26 we are unaware of any papers that

                                                                                    and     ∂zASO

next result shows that if the demand response to negotiated prices is small enough, the payer
will optimally set ASO prices higher:

                                                                                                          ∂DIN S
Result 1 For small enough response of insurance demand to negotiated prices (e.g.                         ∂zIN S

         = 0), zASO > zIN S .27
        In the fully-insured market, the payer benefits from negotiating a lower price level
   23
      It is possible that there is a different cost of effort function for zIN S and zASO . For our Result 1 below,
we need only assume that if eIN S = eASO = 0, then zIN S = zASO .
   24
      For simplicity, we abstract away from asymmetric information.
   25
      We do not treat actuarial value as a choice variable; for instance, it is determined by regulation on the
ACA’s health insurance exchanges.

because it pays the insured claims; at α = 1, the payer is the residual claimant on negotiation
effort. In the ASO market, lower negotiated prices only benefit the payer through increased

                                                           = 0, then ASO prices will be higher.
However, we do not know whether and how the individual and ASO markets differ in their
response to negotiated prices. Employers shopping for ASO services may (or may not) be
better informed and responsive than individuals shopping for fully-insured products. As
a result, it is ambiguous whether zIN S or zASO is higher. Moreover, outside our model,
regulation differs between the ASO and fully-insured markets (for instance, medical loss
ratios do not apply to ASO markets), and this may affect negotiated prices. Finally, payers
may face constraints making it difficult for zIN S to diverge substantially from zASO , such as
threat of bad publicity or regulation. Nonetheless, the observed differences in ASO prices is
consistent with this prediction.



6    Conclusion

There is substantial variation in prices paid by different payers to the same hospitals for the
same service. This variation affects the value of insurance products, implying substantial
welfare effects for consumers. Insurer incentives are critical to understanding the variation
in our data: prices paid are higher for ASO contracts holding fixed both payer and provider.
Insurer size does not necessarily predict negotiated rates in our setting; however, we show
that the ability to “steer" consumer demand (as proxied for by HMO contracts) is important,
consistent with previous studies (Cutler, Kessler, and McClellan 2000).
     Provider prices are hard to observe: the level of negotiated provider prices could be
an important dimension of price transparency efforts. Consumer response (among individ-
uals and large employers) to negotiated provider prices is a crucial determinant of insurers’
negotiation effort. Yet we know little about this parameter; additional measurement of
across payer price variation and consumer preferences over negotiated prices is an important

Notes: Each cell contains the standard deviation across hospital fixed effects (Panel A) or payer fixed effects (Panel
B), conditional on each sets of controls. Fixed effects are estimated as in equation (2). The standard deviation as a
percent of the unconditional average price is reported in parentheses. The dependent variable in each regression is the
raw individual-level transaction price. Patient controls include patient age, sex, and insurance plan type. In the all
inpatient and composite samples, each regression also contains fixed effects for primary diagnosis and clinical cohorts
and are weighted by the overall spending share of each procedure or cohort represents. Regressions underlying estimates
for Columns (4) and (5) include a monthly fixed-effect. Data are limited to hospital-payer-cohort triads with at least
10 cases.

     Notes: ∗ (p<0.05), ∗∗ (p<0.01), ∗∗∗ (p<0.001). Standard errors clustered at the hospital-insurer pair in parentheses. The dependent variable is the log of
     individual-level transaction price. Insurer coefficients are estimated relative to BCBS. The omitted category for funding type is fully insured. The omitted
     category for product type is PPO. All regressions contain controls for patient patient sex and five-year age band as well as monthly fixed-effects. We also
     estimate price-level coefficients for all other payers in the data, which include: Fallon, Health New England, Boston Medical Center HealthNet, Celticare,
     ConnectiCare, Health Plans Inc., Neighborhood Health Plan, NetworkHealth, and Wellpoint. However, we omit these estimates here for the sake of simplicity.

A.1        Measuring Hospital-Payer Prices

Sample Construction

We construct seven distinct samples for the purpose of analyzing price. First, in order to
ensure that we are capturing variation in price, rather than differences patient complexity,
we construct 5 narrowly defined clinical cohorts. We analyze prices for four commonly
provided inpatient procedures—hip replacement, knee replacement, cesarean section, and
vaginal delivery—and outpatient lower limb MRIs. In defining our clinical cohorts, we follow
closely the approach used in Cooper et al. (2015), with the exception that our data do not
contain reliable DRG codes. We therefore identify hip and knee replacements (ICD 8151
and 8154), vaginal and cesarean deliveries (ICD9 7359 and 741), and lower limb MRI (CPT
code 73721) using their respective clinical codes.

Second, we construct two samples, which attempt to measure the average basket of treat-
ments an insurer might negotiate over. In one sample create a composite containing all
of the cases in each of the five narrowly defined cohorts. While this sample most credibly
controls for patient heterogeneity, one might also be concerned that this does not accurately
represent the complete bundle of services over which hospitals and payers negotiate. In order
to address this concern, we also construct a sample of all inpatient admissions in the data. In
our main analyses, we control for differences in treatment intensity by including a fixed-effect
for cohort in the composite sample and primary diagnosis in the overall inpatient sample.

For all of our samples, we limit to patients age 18-64. We exclude all cases where either the
patient lived- or the facility was located outside of MA, and limit to facilities which match
to the American Hospital Association (AHA) Annual Survey data. We exclude cases where
prices are negative, and where prices are above or below the top or bottom percentile of the
price distribution. We also exclude inpatient cases where the patient had multiple discharge
dates or was admitted to multiple hospitals in order to avoid pricing idiosyncrasies that may
be associated with transfers.

We also perform additional sample-specific restrictions to isolate a homogeneous set of treat-
ments. For hip and knee replacements, we include only patients age 40-64 and we exclude all
admissions where a crushing injury or tumor was recorded in any of the diagnosis fields. For
vaginal deliveries and cesarean sections, we focus on cases where the patient was between 18
and 40 years old, and drop all cases that would be disqualified from inclusion in a hospital’s
cesarean section rate.28 For lower limb MRIs, we focus only on outpatient cases where the
MRI was the only procedure recorded for the patient at any facility that day. We also restrict
to cases where there was a separate professional claim for the reading of the MRI in order to

avoid any potential bundling of services that may confound our estimation of the hospital’s
negotiated price.


Price Measurement

For most of our analysis, we use the raw patient-level transaction price. However, in some
figures, we present a risk-adjusted measure of the average price for a hospital-patient pair.
To do this, we follow Cooper et al. (2018) and estimate prices as:

                              priceihpt = πXi + γhp + δt + εihpt

where Xi denotes the characteristics (age and sex) of individual i as well as a fixed effect for
the clinical cohort to which it belongs, γhp are fixed effects for hospital-payer dyad hp, and
δt are fixed effects for each month-year in the sample t. We then generate a price index of
the form
                                  pIN
                                   hp
                                      DEX
                                           = γ̂hp + π̂ X̄ + δ̂t t̄
where the main estimates of interest are γ̂hp , which are the estimated hospital-payer fixed
effects. The other terms scale the level of these fixed effects relative to the average mix
of patients characteristics and the distribution of patients over time. π̂ X̄ is the a vector
containing the average contribution of each individual characteristic (π̂) multiplied by the
state-wide average prevalence of that characteristic. (X̄). δ̂t t̄ adds in the average contribu-
tion of over-time variation in prices by multiplying the aggregate price shock of time t (δ̂t )
multiplied by the state-wide share of patients in each month-year t (t̄).


A.2     Error in Estimating ASO Price Incentives

The purpose of this appendix is to argue that our estimation of ASO price incentives in
Section 4 provides a potential under-estimate of the magnitudes of such effects. Several
empirical facts motivate our approach


 (a) ASO and PPO plans are correlated in the data (see Table A.6)

 (b) While we observe multiple distinct contracts at a given hospital-insurer pair, these are
     often negotiated at the product level, rather than by funding source directly. While
     we observe contract segmentation imperfectly, this observation is informed by conver-
     sations with industry participants. We also attempt to document the nature of this
     segmentation in our discussion of Figure 2, Panel (c) in Section 4 of the text.


Given these observations, we assume the following data generating process. First, each
observed contracted price is the aggregation of price incentives for the patients who choose



                                              A.2
that plan-hospital combination:
                                                      P
                                                        i∈f jhp   pijhp
                                         pi|f jhp =
                                                            Njhp

where each individuals’ negotiation incentives are given by

                                            pif jhp = θhp + Zif j

where Zi is a vector of indicators for funding (f ) and product type (j). The intuition behind
this formulation is that both ASO and PPO provide price shocks that are driven by patient
steering and financial incentives of payers, and that the negotiated price is in fact the average
contribution of characteristics across the relevant patients.

We then carry out the following simulation exercise.


   1. We use the vector of hospital-payer fixed effects as estimated in Column (6) of Table 3.29
      The actual values of these “base” prices is irrelevant since we will assume for the purpose
      of this exercise that they are orthogonal to the product and funding characteristics.

   2. We assign 1,000 patients to each hospital-payer pair, over which we draw a distribution
      of HMO/ASO according to the following process.

                                              HM Oi = 1{i > 0}

                                               ASOi = 1{ηi > 0}
       and                                                        
                                                            1   −0.8
                                      [, η] ∼ N [0, 0],
                                                           −0.8  1

   3. We assume an individual’s price contribution

                           ln(P riceif jhp ) = log(θhp ) − 0.05HM Oi + 0.03ASOi

       That is, HM Oi provides 5% of downward pricing pressure and ASOi softens the payers’
       negotiating incentives by 3%.

   4. We further aggregate these price contributions by product-contract j (defined as HMO
      vs. PPO) such that the observed price
                                       P
                                        i∈jhp (log(θhp ) − 0.05HM Oi + 0.03ASOi )
                  ln(P riceif |jhp ) =
                                                            Njhp
  29
     We use MRI prices for this exercise because it is easier to observe the stable contract, as in Panel (c)
of Figure 2. Because we have defined MRIs as narrowly as single CPT-code, each observation will have the
same chargemaster (list) price. Our observed prices will therefore not reflect any heterogeneity in price that
would result from a price that is set as a share of charges.



                                                      A.3
  5. We estimate OLS price effects

                     ln(P riceif |jhp ) = θhp + βHM O HM Oi + βASO ASOi + εijhp


Column (1) of Table A.7 presents the results of this exercise, which results in an overestimate
of HMO price effects (−0.068) and an underestimate of ASO incentive effects (< 0.001).
The intuition behind this problem is that averaging price at the contract (HMO) level,
introduces a kind of non-classical measurement error by which within hospital-payer ASO
price incentives are not associated with additional price variation. However, the correlation
between ASO and HMO means that the contribution of ASO price incentives are “well
explained” by the HMO indicator.

To solve this problem, we can regress price onto the ASO share by contract

                  ln(P riceif |jhp ) = θhp + βHM O HM Oi + βASO ASOj + εijhp

where                                        P
                                                 i∈jhp   ASOi
                                    ASOj =
                                                    Njhp
The results of this regression are reported in Column (2) of Table A.7, which yields the correct
parameter values. Here, product-type still defines the contract, however identification of ASO
effects is driven by relative differentials in HMO/PPO prices for contracts with more or less
ASO penetration. With a clean identification of contracts (as in Panel (c) of Figure 2), this
method is easily extendable to a setting in which one does not know the precise rationale
for segmentation of plans into contracts. To do this, we can simply calculate average HMO
and ASO (and “other”) shares by identified contract. In our simulation, this is identical to
the method in Column (2) of Table A.7 because, in that exercise, we have assumed HMO is
either 0% or 100% throughout the contract. We apply this method to the MRI data, where
it is easy to identify stable contracts that typically differ based on product type. When we
apply this correction, the ASO effect as originally reported in Table A.3 moves from 2.2% to
14.9% and the HMO effect falls from -2.1% to 2.5% (though it becomes insignificant). We
therefore conclude that the estimates reported in Table A.3 likely provide an underestimate
of the ASO effect.


A.3     Implications: The Value of an Insurance Plan

To assess how price variation translates into expected out of pocket costs, we use data from
Truven MarketScan for 2010, and select a population of working age adults aged 24-64
(inclusive). Truven MarketScan is used by HHS to calibrate the ACA Marketplace risk ad-
justment, and provides similar distributions as the MEPS. We limit to those with 12 months
of continuous enrollment, and take a 1 percent sample of those enrollees for computational
ease. We drop a small number of people for whom at some point there was a service date
with a negative net payment, giving us 216,983 individuals. We then sum up their inpatient

                                              A.4
and outpatient claims for the year.30

We do not examine prescription drug claims in this analysis, as our work has not assessed
price variation in prescription drug claims.31 Moreover, the impact of prescription drug
prices to consumers is complex: for instance, many plans use tiered copays, rather than
coinsurance. Our results should be interpreted as roughly characterizing an insurance plan
with a separate medical and drug deductible.

The impact of negotiated prices on consumers will depend on the insurance plan design
(as well as on the distribution of underlying health care claims). We examine the effect of
negotiated prices using a high-deductible health plan: a plan with a deductible of $5,000, a
coinsurance rate of 30%, and a maximum out-of-pocket (maxOOP) limit of $6,350. This is
similar to a bronze plan on the ACA Marketplaces. The observed spending in Marketscan
comes from a mix of insurers and providers, and we cannot distinguish among them. To
simulate the effect of price variation, we multiply all the observed spending by a multi-
plier—that is, a multiplier of 0.5 to simulate what would happen if prices were 50% of the
observed prices. We take the observed and the multiplied spending levels and translate them
into 1) out-of-pocket (OOP) spending and 2) actuarial value for this population.

Before applying any price multiplier, the average OOP spending in this data is $1,900, and
the average actuarial value of this plan is about 44%. If this data underestimates the right tail
of the claims distribution—i.e. underestimates very high spenders—then the actuarial value
will be understated, since the plan covers 100% of claims beyond the maxOOP. Figure A.1
plots the average OOP spending and actuarial value for this plan from multipliers ranging
from 0.5 to 2. The average OOP spending in the plan ranges from $1,267 at prices 50% of
observed to $2,641 at prices that were 200% of observed. This is equivalent of moving a tier
in actuarial value: AV for the 50% prices is 0.59 while for the 200% prices is only 0.31

                                            ∂DIN S       ∂DASO
Proof: To see that zASO > zIN S when        ∂zIN S
                                                     =   ∂zASO
                                                                 = 0 , consider the first order conditions
for choice of negotiation effort:
  30
       We use the same approach as in Ericson and Sydnor (2017). Note that we do not use the Massachusetts
APCD here. Our analysis of the enrollment files suggested that the APCD had an unreliable measure of the
fraction of enrollees with zero claims. Unreliable number of zero claim enrollees poses a challenge to using
the APCD to measure the population distribution of claims (for which zero claims are important). However,
it is not a problem for our measure of prices (since they are conditional on a transaction occurring), or for
other work looking at demand conditional on using services
    31
       For more on price variation in prescription drug spending, see Starc and Swanson (2017).




                                                     A.5
                          c0 (eIN S ) = αM DIN S and c0 (eASO ) = 0.

Hence, eIN S > eASO = 0. Note that we have assumed that if eIN S = eASO = 0, then
zIN S = zASO , so given that zIN S decreases in eIN S , we have zASO > zIN S .

Note that the payer has an incentive to set positive negotiation effort for the fully insured
market, since it pays for the insured portion of medical spending. However, the payer does
not have incentive to put forth negotiation effort in the ASO market, since it does not pay
these prices. The payer only cares about the level of zASO insofar is it affects the level
demand, but we have ∂D   ASO
                       ∂zASO
                              = 0 by assumption.

Notes: This table presents each payers mean (first-row) and standard-deviation (second-row) for each characteristic,
estimated over the sample of inpatient admissions in the Boston HRR for 2009-2011. Stars indicate significance
levels from a t-test against the overall mean: ∗ (p<0.10), ∗∗ (p<0.05), ∗∗∗ (p<0.01), and standard errors are
clustered at the hospital-payer pair. County level median income data come from the Census Bureau’s Small Area
Income and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE). Distances are measured from the centroid of each patient’s zip code to
the hospital’s longitude and latitute using a geodetic distance measure. “National Payers” represents the combined
average of UnitedHealth Group, Aetna, and Cigna. “Other” contains all other insurers in the data: Fallon, Health
New England, Boston Medical Center HealthNet, Celticare, ConnectiCare, Health Plans Inc., Neighborhood Health
Plan, NetworkHealth, and Wellpoint.

       Notes: ∗ (p<0.05), ∗∗ (p<0.01), ∗∗∗ (p<0.001). Standard errors clustered at the hospital-payer pair in parentheses. The dependent variable is the log of
       individual-level transaction price. Insurer coefficients are estimated relative to BCBS. The omitted category for funding type is fully insured. The omitted
       category for product type is PPO. All regressions contain controls for patient patient sex and five-year age band as well as monthly fixed-effects. We also estimate
       price-level coefficients for all other payers in the data, which include: Fallon, Health New England, Boston Medical Center HealthNet, Celticare, ConnectiCare,
       Health Plans Inc., Neighborhood Health Plan, NetworkHealth, and Wellpoint. However, we omit these estimates here for the sake of simplicity. “Spending Share”
       weights weight each observation by the fraction of spending (across payers) each clinical cohort or diagnosis code represents. “Average Basket” weights balance
       the observation shares by clinical cohort across payers using inverse propensity scores; these weights are then multiplied by the “Spending Share” weights.

Notes: This table presents each payers mean (first-row) and standard-deviation (second-row) for each characteristic,
estimated over the sample of inpatient admissions in the Boston HRR for 2009-2011. Stars indicate significance levels
from a t-test against the overall mean: ∗ (p<0.10), ∗∗ (p<0.05), ∗∗∗ (p<0.01), and standard errors are clustered at
the hospital-payer pair. County level median income data come from the Census Bureau’s Small Area Income and
Poverty Estimates (SAIPE). Distances are measured from the centroid of each patient’s zip code to the hospital’s
longitude and latitute using a geodetic distance measure. Shares of product characteristics do not always sum to 1
because of rounding.
