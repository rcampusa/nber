Can efforts to promote education deter child labor? We report on the findings of a field experiment
where a conditional transfer incentivized the schooling of children associated with carpet factories
in Nepal. We find that schooling increases and child involvement in carpet weaving decreases when
schooling is incentivized. As a simple static labor supply model would predict, we observe that treated
children resort to their counterfactual level of school attendance and carpet weaving when schooling
is no longer incentivized. From a child labor policy perspective, our findings imply that “You get what
you pay for” when schooling incentives are used to combat hazardous child labor.

          Can efforts to promote education deter child labor? We report on the findings of a field experiment

      where a conditional transfer incentivized the schooling of children associated with carpet factories in

      Nepal. We find that schooling increases and child involvement in carpet weaving decreases when schooling

      is incentivized. As a simple static labor supply model would predict, we observe that treated children

      resort to their counterfactual level of school attendance and carpet weaving when schooling is no longer

      incentivized. From a child labor policy perspective, our findings imply that “You get what you pay for”

      when schooling incentives are used to combat hazardous child labor.

An estimated 306 million children 5-17 were economically active in the world in 2008. 115 million were

working in activities considered hazardous in their country of residence by virtue of the activity’s nature

or circumstance (International Labour Organization 2010). This study considers whether involvement in a

hazardous form of child labor can be influenced by schooling incentives. This is an important policy question

as combating child labor through education promotion has been the centerpiece of global anti child labor

policy since 2001.1 The relationship between schooling incentives and child labor is of academic interest as

   1 The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) is the largest funder of anti-child labor programs around the world. The office in

the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) charged with child labor abroad alone has appropriated $800 million to 258 projects

well with implications for the theoretical and empirical literature on the determinants of child labor supply

and the literature on how opportunity costs influence schooling decisions.

   We have an abundance of evidence that schooling incentives such as conditional cash transfers can promote

school attendance, but there are important unanswered questions related to child labor. Conditional transfers

can reduce common forms of child work (Barrera-Osorio et al. 2011, Behrman et al. 2011, Maluccio & Flores

2005, Schady & Araujo 2006). However, the magnitudes of the decline in work do not correspond to the

increase in schooling (Attanasio et al. 2010, Dammert 2009, Duryea & Morrison 2004, Galiani & McEwan

2011). This has lead some to question whether there is a trade-off between common forms of work and

schooling (e.g. Ravallion & Wodon (2000)), a question that is difficult to test directly given the joint

nature of school and work decisions. It is also not obvious whether these results extrapolate to populations

vulnerable to the hazardous forms of child labor that are the focus of policy.

   The recent academic literature on child labor supply rarely finds evidence that child labor supply is

responsive to its return relative to schooling. First, the theoretical literature on child labor supply emphasizes

the primacy of living standards in influencing time allocation. For example, the canonical child labor model

of Basu & Van (1998) is built on the luxury axiom which posits that children work when their family

cannot meet its basic needs otherwise, regardless of how large or small the return to child labor is. Baland

& Robinson (2000) and Ranjan (2001) highlight that constraints on liquidity drive child labor even when

relative prices suggest that alternatives are preferred uses of child time. Second, the empirical evidence on the

determinants of child labor emphasizes the responsiveness of child labor to changes in family living standards

beyond any other factor. An extreme example is Edmonds & Schady (2012) where a $15 per month transfer

in Ecuador induces households to forego $80 a month in child labor earnings. Other studies emphasize the

importance of child labor in coping with transitory shocks when returns to child labor are presumably lower

(Beegle et al. 2006, Duryea et al. 2007, Jacoby & Skoufias 1997). In contrast, there is little evidence of a

response of child labor supply to its net return. Even studies of large economic restructuring where there

should be substantive changes in the employment opportunities open to children typically only find effects on

child labor through family living standards (Cogneau & Jedwab 2012, Dammert 2008, Edmonds & Pavcnik

2005, Edmonds et al. 2010).

   Hazardous child labor may also be fundamentally different from more common forms of work. First,

selection into hazardous child labor may be such that only the most desperate select into it, implying that

their labor supply may be especially inelastic to changes in net returns (Dessy & Pallage 2005). Second,
in 91 countries since the office’s creation in 1995. The influence of DOL far exceeds these appropriations as often DOL is a
contributing partner in larger projects or the experience of DOL informs the design of other, non-DOL projects. In 2001, DOL
launched the Child Labor Education Initiative (EI) that placed the promotion of education at the center of project tools to
combat hazardous child labor.




                                                             2
it is not obvious that schooling is the counterfactual use of time of children in hazardous child labor. It

could be that non-hazardous employment is the counterfactual use of child time to hazardous employment.

Hence, hazardous employment would not be elastic to schooling returns in the same was as non-hazardous

employment where schooling is the counterfactual use of time. Third, agency issues may mitigate the

responsiveness of hazardous child labor to changes in the local economic environment (Rogers & Swinnerton

2008). In usual labor supply models, labor is free to adjust in response to changes in relative prices. Children

in general have limited agency to adjust their own labor supply. In our context, two-thirds of subjects are

migrants. Their agency could be limited if the agent making decisions over child labor (head of the family)

may be at their origin and thus removed from the circumstances of employment such that child employment

may not change in response to changes in circumstances.

   We consider this question of the link between schooling incentives and child labor through a schooling

promotion project for children associated with workers in the handmade export-oriented carpet sector of the

Kathmandu Valley of Nepal. A lottery was used to allocate 660 children to three groups:

  1. A control group whose schooling and time allocation would be monitored but would receive no education

     support.

  2. A scholarship group whose education related expenses would be paid directly or reimbursed up to a

     cap.

  3. A stipend group that received the scholarship treatment plus an additional stipend conditional on

     schooling attendance. The stipend was paid as a credit in a local shop that could be used towards

     food.

The treatments lasted one academic year. The design was motivated by our NGO partner’s desire to test

whether a conditional stipend would improve the impact of the existing scholarship program (the group 2

treatment) that they were administering to a separate population.

   We find that the response to these treatment concord with the predictions of a static labor supply model.

The scholarship treatment is associated with increase in school enrollment during the year of support and

an increase in attendance at the start of the year. Its effects fade out as funds are exhausted. The stipend

treatment has large effects on school attendance and achievement during the period of support. Associated

with the stipend’s effects on attendance, we document a decline in child involvement in carpet weaving, a

hazardous form of child labor. These effects of the stipend treatment dissipate when schooling is no longer

incentivized. After the end of the period of support, we find no evidence of an effect of either the stipend or

scholarship treatments on schooling or carpet weaving.


                                                       3
    These findings have important implications for child labor policy. This is the first field experiment

targeted at a population vulnerable to child labor (and was funded by the U.S. Department of Labor as a

pilot for using field experiments to improve child labor policy). Since 2001, the promotion of education has

been central in efforts to reduce hazardous child labor around the world. Despite the policy focus, we have

little direct evidence of a connection between child labor and the net return to education. Our findings reject

the hypothesis that net returns to schooling do not influence hazardous child labor and highlight the potential

for education support projects to deter hazardous child labor among beneficiaries through decreasing the

cost of schooling.

    That said, our findings also illustrate that transitory education support, as is required for USG funded

projects,2 may not affect schooling and child labor beyond the period of support. Current policy is based

on the premise that there are permanent effects of transitory support. First, there is the hope that the

impact of the support will endure. For example, if liquidity constrained families pull children out of school in

response to temporary shocks, but some cost of rejoining school prevents children from going to school after

the temporary shock has abated (as in De Janvry et al. 2006), the temporary support can have lasting effects

by buffering the temporary shock. Second, permanent-income theory suggests that the marginal propensity

to consume out of transitory income should be zero. Hence, the recipients should smooth the impact of

transitory support over time. In our study context, we do not find any impact of schooling support on

schooling and child labor even after a year past the completion of the program.

    Our findings also have important implications for the modeling of child time allocation. The first models

of human capital such as Schultz (1960) essentially adapt the static labor supply model to discuss the tradeoff

between employment opportunities and schooling. As discussed above, the simple static labor supply model

is rarely used in the child labor literature for the last two decades. Similarly, the recent literature on

educational decisions rarely use the framework Schultz and colleagues developed (for recent examples: Duflo

(2001), Jensen (2010), Bursztyn & Coffman (2012)), and as mentioned above, there is even a debate about

the extent to which work has a meaningful effect on schooling. Our findings on subject responses to the

two treatments follow the predictions of the static labor supply model where foregone earnings are an

important source of schooling costs. Our results then illustrate the usefulness of the static child labor supply

model for the analysis of schooling and child labor decisions (of course, not to the exclusion of other models).

Importantly, this study is not consistent with the view that hazardous forms of child labor are fundamentally

different or require a distinct modeling or policy approach.
   2 USG rules constrain projects to a maximum of 5 years. Our informal review of recent USG solicitations specifically targeted

at child labor suggests 3 years is common at the solicitation stage. A 3 year contract would translate into at most 2 years of
support for children as 3 years would include both start up and reporting time. The project examined below was solicited as 3
years, extended to 5, and provided 1 year of support to children identified as vulnerable to child labor.

1     Background

1.1     Study Population

Handmade carpets are Nepal’s leading export. Nepal exports high-quality hand-knotted carpets to the U.S.

and European markets. Child labor in carpet weaving might be the only way U.S. consumers interact with

products made with child labor in Nepal. Child labor in Nepali carpets became a major policy issue in

the mid 1990s because of working conditions in weaving as well as evidence of human trafficking and forced

labor. This study is part of a project funded by the U.S. Department of Labor aimed at understanding

child labor in the carpet sector of Nepal with the policy goal of eliminating it for children under 18.3 Under

the international convention governing regulation of worst forms of child labor (ILO C182), every country

is charged with making a list of hazardous child labor in the country for prohibition for children below 18.

Carpet weaving is on the Nepali government’s list of hazardous child labor in Nepal. There are an estimated

10,907 children employed in the hand-made export-oriented carpet sector of Nepal out of a total labor force

of 49,538 (ICF 2012).

    Our NGO partner in the study is the Nepali Goodweave Foundation (NGF), formerly known as Rug-

mark. NGF certifies individual carpets as child labor free and provides support services to children found

in establishments involved in the manufacture of certified carpets. NGF selected 101 establishments in the

Kathmandu Valley for this study. The 101 establishments were NGF licensees or subcontractors of NGF

licensees as of January 2010. 100 of these establishments engaged in weaving, with one establishment report-

ing finishing work and dyeing wool but no weaving. These 101 establishments had a total of 3,434 employees

as of January 2010 and had completed a total of 8,464 square meters of carpet in the last 30 days. For

this study, NGF selected 660 children 10-16 associated with carpet manufacturing establishments that (a)

had attended school within the last 18 months, (b) had not received education support from NGF or other

sponsors and (c) were in families who faced an elevated risk of transitioning to child labor. NGF views

children as having an elevated risk of transitioning to child labor if they met at least one of the following

three criteria:

    • Family size: A family with 3 or more school aged children in residence;

    • Family income: Total monthly family income (including monetary support from kin/relatives living

      elsewhere) of NPR 8,500 (USD 119) if housing was not provided free of charge by an establishment or

      of NPR 7,000 if housing was provided free of charge by the establishment;
    3 While the applicable international conventions imply that hazardous forms of child labor should be prohibited for children

under 18, Nepali law prohibits child involvement in carpet weaving for children under 16. Hence, children 16 and 17 are legally
allowed to weave in Nepal.



                                                               5
   • Sibling schooling: Families with 1 or fewer children attending school or families with a child who

      dropped out before completing grade 8.4

These criteria for identifying a child as vulnerable to child labor were chosen by NGF based on the field

experience of their inspectors in its sponsored education program (essentially the scholarship treatment).

Most subjects vulnerable to child labor are not engaged in child labor (less than 10 percent of subjects weave

at baseline). The income criteria were also based on the minimum wage set by the government of Nepal

and in effect in early 2010. The minimum wage is viewed by the government of Nepal as the minimum

income needed for subsistence. The minimum wage level per person was NPR 4,600 per month. Assuming

85 percent of children lived in households with an adult earner implied an income of NPR 8,500 per month.

The allowance of NPR 1,500 per month for rent when housing was provided free of charge by employers was

based on the NGF inspectors’ subjective opinion on the value of this free housing. The decision to limit

subjects to those recently enrolled in school was based on NGF’s opinion that children out of school for

longer would require transition education services and other types of support to re-enter school after a long

absence.

   NGF conducted preliminary interviews with workers in carpet establishments to collect data on the

children they have, their family income and other information necessary to determine eligibility of the

children. For the 660 children in this study, Table 1 contains counts of the number of subjects who met each

of the criteria listed above. All study subjects were 10-16, had attended school within the last 18 months,

and did not receive other education support. Subjects could match multiple criteria. Two-thirds of study

subjects met at least two criteria. Only 30 study subjects did not meet the low income criterion. Of these

30, 1 was in the study because of sibling dropouts, 3 were in the study because 1 or fewer siblings attend

school, and the remaining 27 met the family size criteria, having 3 or more eligible children in the family.

   Table 2 contains a comparison of the study population to children 10-16 in the country, in the Kathmandu

Valley and living in households below the national poverty line in the Nepal Living Standards Survey-

III (NLSS-III) of 2010/11. Our pool is more Buddhist and of Tamang and Magar ethnicity than other

populations within the country.5 Our study pool is also younger and more likely to be female than a random

sample of children in either of these populations. The mothers and fathers have lower educational attainment

compared to population in the Kathmandu valley (including poor households) and the national population.

Parental education and literacy is similar to or slightly better than that of the national population living in

poverty although not compared to poor households in Kathmandu. Fathers are less likely to be present in

  5 The  carpet exporting industry in Nepal was initially set up amongst Tibetan refugees in Kathmandu. The ethno-linguistic
similarity between Tibetan and Tamang and Magar ethnicities explain why these ethnicities and religion are predominant in
the carpet sector of Nepal.

our study population than other populations. To the extent that mothers and fathers respond differently to

schooling incentives, findings could differ in our sample compared to a sample where fathers are impacted

by schooling incentives. Schooling is more prevalent in our sample although completed education is lower.

Importantly, while slightly less than 10 percent of our sample is involved in weaving at baseline in our sample,

participation in this hazardous form of child labor is more prevalent than wage employment in general among

the poor in the Kathmandu Valley.


1.2    Program Description

The primary purpose of the Schooling Incentives Project Evaluation (SIPE) study was to evaluate the impact

of scholarship and stipend programs in encouraging school enrollment and attendance and reducing child

labor in the carpet sector in Nepal. SIPE was the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) impact evaluation

of a child labor and schooling intervention to be conducted in Nepal. Subjects were identified in February

2010 and received schooling support for the school year beginning in April 2010 and ending March 2011.

   NGF designed and implemented SIPE with technical support from the authors.6 NGF’s involvement in

the project was motivated by a desire to improve the efficacy of its efforts to prevent children working on

looms. The 660 study subjects were grouped into gender - age - establishment size cells, and randomization

was used to assign subjects in each cell to one of three groups:

   1. Group #1 is the control group. The children in group 1 received no schooling-related assistance.

   2. Group #2 is the scholarship group. The children in group 2 received a scholarship benefit. NGF

      reimbursed or paid each child’s schooling-related costs up to a maximum of (Nepali rupees) NPR

      3,950 per year. This assistance could include all schooling-related costs such as fees, tuition, uniforms,

      books and other supplies. Once the scholarship funds were exhausted, no additional support was

      available to subjects from NGF. This treatment arm was modeled after NGF’s Sponsored Education

      Program.7 Our calculations from the Nepal Living Standards Survey 2003/04 (NLSS) suggested that

      this scholarship amount was sufficient to cover schooling costs for children if they attended community

      or government schools in the Kathmandu Valley.

   3. Group #3 is the stipend group. The children in group 3 received the scholarship as group 2 and an

      additional stipend. In addition to the scholarship, NGF provided a stipend of food rations valued at
   6 ICF International executed SIPE under its "Research on Children Working in the Carpet Industry of India, Nepal, and

Pakistan" contract with the U.S. Department of Labor. NGF, New ERA, and the authors (through International Child Action
Research and Evaluation LLC) were all sub-contractors to ICF for this contract. Leigh Linden was an important contributor
to the early discussions of this project, in addition to providing invaluable input on an earlier draft of this paper.
   7 The scholarship amount, NPR 3,950, was the yearly average cost for supporting one child through the NGF’s own school

support project in year 2008.



                                                           7
      NPR 1,000 per month per child provided that the child attended school at least 80 percent of the days

      his or her school was open for teaching. The stipend distribution occurred through local stores. Every

      child that received the stipend was given an identity card with a picture of the child and their guardian.

      NGF identified several local stores in the neighborhood of the recipients’ residences and arranged for

      the holder of the identity card to receive the stipend as an in-store credit when the child met the school

      attendance requirements.8 Families in the poorest third of the population of the Kathmandu Valley

      spend slightly more than NPR 1,000 per month on grains and pulses. Hence, we do not anticipate

      significant distortions from the stipend’s payment as an in-store credit. The amount of the stipend is

      a third of the cash earnings made by a youth in weaving and roughly the same as a child would earn

      working as a domestic, a common occupation of migrant children in Kathmandu.

All subjects assigned to the two treatment arms took up the benefits when offered. Although group 3

receives both the scholarship treatment and the additional stipend, we refer to group 3 as the stipend group

for economy.

   Subjects appear comparable across treatment arms. Table 3 summarizes background characteristics of

study subjects by treatment status using data collected before the assignment of subjects to treatment arms.

Column 1 contains the control population mean and (in parenthesis) standard deviation for the attribute

indicated by the row. Column 2 contains the differences between the scholarship treatment group and the

control group and the standard error of this difference in parenthesis. For example, the average subject age

in the control group is 11.86 and 11.91 in the scholarship (group 2) arm. Column 3 contains the difference

between the stipend group (group 3) and the control group as well as the standard error of this difference.

Column 4 is the difference between the scholarship treatment group and the stipend treatment group and the

standard error of that difference. The bottom rows of the table contain the F-Stat and P-Value associated

with the null that the individual differences in the column are jointly zero.

   There are no statistically significant differences across characteristics, and to our eyes, none of the dif-

ferences appear substantive either. A few characteristics in Table 4 merit explanation. NGF works with

children associated with licensee establishments. The average associated establishment has 41 employees.

All subjects will have a caregiver involved in carpet manufacture but fewer than 1 in 10 subjects weave

themselves and 98 percent have gone to school at some point in the academic year prior to treatment. 59

percent of subjects live inside the worksite usually with 3.6 other family members present. 66 percent were

born elsewhere and 66 percent have both parents present.
   8 At the time of the project, USG projects were restricted from providing direct cash payments to beneficiaries in foreign

countries. Hence, the stipend had to be delivered as a credit. Most recipients bought rice with the credit.

ended in March 2011. Table 4 reviews the timeline of data collection which spanned February 2010 to August

2012 as well as the project. There are two providers for the data used in this study. NGF and New ERA

Ltd. New ERA is a Nepali data collection firm contracted to provide independent data collection. All data

provided by NGF is collected by agents who are informed of a subject’s status in the intervention. New ERA

was explicitly independent of the evaluation. New ERA enumerators were not aware of a subject’s status in

the intervention or the details of the intervention.

    NGF provides two sources of data used in this study. First, they conducted an eligibility survey in early

February 2010 that was used to identify subjects, allocate subjects to cells for randomization, and test the

validity of the randomization. Second, NGF collected schooling records for the purpose of documenting

compliance with the attendance requirements for the stipend intervention. We refer to these data as NGF

School Records. They are attractive in our evaluation, because they contain monthly school attendance

records for every child from April 2010 until March 2011 as well as yearend in-school test scores. These

school attendance records were used by NGF to determine program eligibility.

    New ERA provides four surveys used in this study. The baseline survey was conducted before subjects

were informed about their status in the project in March 2010. The data were not available prior to random

assignment so only the NGF eligibility survey was accessible at the time of randomization. Both subjects

and their adult caregivers were interviewed in the baseline survey. The midterm survey was conducted

in September 2010, before the October holidays. Only adult caregivers were interviewed in the midterm

survey. The number of questions was reduced compared to the baseline survey, and no questions about child

involvement in the carpet sector were collected. The yearend survey was conducted after New Year festivities

in April and May of 2011. Adult caregivers and subjects were interviewed more than a month after the final

distribution of benefits. The yearend survey instrument was nearly identical to the baseline instrument. The

post survey was conducted in August 2012, approximately 17 months after the final distribution of benefits.

A streamlined instrument was administered to adult caregivers.


2.2    Empirics

The SIPE study was small in scale because of limited resources. The sample size was chosen to have statistical

power with regards to answering one question. Specifically, SIPE was engineered to test the null hypothesis



                                                       9
that the stipend intervention provided no impact on school attendance relative to just the scholarship. This

focus was chosen in discussions with NGF, because it was directly relevant to NGF’s school promotion

efforts. The scholarship portion of SIPE was identical to their Sponsored Education Program, or SEP, and

this null hypothesis was equivalent to asserting that schooling outcomes would not be improved by providing

additional financial support for earnings that would be foregone by attending school rather than working

full-time. The sample size of 220 per treatment group was chosen to test the null hypothesis separately by

gender, by age group, and by carpet establishment size.

    The study size was chosen to be able to detect differences in school attendance between the scholarship

and stipend treatments using a simple comparison of means in the yearend data. However, our interests are

broader than school attendance alone. We consider outcomes related to school performance, completion, and

child labor. For most outcomes ex-ante, we expected our sample size to be underpowered without additional

controls. Moreover, the information available at the study design stage overstated the lack of schooling in

the subject pool so that even school attendance differences are underpowered without controls.

    Hence, we use a regression approach throughout our analysis. Because the randomization appears to

have achieved balance (Table 3) , these controls function to reduce variance and improve statistical power

only. Specifically, we estimate:


                              yijkt = βAi0 + b0 + b1 Sci + b2 Sti + αYijk0 + πijk0 + εijkt                                      (1)


    where yijkt is outcome y for child i in family j associated with establishment k observed at time t.

Sc is an indicator that child i was assigned to the scholarship treatment, St is an indicator that child i

was assigned to the stipend treatment. All subjects who were offered the opportunity to participate in the

scholarship or stipend treatments chose to participate, so there are no issues of take-up associated with

interpreting the coefficients on these random assignment variables. A is a vector of age fixed effects, a gender

effect, and age*gender effects. Yijk0 is a vector of the outcome variables observed at baseline. Its inclusion

means that we identify the impact of the treatments based on changes in y between the baseline period

and either the midyear, yearend, or post period. SIPE randomization was conducted after stratifying the

population into age group × gender × establishment size cells. π is a vector of fixed effects denoting the

subject’s stratum used in randomization. εijkt is a mean zero error term. We cluster standard errors by

establishment throughout.9 We think there is apt to be important clustering of time allocation decisions at
   9 The empirical approach stipulated in an analysis plan submitted to ICF before the availability of the midterm data or

schooling records (available from authors upon request) was identical to what we use here with regards to the included controls,
the functional form of these controls, and the clustering of the residuals. The only difference in specification is that the ex-ante
analysis plan specified the scholarship dummy to be one for both the scholarship and stipend treatments so that the coefficient
on the stipend indicator directly tested differences between the scholarship and the stipend. This difference in specification is
only relevant for the presentation of results and is not substantive.


                                                                10
the establishment level, because subjects are grouped together by establishment. 59 percent of subjects live

inside the establishment, but the other 41 percent of subjects typically live proximate to the establishment

where their caregiver works.

    All results tables follow a similar structure. For each outcome of interest, we report the mean of the

outcome for the control population and its standard deviation in column 1. In column 2, we report b1 and

its standard error. This tests the null that outcome y does not differ with the scholarship group compared

to the control. Ex-ante, we expected modest effects of the scholarship, and we do not believe that our

sample size is sufficient to detect effects of the scholarship in general even with the control function approach

specified above. In column 3, we report b2 and its standard error. This tests the null that outcome y does

not differ with the stipend group compared to the control. In column 4, we report the difference between

the two treatment groups (b2 − b1 ) and the F-Statistic associated with the null that the difference is zero.

We report findings for the pooled sample and bifurcated by gender.10 Random assignment was conducted

at the individual level, so spillovers are a distinct possibility and discussed in section 4. b1 and b2 are both

identified net of any spillovers.

    With two-thirds of subjects as migrants, attrition was an ex-ante concern in this study, and substantial

resources were devoted to tracking subjects in every round except for the midyear survey.11 The survey

instruments implemented by New ERA contained a great deal of information aimed to assist us in tracking

study subjects. Out of the original 660 study subjects identified in February 2010, 655 were interviewed in

the yearend survey in May 2011 and 650 participated in the followup survey in August of 2012.12 We regard

this 98.5 percent retention rate as an achievement in a migrant population. Table 5 tabulates attrition by

treatment group and data source. Attrition is uncorrelated with treatment status.



3     Main Findings

3.1     Schooling

School attendance appears to have been positively impacted by both the stipend treatment and the schol-

arship treatment while support lasted. Because scholarship funds were largely exhausted at the start of the
   10 While the design would allow bifurcation by age group and establishment size, we do not present those results herein.

Establishment size differences were almost never substantive, and we do not think the value-added to the present discussion of
the age group differences was sufficient to justify their inclusion.
   11 While the project funder wanted a midyear survey for their own goals, an important part of the midyear survey was to

collect tracking information on individuals before the October holidays where many families go home. Hence, we did not feel
it was worth the resources at that time to track down families that had already migrated.
   12 We have some information on 7 of the 10 missing children. One child died. One child is from a family who is in hiding

because of unpaid debts. Two children came from a closed factory. Their location was unknown by any of their provided
contacts or former classmates. Three children (all unrelated) are in an unknown location after their mothers left their fathers
(all abroad) for another man.




                                                              11
school year, we see smaller overall effects of the scholarship on schooling when compared to the scholarship.

   The impact of the scholarship on having attended school during the year of support and the attendance

rate overall is evident in Table 6. 92 percent of control subjects attended school during the year support

(down 6 percentage points compared to the school year before support). The scholarship increased this by

a statistically insignificant 2.3 percentage points compared to the control. The stipend increased this by a

statistically significant 4.9 percentage points. The school attendance rate is the number of days the subject

attended school divided by the number of days that the subject’s school was open for teaching (defined using

NGF’s administrative records). Control subjects attended school 4 out of every 5 days the schools was open

for teaching. Stipend subjects attended school more than scholarship or control, a total of 91 percent of

days.

   The month by month impact of the treatments on attendance rates during the year of support is pictured

in Figure 1. The difference between the stipend treatment and control treatment is statistically significant

in every month. The difference between the scholarship treatment and control is not statistically significant

in any month. The difference between the stipend subjects and the control or scholarship populations is

greatest in month 7. This is a month with two important festivals where many families migrate back to their

place of origin in rural Nepal. We specifically timed the midterm survey before this festival season in order

to make sure that we had the most recently available information to track mobile subjects. We find that the

stipend significantly reduced the proportion of days missed by subjects during the festival season.

   Figure 1 combines the extensive margin of attendance (attend school at all in the month) with the

intensive margin (number of days attended conditional on attendance). By combining the two, the figure

mixes something the scholarship treatment can affect (the extensive margin - it makes school free until funds

are exhausted) with something it does not affect (the intensive margin - the cost of attending school on any

given day doesn’t change once the extensive margin costs have been paid). Figure 2 pictures the impact

of both treatments on the extensive margin of attendance for the month. We find treatment effects are

very similar on the extensive margin between the two treatments at the start of the year, but the impact

of the scholarship treatment starts to fade and the gap between the scholarship and the stipend treatment

grows throughout the year. In fact, the impact of the scholarship on the extensive margin of schooling

differs significantly from the control in the first two months of the year. Figure 3 contains the impact of

each treatment by month conditional on attending school. As we would expect, here we see no effect of the

scholarship on attendance compared to the control. Given that the stipend pays for attendance, we would

expect to see large intensive margin effects for the stipend treatment, and we see such, especially in month 7.

The scholarship reduces the cost of attendance on the extensive margin without any impact on the intensive

margin. Hence, the two treatments impact attendance along the lines of “You get what you pay for.”


                                                      12
   The additional attendance in the stipend treatment is associated with increased probability of taking

final exams and scoring better on the in-school final exams (Table 6). The impacts on the probability of

taking the test are large, a nearly 10 percent increase in the probability of taking the test compared to the

control or the scholarship group. The probability that individual failed the school year was reduced by both

treatments. The increase in test scores is positive for both treatments, but slightly larger for the stipend

treatment. The fact that the two treatments are associated with a reduced failure rate implies that the extra

test score improvements for the stipend population are not at the margin of passing.

   We cannot reject the null of no effect of either treatment on schooling past the year of support. These

findings are in Table 7. In the year after support, we do not observe a substantive difference in enrollment

between the treatment groups. The scholarship and stipend groups are slightly less likely to pass their grade

of enrollment in the year after support (although these negative coefficients are not statistically significant).13

Enrollment falls off between one year past support and two years past support, and we cannot reject a null

of no difference in school enrollment for the year or attendance in the month of the follow-up survey (two

academic years removed from the supported year) across treatment groups. Although stipend subjects were

44 percent less likely to fail school during the year of support (Table 6), we are not able to reject the null

hypothesis that they have no higher schooling attainment after one year and a half. Hence, there do not

appear to be lasting effects of the treatment beyond the period of support for schooling.

   During the year of support, the effects of the stipend are largest for girls. Table 8 bifurcates the sample

by gender. It is apparent that most of the statistically significant effects of the stipend in Table 6 came from

the response of girls to the stipend (although boys show significantly higher attendance rates as well). The

impact of the stipend is especially large for the failure rate of girls (reducing the probability of failing by 66

percent). As with the pooled sample, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the impact of the stipend on

schooling for girls lasted only during the year of support.


3.2     Child Labor

The purpose of this intervention, from the funder’s perspective, was to stop children from weaving. Weaving is

considered a hazardous form of child labor because of its association with long-term spinal injuries, arthritis,

respiratory ailments, and eyesight damage as well as the prevalence of forced and bonded labor in the sector.

We find that the stipend intervention substantively reduced weaving among treated girls during the period

of support.

   At baseline, 9.5 percent of control children were involved in weaving. 11.4 percent of control children
  13 Passing in Table 7 is based on caregiver responses whereas passing in Table 6 is from school administrative records. We

suspect the higher pass rate in the control sample in the year after response owes to this difference in respondent.



                                                            13
participated in weaving at some point during the year of support. 12.9 percent of control children participated

in weaving 16 months past the year of support. It may seem surprising that an intervention aimed at

preventing a hazardous form of child labor would deal with subjects whose probability of entering into the

activity are far from 1 during the period of support. However, this is not at all unusual for education

interventions aimed at deterring entry into hazardous child labor.14 These illegal activities are rare, so it

would be surprising if we were were able to identify a subject pool with a transition probability close to 1.

Given that the probability a child works in any form for pay in Kathmandu is 3.8 percent, we think it is

appropriate to view children with counterfactual probabilities of being involved in a hazardous form of child

labor of more than 10 percent as children who are vulnerable to hazardous child labor.

   Table 9 contains the impact of the scholarship and stipend treatments on weaving in the pooled sample.

We can measure child involvement in weaving at 4 points in time: in the 7 days before the interview in the

yearend survey, in the 12 months before the yearend survey (including the 7 days before the interview and

including most of the year of support), in the 30 days before the follow-up survey, and in the 12 months

before the followup survey (which would include the 30 days). We begin the table with the 7 days before

the interview measure, because we also have hours worked data to match that recall period. 7.3 percent

of control subjects weaved in the 7 days prior to the year end survey. On average, those that weaved did

so for 30 hours over the previous 7 days. It is useful to note that this is not total time working, only time

spent weaving. The stipend is associated with a 4.3 percentage point or 59 percent reduction in weaving.

The decline in hours worked associated with the stipend is greater than would be predicted by the decline

in participation alone. The decline in participation in the stipend population, using the controls hours as

a counterfactual, implies that the coefficient on the stipend treatment in row 2 should be -1.253 instead of

the observed -1.497. The larger observed treatment effect might reflect a treatment effect on the intensity of

weaving, or it might reveal that those whose weaving is most influenced by the stipend are those who weave

more time-intensively absent the treatment.

   The 7 days prior to the yearend survey does not include the period where conditionality was enforced

for the stipend. However, we think the reduction in weaving in the 7 days prior to the yearend survey may

reflect the reduced labor supply during the period of support. The mode carpet size being manufactured

in Kathmandu at the time of our study was 8 foot x 10 foot with 100 knots per square inch. Carpets are

knotted in teams who work in a line. The consistency of knotting in the product requires that the team is

held constant throughout the manufacturing process. Thus, it would not be unusual for a team to spend

more than a month dedicated to an 8x10 carpet during normal work periods. The yearend survey was
   14 The U.S. Department of Labor’s Office of Child Labor, Forced Labor, and Human Trafficking regular publishes research on

its website that report on interventions aim at populations vulnerable to hazardous child labor.

conducted around the Nepali New Year’s celebrations. It would not be surprising to learn that carpets being

manufactured at the time of our yearend survey were started when conditionality was enforced in the stipend

intervention, and the impact of the stipend on weaving participation in the past 7 days during the yearend

survey may reflect a combination of the impact of the stipend and whatever decisions were being made after

the end of support.

    We prefer the measure of child weaving the 12 months prior to the yearend survey as our measure of

the impact of the stipend treatment on weaving during the period of support. The stipend reduces the

probability the child was engaged in weaving during the year of support by 5.5 percentage points or 48

percent. The scholarship does not appear to be associated with a reduction in weaving, and we can reject

the null of no difference between the scholarship and stipend treatments at 10 percent. 16 months past the

end of support, we cannot reject the null of no impact of either treatment on child engagement in weaving.

    The reduction in child labor is concentrated in girls. Results bifurcated by gender are in Table 10. Boys

are less likely to be involved in weaving compared to girls (6 percent vs. 16 percent), and even when they

participate in weaving, boys do so for fewer hours on average than participating girls. Hence, we do not find

it surprising that we observe larger effects of the stipend among girls. Girls’ involvement in weaving in the

year of support declines by 10 percentage points or 64 percent. Girls are more likely to weave at follow-up

compared to the year of support, 19 percent compared to 16 percent. However, we cannot reject the null of

no effect of either intervention at follow-up for boys or girls.



4     Discussion

Both the scholarship and stipend treatments lasted one academic year. Recipients were told in advance

that support would last only one year and that no future support was anticipated. A simple, static labor

supply model predicts the “You get what you pay for” response to the scholarship and stipend treatments

we observe.

    In its simplest presentation, the classical static labor supply model has a single agent with preferences over

consumption of a composite good c and schooling s. u(c, s) is the utility representation of these preferences.

The child time endowment T is allocated between schooling s and labor l: T = s + l. The price of the

composite good is normalized to 1. Schooling is costly at price p. The agent is endowed with non-child labor

income Y . Child labor earns a wage w. Hence the budget constraint is c + ps = wl + Y . Plugging in the

time constraint into the budget constraint, we get the full income constraint: c + (w + p)s = wT + Y .

    Figure 4 illustrates the impact of the scholarship on schooling and work decisions. While in effect,

the price of schooling declines, inducing the agent to consume more schooling. This is pictured as a shift


                                                       15
from equilibrium a to equilibrium b. Consumption need not decline, but it could depending on preferences.

Importantly, once the scholarship funds are exhausted, the full income constraint returns to its original level,

and equilibrium a returns. Hence, the impact of the scholarship should only persist so long as scholarship

funds are available as we observe in section 3.1.

    Figure 5 illustrates the impact of the stipend intervention in the static labor supply model. We have the

effect of the scholarship, plus the additional discontinuity in the full income constraint created by the school

attendance requirement of the stipend. When the program is in effect, subjects move from equilibrium a

to c. However, when the project ends, we return to equilibrium a. The reduction in child labor (which is

modeled as the alternative to time in school) and increase in schooling only lasts as long as support.

    This discussion highlights that the stipend includes both the income effect of the change in the price

in schooling and the effect of the additional income that comes with the stipend. We are surprised that

a dynamic model does not better explain our results. Ex-ante, our expectation was that forward-looking

households would exhibit permanent income behavior, treat the one year of support as a transitory income

shock, and save a significant portion of the transfer, at least for the stipend treatment. The stipend was paid

in-kind, but we did not expect the in-kind transfer to be binding with respect to rice and pulse consumption.

Hence, there would be ample means to save the stipend.

    Additional savings does not appear to have materialized. Table 11 documents the impact of the transfers

on household savings and spending. 17 percent of households report some savings, and the stipend recipients

do not appear more likely to save. In fact, stipend recipients report saving less. The stipend appears to

have been spent. The stipend and scholarships appear to be associated with similar increases in educational

expenses. The amount of increase in education spending is roughly of the magnitude that would be predicted

by the scholarship’s impact on schooling and the larger magnitude of the stipend (not statistically different

from the scholarship) is in-line with the stipend’s larger impact on schooling. The increase in food expenses

with the stipend implies that 73 percent of the stipend went towards increased food expenditures.15 This

does not seem to be far off from what we would expect for the slope of an Engel curve in a poor population

like our subject pool, but we cannot rule out some type of non-fungibility in the household budget. Total

expenses increase with the stipend such that 85 percent of the transfers seems to have been translated

directly into new spending.16 This is far off the marginal propensity to consume transitory income that the

permanent-income hypothesis would suggest.

    What happens to the remaining 15 percent of the transfer that is not accounted for by expenditures?
  15 There are on average 1.2 stipend recipients per family with at least one child winning a stipend. The increased food

expenditure associated with the stipend in Table 11 is NPR 877 per month.
  16 For stipend award winning families, there are on average 1.2 stipend recipients (who also receive the scholarship treatment)

and 0.3 scholarship recipients. This implies a total increase in resources on average per month of NPR 1694 for stipend families.
The results for total expenditures in Table 11 imply additional monthly expenditures of NPR 1433 on average.



                                                               16
We have already documented a decline in child engagement in weaving associated with the transfer. In

expectation, this reduction in child weaving results in foregone earnings that are greater than the amount of

the transfer for an individual child. The stipend transfer is NPR 1,000 per month, and the average monthly

wage of a full-time weaver under 20 at the time of our study is NPR 3,078 per month. A 6 percent decline

in weaving with 1.2 recipients per household implies a NPR 222 decline in income. This is 85 percent of the

difference between the increase in consumption observed in Table 11 and the increase in resources associated

with the stipend treatment. There is also some evidence that the transfer was associated with a decline in

adult labor supply. This is evident in the bottom row of the table. Average adult hours worked declines by

3.3 hours per week in stipend recipient households compared to control households. Overall, then, it appears

the stipend was spent largely on food but also on reduced child and adult labor. There does not appear to

be substantive permanent-income type smoothing behavior.

   This observation that there appears to be a decline in adult labor supply raises the question of spillovers

within household as there can be control and treated children within the same family. If there are important

spillovers in time allocation, this would reduce our estimates of the effect of the stipend or scholarship

treatment. To examine spillovers, we limit our sample to control subjects. We modify equation (1) to

control for the number of subjects in the family (which is non-random), Nj . Conditional on Nj , the presence

of a scholarship winner ScWj or a stipend winner StWj in the family will be random. Hence, we estimate:


                   yijkt = βAi0 + b0 + δ0 Nj + δ1 ScWj + δ2 StW j + αYijk0 + πijk0 + eijkt                 (2)


where δ1 is how outcome y differs for a control child when there is a scholarship winner in the family

(compared to no scholarship winner), and δ2 is how outcome y differs for a control child when there is a

stipend winner in the family. Estimates of δ0 , δ1 , and δ2 are reported in Table 12. In general, the more

eligible children in the family, the worse the schooling outcomes and the more prevalent weaving. δ0 is not

causally identified, but the general pattern matches the NGF inspector priors that resource dilution is apt

to be an important influence on time allocation. The presence of a scholarship or a stipend winner in a

control child’s family is associated with higher school attendance for the control child. Spillovers in school

attendance have been documented in other contexts (e.g. Angelucci & De Giorgi (2009), Bobonis & Finan

(2009)), and we cannot separately identify whether this increase in schooling attendance reflects resource

transfers or peer effects. However, in the remaining 14 regressions in the table, we cannot reject the null

of no spillover at 5 percent for any outcome. The clearest evidence of spillovers in labor supply from the

stipend treatment come from the apparent reduction in hours worked among adults.

5    Conclusion

Combating child labor through education promotion is at the center of anti-child labor policy aimed at

ending the involvement of 115 million children worldwide in hazardous child labor. The USG is the largest

funder of anti-child labor programs worldwide, and financial education support in USG-funded programs

is required to be transitory by federal law. We evaluate the impact of an USG anti-child labor aimed at

children vulnerable to child labor in the hand-made export-oriented carpet sector of Nepal. We evaluate the

impact of a scholarship program designed to cover direct, out-of-pocket schooling expenses and a stipend

program that included the scholarship plus an additional stipend conditional on school attendance in the

previous month.

    We have found small, positive effects of a scholarship program that covered out-of-pocket schooling

expenses on whether subjects attended school at all at the start of the period of support. These treatment

effects on schooling dissipate quickly such that we found no effects on school attendance for the year of support

(although scholarship recipients were more likely to pass the school year). We found larger, substantive

effects of the combined scholarship and stipend program that covered school expenses and provided a large

stipend conditional on school attendance. The stipend treatment appeared to reduce child involvement in

carpet weaving, a worst form of child labor in Nepal. However, after 16 months, we find no evidence of

the program in schooling attendance, grade level, or child labor. These findings are inconsistent with the

hypothesis underlying USG anti-child labor policy that transitory education interventions are an effective

tool to combat child labor in the long run. Our findings suggest an impact on child labor and schooling

during the period of support, but it decays quickly after support ends. You get what you pay for.

    Our “You Get What You Pay For” findings are exactly what a classical static labor supply model would

predict. The scholarship changes the relative price of consuming schooling until its funds are exhausted, then

the original equilibrium returns. The stipend also changes the relative price of consuming schooling as well

as shifting the budget constraint in a way that induces more consumption of schooling and less child labor

until the incentive is removed. This classical model is rarely used in the child labor or schooling literatures

at present. Our findings illustrate that this classical framework can be useful for understanding child labor

even in a case of a worst form of child labor.

    An interesting question is why does the classical static labor supply model do such a complete job of

explaining the response to the program evaluated herein. In the present case, subjects knew that the support

was transitory. We suspect that is not always the case in anti-child labor programs, but the implementing

NGO went to great lengths to make sure that recipients knew the support was transitory. We expect poor

families to save positive transitory income shocks. Families appear to spend 85 percent of the stipend. The



                                                       18
balance does not appear to have been saved and may be accounted for with reduced labor supply by study

subjects and their adult care-givers. We do not see permanent-income type behaviors in response to this

transitory support. One possible explanation for the lack of smoothing is that the poor subjects could be

facing a subsistence constraint (e.g. Dasgupta & Ray (1986)). Eating could be the highest marginal return

available to recipient households. If this were the case, we are surprised we do not see more children involved

in child labor. Work in the carpet sector appears to be readily available to subjects; we frequently heard

complaints from employers that they could not find workers. If our subject families were suffering from

not having enough to eat to subsist, we would expect to see a lot more child labor than we do. Liquidity

constraints are a possibility. Other studies have found liquidity constraints to be an important influence

on child labor and schooling (e.g. Edmonds (2006)). However, ordinarily we think of liquidity constraints

as limiting an agent’s ability to borrow against future income rather than to find a way to save current

income. Financial access among migrant workers in the Kathmandu Valley is not perfect, but 17 percent of

control subjects are in families with positive savings. We do not think that this is a setting where agents face

physical constraints on their ability to save, but there is nothing herein to rule out the possibility of physical

liquidity constraints preventing families from transferring transitory income forward. The explanation for

why a simple, static labor supply model can so completely capture the response to the schooling incentives

considered herein is an interesting question for future study, but we believe our findings should revive the

utility of this model in future discussions of child labor and schooling policy.

variable. All regressions include age × gender fixed effects as well as dummies for randomization strata and controls for baseline
time allocation. Standard errors are clustered by establishment. Column (1) is the mean and standard deviation of the row
variable for the control group. Column (2) indicates the coefficient and standard error on an indicator for scholarship treatment
group. Column (3) indicates the coefficient and standard error on an indicator for stipend treatment group. Column (4)
presents difference between coefficients in columns (2) and (3) and F-stat for the test of null that stipend group differs from the
scholarship group. The first row is based on parental report and the rest comes from school report from NGF.

∗ : p < 0.1;∗∗ : p < 0.05;∗∗∗ : p < 0.01. Each row is from a different regression with the row variable as the dependent
variable. All regressions include age × gender fixed effects as well as dummies for randomization strata and controls for baseline
time allocation. Standard errors are clustered by establishment. Column (1) is the mean and standard deviation of the row
variable for the control group. Column (2) indicates the coefficient and standard error on an indicator for scholarship treatment
group. Column (3) indicates the coefficient and standard error on an indicator for stipend treatment group. Column (4)
