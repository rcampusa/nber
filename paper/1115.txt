            THE THEOREMS OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE WITH FACTOR MOBILITY

                                     Abstract


            This   paper addresses the relation between goods trade and

international factor mobility in general terms. Conditions for factor price

equalization are derived for situations with trade in both goods and factors,

as well as Rybczynski and Stolper—SarnuelSofl theorems. A weak price version

of the Heckscher—Ohlifl theorem is presented, as well as stronger quantity

versions.

            The basic theorems of international trade, suitably interpreted,

are shown to hold in their strong versions if the number of international

markets is at least as large as the number of factors.      The crucial

dimensionality issue is hence not the relative number of goods and factors

per se, but the number of international markets relative to the number of

factors. Only the price version of the Heckscher—Ohlifl theorem fails to be

essentially preserved by this condition.

1. Introduction

          This paper addresses the relation between commodity trade and

international factor mobility in general terms. There are two rtivations.

The first is the intrinsic importance of the subject relative to the limited

attention it has thus far received. MuJ.ti—commodity and imilti—factor

generalizations of the standard factor proportions theory of international

trade deal rstly with goods trade only and ignore international nobility of

factors of production (see Ethier (1982b) for a recent survey). Although

there exists an extensive literature on various aspects of international

factor nobility (surveyed in Jones and Neary (1982)), there are few attempts

systematically to discuss the trade pattern in both goods and factors when

some factors are traded. Such a discussion is contained in Svensson (1982),

who extends previous work by Dixit and Woodland (1982) to trade in factors as

well as in goods. But Svensson's analysis deals only with marginal factor

endowment differences in the neighborhood of an autarky equilibrium. Thus a

more general treatment is needed.

          Our second notivation is the dixnensionality issue. As is well

known, the standard theorems of factor—endowments trade theory are very

sensitive to whether the nwnber of goods equals the number of factors or

not.1 This is widely regarded as very damaging to the theory, since the
                                      —2—




relative abundance of   goods   and factors is an arbitrary feature of nature and
technolor,    and one about which most of' us have limited intuition. Ethier

(1982b) presents a countervailing argument assigning factor mobility a key

role. There are two parts to the argument.       (i) Those traditional results

which   are otherwise quite general, with equal numbers of'   goods and factors,

are weakened only slightly when goods outnumber factors but substantially

when factors outnumber goods. Thus the key requirement is that there be at

least as xxariy goods as factors, not that they be precisely equal in number.

(ii) The n.in reason dimensionality natters is not the technological distinc—

tion between goods and factors, but the assumption that the former are inter-

nationally traded while the latter are not. Thus the standard       results are
preserved   when factors outnumber goods if enough factors are traded. This

interpretation leaves the basic propositions sensitive nainly not to an

arbitrary feature of nature but to whether enough narkets exist —— to which

most substantive results in economics are sensitive. In any event, this

discussion implies a central role for factor mobility in an understanding of

the significance of the basic propositions of factor endowments trade theory.

            Our paper is organized as follows. Section 2 sets out the basic

framework, and then Section 3 offers a full treatment of' factor—price

equalization,2 exposing the role of dimensionality. Section 4      derives   some

Rybczynski—type and Stolper—Sainuelson type results. The relation of com-

modity trade and factor trade to each other and to factor endowments is the

topic of the Heckscher—Ohlin type results of Section 5, which thereby also

extend the previous analysis in Svenssori (1982) of narginal factor endowment

differences. Section 6 contains a sumnary and some conclusions.

2.    International Equilibrium
               Consider a   world of two countries, home and foreign. First we

describe the home country. There are M goods, indexed i=l,...,M, all                of   which

are traded. They are produced by N factors, NT of which are traded and NN c

which    are   not. Factor endowments are fixed.

               There are J (production) sectors, indexed j =        l,...,J.    Ehch

production sector is characterized by a convex technology T' of feasible

combinations (ii, v3) of net output M—vectors y of goods and non—negative

input N—vectors v of factors. In particular, there are no externalities

between sectors. (Indeed, sectors are defined as the finest partition of the

overall production technology for which there are no intersectoral

externalities.)

               By using this concept of sectors, we can include joint production.3

For the special case of no joint production, we can identify sectors with

goods, and for sector j all (yi, v) in T will have y 0, and y =                    U   for

all goods i other than J•

               For given goods prices p and factor inputs v, the sector j product

function is defined as G(p,v) =            uRx{py:   (y,v3)cT3} ,   the riaximum   value

                                 j
added obtainable, where py denotes the inner product z.p y. (or,
                                                                     ij

equivalently, the natrix product between the row vector p' and the column

vector   yi; we let all vectors without a prime be column vectors, and let

prime denote transpose). For a given domestic factor input v, the

domestic product function is defined as G(p,v) =         nax{E.G(p,v):         Ev <    v}   ,


the   naximum value of      domestic   output when factors are freely nxbile between
                                          _4—




sectors. We let v = (k         ,P/ )   denote home factor endowments, where the

NT_vector k denotes ownership of traded factors and the Nw_vector 2. denotes

endowments of nontraded factors. For simplicity we shall call these

"capital"   and "labor", respectively-. Let the NT_vector k denote capital
input in production (as distinct from capital endowments) in the home
country-,   and let the NT_vector r denote rentals, the price of capital.         Then,

for   given goods prices and rentals, and given factor endowments, we define

the national product function G(p,r,v) as


Ci)         G(p,r,k,L) =      G(p,k(p,r,L),&)   + r(k k(p,r,L)).


Here the capital input function i(p,r,L) is the solution to flEX {G(p,,L) +

r' (k —   k): k )   O}   , which then fulfi11s


(2)          Gk(p,k(p,r,2.),L) = r.


             Hence we assume each sector behaves competitively, and takes goods

prices and rentals as given. The first term on the right hand side of             Ci)


is domestic product from the use of factors (k,2.) at home, and the second

term is factor income from abroad, due to the net export of capital (k —

the   difference between endowments and domestic input of capital.

             Assume that the demand side of the home country can be represented

by a standard M—vector demand function D(p,Y), where Y is national income.

We define net export of goods, x, and of capital, z, as


(3)          xy—candzk—k,
the difference between output y and consumption CM—vector) c, and between capital
                                               —5—



endowments and capital input. By standard properties of the national product

function, net export of goods and capital will be given by the functions5


R)          x(p,r,v) =       G(p,r,v)     —   D(p,G(p,r,v)),   and


(5)         z(p,r,v)     =   G,r,V)       = k —     k(p,r,).
Furthermore, the prices of nontraded factors, wages w, will be given by


(6)         w   =
                    G2(p,r,v).

            The     foreign country has factor          endowments   v = (ç*,*) and
analogous   national product and dennd functions, which give rise to net

export functions for goods and capital, denoted by x*(p,r,v*) and z*(p,r,v*).

A world equilibrium will satisfy


CT)         x(p,r,v) +       x*(p,r,v*)    =   0, and

(8)         zCp,r,v)     +   z*(p,r,v*)    =   0,

that is, both goods and traded—factor nm.rkets are in equilibrium.

3. Factor Price Equalization
          We first determine when free trade in goods and capital will
internationally equalize the rewards of nontraded factors. To this end we
now assume that the two countries have identical technology                 with constant

returns   to scale. Then G(p,r,v) is linearly homogeneous in v, k(p,r,9..) Is
linearly homogeneous in 2, and the functions apply to both countries.
                                          —6—



                To establish a point of reference, suppose initially that    the
world's stock of factors is distributed between the two countries so as to

render the foreign endowment proportional to the home: v = Xv.             Thus the

two    countries    are initially identical in all respects save possibly tastes

and    scale.
                Under these circumstances, a possible free—trade equilibrium, (7)
and (8), is obtained if each country produces a scaled—down version of the

world output vector, if no capital is actually traded, and if goods are

traded to accommodate taste differences. (Depending upon dimensionality,

there nay be other equilibria as well, with the same prices, but this

possibility will not disturb our subsequent argument. We assume that the

equilibrium       price vector is unique, up to a irultiplicative factor.) That is,
we have


(9)             x+x*0 and zz*0.
Also, w =       G(p,r,v)    =   (p,r,xv) = w,   so that the prices of nontraded

factors are equalized. We wish to know the circumstances under which this

equalization is preserved when we abandon the assumption that endowments in

the two countries are strictly proportional             to each other.
                As a first step, let the relative endowments depart irarginally from
proportionality       by perturbing the above equilibrium by redistributing

endowments:6


(10)            dv + dv*   =   0, with Wdv = Wdv*   =   0,
                                                   —7—



where W =      (r   ,w ).     Then, from (7) and            (8)



(ii)          (x + x*)dp +
               p         p
                                     (xr+ x*)dr
                                           r
                                                     = —(x
                                                           v
                                                                  —   x*)dv
                                                                       v
                                                                              = 0 and



(12)          (z + z*)dp +           (Zr + z*)dr     = —(z        —   z*)dv   =   0,

as consequences of homogeneity. Here x is the MxM                             iratrix         etc.

Then dp = 0 and dr = 0 is consistent with maintaining free trade equilibrium.

In this case, wages in the two countries change according to



              dw=G Lvdv=G U
                          dL,and
(13)
                    =   * dv
                         Lv
                                     4*U

where we have used               =   0; that is, wages do not directly depend on capital
endowments.7 Now, since the national product function is linearly homogeneous

in factor endowments, its first derivatives are of zero homogeneity, and its

second derivatives are homogeneous of degree minus one. Hence,


(114)                   ,Av) =
                                 LL       ,xv) =           ,v)/X.


It follows that


(15)          dw — dw* =         (    +
                                            L)dL
                                                    =    (x +

and     we see that wages remain equalized if                          is equal to zero; that is, if

changes in labor endowments have no (local) effect, at constant goods prices

and rentals, on wages.
                                               —8—




               To show that           indeed equals zero, under the assumptions of

identical technologies, constant returns to scale, and initially proportional

endowments, we employ the unit value added cost function, as follows.

               For each sector j, the unit value added cost function c(p,w) is
defined as8


(16)           C(p,W) =   ndn{Wv:        pyi         1, (y,v)cT}.

This cost function gives, for given goods prices (the M—vector p) and factor

prices (the N—vector w), the minimum value of inputs for which value added,

the value of the net .output vector, is equal to unity. Let                    denote value

added in sector j; let Y =            (yi)   be the corresponding J—vector; and let

C(p,W), the national cost function, be the vector whose components are the

cost functions for the sectors with positive value added. That is,9 let

J(Y) =   {j:    jcJ,      > O}   (the set of sectors with positive value added) and

C(p,W) =                              (We suppress the argument Y, or J(Y), of the

national cost function.) The national cost function is homogeneous of degree

zero in goods prices and factor prices. Then, by Euler's theorem

(ii)           pC +    WC
                         W       0,
                 p

where pC denotes pre—multiplication of the (row) M—vector p by the

(Mx J(Y))—uatrix C = [aCu/aph], etc. Since W =                    (r,w)   and in equilibrium

       w, we can write


(18)
               £ w
                       = —pC
                             p
                                 —    rCr

We note that the xatrix C               EaCI3w'] is N        x J(Y). If J(Y)    N ,
                                  w                      N                       N
                                               —9—




C     is square or can be ude so by arbitrary deletion of enough equations

(that is, sectors) from (18).             If   so, and if C thus modified is of rank N
                                                           w                          N
it is invertible, and we can write


(19)              = —(pC        +   YC )c'.
                                      rw
             P.            p

Here the right hand side does not depend on labor input P..10            We hence

conclude that          equals zero, and from (15) we have factor price

equalization, and

(20)        dw = dw*       0.


The    sufficient condition for this is
(21)        J(Y) >   N    = rank C
                      N               w

that is, there must be as nny linearly independent (that is, distinct)
sectors with positive value added as there are non—traded factors. If the
equilibrium vector Y of value added is unique, (21) holds with equality and the
number of sectors is e.ctly equal to the number of non—traded factors.
            The next step is to consider large international differences in
relative endowments. The above argument applies             to all finite changes Av and

tv* consistent with (10), for which neither country is forced to            shut down

any sector.'1 When   will this be so?
            To see this, first recall that the price derivatives of          the   cost
function,   in equilibrium, are conditional unit value added input functions.'2

Then we can write the home country's output, capital input and labor input as
                                               —10—




 (22)        y = — CY, k =       CY and £ = CY,

where CY denotes post—multiplication of the nRtrix C =                       I3C/p]    by the

(column) vector Y, etc. Let us now define the generalized diversification cone
K(p,r,w) as

(23)        K(p,r,w) =            0: £ =   CY,          o}.

It is, for given goods and factor prices, the set of labor inputs consistent

with    non—negative value added in all sectors. The diversification cone is of
dimension NN if (21) holds. To assure that the                output vector is unique, we

assume that   (21)   holds with equality. Then Cw is square and can be inverted,

and we can use (22) to get



(21)
                    pw                     rw
            Now, suppose the world is in the initial equilibrium, and consider

changes v and v* consistent with (10), and leaving £ and R. in the

diversification cone. Is this consistent with a new equilibrium with

unchanged goods and factor prices? If, in fact, these do not change, we have

Thus world output of goods and world input of capital reu.in unchanged.

Since world denRnd for goods and world endowments of capital are unchanged,

world markets for goods and capital remain in equilibrium.
              It follows that for changes v and t,v* that fulfill (10) and leave
£ and 9.*    in the diversification cone, there exists a new equilibrium with
unchanged goods and factor prices and hence factor price equalization. But
are we sure that there do not still exist other equilibria, where factor
price   equalization does not obtain? To dispose of this possibility, assume

K(p,r,w0) and K(p,r,w). Then there exist Y° andY1 such that
(26)         9. =   C0Y0   and 2. =   C1Y1,

         0          1                    0                            1
where   C    and Cw denote C(p,r,w ) and               C(p,r,w ).            Furthermore, by zero
hongeneity of the national cost function, we have

(27)         —pC0 = rC0r + w0C1 and —pC1 = r'C1 +
                    p         w               r          p                         w

with obvious notation.

             Recalling that the derivatives are conditional input demands, since

the input demands minimize cost, we also have

             rC° + w1C°         —p'C0 = rC0 + w0C0,

                                                                                   10 00

with strict inequality if w1            w0.       By    a symmetric argument, we can show

with strict inequality if w0            w•

                                           -.12—




was assumed at first.

             Hence, factor price equalization must obtain, if the endowment

changes fulfill (10) and leave both countries' labor endowments in the

diversification cone. The crucial condition is (21). If there is no joint

production, this reduces to


(31)         M +         N.
                   NT


That    is, the total number of international narkets (goods and traded factors)
must be at least as great as the number of factors. This indicates that at
bottom factor price equalization depends not on an arbitrary aspect of nature
(the relative numbers of goods and factors) but rather, just like nDst
interesting propositions in economics, on the existence of enough nurkets.
Note,    however, that    the number of narkets which is sufficient   depends upon

the number of factors (so that reducing the number of goods and increasing

the    number of traded factors a like aimount is not neutral: the required
number of'   international  narkets rises).
             At this point we mist say a word about nontraded goods. They
should   of course be allowed if commodities are to be treated analogously to

factors. We exclude them for expositional reasons, since they do not affect

our basic argument. If included, conditions for equilibrium in nontraded

goods narkets would be solved for nontraded goods prices as functions of the

present state variables, and these functions would simply be embodied in the

form of the national          product functions, and so forth. Then, provided proper
care   were taken in the use of the diversification—cone concept, the argument
                                     —13—




of    this section would proceed essentially unchanged.'3 In particular, (21)

would ren.in the key dimensionality condition. Note that    this indicates a
way   in which factors and goods differ: an additional nontraded factor xrakes
(21) more stringent, but an additional nontraded good does not.

4.    Comparative Statics
             In factor—endowments models   of   commodity trade, the Rybczynski

theorem describes the effects of endowment changes on outputs, and the

Stolper—Samuelson theorem addresses the implications of commodity—price

changes for factor rewards.' Both propositions exploit the technological

relation between goods and factors and do not depend upon whether factors

are   internationally traded or not (although the latter might help determine
the circumstances under which   the theorems can in fact be applied). For

example,    the Rybczynski theorem's description    of how commodity outputs

respond    to changes in a nation's employment of factors is not sensitive to
whether the latter changes are due to domestic factor accumulation or to the
import of traded factors. Thus we need say little about the influence of
factor trade on the standard propositions. Instead we focus on the new
questions   that arise.

            There are three relevant aspects to the two theorems. First, they
are linked together by the "reciprocity relations." Next, each of the
theorems contains two assertions, one relating to nagnitudes and one relating
to directions. For example, the Stolper—Samuelson theorem asserts that
commodity price changes produce unambiguous changes in real factor rewards,
                                          —l 4—




and also that relative factor intensities help to predict the direction of
the latter. We examine in turn each of the three aspects.

(i)    The reciprocity relations

            The standard reciprocity relations follow from differentiation of

the domestic product function. We have G               =   G,   where again a prime denotes

transpose. Hence, for good i and factor j,

(32)        ayh/vi =     (/av)(aG/p')             (3/p1)(aG/avi) =


These relations hold whenever the respective terms are well defined. They

reflect only the technology (and the optimization implicit              in the domestic
product    function) and these hold regardless of whether factor j is traded or

nontraded. But the presence of traded factors introduces the questions

of how changes in the endowments of nontraded factors influence a country's

use of traded factors, and of how changes in the (international) price of

traded factors affect the rewards of nontraded factors. We therefore derive

an appropriate set of reciprocity relations. This is not difficult. For we

have, using twicedifferentiability of the national product function,


              r&
                   =-,
                    Lr

and    since, by (5) and (6),


(33)
              r
                        and—k£ =G
                   £r               rP.



we get the desired reciprocity relation

()                      = i/a1
for traded factor i and nontraded factor j.
                                       —15--




 (ii)   lhgnitudes

             It is well known that   the   following results hold under very      general
circumstances     when M = N and there is no joint production: (a) an increase

in the price of any good causes a nDre—than—proportional rise in some factor

reward and a decline in some other factor reward; (b) at given commodity

prices, an increase in the econonr_wide use of any          factor   requires a

more—than--proportional rise in the output of some good and an absolute fall

in the output of some other good; (c) application of the reciprocity

relations    (32) to the "Stolper—Samuelson" result (a) yields         further
"Rybczynski" results and application to the "Rybczynski" result (b) yields
further "Stolper—Samuelson" results. If there are nrre goods than factors
these results are almost completely preserved, but they are weakened
substantially     when the number of factors exceeds the number of goods.15

            The presence of traded factors has     little   effect on these

propositions: the results follow whenever the conditions are met- But two

points should be rrade.     First, the above results are weakened when there are

more factors than goods because endowment changes at constant prices then

require changes in factor rewards for factor nErkets to clear.            Thus the

analysis   of   the previous section implies that, with traded factors, condition

(31) replaces M N as the dimensionality requirement for the results to hold

in full    strength:   there must be at least as iiany international nurkets as

factors.

            The second point concerns the relation between traded and nontraded

factors. Suppose an exogenous rise in the reward of some traded factor, all
                                               —16—



other international prices renining fixed. Then some factor reward must

fall,    else no sector would be able to earn non—negative profits at unchanged

commodity prices. With the rewards of traded factors fixed, it must be a

nontraded      factor that becomes cheaper. Furthermore, this is a. real decline
since commodity prices have not changed. Thus each traded factor is an
"enemy-'t to some nontraded factor. The reciprocity relations (35)             then   imply
that the denRnd for any traded factor is reduced by a rise in the endowment
of some single nontraded factor. Note that these results do not require
condition      (31)    and that they are fully compatible with joint production.

(iii)    Directions

               In   factor—endowments trade      imodels, factor intensities predict, in

an   average sense, the response of factor rewards to commodity—price changes
and the response of outputs to factor—endowment changes. For example,
commodity—price changes are positively correlated with changes in the rewards
of those   factors used relatively most intensively (see Ethier (1982a,b)).

Such predictions are not sensitive to whether some factors are traded or

t.l6 But now we are interested instead in predicting the direction of

change of commodity outputs and traded—factor usage jointly in response to

changes in the endowments of nontraded factors, and also in predicting

changes in nontraded factor rewards in response to changes in the vector of

commodity prices and traded—factor rewards. We have

                =     G(p,r,v)   and     =             =


Define   q =    (y,    —iv)' and ii    = (p   ,r )', where all vectors without primes are

This   is the general (directional) Rybczynski theorem for an economy with
traded factors. Note that R depends only upon technolor. Using the term
"relative factor intensities" to refer to the relative nugnitudes of the
elements of R, correlation (36)                                        says      that any change in the endowment of
nontraded factors will, at constant prices of goods and traded factors, tend
on   average    to raise the most the outputs of goods, and to reduce the most the
                                                —18—




 usage of traded factors, that are relativeiy most intensive in the use of
 those nontraded factors that have increased the most, etc. Note that we look
at     the various commodities' intensity of use of nontraded factors only, but

that    these   are compared not only with each other but also with the relative

intensities of nontraded factors in the econonr's usage of traded factors.

 (Nontraded factors can          be    thought of as "employed" in the national usage f'

traded factors in thesense that,                given   commodity outputs, an increased

endowment of nontraded factors               allows the econoxmj- to reduce its usage of
traded    factors).17

             This result is extremely general in that it allows joint

production, applies to arbitrary endowment changes, and is independent of the

relative numbers of goods, traded factors, and nontraded factors. Thus the

movement from            to 9.1 may or may not change w. But           for   (36)   to   be useful we

need to explore the nature of the key               matrix    B. To this end assume that

there are the same number of             goods as sectors. Then, if          the matrix —C in

(22) is of full rank, it can be inverted. Doing so, (22) becomes


(37)         k = —c C1y =         —C   C1G     and £ =   —C   C'y =   —C   C1G
                        rp             rp p                   wp           wp p

To proceed further we need further restrictions. Assume that condition (31)

holds, so that our results from the previous section imply                    that   a small

deviation    of £   about 2.     produces    no change in w. Then from (37)

             —k
                £
                    =   —C    C1G

where I is the identity matrix. If, furthermore, (31) holds with equality,

Here

intermediate         point) in the respective sectors and —C Cr the matrix                            of traded
factor   requirements. If joint production is excluded, —C is the diagonal

matrix whose diagonals are the inverse of the goods prices and can hence be

made equal to the identity matrix by the proper choice of units of

measurement of goods.

               Continuing to suppose that (31) holds —                          but    not necessarily- with

equality —— suppose that the hypothetical endowment change leaves the econorrr

within   the original generalized diversification cone. Thus no change in w
will take place and the production techniques will likewise be unaltered. In
this case H can sily be calculated from the observed techniques.

That is,      the direct input requirements are in this case used to determine

5. Patterns of Trade in Goods and Factors
                   In       this section         we develop versions, appropriate in the presence of
factor   trade, of the principle                                 of comparative advantage and of the price and
quantity       versions of the Heckscher—Ohlin theorem.


Ci) The principle                     of   comparative advantage

                   General results relating the pattern of trade in goods only to

differences            in    autarky goods prices have been obtained by Deardorff (1980) and

Dixit and Norn.n (1980), and surveyed                                         in   Ethier (1982b).   Factor trade can   be

straightforwardly                    incorporated. Letting                           and rA denote autarky prices and c,

y and z denote free—trade consumption, output and factor exports, we have

                    A                A   AAA
                   p c G(p ,r ,v) > p y + r z.
                                                      —21—




The first inequality follows from standard gains—from—trade arguments, which

easily encompass factor trade,18 and the second inequality follows from the

definition of G. Thus

               A
          it       (x,z)           0


where    =     A_ ,rA_ )         and x =     y    — c.    Now ir (x ,z )   = 0 if r denotes free
trade prices. Thus

(ho)               —         (f ,z ).        0.


Similar arguments applied to the foreign country yield

                           )(x*,z*)'          0.


          Since (x,z) +            (x*,z*)        =   0, we have

  1)      (.rr
                       —     v   ( ,z   )—   > o.

The great generality of our results (ho) and (hl) should be apparent.



(ii) The price version of the Heckscher—Ohlin theorem

         Assume that the number of goods equals the number of sectors and that

C is of full rank so that (17) implies

                   = r[—cTh 1] +
                             rp         [—wpl}•
Furthernre, assume no joint production. Then the right—hand side above

depends on factor prices only and indeed the right—hand side is identical to

the (row) vector of the standard unit—cost functions. Then we can write

                   = WD(W)
                                                                                 —22—



where

                                 r_ rp
                     D(W)=                            1

                                            VP
Now define the real—valued function d(W) by


                     d(W) =


where        (x ,z') denotes the actual free—trade vector of net exports of goods and
                           A
factors.             Let W       and W denote autarky factor prices at home and abroad. Then,
                                                                                                            -

Here we have used d(W) = D(W)(x',z), since by cost minimizing all terms
                                are zero. The left—hand side of (12) is nonpositive by

relative         to the goal of                       predicting something about (x,z) solely from (wA— wA* ).
Now we need to know (rA —                                 rA     )    as well, that is, we do not use a concept of

relative factor abundance limited to nontraded factors only. The problem is

that the latter do not in                                 general give enough inforxtion if                     there are also

(iii)    The quantity version of the Heckscher—Ohlin theorem

             In factor—endowments trade theory, the quantity version of the

Heckscher—Ohljn theorem is related to the Rybczynski theorem. We now wish to

use our versions of the latter to develop explanations of the pattern of

joint trade in goods and factors. To that                                  end,      we now         define     the vector x

and   x' of home country "preference trade" and "induced trade", respectively,
as follows

             x
                 P      1          I
                     =g(y +*) —candx =x—x
                                          P


where c denotes the home consumption vector, g the home—country share of the
value of world output, and y' and y denote home and foreign outputs

respectively. Note that if the home and foreign countries share identical

honiothetic tastes, x 0 and x =                            x'.       Define              =   g(1    +   t*),   where     and P'

denote endowments of nontraded factors at home and abroad. Then, if p and r

equal   free trade equilibrium prices, we                            have from (36)

                     1       0           ..1        .0           1         0

where   y=   G       (p,r,k,p.1) =         G(p,k,) and k1 = k(p,r,)                                  for i =     0,1.   Nov

                                                               g(I     +                 = —z   +

Here z denotes the vector of home country capital exports and                                                    denotes the

vector each component of which shows the excess of home ownership of the

respective traded factor above the fraction g of the world supply. Let                                                        be
                                               —2k—

Al so

Thus we have

R5)          (x,z)R[(t' —             g(&1 +          > 0.

This is the generalized quantity version of the Heckscher—Ohlin theorem. It

says    that the induced net exports of goods and the z' portion of the net export
of capital are positively correlated with the country's relative abundance of
the nontraded factors utilized relatively intensively. Equation (1i5) decomposes
total factor trade z into what we call "endowment factor trade" and "induced
factor trade" z'. The endowment trade component is the direct result of the
extent to which the country's ownership of traded factors is not proportional to
the world supply of these factors. This trade is independent of factor
intensities      (and technolor generally), of tastes, of prices, and of endowments

of nontraded factors, except in the indirect sense that all these help to

determine the factor of proportionality g, which depends upon the actual

equilibrium.         By contrast, induced factor trade z', which alone enters into
(145), is determined, jointly with induced commodity trade, by factor intensities
and by endowments of nontraded factors. Ownership of traded factors has no
influence (except, a.in, if it            helps determine the general equilibrium).
                                       —25—



Broadly speaking, countries conduct endowment trade directly to export abundant

traded   factors and to import scarce traded factors, and they conduct induced
factor trade indirectly to export abundant nontraded factors and to import
scarce nontraded factors —— in the form of those traded factors which best
substitute    for them in   the production process. Both components of total factor
trade thus have a factor—endowment base.
            Note the analor between the two types of goods trade and the two
types of factor trade. Induced goods trade, like induced factor trade, is
determined by relative factor intensities as summarized in (145).       Preference

(goods) trade reflects taste differences just as endowment (factor) trade
reflects    ownership differences. If   tastes are identical and homothetic, and if
the home and foreign countries own traded factors in identical proportions, (145)

describes   all trade. It is common to use the term "demand reversal" to describe
a situation where taste differences cause the opposite pattern of commodity
trade   (in a 2x2 world) to that predicted on the basis of relative factor

endowments. We can analogously use the term "demand—endowment reversal" to

refer to the case where x' and        are such that (x,z)R[L1 — g(p1 +             < 0.
            The basic result (145) allows joint production, is valid no matter

how great the difference between home and foreign endowments, requires no

restrictions   on dimensionality, and imposes no additional restrictions on
technolor (such as ruling out higher dimensional analogs of factor—intensity
reversals). To proceed further, suppose that      the   number of sectors equals
the number of goods, that there are at least as many goods and traded factors
as there are factors, and that in the free trade equilibrium the home and
                                             —26—




foreign endowments of          noritraded   factors lie in a common generalized
diversification        cone (so that    there is factor price equalization). If we now
apply   to (38a) the same logic that we applied to (36) in order to derive (1t5)

we obtain



(146)              —   g(1    + z*)I_ E_CWC; 1x1    >   0.



Thus a country will on average           export those goods which make relatively

intensive   use of the country's relatively abundant nontraded factors. (This of

course applies only          to   induced trade. We describe as a "demand reversal" the
                                  I
case where substitution of x for x in (146) reverses the direction of the

inequality.)

            Note two aspects of this result. First, the concept of relative

factor intensity employed here is the most natural one: simply                 the   relative

sizes of the direct nontradedfactor input requirements of the techniques

actually    in   use. Second, note that        only     the endowments of nontraded factors,

and only that      part   of the input matrix pertaining to nontraded factors, enter

into (146). Changes in the ownership of traded factors, or technological

changes which do not influence the use of nontraded factors, will produce no

effect. That is, (146) establishes a sense in which the pattern of induced

commodity trade, on average, cannot be reversed by such changes, even if                 the
trade vector x' changes. But such a reversal could result from a change in the

traded status of a factor,19 since such a change would add or subtract from the

matrix in (146).

 that comnrdity trade substitutes for the exchange of nontraded factors. A
similar relation can, surprisingly, be established between (induced) goods trade
and actual (induced) factor trade. Using (38b) in the same way that we have
used (38a) and (36) leads to

This says that a country on average exports those goods that nake relatively
intensive use of those factors that are imported in excess of endowment
trade. That is, induced trade in goods and the induced exchange of traded
factors are, in a sense, substitutes.2° Note that, again, the relevant concept
of factor intensity is the relative size of the direct traded—factor inputs of

the techniques actually used. Also, the part of the technolor pertaining to

nontraded factors does      not enter at all.
             Indeed,   under present assumptions, this basic substitution property

can be nEde xre exact. We first note that            the   well—known Travis—Vanek

theorem21    extends to encompass factor trade in a straightforward way.
Induced goods trade would enable the home country to consume the fraction g of
the    world output of each good. Factor price equalization then implies that

these consumed goods would embodr the services of the fraction g of the worldTs

stock of each factor, traded or nontraded.           Let x&    —C    Cx'   and xk   —C Cx'
                                                                    wp               rp
denote the nontraded—factor          and traded—factor content of induced goods trade.
Then

             xt =   1 — g(             +   L*)   and       = (k1 —   z)    — g(k1 +


by our generalized Travis—Vanek theorem. Thus

             xk = k  1
                         —   g(k
                                   1
                                       +   k*)   — z = zE — z =      —z
                                                                       I




That is, induced factor trade is equal to and opposite in sign to the traded

factor content. of induced goods trade.



6. Summary and Conclusions

             Factor price equalization for nontraded factors, with trade in goods

and some factors, results if the number of distinct sectors with positive value

added is at least as large as the number of nontraded factors and if each

country's endowment of nontraded factors is in the generalized diversification

cone. If there is no joint production, this requires the number of goods and

traded factors to be at least as large as the total number of factors, that is,

the number of international markets should be at least as large as the number of

factors. The introduction of nontraded goods does not change this result.

             Factor price equalization does not per se depend on the (rather

arbitrary) relative number of goods and factors but instead on the (less

arbitrary) relative number of international markets and factors.

           Next     we examined the 1rbczynski and Stolper—Samuelson theorems. The
usual   reciprocity      relations hold between the effect on output of factor input

variations    (at constant goods prices) and the effect on factor prices of goods
                                     —29—




price variations (at constant factor input), independently of whether some
factors are traded or not. We also derived additional reciprocity relations,
between the effect on traded factor inputs of nontraded factor input variations
(at constant goods and traded factor prices) and the effect on nontraded factor
prices of 'variations in traded factor prices (at constant nontraded factor
input).
             The "ngnitude" aspects of the Rybczynski and Stolper—Samuelson
theorems require the conditions for nontraded factor price equalization to hold
in full strength, that is, there should be at least as nny international
markets as factors.      Even without nontraded—factor price equalization, each
traded factor is an "eneny" to some nontraded factor, in that the nontraded
factor's price niist fall if the traded factor's price increases. By the
reciprocity relations, the demand for any traded factor is reduced by the
endowment of some single nontraded factor.
            We derived a general (directional) Ry-bczynski theorem: any change in
the endowment of nontraded factors will, at constant goods and traded factor
prices,    tend on the average to raise the nest the output of those goods, and to

reduce the ixst the usage of those traded factors, that   use   relatively

intensively those nontraded factors which increase the most. Here, "relative

intensity"    is defined from the sign pattern of the generalized Rybczynski nntrix
of the national product function. This result is extremely general in that it
allows    joint production, applies to arbitrary endowment changes, and is

independent of the relative numbers of goods, traded factors, and nontraded

factors.
                                        —30—




         If the conditions for factor price equalization hold, the above
theorem holds for relative intensity defined from the direct nontraded factor
input    coefficients.

             We also derived a (directional) Stolper—Samuelson theorem   that
a change in goods and traded—factor      prices on average increases the most the

prices   of those nontraded factors used relatively intensively by the goods and
traded factors whose prices increase the most.
            Finally, we looked at patterns of trade in goods and factors. The
principle of comparative advantage extends in straightforward fashion to
encompass factor trade. The price version of the Heckscher—Ohlin theorem is,
however,    rather   weak.   The quantity version fares better. Decomposing factor

trade   into "endowment trade" and "induced trade", with the former due to the
country's   endowment of traded factors not being proportional to world endowments

of   traded factors, induced factor trade is positively correlated with the
relatively abundant nontraded factors used relatively intensively. Decomposing
goods trade into "preference trade" and "induced trade", with the former
reflecting taste differences, we derived a quantity version of the
Heckscher—Qhljn theorem: the induced net export of goods and induced factor
trade are positively     correlated with a country's relative abundance of the
nontraded   factors used relatively intensively. This result is    again very

general, allows for joint production, arbitrary differences between home and

foreign endowments, and requires no restriction on dimensionality. Assuming

nontraded factor price equalization, the theorem holds for relative intensities

defined by direct nontraded factor input coefficients. We also demonstrated
                                     —31—




that   in general induced goods trade and induced factor trade are substitutes,
and we   established the precise sense in which this is so. The Travis—Vanek

theorem was extended to factor trade, under nontraded—factor price equalization.

            The basic theorems of international trade, suitably interpreted, hold

with both goods   trade and factor trade. In   particular, with at least as uany

distinct sectors as goods, the crucial dimensionality condition under which the

theorems hold in   their strong versions is that the number of international
markets    for goods and traded factors be at least as large as the total number      of

factors.    Hence, the crucial issue is not the relative number of goods and
factors    per se but rather the number of markets.   Of the   central proposition,
only   the price version of the Heckscher—Ohlin theorem fails to be essentially

preserved by this condition.

6.   The purpose of the restriction Wdv = 0            is   to prevent the endowment

     change   from disturbing deirands, at constant prices, by redistributing
     incomes across countries. But this does not, in fact, limit the
     applicability      of our analysis    because the      original position was itself

     arbitrary except for the requirement that endowments be proportional.

     Thus we could nake the initial international income distribution equal to

     whatever we wish.

      employed   in the usage of traded factors.
