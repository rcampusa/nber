                         THE DYNAMICS OF PART-TIME WORK


                                          ABSTRACT


       This paper uses 14 years of data from the P5W to explore dynamic labor supply choices
among adult women between full-time, part-time, or no labor market work. A variety of models
indicate that past choices should be important in predicting current labor supply choices. This
paper compares the effectiveness of several estimation sntegies which require more or less
historical information. The results indicate that past history in labor supply choices among adult
women is very important in predicting current labor supply; given the lack of such data in many
cases, the paper explores how much is lost when limited or no longitudinal information is
available. In addition, the paper explores the substantive question of the role of part-time work
in the labor market. Part-time workers are a very heterogeneous group; different part-time
workers are in the midst of very different labor supply patterns. Most women use pan-lime work
as a temporary alternative to full-time work or to being out of the labor market; few women use
it as a uansitional step into full-time employment. Simulations suggest the potential impact on
future labor supply of mandating that low-skilled women who are out of the labor market enter
part-time work.

              The Dynamics of Part-Time Work


                                Introduction

        The role of part-time work in the labor market is not well understood.

Some argue that part-time work creates difficulties for workers, pointing to the

lesser availability of health and pension plans among part-time workers, and

to the lower average wage levels on part-time jobs. Others argue that part-

time work provides labor market flexibility to workers who face other

demands on their time, allowing workers who are currently unable or

unwilling to work hill-time to maintain their labor market connections and

skills. Consistent with this last argument, there is increasing emphasis on

placing public assistance recipients into mandatory part-time work, on the

theory that this will aid their movement toward economic self-sufficiency by

leading to future full-time employment.

         This paper investigates dynamic labor supply choices among adult

women, with a particular focus on the role of part-time work. The primary

substantive question of the paper is "How does part-time work fit into long-

 term patterns of labor supply?" I am particularly interested in knowing
 whether pad-time work acts as an "intermediate state" that some women utilize



                                         1
as they move toward full-time work. This is important in evaluating the policy

claim that putting non-working women into part-time jobs will assist them in

moving toward full-time work. To answer this question, however, we need

to understand the dynamic patterns underlying the choice of all labor market

states utilized by adult women. Thus, this paper also provides an empirical

investigation of labor supply choices among women, with more careful

attention to the role of past history and of heterogeneity in preferences in

determining current and future labor market status.

         In addition to substantive questions about part-time work and female

labor supply, this paper provides useful information for empirical researchers

about the value of utilizing longitudinal data on past labor supply choices to

predict current labor supply. Because I have a particularly long panel (14

years), I can compare the usefulness of controlling more or less completely for

past labor market history, either by including more years of past history, or

by modelling sequential patterns of past choices more fully. I can also

compare lagged dependent variable estimates to random-effects estimates,

which characterize in a different way the population heterogeneity that is

 presumably reflected in past history and which can be implemented on cross-

 sectional data without any past labor supply information.

         The results of this analysis indicate that past labor market choices are

 critically important for understanding and predicting current labor market

 choices among women. This is particularly true for part-time workers; at any

                                        2
point in time, part-time work is used by women following very different

dynamic labor supply patterns. While part-time work is used by many women

for brief periods of time (highly correlated with changes in household

demographics), it is only infrequently used as a stepping stone from out of the

labor market into full-time work. It is much more likely to serve as a short-

term alternative to someone who is predominantly out of the labor market, or

to someone who is predominantly a full-time worker. There is also evidence

of substantial heterogeneity among adult women in their labor supply behavior.

Some women appear to be very stably attached to a particular labor market

state, while other women are more likely to be frequent movers between

multiple labor market states. Random effects models of this heterogeneity do

not fit the data as well as models that include lagged information on past labor

supply choices, but for some purposes random effects models may be almost

as useful as lagged dependent variable models.

Part-time Work and Dynamic Labor Supply: What Do We Know?

          Among the 19 percent of the workforce that worked part-time in

 1992, over two-thirds were women. Figure 1 indicates that a relatively

constant share of employed women have worked part-time over the past 25

years, between 2.5 to 30 percent of the female labor force.t Of course, the

                                              3
growth in female labor force involvement means that the number of part-time

female workers has expanded enormously. In contrast, there has been a slow

increase in the share of part-time workers among employed men over the past

25 years, from about 8 percent to over 12 percent of male workers, as figure

1 shows. Part-time work among men is also more cyclical than among

women, reflecting a greater amount of involuntary part-time work among

men 2

          Despite an ongoing public discussion about the problems and/or

advantages of part-time jobs, labor supply research that has focused on part-

time work is surprisingly scarce? A few studies have investigated part-time

work choices at a point in time, including Long and Jones (1981), Nakainura

and Nakamura (1983), and Blank (1988). These studies indicate that women

with younger children, more children, and higher levels of other income are

more likely to work part-time.4




    2lnvoluntary pad-time work occurs when workers indicate that they are working pad-time
even though they are available for and want MI-time work. In 1992, 40 percent of male part-
timers indicated they were involuntary, while only 25 percent or female part-timers sought nih-
time work.

    3For a review of the literature, see Blank (1990b).

     4A larger literature analyzes wage differentials between part-time and full-tune workers (for
instance, Nakamura and Nakamura, 1983, or Blank, 1990a). ml. research typically concludes
that equivalent part-time workers earn less than their 611-time counterparts, although the size of
this effect varies across occupations and depends upon the correction for selectivity into pan-time
work. Non-wage compensation differentials are even larger. Jones and Long (1979), Corcorsn
et *1. (1983) and Sundt (1987) control for the effect of past labor-market involvement on current
wages. At least in the short run, part-time wells appear correlated with lower wage growth.

                                                4
         A number of "counting exercises" have investigated the use of part-

time work in a more dynamic context. Moen (1985) includes simple spell

tabulations of part-time and full-time spells over short periods of time. Main

(1988) uses retrospective life histories of British women to display lifetime

patterns of part-time and full-time work.                 Blank (1989) estimates the

determinants of part-time spells using hazard rates.5 These studies tend to

show quite complex patterns of labor market movement among adult women

and indicate that part-time work is a transitory labor market state for most

women. But most of these studies are limited. Except for simple descriptive

analysis, we know very little about the women's choices over time between

part-time and full-time spells of work and spells out of the labor market.


                                              Ill
                        Models of Dynamic labor Supply

          The standard static labor supply model conceptualizes hours of work

as a function that can be written as:


(1)                 Hours = f(S, 'Y0 D, Z),


where S is a vector of human capital attributes of the individual that determine

 compensation and wages. Y0 is a vector of other income sources in the



    5Attempts to estimate the determinants of women's spells of labor market participation and
 nonparticipation (without explicit attention to the issue of pan-Lime work) include Heckman and
 Willis (1977) and Hill and O'Neill (1989).

                                               5
household and includes both the earnings of other individuals as well as non-

earned income. D represents a vector of labor market demand conditions that

may constrain labor market choices. Z is a vector of household composition

and demographic characteristics that is used to control for differences in the

opportunity cost of market work and for differences in preferences across

households. If labor market choices in each time period are independent of

choices in all past and future years, then estimation of (1) using current

information on all the variables will suffice.

           A variety of labor supply models, however, predict time dependence

in labor supply. First, human capital investment models suggest that current

 compensation will depend on past labor market experience, which in turn

 affects current labor supply. This implies that the human capital vector, S,

 should include information on accumulated experience. Second, there may be

 time dependence in labor supply options exclusive of compensation effects.

 If labor market involvement expands a woman's job networks and job search

 knowledge, she may be more likely to work if she has worked more in the

 past. A theory less accepted by economists but often raised in policy
 discussions about labor supply is that past labor market involvements may

 change women's preferences over time, so that the utility associated with work

 may increase (or decrease) over time as work experience changes.6


     6Eckstein and Wolpin (1989) make this point; their estimatca indicate that the disutility of
  employment increases with experience.

                                                6
        Third, there may be heterogeneity in women's preferences with regard

to how they evaluate their labor/leisure    choices. In the absence of direct

information on this phenomenon, past labor supply choices are often assumed

to reveal evidence about this heterogeneity. In this case, past patterns of labor

supply are important not because they directly affect current choices, but

because they are correlated with other less measurable variables that influence

both past and current choice. Fourth, life cycle models of labor supply predict

that labor supply choices will depend not only on past but also on future

expectations about labor supply and household demands. Since most data sets

contain no information on future expectations, these are typically proxied by

information on past behavior.

         The point of this paper is not to try to distinguish between these

competing explanations. Researchers who have estimated models designed to

highlight each of these particular theories of labor supply have found evidence

of time dependence. My interest is in conducting a less structural exploration

of dynamic labor supply choice, although like all empirical papers I will have

to make certain distributional and functional form assumptions.

         Rather than estimating the static model in (1), I want to estimate a

more general dynamic version.           Specifically, I want to estimate the

determinants of the sequential set of labor market choices, assuming these

choices are correlated over time, starting in period 1 when a woman first



                                        7
                                                                     be
enters the labor market and opts to work h1 hours. These choices can

characterized as a series of probabilistic equations that evolve over time:


(2a)        Prob(Hours1hi js1, Y01, D1, Z1)

(21,)       Prob(Hoursh2 h1, S2, Y02, 1)2, Z)

(2c)        Prob(Hours3h3 j h2, h1, S3, Y03, D3, Z3)

(2d)        Prob(Hours.rhT I h1, hT.2, ... , h1, ST, 'oT' 1)T 7-r)


where the choice of hours in each period is assumed to be the result of all past

optimizing choices among labor/leisurelhome production options of the
individuaL7 Unfortunately, unrestricted estimates of (2d) are impossible to

 compute when T becomes at all large, because of the difficulty of computing

 all of the necessary intercorrelations between periods.

             One way to solve this problem is to paraineterize the utility function

 in a way that assumes preferences are separable over time (Heckman and

 MaCurdy, 1980; MaCurdy, 1981; Browning, Deaton and Irish, 1985; and

 Altonji, l986). These models of life-cycle labor supply assume that people

 are able to fully adjust their labor supply in each time period. More recent

 work has estimated models that allow somewhat slower labor supply



    'Fertility decisions may also be endogcnous. I do not deal with this, other than to control for
 cumulative past fertility decisions through the vector Z that characterizes household constraints.

        'A somewhat different specification is provided by Eckatein and Wolpin (1989), although they
 also specitr and estimate a particular form of the utility function, which is then used to simulate
  dynamic labor supply choices.

                                                   8
adjustment, typically assuming some type of habit adjustment model (Hotz,

Kydland and Sedlacek, 1988; Bover, 1991). The focus of this work is to

measure the intertemporal adjustment in labor supply that occurs as wages

change along a given lifetime wage profile.

        I choose a different approach to study the dynamics of labor supply,

for a variety of reasons: First, the explicit parameterization of utility required

to produce estimable specifications in the research cited above makes it

difficult to determine how much the results depend on the parameterization.

I do not want to impose a particular model of intertemporal labor supply on

the data, but want to test for patterns of time dependence among labor supply

choices in as nonparametric a manner as possible. Second, such specifications

assume wages are not affected by labor supply choices, an assumption that the

existing literature on part-time wages clearly indicates is incorrect. This is

particularly important, given my interest in separating part-time and full-time

work choices. Third, these models are primarily designed to estimate the

elasticity of intertemporal male labor supply to wage variation over time,

which is not the main concern of this study. Household characteristics should

be far more important in determining women's labor supply decisions--

particularly their movements iii and out of part-time work‚Äîthan ire changes

in short-run wage levels. I therefore want a model that allows me to estimate

the effect of a wide range of time-varying variables on labor supply choice.



                                        9
          An alternative way to simplify the problem in (2) is to characterize the

continuous hours of work variable by a few discrete labor market states. I

will assume that a person's labor market involvement at any point in time can

be adequately summarized by three discrete categories: (1) Out of the labor

market (Hours = 0), referred to as OLM; (2) Part-time work (0 C Hours C

35), referred to as PT; and (3) Full-time work (Hours                    35), referred to as

FT. The result is a discrete version of (2) with three labor market states in

each period. This simplification is consistent with existing evidence on how

the labor market functions. First, firms explicitly define and advertise part-

time jobs, so that this distinction is recognized institutionally in the labor

market. Second, as noted above, there is a difference in the compensation of

equivalent workers in part-time and full-time jobs, which indicates that these

two categories embody real productivity differences.

           With a three-way characterization of labor supply choices, I can

investigate the dynamic model in (2) in three different ways. First, I can

focus on the determinants of the duration of time spent in any one labor

market state. This results in standard duration analysis of OLM, PT, and FT

 spells. The biggest drawback to this approach is that it does not allow me to

 estimate patterns of movement across multiple labor market states over time.9




                       one can estimate a hazard modcl with multiple types of spells allowing for a
 11111 set of intercorrelations between the spells, but this sort of estimation is beyond current

 econometric abilities.


                                                10
Therefore I also investigate a second approach, which ignores the issue of

spells and estimates the discrete version of (2) in each time period, controlling

for past labor market history. l'his means estimating a three-way multinomial

logit of the choice between labor market states, including dummy variables to

represent the full range of (discrete) labor market choices made in past

periods. The third approach is to use a three-way multinomiat logit to

estimate current labor supply choices, but rather than including explicit

information on past labor market history to instead characterize the
heterogeneity across individuals with random effects.          (ills would be

particularly consistent with the third model of time dependence described

above, where past history merely proxies for underlying stable differences in

preferences.) Because this approach requires only cross-sectional data to

implement, it is interesting to compare the goodness of fit properties between

the lagged dependent variable estimates and the random effects estimates. All

three of these models are developed in more detail below.


                                        Iv
                                   The Data

         The data used in this paper are from the Panel Study of Income

 Dynamics (PSID) from 1976 to 1989. Data prior to 1976 are not usable for

 my purposes, since labor supply information on wives was not available before

 this year. This provides 14 years of information. Included In my sample are



                                        11
all women between the ages of 18 and 50 in 1976, who are spouses or family

heads in all 14 years.'¬∞ Thus, I have attempted to select a sample of women

who, for the entire time period, are in a position to make labor supply choices.

Explicitly omitted are women who are in school or living with their parents

during any of these years, or women who are old enough to have reached the

usual retirement age.         I also omit those persons who were part of the

oversample of low-income families in the PSID. There are 1463 women who

meet these criteria, which provides 20,482 observations (1463 times 14 years).

Where I make comparisons to men, they are sampled in an identical way.

          Throughout this paper, a part-time worker is someone who reports

working less than 35 hours per week on her longest job last year. This

ignores differences in annual weeks of work among women. The alternative

 is use a full-time definition based on annual hours of work (such as 1680 hours

 per year‚Äî35 hours per week times 48 weeks per year.) This would seriously

 overestimate the incidence of part-time work, however. For most of these

 years I only have information on main job last year." Any full-time worker

 who enters or leaves the labor market during the middle of the year will show

 an annual hours figure that will look like pan-time work, even though it

actually reflects the end (beginning) of a spell of non-work and the beginning

(end) of a spell of full-time work.

          Figure 2 presents the range of labor supply choices among both men

and women over these 14 years. Plotted is the cumulative share of the

population as hours of work increase, based on data from the entire 14 year

period. The solid line is based on the adult women sample described above

and the dashed line shows hours choices among an equivalent sample of adult

men. As the graph shows, substantially more women are out of the labor

force (at zero hours), and their cumulative share between 0 and 40 hours rises

more rapidly than men's. Both groups show a large spike at 40 hours. The

number of men working over 40 hours is much higher, and men's cumulative

share rises quickly above 40 hours, while women's is more flat. Few women

or men work less than 20 hours per week. An average, 28 percent of the

women in our sample are out of the labor market at any point in time during

these years, another 23 percent are working part-time, and 51 percent are




    "Experimentation with an annual hours of work definition of 'part-time confirms this

be to define five labor market states instead of three: 012.1, Part-time/Pan-year, Part-time/Full-

working full-time. In contrast, only 3 percent of the men are out of the labor

market, 4 percent work part-time and 93 percent work full-time.'2

                    Observed Transitions and Labor Supply
                          Patterns in the Raw Data

          Because     of the scarcity of information on dynamic labor supply

choices, it is interesting to start by looking at simple tabulations of the patterns

of labor market change in the raw data. Table 1 presents the avenge

transition matrix for adult women and men between the three labor market

states over the 14-year period. Table 1 indicates that a substantial number of

women remain in the same labor market state over any two-year period: 79

percent of the sample lies on the diagonal of the transition matrix. Much

greater stability is present among full-time and OLM women than among ‚Äî

time women, however. While 86 percent of the women who work full-time

 in year t are observed to work full-time in year ti-I; only 66 percent of the

 part-timers in year t will remain part-time workers in year t+ 1. Twenty

 percent of part-time workers will move up to full-time work, and 14 percent

 will move out of the labor market. Thus, table 1 indicates that part-time work

 share of men who arc out of the labor force is quite low compared to weekly labor force
 participaLion data, since a person would have to be out of the labor market all year in order to be
 placed in this category.

                                                 14
is clearly a more transitional category than either of the other two labor market

states.

          While the adult women's transition matrix looks relatively stable, the

men's transition matrix is extremely stable. Ninety-four percent of the men

stay in the same labor market state (are on the diagonal) over a two-year

period, mostly in full-time work. Of those working part-time, over half will

be in full-time work in the next year.

          Table 1 emphasizes the differences between the male and female labor

force and indicates that dynamic labor supply estimates for men are of much

less interest than for women. Most men work full-time at some point during

the year. Women show much greater variance in their labor supply choices,

both at a point in time and in their movements over time.

          Given an interest in the dynamic role of part-time work in women's

labor supply choices, it is interesting to look at a three-year transition matrix,

to see whether any frequent patterns of movement between the OLM, PT and

FT categories occur. Table 2 presents the three-year transition matrix for

adult women, showing the probability of being in one of the three labor market

states in year t+2, conditional upon all possible patterns in years t and t+1.

          Table 2 indicates that over a three-year period 66 percent of women

stay in the same labor market state for all three yeaa The transitional nature

of part-time work is even more apparent in table 2. Among all women who

worked part-time in year t, 66 percent were still in part-time work after 1

                                         15
year, while only 49 percent (11.4 percent out of 23.3 percent) are still there

after 2 years. Those who move between labor market states are distributed

widely throughout all the cells in the matrix.

           Table 3 presents information on aggregate labor supply patterns over

the entire 14-year period. For comparison purposes, table 3 also shows the

equivalent patterns among adult men (who one would expect to show more

stable patterns than adult women), and among all adult women in my sample

who are married 10 or more of the 14 years (who one would expect to show

less stable patterns if married women are more prone to changing labor market

status).

           With 14 years of data and 3 labor market states, there are

(approximately 4.8 million) possible data patterns. Among the 1463 women

in the sample, I observe only 931 of these patterns, with a substantial minority

of the women located in only a few patterns. Twenty-two percent of all adult

women never change labor market states over a 14 year period, as part 1 of

table 3 indicates. The bulk of these are full-time workers. Only 1 percent of

the sample is permanently attached to part-time work. In comparison, 68

percent of the men remain in one labor market state for 14 years, almost all

of them working full-time.

           Part2oftable3 indicatesthatoverhalfofthewomenareinthesame

indicates, 64 percent of the women have spent at least one year out of the

labor market, 69 percent have worked part-time at least one year, and 85

percent have worked full-time at least one year. A substantial minority of

women seem to be 'movers"‚Äî40 percent have spent time in all three labor

market states over the 14 year period. Interestingly, as column 3 indicates,

there are not large differences between those women who are stably married

over this period and all women.

         The last two parts of table 3 investigate the prevalence of any sort of

"stepping-stone" pattern between OLM, PT and FT moves. Part 6 tabulates

the share of women who ever show a pattern of OLM to PT to FT work

(regardless of the number of years spent in each state). Part 7 tabulates the

reverse stepping stone pattern, moving from FT to PT to OLM. The results

indicate that few women in part-time work are in a transitional state between

OLM and full-time employment.'3 The majority of part-time workers enter

part-time work from a full-time spell and return to full-time work, or they

enter pad-time work from OLM and return to OLM. This suggests that part-

time work is used as a temporary alternative to another (more permanent)

labor market state, not as a transitional state.

         The results in tables      1   through 3 confirm that women show a great

deal of movement in their labor supply choices over time. Much more so than



   It is possible that a larger proportion of women work pad-time for a month or two before
finding MI-time work and that higher frequency data would show more stcppiug stone" patterns.

                                             17
among men, there are frequent changes in labor supply among many women,

implying that dynamic analysis of labor supply decisions may be more

interesting for women than for men. Although women appear to be a

heterogeneous group,        a    substantial minority seem stably attached to a

particular labor market state. Part-time work is clearly a more short-term and

transitional state than OLM or full-time work, but it is used less as a

transitional state into or out of the labor market than as an alternative to either

OLM or full-time work.

                   Estimating the Determinants of Spells in
                            a Labor Market State


A.         Competing R&/c Duration Models of 0111,                 PT, and FT Spells

          An obvious way to investigate dynamic labor market movements is to

focus on the observed spells in part-time and full-time work and out of the

labor market.        This section introduces a competing risk multiple-spell

estimation model that I will use to investigate both what moves women into

spells of part-time work from full-time work or OLM, as well as the

determinants of the length of part-time spells. The analysis of time-dependent

data is by now relatively standard and does not require much introduction.'4




     "For a discussion of duration models, sec Lancaster (1990).

                                              18
         Let F(t,Xj3) be the cumulative distribution function of time spent in

part-time work, with f(t,Xj3) as its related density function. X1 represents the

vector of independent variables [S1, Ym, D, Z,J, with fi as the vector of related

coefficients. One can characterize the probability of leaving pad-time work

at any point in time as the hazard rate, h(t,Xj3), which is the probability that

a spell ends in period t, given that it lasted to t-1. For any completed spell of

part-time work, the likelihood that an individual is observed to work part-time

from time 0 to time t is simply f(t,X,P).

          The probability that an individual spends a particular amount of time

in any labor market state can be straightforwardly estimated, once a hazard

function is chosen. A semi-parametric hazard, where the data essentially

determines the shape of the hazard function in each period, is often
preferred.'5 Time-vaqing covariates (such as number of children, household

non-earned income, etc.), can be readily included in the estimation, as can any

number of right-censored spells.

           A few particular issues are important in implementing spell duration

 estimates with this data. First, because of the lack of any retrospective

 information, I have to omit all left-censored spells. While this is a standard

 procedure, it is particularly worrisome in this case, because the most stable




     Dcpending on the data, freeing up the hazard in each period is not alwayl possible. Flinn
 and Beckman (1982), for instance, auggeat a particularly flexible form of the lime variable. The
 approach used here is similar to that suggested in Meyer (1988).

                                                19
individuals‚Äîthose who remain working Mi-time or part-time, or who are out

of the labor market in all observed years‚Äîare all left-censored. By throwing

these individuals out, I may be throwing out a very important part of my

sample.     Concern about this issue is one reason I turn to alternative

explorations of the data in the next section.

          Second, I am particularly interested in estimating competing risk

models of labor force movement. Ending a spell of part-time work to move

out of the labor market is almost surely a very different type of spell ending

than is moving into MI-time work. In addition, to the extent that I want to

estimate the determinants of the start of part-time spells, I need to distinguish

between Mi-time and OLM spells that end in pad-time work and those that

end in other activity. Competing risk models can be implemented in a

straightforward manner)6 I simply assume that at any point in time, an

individual in labor market state j is "at risk' of ending a spell in the labor

market by either moving to labor market state k or by moving to labor market

state I. Each of these moves has an underlying hnard rate, hk(t,Xt, (3k) and

h1(t,X1, P,). The aggregate haard of leaving labor market state j can be

characterized as a simple additive function:


(3)       h(tX, (3) = hk(t,Xt, (3& + h1(t,x, fiji).


     6Fora discussion of the iuun involved in estimating competing risk models, see the above
rtferences on duration analysis, as well as Heskman and Honore (1989), Han and Hausman
(1990), and Narendranathan and Stewart (1991).

                                            20
With only minor complications, this additive hazard can be readily estimated.

         Third, I observe a substantial number of individuals who experience

multiple spells in the same labor market state over 14 years. This is

particularly true of spells of part-time work, which tend to be of short

duration. The best way to work with data which contain multiple spells is to

include information on past labor market spells in the estimation (Honore,

1991).      For Stance, I can include information on the type of spell
immediately preceding the current one. In a competing risk model for part-

time spells, including a control variable for whether the prior spell was an

OLM spell lets me determine whether people who move into part-time work

from out of the labor market are more likely to leave the labor market again

or to move on to full-time work. I can also include information on the

observed spell number, on the length of previous spells in the same labor

market state, and on the length of time since a previous spell was last

observed.

         Given the frequency of multiple spells in the data, including these

multiple spells in the estimation procedure is probably quite important to the

analysis. The cost of including multiple spells, however, is that it makes

traditional adjustments for population heterogeneity impossible to carry out.

Once characteristics on past spells are included in the estimation, the

assumptions needed to estimate standard heterogeneity models no longer hold

(Honore, 1991).       This is not necessarily a major concern, however.

                                     21
Heterogeneity adjustments try to control for unmeasured population

differences; including information on past labor market choices should also

control for these differences.     In the following section, I control for

heterogeneity in several alternative ways.


B.      Estimation Results

        Table 4 summarizes the spell data in my sample. I observe up to five

spells of OLM and part-time work over 14 years, although the higher-sequence

spells tend to bequite short. First observed spells in full-time work average

close to 4 years, out of the labor market spells average 3.2 years, and part-

time spells average only 2.6 years, again indicating the more transitory nature

of part-time work. Second spells in all labor market states avenge between

2 and 3 years. When the sample is limited to non-censored spells, the spell

lengths are shorter. Table 4 indicates that there are a substantial number of

second and higher spells in this data, making the use of multiple-spell

estimation techniques particularly attractive.

         Table 5 presents the results of three multiple-spell competing risk

estimates, as described above. The first two columns of table S present the

estimates for spells out of the labor market. The third and fourth columns

present the estimates for spells of part-time work, and the last two columns

present the estimates spells of full-time work. Hazard rates are estima'4

semiparametrically, with dummy variables included for each time period.'7

Positive coefficients in table 5 indicate that higher values of a variable make

it more likely that a current spell type will end in an exit to the indicated labor

market state. Thus, the coefficients in row one imply that older workers are

likely to have longer OLM spells because they are less likely to terminate a

spell OLM and move into either full-time or part-time work, although the

probability of moving into full-time work is lower. Older workers in part-time

spells are also less likely to terminate their spell and move into full-time work,

but are more likely to move out of the labor market.

          The first group of variables in table 5            presents    the coefficients on

personal and household characteristics from these three competing risk models.

A few results stand out. First, older women are less likely to end a spell out

of the labor market or to move into full-time work. Second, black women are

more likely to move into MI-time work. Third, less educated women are

more likely to terminate spells of full- or pan-time work and leave the labor

market. Fourth, an increase in the total number of children increases the

propensity of a woman to move into full- or part-time work, while an increase

in the number of preschoolers decreases the propensity to move into full-time

work and increases the propensity to leave the labor market. Part-time spells

are little affected by the number of children but strongly affected by the

number of preschoolers. Fifth, women with higher other income in their

family are less likely to become full-time workers. Sixth, local unemployment

rates increase the length and probability of OLM spells, but have little effect

on part-time or full-time spells.

          The second group of variables in table 5 controls for previous spells.

These variables are very significant for all types of spells, and underscore the

importance of past history on current spell duration. The length and type of

spell ending is strongly influenced by the previous spell type. For instance,

women who enter a part-time spell from out of the labor market are much

more likely to leave the labor market again than move into full-time work.

Women who enter a part-time spell from full-time work are much more likely

to return to hill-time work than to move out of the labor market. These

results are consistent with the data tabulations above, which indiested that few

people use part-time work as a stepping stone between OLM and full-time

employment.

          The observed spell number has weaker effects on spell lengths)8

Higher number spells of OLM or part-time work (which tend to be shorter

spells) are less likely to end in hill-time work. To the extent that full-time




    Thc inclusion of a    variable to control for observed spell number may be somewhat
problematic, since the observed first spell after 1976 may not be the flat spell of the woman in
this type of work. The omission of this variable has little effect on other covariates.

work is a more stable category for many women, this may reflect the fact that

women who have higher sequence spells in this data are frequent movers, and

thus more likely to be in OLM or part-time spells. 1920

          Figure 3 plots the hazard rates estimated in table S for each of the

three competing risk models for a specific woman.21 Because the woman is

assume to have a preschooler, she has a high (41 percent) probability of

leaving a full-time spell after one year (the sum of the two hazard functions

among full-time workers), but this declines steeply over time. In contrast, if

this woman work part-time the probability of ending her spell is 47 percent in

the first year and remains high over time. After 5 years, almost all part-time

workers have exited part-time work. If this woman is out of the labor market,

she has a 47 percent chance of going to work after one year. The probability

that this woman will enter part-time work from out of the labor market is

everywhere higher than the probability that she will move into full-time work.




    '% other estimates (not shown here), based only on second and higher spells. I included
controls for the length of the previous spell in the same labor market state and the length ofCame
since that spell occurred. Both of these variables were highly significant. The longer a previous
spell and the more recent that spell, the more likely that the current spell will continue.

     20Other specifications included occupational controls and controls for changes In variables as
well as their level values. While sonw of these had significant coefficients, their inclusion bad

        These hazard rates underscore the differences between part-time and

full-time workers and, together with the results of table 5, indicate the

importance of looking at women's labor supply choices in a dynamic context.

Spells of either OLM, part-time, or full-time work are strongly influenced both

by the nature of the previous spell as well as by the type of spell exit that

occurs (the use of a competing risk model significantly increases the
explanatory power of the model). In addition, these hazard models indicate

the importance of personal, household, and environmental variables in

determining the length and nature of labor market spells. Part-time workers,

in particular, are a very heterogeneous group, at risk of either increasing or

decreasing their labor market efforts. The differential effects of control

variables in influencing the movement into and out of part-time work indicates

that, depending on their personal and environmental characteristics, women

observed working pan-time in any particular period may be in the midst of

very different routes through the labor market.

                   Modelling a Complete Set of Labor
                      Market Patterns Over lime

        While the duration estimates just discussed provide useful information

about women's dynamic movements through the labor market, they have at

least two problems. First, they focus only on spells in a single labor market

state. Totheextentthatmyprimary interestisinthefuilpatternoflabor

                                      26
market behavior over 14 years, the duration models do not estimate this. In

fact, as noted, those patterns that are most striking‚Äîpersons who remain in the

same labor market state for the entire 14-year period‚Äîmust be thrown out of

the data as left-censored spells. Second, these duration estimates may not fully

account for heterogeneity across women. Although two limited measures of

spell count and past spell type are included in the estimates, one might believe

that past patterns of labor involvement have a much greater impact on current

choices than these duration models allow. For both of these reasons, this

section presents an alternative way to analyze women's movement through the

labor market.


A.      Multinomial Logit Lagged Dependent Variable ModeLr

        I am interested in developing a technique that will measure the

probability that a woman follows any sequence of labor market choices over

time. The dynamic model of labor supply in (2) provides a starting point for

this analysis. In this section I estimate a simplified version of (2) which

assumes that the probability an individual is observed in any particular labor

market state can be denoted as


(4)     Prob(LMS1=L) = f(X, g(LMS1, LMSk2, ... LMS.j)) 1=1, 2, 3


where LMS1 is a discrete variable indicating labor market state that takes on




                                      27
threevalues I= lifHoursO(OLM)
                I=2ifO<Hourst<35(PT)
        and =3ifHours35(FF).

X is the vector of personal, household, and economic environment variables

discussed above and g(.) is a function that describes past labor market patterns.

Written this way, the probability of observing an individual in any particular

labor market state can be estimated as a multinomial logit, with controls for

the labor market patterns observed in past periods. For example, this implies

that the probability a person is of out of the labor market in time period t can

be written as


                                        exp(Xfl1 +   L171)
(5)      Prob(LMS    1)       1 +exp(x/31 + Ly1) + exp(xfl2 + L,y,)


where L is the vector of dummy variables representing ‚Äî labor market

history. j3 and $2    are   coefficient vectors that indicate the effect of the X

variables on OLM and part-time work, respectively. y and 72 describe the

effects of past labor market patterns on the probability of choosing OLM or

part-time work, respectively. Full-time work is the residual category. Using

the standard multinomial logit format, equivalent equations can be written for

the probability of being in part-time and in full-time work.




                                         28
           The characterization of labor market history is important in this

model. I will compare results from three different lag specificatio&2

           (1) Full Lag Specification:         If there are j lag periods in the model,
there arej3 potential patterns of history that an individual could follow, given

three different labor market states. A separate dummy variable specifying

each of these possible patterns provides the fullest possible set of controls for

past labor market patterns. Of course, this specification is only feasible at

relatively low levels of j.

          (2) Simple Lag Spec jflcation: One of the simplest specifications for

j lag periods is to include a dummy variable for each independent labor market

stateineachpastyear,whichresultsin2jlagparameters. Foreach lag
period, this means including a dummy variable that controls for whether an

individual was OLM and a dummy variable that controls for whether an

individual was a part-time worker (full-time work status can always be derived

from these two dummy variables). This specification assumes that the effect

of each past labor market choice is independent of the pattern of choices that

precede or follow it, so that multiple years in one state of the labor market

have a simple. additive effect on current labor market choices.




    None of these lag stnictures interact past labor market choices with the other control
variables, due to conitnints on the number of parameters I can feasibly estimate. For instance,
the effect of put education on the probability of working full-time may be different for someone
who has been out of the labor market for the put three years.

                                              29
        (3) Compla Lag Spec jflcation: An alternative between the full and
the simple lag specification is to control for the labor market state at each past

point in time (the simple specification) as well as past patterns over time.

Withj lag periods, one can specifr a set of 2(2j-1) + (j-2) dummy variables that

completely distinguishes all possible past patterns, but imposes some adding

up constraints, In particular, this means including all of the 2j dummies from

the simple specification, as well as controlling for the total number of times

that each state was observed over the pastj periods (2(j-1)+(j-2) independent

dummies). For example, with three lags, the complex lag specification would

include 11 dummy variables:


                OLM..1 =   if person OLM in period t-1, 0 otherwise;
                            1
                OLM.2 = 1 if person OLM in period t-2, 0 otherwise;
                OLM.3 = 1 if person OLM in period t-3, 0 otherwise;
                PT =   1 if person PT in period t-1, 0 otherwise;

                fl= 1 ifpersonPT inperiodt-2,Ootherwise;
                PT= 1 ifpersonPT inperiodt-3,Oothezwise;
                2OLM =  ifOLM., = 1 intwoofthreepastperiods;
                            1

                3OLM= lifOLMbJ= linthreeofthreepastperiods;
                2FF =lifPT=1intwoofthreepastperiods;
                3FF = 1ifPT1= linthreeofthreepastperiods;
                2FT =     1ifFT.=       lintwoofthreepastperiods.

These 11 dummy variables can be used to uniquely characterize every one of

the 27 possible ‚Äî labor market states within a three period lag structure.




                                       30
 B.      Eatimation Results

         Table 6 presents estimates of labor force choices, using two quite

 different lag specifications. Columns 1 and 2 present the results from a

 multhomial logit model with three lag periods, using a complex lag

specification (11 lag parameters in each branch of the logit.) It will become

clear below why I elect to focus particularly on this 3-lag structure. For

comparison, columns 3 and 4 choose a very different lag structure, which uses

information from the largest possible number of lags (13). As one adds lag

periods, the number of usable observations shrinks. Thus, with 13 lags, I can

use only the 1463 observations on labor market choices in 1989, while with

3 lags I can use 16,093 observations, using information from 11 years of labor

market choices for each person. By necessity with this smaller number of

observations, I use the simple lag specification for the 13-lag model. Thus,

between these two models, we can see the trade-off between more lags (but a

simpler lag structure and fewer observations) versus fewer lags (but more
observations and a more complex lag structure.)

        Many of the coefficients on the explanatory variables are similar in

sign and magnitude between the first two and second two columns in table 6,

although the coefficients estimated from the 3-lag model are much more

significant. In both cases, older persons with less education, fewer total

children, more preschoolers, more non-earned income, and in areas with

higher unemployment rates are more likely to be out of the labor market than

                                    31
working full-time (the omitS category). Compared to full-time workers,

part-timers are less likely to be black, and more likely to be older, married,

and have more preschoolers.

        Table 7 simulates the estimated effect of past labor market history on

current labor market choices, using the coefficients from the 3-lag model

estimated in columns 1 and 2 of table 6. Using a typical" woman (age 25,

white, high school education, married, 2 children, 1 preschooler, and $25,000

in non-earned income, with a county unemployment rate of 6.9 percent), the

table simulates the probability that this women is currently out of the labor

market, or working part-time or full-time, given all possible patterns of labor

force involvement over the last three years.

        Note three things in table 7. First, the most recent year's history is

most important in determining current labor force status. For instance, women

who were out of the labor market in the most recent past year (row 1 and

rows 4-11) have over a 50 percent probability of being out of the labor market

next year. Second, those persons with stable ‚Äî labor market histories (rows

1-3) are strikingly more likely to continue in the same labor market state than

even persons who have been in the same labor market state for the past 2

years (rows 4-5, 12-13, and 20-21). Third, in these estimates as in the simple

tabulations, pad-time work is a much more transitory state than OLM or full-

time work.



                                      32
          The conclusion from table 7 is that time dependence in labor supply

choices   among adult women appears to be extremely strong, even after

controlling for the standard set of household, skill, and economic fictors.

Further tests of the extent and nature of this time dependence are provided in

table 8. Table 8 shows the likelihood fimction values that result from a series

of increasingly more complex lag specifications, testing two different
hypotheses about the importance of time dependence on labor supply choices.

Part 1 of table 8 looks at the effect of controlling for longer lag periods, while

part 2 looks at the effect of controlling more fully for all possible lag patterns

within a given lag period.

          Part 1 presents the log likelihood values and the related likelihood

ratio tests that result as an increasing number of lag periods are included in the

data set. For instance, the first row of part I indicates that going froma 7-

period lag structure (using the complex lag model described above, with 32 lag

parameters in each logit branch) to an 8 period lag structure‚Äîimplemented on

the same data‚Äîresults in no significant increase in the likelihood function.

This is true for 8 lags versus 7 lags, as well as for 7 lags versus 6 lags.

Below 6 lags, however, dropping a lag period results in significantly worse

explanatory value, particularly when moving from 3 to 2 lags or from 2 to 1

lags, as measured by the likelihood ratio test. This suggests that a great deal

of past labor supply information is necessary (at least 6 years) before further

past lag periods become unimportant in explaining current labor supply.

                                       33
         Part 2 of table 8 investigates the effect of controlling more completely

for all past lag patterns, given a preset lag length. For models that include

from 2 to 8 lags, the simple model (which assumes the effect of past labor

market choices are additive over time) fits the data significantly worse than the

complex model, which also includes controls for multiplicative effects. In

turn, the complex model fits less well than the full interactive model for

models that include 2 to 4 lags? This section indicates that there is no

'simple" specification of past lag patterns that fully captures their effects.

Rather, increasingly complex models that control for as many past patterns as

possible fit the data increasingly better.

         The short summary of table 8 is that there does notappear to be any

"short-cut" to dealing with time dependence in labor supply estimation, at least

among adult women. The more lag periods (up to at least 6 years), and the

more complex the lag specification, the better the model fits the data. The

time dependence in labor supply is both 'deep" (in the sense that past labor

supply choices continues to affect current choices for many years), and 'wide"

(in the sense that all unique past patterns of labor supply choices appear to

affect current choices; past patterns cannot be conveniently grouped together

into only a few significant patterns.)




    t3Tbe zU model, with controls for every possible past tag pattern, cannot be readily
implemented for more than 4 lags.


                                          34
           Taken together, the results in tables 7 and 8 also indicate that past

labor market histories are crucially important in determining current labor

market location for adult women. The coefficients on these past histories are

large and significant in most cases. Simply observing information from a

current labor market spell provides little predictive information about next

year's labor market choices since different past labor market histories have

such a strong effect on future choices. I return to this point below.

           With respect to part-time work, tables 6 and 7 confirm many of the

results noted above. The use of part-time work is heavily affected by personal

and household characteristics. Even after controlling for these, however, part-

time work remains a labor market state which women are more likely to leave.

Among other things, this implies that the use of part-time work is harder to

predict than are other labor market choices. Past use of part-time work is less

likely to lead to future part-time work than are other types of labor market

choices.


C.         Multinomial Logit Random Effects Mo4eLc

           As noted above, one reason to include past lag histories in labor

supply models is because they may reflect endogenous differences in women's

preferences that create heterogeneous choices.         l'his suggests that an

alternative to a multinomial logit model of labor supply with lagged dependent

variables is a multinomial logit model that controls for heterogeneity in the


                                       35
population through random effectsP' In addition, ills worth noting that a

random effects model may be the only feasible model when only cross-

sectional data on labor supply are available. In this case, one interpretation

of heterogeneity adjustments is that they are a way of controlling for the

unmeasured (in cross-sectional data) differences in past labor market histories.

          Assume there are two types of women, not fully accounted for by the

control variables in these logit equations. A standard way of characterizing

heterogeneity is assume that the constant term in the multinomial logit

estimates differs across heterogeneous groups of individuals. The result is that

the probability of being out of the labor market now becomes the more

complicated expression:



                                                     exp(XJ31 + C11)
                                                                                             +
                                        1    + exp(X31 + C11) + exp(Xfl2 +            C12)

                                         1   + exp(Xfl1 + C22) + exp(Xfl2 +            C)




    Both controlling for heterogeneity and including tagged dependent variables results in biased
estimates of the heterogeneity, for the same reason that it is not appropriate to include
heterogeneity corrections in duration models with information on past wells. The assumptions
under which random effects models produce unbiased estimates do not hold in the presence of
lagged dependent variables.

person? while C11, C12,          C, and C are the random effects parameters
associated with being a type 1 or type 2 person in each branch of the logit.

          In estimating this model, there is one additional complication. I have

14 observations on each person. In estimating the likelihood function for each

individual, I need to take account of the fact that the probability of being a

type 1 person is applied similarly to all 14 data periods. This implies that the

likelihood function for any individual is maximized by estimating

z is the set of all time periods during which this person is out of the labor

market; p is the set of all time periods during which this person works part-

time and f is the set of aLl time periods during which this person works lull-

time. Maximizing the log of this likelihood function across all individuals in



   5This form of heterogeneity is admittedly quite arbicary. I experimented with interacting the
control variable coefficients and the random effects, but had problems making this more complex
model converge.

the sample results in estimates for the   vectors fl, fl2 for the random effects

terms C11, C12, C, C, and for the probability parameter, P. In the results
below I estimate three random effects rather than two, which is a
straightforward extension of the above model.


D.      Estimation Results from Random Effects Logit

         Columns 5 and 6 of table 6 presents the results from maximizing the

log of a likelihood function similar to (7) for all individuals, but with three

rather than two random effects. The coefficients indicate the effect of the

relevant variable relative to the omitted (full-time) category. Thus, the first

row indicates that older workers are more likely to be found out of the labor

market or in pad-time work, although the likelihood of being out of the labor

market is higher than the likelihood of being in pad-time work.

        Compared to the estimated coefficients on the two lagged dependent

variables models, shown in columns 1 through 4 of table 6, the random effects

coefficients are different in a number of cases, in terms of size and
significance. Lower education levels and more preschool children have

particularly strong effects in keeping women out of the labor market in the

random effects model.

        Table 9 summarizes these estimates by simulating the probability of

being in each labor market state for a typical woman of either type 1, 2, or 3,

using the coefficients reported in columns 5 and 6 of table 6. Taking the same


                                      38
 set of base personal and household characteristics as were used in the

 simulation in table 7, table 9 shows the differences in labor market choices

 predicted by the random effect model for women of each of the three types.

         The probability of being a type 1 worker is estimated at 27 percent.

Type 1 workers are mobile across all three labor market states, and have a

significant probability of working part-time, working full-time or being out of

the labor market. In contrast, type 2 workers have a very high probability of

being out of the labor market (79 percent in the simulation in table 9) with less

chance of working either part-time or full-time. The probability of being a

type 2 worker is 30 percent. Finally, type 3 workers are almost always found

working hill-time. The probability of being a type 3 worker is estimated at

43 percent.

        The broad characterization coming out of this random effects model

is that there are three distinct labor market types: 'workers," who typically

work hill-time; non-workers," who are typically out of the labor market; and

'movers' who migrate between all three of these states. There is a substantial

probability mass associated with each of these three types. These results

clearly suggest that some number of women appear permanently attached to




                                      39
full-time work, and some appear permanently out of the labor force. But a

significant number (27 percent) are more mobile


E.       How Do These Models Compare?

         The three models estimated in table 6 are based on three different

conceptions of how to characterize female labor force choices. The 3-lag

model assumes that a complex but relatively short lag specification is adequate,

the 13-lag models opts for many lag periods but a simple lag specification,

while the random-effects model ignores past labor market history and attempts

to estimate the unmeasured heterogeneity in labor supply choices among

women at any       point in time. This section compares the advantages and

disadvantages of each of these models.

          Table 10 presents three different measures of the goodness of fit

among these three models, based on a comparison of the actual data for 14.63

women in 1989 (the last year of my sample) versus the estimated data from

each of the three models for this year. Part 1 compares the aggregate

predicted weight in each labor market category. In the actual data in 1989, 24

percent of the women are out of the labor market, 23 percent work part-time,

and 52 percent work full-time. Taking the average predicted probabilities for


    26Although there are problems with interpreting the coefficients as noted above, I also
estimated a multinomial 141 model with both three years of tag information and with two random
effects, allowing all of the lag parameters to vary in the random effects. This model indicates that
even after control1i for three years of lags, some heterogeneity appears to remain in the data.
In general, the two random effects indicate a group of stayers" who remain in the same labor
market state over time, and mover? who change labor market states frequenfly.


                                                40
each woman in the sample for each labor market state indicates that the 3-lag

model predicts almost identical aggregate probability weights, while the 13-lag

model is exactly right (to 1 decimal place.) The random effects model comes

in third, but doesn't do too badly. A chi-squared test comparing each of these

three model predictions to the actual data indicates that the null hypothesis that

the predicted numbers are identical to the actual numbers can_not be rejected

at a 10 percent level of significance for any of the three models.

         In contrast to predicting the aggregate probability in each category,

part 2 of table 10 compares how well each model predicts labor supply choices

for each woman in the sample. The numbers indicate how many cases are

predicted accurately by the model for each labor market category, where

 accuracy" is defined as a predicted probability of 67 percent or greater that

the woman will be in the labor market state where she is actually found.

Among the 1463 observations, the 13-lag model accurately predicts the labor

supply choices of 78 percent of the sample, while the 3-lag model is correct

74 percent of the time. The random effects model is substantially worse, with

only 7 percent of the observations correctly predicted. This is because the

random effects model assigns eveiy woman some probability of being either

type 1, type 2, or type 3. The result is that the predicted probabilities for each

woman are a mix of the predicted types. While its aggregate probability

weights are not too far off, the individual predictive ability of this model is



                                       41
extremely bad.        In all three models, the probability that these individual

predictions are identical to the null hypotheses can be rejected with 99 percent

confidence. The chi-squared statistic for the random effects model is

particularly large.

         Finally, past 3 of table 10 does a more standard goodness of fit test,

based   on Heckman's (1984) suggested procedure for comparing a set of

estimated sample values to a set of actual observations. Consistent with the

other results, one cannot rqject the null hypothesis that either the 13-lag model

or the 3-lag model are similar to the actual data, while the null hypothesis that

the random effects model is similar to the actual data is rejected with 99

percent certainty.

         Two very important conclusions emerge from table 10.              First,

although the results in tables 7 and 8 emphasized the significance of extensive

and fully specified lag patterns in fitting current labor supply choices, table 10

suggests that such complete specifications may not be necessary for good

predictive value. In fact, the 3-lag model, estimated with a complex lag

specification, predicts both the aggregate probability weight in each labor

market state as well as actual individual choices almost as well as a model that

includes another 10 lag periods. While there may be significant differences

in the likelihood functions of these two models, the difference in their

predictive values is quite small. I compared a number of alternative models,

and the predictive value of including only two lags is noticeably worse, as is

                                        42
the predictive value of including three lags but with only a simple lag

specification. In contrast, the value of including more than three lags, or of

specifying that lag structure beyond the complex specification in table 6,

columns 1 and 2, has little additional predictive value. Thus, having data on

only a few lag periods is adequate for specifying time dependence in labor

supply choices if one's primary intent is to predict labor supply choices at

some future time or for some alternative sample of persons.

          The second major conclusion from table 10 is that the value of

controlling for past labor supply history depends heavily upon the purpose of

the exercise. If you want to estimate the aggregate population weights, all

three of these models are generally effective. In this case, using cross-

sectional data with a random effects specification may be entirely satisfactory.

If, however, you want to predict individual labor supply choices, then the

availability of longitudinal and lagged information on labor supply is much

more important, and the lagged models are far superior to random effects

models.


                                      VIII
            Implications for Women's Labor Market Behavior:
                         Some Simulated Results

          Any of the estimates derived above can be used to simulate the

behavior of women over time, estimating the probability that they will follow

a particular sequence of labor market choices. This type of simulation may


                                      43
be particularly interesting with regard to the question "How do women move

from out of the labor market into full-time work? A number of policies in

recent years have focused on moving women who receive public assistance

into employment. In most cases, this means placing them in a part-time job.

For instance, the welfare reform plan proposed by President Bill Clinton in

summer 1994 requires eligible welfare recipients who do not find private

sector work to work between 15 and 35 hours in an assigned public sector job.

The hope is that this part-time work will increase their labor market

connections and experience and, over time, will result in their moving into

full-time self-sufficient employment. This section estimates a series of

simulations that test whether moving women into part-time work is a

reasonable approach, based on the historical experiences of adult women over

the past two decades.

        Table 11 presents simulation results for several low-skilled women.

Assuming these women have been out of the labor market for the put two

years, the simulations estimate the effect of moving into part-time or full-time

work this year (as opposed to spending another year out of the labor force) on

the probability of working part-time or full-time next year. All of these

simulations are based on the coefficients estimated in the 3-lag model and

shown in columns 1 and 2 in table 6.          The first simulation is for a black

woman without a high school degree, with two grade-school-age children, who

is unmarried, age 25, and has only $2500 in non-earned income. The second

                                      44
simulation is for the same women but assumes that both of her two children

are   preschoolers. The third simulation assumes that the woman has a high

school degree.

          The first simulation indicates that if this woman stays out of the labor

market one more year, the probability she will move into full-time or part-time

work the following year is quite low (26 percent). If, however, she works

part-time this year, there is almost a 50 percent probability she will remain a

part-time worker next year and a 29 percent probability she will move into

full-time work next year. If she works full-time this year, there is a 78

percent chance she will remain in full-time work next year.

          Comparing the results in these simulation, there are two major

conclusions.     First, the personal and household characteristics of the

individual matter enormously in her labor supply choices. The woman with

preschoolers has a much lower probability of working full-time in the future,

regardless of what she does this year. I emphasize this point because much

of this paper has focused on coefficients other than those on the control

variables. While past labor market histories are very important in predicting

future labor market choices, the control variables are also important,

particularly education level and number and age of children.

          Second, if a woman has been out of the labor market for three years,

moving into part-time work will substantially increase her probability of

staying in the labor market the next year, but it will only somewhat increase

                                        45
her probability of moving into full-time work. The only way to substantially

increase her future probability of full-time work is for her to work full-time

this year. This is consistent with all of the evidence above: Few women use

part-time work as a way to move from out of the labor market toward full-

time work. Women who have been out of the labor market and move into

part-time work are much more likely to leave the labor market or stay in part-

time work than to move on to full-time work.

         These simulations are only suggestive of the effects of a policy that

mandates welfare recipients move into part-time work. They show the

expected future labor market patterns among women over the past 14 years

who have voluntarily moved into part-time work from an extended spell out

of the labor force. As a result, one might believe that they substantially

overstate the effect on fixture labor supply choices of mandatorily demanding

that a woman take a part-time job. They do, however, underscore policy

issues that deserve more consideration: According to these simulations,

moving into pan-time work substantially increase a woman's probability of

being in the labor market in the fixture.      If the goal of welfare-to-work

programs is increased labor force participation, these simulations support the

idea that current part-time work increases future labor force participation. If,

however, the goal is to move women into economic self-sufficiency, which

almost always requires full-time work, then it is less clear that mandating part-

time work will help as much. Rather, the results in this paper suggest that

                                      46
women who move from out of the labor market into full-time work tend to

make that leap immediately. At least historically, few women have either

chosen or been able to put together a sequence of jobs that lets them move

sequentially from out of the labor market, into part-time work, into full-time

work.


                                     Ix
                                Conclusions

        This paper analyzes the dynamics of adult women's labor market

behavior over a 14-year period between 1976 and 1989. It uses         several

different techniques to investigate the nature and the pattern of labor supply

choices made by women over time. The results indicate there is a substantial

amount of labor market movement among individual women over these years,

which is strongly correlated with personal characteristics and household

demographic changes. The results also indicate the importance of analyzing

longitudinal data in order to understand current labor supply choices among

women. Women's current choices are strongly affected by their past labor

market choices. Even information on labor supply choices as far back as 6

years helps explain current labor market behavior.

         Yet, for those with more limited longitudinal data from which to

explore labor supply choices, this paper indicates that models with only 3

years of lag information can predict individual and aggregate labor market



                                     47
involvement almost as well as models with more lag periods, if a relatively

full specification of lag patterns is used. Models with less than 3-year lags or

with only very simple controls for past lag structure are less adequate. In

addition, random effects models, based only on current labor supply

information, are also quite effective in predicting aggregate labor supply

patterns, although they are very ill-suited for predicting individual labor supply

decisions and do not fit the data as well as models controlling for past labor

supply choices.

         With regard to the use of part-time work in the labor market, this

paper indicates that it is rarely used by women as a transitional labor market

state. Most women use part-time work as an alternative to full-time work and

return to hill-time work after some period of part-time employment, or they

enter part-time work from out of the labor market and then leave the labor

market again after a part-time spell. There is little evidence here that placing

women in part-time jobs will greatly increase their probability of moving into

full-time employment over time.

         Women show a far greater diversity in their labor supply choices than

do men, and move between labor market states more frequently. This is the

result of two groups of women in the labor market: A substantial number of

women are extremely constant in their labor supply decisions, either working

full-time or not working at all over many years. This heterogeneity in long-

term behavior is one primary cause of diversity in labor supply choices among

                                       48
women.      Another group of women, however, can be more readily

characterized as "movers," and change labor market states with greater

frequency. Thus, the diversity observed in female labor supply at any point

in time is the result of both underlying stable heterogeneity in behavior among

some, as well as extensive mobility across labor supply choices over time

among others.

         Further analysis of these issues might usefully focus in three areas.

First, this paper contains little information on the nature of the jobs that

women are taking. Given the evidence here on the heterogeneity among the

part-time work force, it would be interesting to see what types of jobs are used

by different groups of part-time women. Second, this paper necessarily
aggregates labor supply decisions into three discrete labor market categories.

By doing this, a great deal of information on labor supply choices is thrown

away. Third, the econometric models used in this paper are limited in the

extent to which they estimate intercorrelations between different labor market

choices and in the ways in which labor market history is fed into the estimates.

Attention to more complete econometric estimation procedures could provide

a better understanding of the full set of interactions between past and present
