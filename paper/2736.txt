                  MULTICOUNTRY MODELING OF FINANCIAL MARKETS


                                    ABSTRACT


     After a survey of alternative theoretical approaches to modelling fin-
ancial markets, the domestic and international financial linkages of major

rulticountry models are examined and assessed.   The properties   of these
models are compared by calculating the slopes of their UI and BP curves for

the United States, Germany, and Japan. The BP curves (horizontal by

assumption in several models) are almost always found to be flatter than the
estimated UN curves.    International differences in UI slopes are not

generally greater than inter-model differences in the estimated slopes of LN
curves for any given country.   Models with rstional or model-consistent

expectations in their financial  markers tend to show mere appreciation of rhe

U.S. dollar, in response to fiscal expansion, than do models with adaptive
expectations, although in both types of model the induced nominal exchange
rate changes play a modest role in the transmission linking domestic spending
to the current account.   Suggestions are made for modelling   the increasing

globalization of financial markets, and for more explicit treatment of

learning behaviour in the modelling of expectations.

                               1. Introduction



     What theoretical approaches are available for the modelling of
domestic and international financial markets in multicountry
econometric models? What structures have been chosen and applied in the
major models, and what are the main properties of the financial sectors
that have been estimated? What do the models appear to reveal about the
comparative behaviour of financial markets in the United States, Japan
and Germany? Finally, what are the implications of these estimated
financial models for the domestic and international effects of fiscal
and monetary policies? These are the main questions that we shall be
addressing in this paper.

     Although the main emphasis of this paper is on the modelling of
domestic financial sectors, and on the resulting implications for
macroeconomic behaviour, there are three ways in which our focus has
been made more international.

     First, since the multicountry models that we are surveying include
separate national blocks for (at least) the three largest industrial
economies, we shall be comparing the treatment and properties of the
monetary Sectors of the United States, Japan and Germany. The stage for
this comparison will be set in section 2, where we review some of the
main questions of theory and model design that underlie the
specification of domestic financial markets in multicountry models. We
then present our empirical comparisons, looking across models and
across countries, in section 3 and a related Appendix.

     Second, we shall emphasize the modelling of the international
linkages of financial markets, as captured by the modelling of
international asset movements, interest rates, and exchange rates. This
will be done in section 4.

     Finally, since a primary purpose of the multicountry models is to
show how the effects of national policies are transmitted to other
countries, our review will emphasize those aspects offormonetary
structure that have the most important implications       international
transmission. To do this, we shall present and discuss, in sections 5
and 6, a number of the key simulation results prepared for this and
related earlier conferences. We shall be trying to assess the
implications of alternative modelling strategies as well as of the
apparent differences in financial structures in the largest industrial
countries. Our comparison among national economies will be mainly
limited to the United States, Japan, and Germany, since these countries
are the focus of the simulations prepared for this conference.

     In our concluding section, we shall summarize our evidence about
the character and properties of the modelling of financial markets in
multicountry models, and make some suggestions for further work.

                     2. Domestic Financial Markets

2.1 Model Design

     The design of a macroeconomic model is a compromise between a set
of objectives (e.g. forecasting, policy simulations), theoretical
inclinations, and data limitations including the evaluation of the
empirical evidence. Multicountry models were built to focus mainly on
spill—over effects of national policy settings and the effects of
exogenous shocks.

     Broadly speaking, three basic approaches were adopted in
formulating these models: linkage, replication and standardization.
In linkage models, independently developed national models are linked
together via trade and international capital flows. Project LINK (Ball,
ed., 1973) is the most comprehensive model in this category. For
replication models, the designers set up a prototype model which is
replicated over a number of countries with some allowance for
differences in institutional characteristics and a common framework for
international linkages. The Federal Reserves Multicountry Model (MCM(
is the archetype of this class of models. The World Economic Model of
Japans Economic Planning Agency (EPA) falls somewhere in between
linkage and replication models. There is a discernible trend in recent
multicountry models towards standardization of macroeconomic
relationships. Countries of a comparable level of development share
common specifications and in some instances common parameter estimates
in these models. The OECD's INTERLINK model (Richardson 1988), the
National Institute model (NIESR 1988), the IMF's MULTIMOD (Masson et
al. 1988) arid models developed by McKibbin and Sachs (1986) and Taylor
(1988( are cast in this mold.

     The trend towards standardization appears to be motivated by a
desire to increase the transparency of large models and to ensure
greater consistency between theory and application, in behaviour (of
similar agents between markets), in accounting relationships
(particularly between flows and stocks and wealth effects) and in
transmission of information (e.g. by the application of model—

                                                                  of
innovations (microcomputers) have also contributed to the process
simplifying and standardizing the national blocks of multicountry
models.

     The focus on international linkages and the trend towards
standardization have meant that the contribution of multicountry models
to the modelling of domestic financial sectors has been relatively
modest. We will argue that the models that we have elected to examine
share a common view as regards the representation of domestic financial
markets and that they differ basically in terms of the level of
aggregation of financial assets, and the way they treat expectations.
In the treatment of expectations, the key difference is that between
the model—consistent expectations used in the Taylor model, and the
adaptive learning processes typically assumed in the other models.


2.2 A Framework

     National balance sheet accounts provide a convenient framework to
structure the financial block of a macroeconomic model. A stylized

  The accounts identify the nature and extent of financial claims among
the various sectors of the economy. Financial claims can be

     2 Most of the macroeconomic literature, following Muth (1961),
uses the term rational expectations' to define expectations that are
consistent with the forecasts of the model used for analysis. Walters

     From the accounting framework it is relatively straightforward to
derive a set of behavioural relationships whereby asset demands are
defined in stock terms within the context of a portfolio according to
risk/return characteristics of the various assets. The formulation of
asset demands within the framework of a portfolio implies a common set
of explanatory variables and cross—equation restrictions that are well
known (Tobin/Brainard 1968, Christ 1971). The characterization of these
restrictions in a dynamic context have also been thoroughly discussed
(Purvis 1978, Owen 1981). The multicountry models in our survey have
simplified, and sometimes ignored, important aspects of the portfolio
approach. For instance, exclusion restrictions are typically the norm
when it comes to interest rates on competing assets in the various
portfolios. Furthermore, in the disaggregated models such as MCM and
EPA, the wealth variable does not represent the sum of the components
in the financial portfolio that is considered in these models.

     The complexity of these financial relationships can he reduced
somewhat by adopting various modelling strategies. One possibility, is
to group all the liabilities of a sector into one asset category. For
example the government issues only bonds, firms only equity, money is
non—interest bearing government debt etc.... This reduced set of
claims may      be modelled according to the aforementioned
principles.hen

     More typically, the size of the financial block is reduced by
aggregating over sectors and omitting specific markets altogether.
Credit and the equity markets are particularly susceptible to this
treatment by aggregation over households, firms and the banking sector,
or private financial intermediaries. Markets may be dropped if they are
"internalized" when aggregating over agents. But this procedure is
acceptable only if it assumed that the remaining sectors have no claims
on each other that take the form of the omitted assets (eg. no bank



       The Bank of Canada's Small Annual Model adopts this strategy.

loans to foreigners; non—residents have no equity claims on
domestic capital Stock).

     Markets may be integrated by assuming that various financial
assets are very close substitutes and therefore that their particular

     This may be viewed as a reduced—form approach to interest rate

and MCM) may be less apparent       other financial markets are
summarily described or ignored altogether.
     There is a presumption that a more disaggregated approach might
reduce potential simultaneity problems and help to identify the
fundamental market equations (supply/demand) by using sector—specific
characteristics as supplementary information. However, in most
macroeconomic models disaggregation involves separate classes of assets
rather than classes of agents, so that the equations tend to employ
similar structures and variables.

     As a practical matter disaggregation implies more potential
sources for errors in specification and estimation. One reason for this
is the sheer volume of coefficients and data involved, which limits the


        Comparing the alternative approaches for U.S. long—term bond
rates, Friedman (1980) concluded that "the structural modelling
approach to interest rate determination...performs    fairly well without
sectoral disaggregation empirically [and) .. . in comparison with familiar
unrestricted reduced—form term structure equations".

attention that can be given to ensure that each component of the
disaggregated structure has sensible doefficients and properties. In
particular, the pervasive use of partial adjustment processes and
backward—looking expectations in a fairly disaggregated model structure
could very well result in rather sluggish responses to policy shocks,
thereby limiting the interest of policy makers in these models.
     Models that derive their dynamic process from estimates based on
low frequency data may be subject to problems of time aggregation bias.
The adjustment path of the various economies in response to external or
policy shocks may be misrepresented. Temporal aggregation can lead to
lower precision in estimation and prediction, low power for tests and
inability to make short—run forecasts (Zeilner and Montmarquette
(1971)). Empirical studies using temporally aggregated and
disaggregated data document the sensitivity of inferences on lag
structures to the level of temporal aggregation (Engle and Liu (1972),
Wei (1978)).


2.4 The Demand for Money

     The key behavioural relationship in the money market is the demand
for money -defined in terms of an aggregate or its components. Three
motives are traditionally invoked for holding money balances: for
transactions purposes, to speculate or to hold as a precautionary
reserve. With each motive one could associate different explanatory
variables: relative yields and transactions proxies, wealth and
expected holding period yields, relative yields and measures of
transactions uncertainties.

     However, macro models typically eschew this complex Set of
motivations to focus on a narrow set of variables: one to represent
transactions (GNP, GDP, absorption or consumption), another to express
opportunity costs (short—term competing rates plus, where applicable,
own rates for certain sub—components of monetary aggregates,) and,
perhaps, a wealth variable (which in most models does not represent the
aggregate of the financial portfolio)
     The use of a single representative interest rate (opportunity
cost) is most probably the Outcome of multicollinearity in estimating
asset demand equations. However, it may be justified either (1) by
assuming that portfolio decisions are separable between broad types of
financial claims (and that marginal allocative decisions are made
between cose substitutes), Or (2) by considering that all non—monetary
financial assets are perfect substitutes for each other such that their
expected holding period yields would be equalized.

     Surveys of empirical research on the demand for money (Cooley and
Leroy, Judd and Scadding, Laidler 1985, Podolski 1986) present evidence
                                        7

of unstable relationships.5 One explanation of the instability of the
                                                          incomes and
relationship between monetary aggregates, interest rates, nature and
prices is that financial innovatios have transformeda the
attractiveness of monetary assets.   Various, and to   certain extent
                                                                     of
complementary, hypotheses have been offered to explain the process
financial innovation.

     Silber (1975, 1983) argues that innovations in financial
instruments and practices occur to remove or lessen the constraints
that firms face. Innovations are most likely to appear when the nature
of constraints change (i.e. modifications in the regulatory
environment) or when the costs of adhering to the constraints are
modified (e.g. circumventing deposit rate ceilings when market rates
are high). Kane (1977) proposed the hypothesis of circumventive
innovation or a "regulatory dialectic" in which the political process
of regulation and the economic process of regulation avoidance interact
by continuously adapting to each other. Wojnilower (1980) has observed
that, according to the U.S. post—war experience, credit shortages at
the peak of trade cycles were mainly responsible for financial
innovation and regulatory change. Technology has provided a further
impetus to financial innovation (Niehans), particularly in the sphere
of information processing, as financial intermediaries have sought to
lower transaction costs while providing more flexible financial
instruments.

     What are the implications of financial innovations? First, one
would not expect to find very stable money demand functions and would
not therefore be surprised if key parameter values differed between
models for similar aggregates (different sample periods and/or
conditioning variables). Secondly, one would favour broader aggregates
or a more aggregated" approach to the structure of the financial block
in a model as substitutions between components due to innovations would
tend to be internalized. However, there is some evidence indicating
that broader aggregates are not necessarily mor stable, in a
functional sense, than are narrower aggregates.



       In particular, functional instability may appear as the result
of targeting a particular monetary aggregate, as financial innovations
are developed to economize on scarce forms of money. Such an outcome
illustrates "Coodhart's Law" - that any monetary aggregate chosen as a
policy instrument will quickly see its financial significance change
(Laidler 1985, p. 160).
     6
       Laidler (1985, p. 120) states ".     .it
                                            does appear that
institutional change is an important factor influencing the demand for
money. . . Such change turns Out tO have been important for a long time

and rather wide variety of countries."

          See, e.g., floughton (1981) and Blundell—Wignall at al.   (1984).
     Third, financial innovations could affect the properties of the
macro model and in particular the slope of the LM curve. The
conventional interpretation would be that greater substitution
possibilities (new financial instruments) would make the monetary
assets more responsive to interest rates changes. Conversely,
financial innovations may leave money holdings in the hands of less
market—sensitive agents or sharpen the "moneyness" of the monetary
aggregates such that the interest rate elasticity of the demand for
money decreases. The net effect could go either way, as noted much
earlier by Marty (1961).


2.5 Monetary Policy Channels

     The relative importance that is given to asset characteristics
influences behavioural relationships in macro—models and the channels
of transmission of monetary policy. For instance, Keynes focussed on
the maturity of the asset and accentuated the relative illiquidity of
long term assets (higher capital risk). Money and short—term bonds
would be close substitutes at the short end of the maturity spectrum
while long—term bonds and real capital were close substitutes at the
long end. Tobin (1969) provided an alternative view whereby assets are
classified according to the nature of their claims, either in nominal
or real terms, thereby grouping money and bonds together. The buffer
stock approach8 identifies money as the residual asset in the portfolio
and assumes temporary disequilibrium in the money market as a
consequence of exogenous changes in the money supply with spill—over
effects on goods and asset markets.

     Each approach entails a different characterization of the
transmission mechanism of monetary policy impulses to the real economy.
The standard Keynesian version, which is favoured by all the
multicountry models under review, establishes a money market
equilibrium condition which solves out for a short—term interest rate.
     Short—term interest rates are determined in the money market
either in terms of the "narrow" institutional framework of managing
bank (free) reserves (MCM, EPA), or as the result of equilibrating
supply and demand for a conventional monetary aggregate. The detailed
framework which characterizes the MCM and EPA models broadens the range
of monetary policy instruments (setting discount or equivalent rates,
reserve ratios or the monetary base via open market or foreign exchange
operations). For the highly aggregated "standardized" models (OECD,
NIESR, TAYLOR) the money supply becomes the policy variable without
specific reference to the setting of policy instruments to achieve
monetary targets. Alternatively the key short—term interest rate may

                                               that expected holding
period yields of assets of varying maturities     equalized and a
representative long term interest rate is derived from a term structure
equation that reflects expectations of future short rates. Risk premia
are typically ignored or subsumed in a constant term.  Long rates, with
or without due consideration for expectations of inflation, then affect
core intertemporal decisions (investment and savings).

     The Tobin model (supply price of capital) puts more emphasis on
the effects of monetary policy shocks on the stock market and the
market valuation of real capital assets. Stock market booms favour
investment in capital goods as their market price exceeds their
replacement cost.
     The buffer stock approach adds a notion of temporary equilibrium
in its treatment of market clearing in the short run for the money
market. In this approach, holders of money balances are assumed to
absorb unexpected short—term changes in the money supply, without the
very large swings in interest rates that are implied by conventional
money demand equations estimated with lagged response to interest
rates. The buffer—stock model reflects the basic monetarist (Friedman
and Schwartz 1963) interpretation of the transmission of monetary
policy. The nominal money stock is supply determined and controlled by
the monetary authorities. Real balances are demand determined. Excess
supply positions in the money market are liquidated by additional
purchases of assets and goods such that a money market disequilibrium
term may be included in some aggregate expenditure functions. The
long—run equilibrium between money supply and demand may then be
achieved by some combination of changes in interest rates (Artis and
Lewis 1976), output (Jonson 1976) and the price level (Laidler 1983).
In the short run interest rates are determined in the bond market and
the interest rate response to monetary policy shocks, such as an open
market operation, is weaker than in the conventional Keynesian
approach.
     In the conventional approach, which is adopted in all of the
multicountry models, short—run interest rates may overshoot following a
monetary shock. The interest rate bears all the burden of the
adjustment and overshooting may occur if the short—run interest
elasticity of the demand for money is substantially below its long—run
value.

     This Section provides a summary overview of the financial sectors
of five multicountry models providing simulation results and analysis
for this conference. They are the Federal Reserve Boards multicountry

model, the world model          of the Japanese Economic Planning Agency, the
INTERLINK model of the          OECD, the global economic model of the U.K.
National Institute for          Economic and Social Research (NIESR), and the
Taylor model. With the          exception of INTERLINK, which is semi—annual,
all of the models have          a quarterly frequency.

     In the text of this section, we present summary evidence about the
LM curves and term structure relations in each of the models, while the
Appendix gives the underlying evidence about the structure and
estimated equations of the individual models.

    Table 3.1 provides estimates of the slopes of the LM curve in the
each of the different models, for each of the G—3 countries. The slope
of the LM curve has implications for crowding out of fiscal policy
actions when money supplies are fixed. Furthermore, as discussed below
in section 5, when combined with a representation of external
equilibrium (a BP curve), the money market equilibrium condition can be
used to make inferences about the exchange rate response to aggregate
demand shocks in the short run.

     Exact comparisons between models for all major monetary aggregates
are not possible due either to limitations in the documentation or
model design. Nevertheless, a few observations are warranted. First,
it is apparent that estimates of the respective LX Slopes differ
greatly between models for a similar aggregate and country thus
indicating some uncertainty about the precise magnitudes. Second, when
considering the key aggregate for each country that may be used in
policy simulations, there are no firm conclusions about the relative
steepness of the LX curves in different Countries. For instance, there
is no general consensus that the LM Curve is steeper in the U.S. than
in Japan or Germany.

     In Table 3.2 we report estimates of the impact and long—run
response of the representative long—term interest rate to the short—
term money market rate. The OECD and Taylor models impose a long—run
proportional adjustment of long—term rates to changes in short—term
rates, as required by the pure expectations term—structure hypothesis.
Long—run homogeneity -is not imposed in the MCM and EPA models. In the
Taylor model, expected future short—term interest rates are derived
from forward simulations of the model, while in the other models
expected future rates are based on adaptive expectations. Some of them
do include, however, variables that might affect the future course of
interest rates, such as government borrowing requirements (EPA and, for
the United States only, OECD) or net foreign lending (EPA). The
National Institute model has no long—term interest rates, and hence no
term structure.

     The estimates of the long—run response of long-term rates- to
short—term rates are derived from the term—structure equations rather
than simulation results. The distinction is especially important for
the Taylor model, where the simulated impact may be much larger, since
expected future short—term rates are influenced even in the first
period. We shall return to this issue in sections 6 and 7, where we
discuss full—model properties.

            4. International Integration of Capital Markets

4.1. Asset Substitutability and Portfolio Balance

     All multicountry models reviewed in this paper involve some form
of portfolio model of the demand for foreign assets. The different
models are distinguished, in terms of their specification and
properties, by three crucial features:
 1. The assumed degree of asset substitutability. Where this is assumed
to be infinite, then the usual demand equation based on rate—of—return
differentials cannot be directly estimated, and interest rates differ
by the expected rate of change of the exchange rate.
 2. The assumed process for determining expected future exchange rates.
This is especially important for models assuming a high degree of asset
substitution, since anything that influences the level of the expected
future exchange rate has equivalent effects on the spot exchange rate.

 3. In models that assume imperfect asset substitution, the key feature
is the form chosen for estimation of the demand equation for foreign
assets. If the portfolio demand equations are estimated with portfolio
stocks, or changes therein, as the dependent variables (as in EPA),
they generally show much smaller asset substitutability than if the
equations are reriormalized and estimated with the spot exchange rate as
the dependent variable (as in OECD).

    We shall first consider these and other specification issues, and
then describe the estimated properties of the capital market linkages
and exchange rate determination in selected multicountry models.9 We
start first with reference to a standard portfolio model. In a
representative two—country model the home—country portfolio consists of
domestic money (M), domestic currency bonds (B), and foreign currency
bonds (F); the home wealth constraint (W) is given by:

               WM+B+EF;                                 (4.1)

where E is the exchange rate defined as the home gurrency price of
foreign currency. Demand functions for the home—country portfolio are
typically of the form:
               M =   m(i,   i+   P, y, W(               (4.2)

               B =   b(i, i+e    P, y, W)               (4.3)


       For a survey of the major theoretical issues relating to
international asset substitutability, and the implications for policy,
especially foreign exchange market intervention, under flexible
exchange rates, see Boothe et al. (1985).

reserves), so that the estimated equation

      A second class of models, under the general heading of 'uncovered   in
interest parity' models, is a degenerate form of the portfolio model
which asset substitutability is perfect. They may be viewed as
                                                    in the sense that the

                                             correlation between the
equation 4.4, since there will be perfect
domestic and foreign interest rates, after adjusting for     the expected
 rate of change of the exchange rate. In these models, of which     MCM and
TAYLOR are examples, the expected rates of return on assets of


                i   =   i
different currency denomination are always equalized:
                               +   s.                      (4.5)

                                                                  on
     Since, as described in the previous section, interest rates
               short—term domestic assets are set so as to  equilibrate
representative
the supply and demand for domestic money, equation 4.5 determines the
                                                           that assumes
expected rate of change of the exchange rate in any model
uncovered interest parity. For any given value of the expected future
                                    14

exchange rate, equation 4.5 can then be solved for the spot rate, and
net capital movements determined residually from the balance of
payments identity. Thus the uncovered interest parity models are
similar in form to portfolio balance models renormalized as exchange
rate equations. The key difference is that a portfolio balance variable
appears as a determinant of the exchange rate in the portfolio balance
model, with a coefficient that falls as the estimated degree of asset
substitution increases.

     In all models, the specification of the expected exchange rate has
important implications for capital movements and the exchange rate.
These expectations may be derived from actual forward simulations of
the model (as in TAYLOR), based on actual or expected purchasing power
parity (as in OECD), or based on recent exchange rate levels and
changes. Exchange rate expectations are of greatest importance in the
models with uncovered interest parity, as in these models any change in
the expected future rate is translated directly into a corresponding
change in the spot exchange rate, since the interest parity condition
uses the interest rate differential and the expected future spot rate
to determine the spot exchange rate.


4.2. Other Specification Issues

     While exchange rate determination is not immediately affected by
portfolio proportions in models assuming uncovered interest parity,
this does not necessarily eliminate longer—run feedbacks from the
current account to the exchange rate. This can be seen by adding a
goods market equilibrium condition and a balance of payments condition
to (4.1), (4.2) and (4.5). Although the capital account is passively
determined, as long as there are wealth effects on. consumption or on
money demand then changes in the current account will eventually
influence domestic demand and prices, and hence the equilibrium nominal
exchange rate.  A current account surplus will also add to the stock of
net foreign claims, which will lead to increased interest and dividend
receipts and to eventual appreciation of the real exchange rate. In
models solved with model—consistent expectations for expected future
exchange rates (such as TAYLOR and MULTIMOD), these longer-run effects
show up immediately, in modified form, through their impact on the
expected future exchange rate. In these models, movements in the spot
exchange rate are influenced largely by the longer—run equilibrium
properties of the system.
     Aside from the greater modelling flexibility associated with
relaxing the uncovered interest parity assumption, the portfolio
balance approach has specific analytic applications which cannot be
addressed by the monetary models. One implication of imperfect
international asset substitutability is that relative supplies of
domestic and foreign assets can affect their relative expected returns
through the exchange rate.  Sterilized intervention, the exchange of B
for F with M unchanged, can have no exchange rate impact under the
assumption of uncovered interest parity.

     While the portfolio can be disaggregated so as to alLD; for more
detailed linkage among exchange rates, capital flows and wealth,
simplifying assumptions are frequently made.  Currency substitution,
for example, is typically assumed away, even in models assuming perfect
international substitutabilty of bonds, by not including foreign money
in the domestic portfolio.1

     Theoretical models have employed the small—country assumption

the linkages from the exchange rate to wealth.

     Other assumptions are made regarding the level o  aggregation.
The lack of bilateral capital flow data for most countries, for and
example, requires specification in terms of multilateral  flows

                                                                  MCM is

                                               net foreign assets and
perfect asset substitutability, does not model
the associated net investment income.

     Portfolio models in the form of equations (4.1) through(4.4) are
unstable, under conditions of static expectations and local asset
preference, when net foreign asset positions are negative  (Masson
                                                      net debt to
1981). When net foreign assets are negative, and the

national wealth. The resulting transfer of wealth to foreigners
the demand for the domestic bond and raises the demand for the foreign
bond, requiring a depreciation for asset market equilibrium. This, in
turn, sets up the need for further depreciation and, under static
expectations, long—run instability. Branson and Henderson a(1984) have
demonstrated that under rational expectations there exists    unique

 saddle path solution for the exchange rate which involves a jump
 appreciation followed by depreciation sufficient to clear the asset
 market.

    The potential instability of the net debtor model is not an issue
in existing multinational models, since none has adopted the
                                                              assumption
that the exchange rate moves so as to provide immediate portfolio
balance with existing stocks of assets. In models involving
                                                            imperfect
substitution of assets, either immediate portfolio balance is  not
imposed (e.g. EPA) or the exchange rate is derived from a renormalized
equation with the exchange rate being determined through its role in
defining the expected return on foreign investment (e.g. OECD). The
issue cannot arise in the models assuming perfect asset substitution,
since there is in any event no direct link from portfolio proportions
to the exchange rate.

     The more direct link from international payments flows to the
exchange rate in the directly—estimated portfolio balance models than
in the models assuming uncovered interest parity may have other
implications for long—run stability. J—curve effects, for
were noted to lead to destabilizing exchange rate movements example,
                                                             in the EPA
and in early versions of MCM. In some cases stability ha             the

expectations.

4.3. Interest Rate Linkages
     As noted, the portfolio approach provides for a rich menu of
possibilities in modelling different exchange rate regimes and the
alternative intervention rules of different countries. Differential
treatment for specific subgroups within the model, such as the EMS
countries for example, can also be a desirable feature. There is the
potential, however, for more varied interest rate linkages to lead to
unintended asymmetries in international transmission.

     The interest rate linkages in models assuming perfect asset
substitutability are straightforward: nominal rates differ bilaterally
by the expected rate of depreciation of the home currency against the
foreign currency. These parity conditions may be specified either in
bilateral or multilateral form (i.e. in terms of some weighted
of foreign rates). If the latter form is used,                  average
                                                           is assured
for all cross—currency bilateral rates as long consistency
                                               as the weighting
procedure used for constructing the effective exchange rate is the same
as that for constructing the world interest rate.  This result is
independent of the weighting matrix chosen.
     In MCM, the combination of perfect asset substitutability with
exchange rate expectations determined by relative price movements
implies that in the long run real interest rates are equalized across
countries, and nominal exchange rates reflect purchasing power parity.
There are four exchange rates in MCM; the bilateral Canada/U.S. rate
                                    17

and weighted average rates for the U.K., Germany and Japan, For the
most part the weighting is symmetric and based on the total world trade
shares of the five countries.11 In order to endogenize the stock of
foreign assets for calculating investment income, some components of
the capital account are modelled. The equations contain a variety of
dissimilar direct interest rate links, but with no consequence for
international transmission since the capital account is passive.

     Symmetric treatment of interest rate linkages across countries is
not exclusive to models assuming perfect asset substitutability. OECD
derives effective exchange rates from world capital flows and world
interest rates based on a geographical flows weighting matrix. The EPA
model, which does not presuppose interest parity, has adopted a more
flexible approach to foreign interest rates based on dominant country
assumptions in the capital flow equations of the various country
models. In the capital account equations for Japan, Germany, Italy and
Canada, the U.S. rate is the dominant foreign rate while in the French
model both U.S. and German rates appear, and in the U.K. model the
foreign rate is a weighted average of the U.S., German, Canadian and
Japanese rates.

4.4 The models compared

     Table 4.1 records capital account elasticities for EPA, OECD,
NIESR, MCM and TAYLOR. The elasticities for EPA are calculated from
full—model simulation results. For OECD and NIESR they are based on
direct structural evidence from estimated balance—of-payments sectors.
The elasticities are computed as changes in the capital accounts as
ratios to GNP arising from a sustained 100 basis point reduction in
domestic short—term interest rates with fixed spot and expected future
exchange rates. For MCM and TAYLOR, the elasticities are set equal to
infinity, since this is a feature of the assumed specification.

     Capital movements are at least ten times more interest—responsive
in OECD, where the portfolio balance equation is renormalized and
estimated as an exchange—rate equation, than in EPA and NIESR. The
small size of the numbers reported in table 4.1, especially when
compared with the infinitely large values reported for the models
assuming perfect asset substitution (TAYLOR and MCM), is a consequence
of reporting them as proportions of GNP, which is done for ease of
international comparisons. A numerical comparison might also be useful.
Each .001 of GNP, for the United States in 1987, represents almost $5
billion, so that in NIESR, which shows the least mobile capital for the
United States, each percentage point increase in U.S. interest rates
brings in about $18 billion of foreign capital in the first year.



        The only exception is the slightly different treatment of
expected foreign inflation in the U.K. model compared to the other
country models.

   Table 4.2 records estimates of the marginal propensities to import
for the various models, calculated as the income elasticities
multiplied by the 1985 ratio of imports to GNP. These are derived as
closely as possible from directly estimated equations, and represent,
where available, the elasticities with respect to output rather than
final spending, since we combine these data with those for the capital
account to obtain approximate BP curves.

capital account impacts of 100 basis point reductions in short—term
interest rates with fixed exchange rates (EPA, July 1987 for the United
States and Japan, EPA 1987 for Germany).

effective exchange rate after a move into current account deficit of $1
billion per quarter is roughly one quarter of a percentage point in the
U.S., one point in Japan and two—thirds of a point in Germany. These
figures were provided for us by Simon Wren—Lewis, and differ from those
reported in Wren—Lewis (1987, p. 59), because the exchange rate
equations have since been revised to embody smaller, and hence more
plausible, cross—country effects in the exchange—rate equations.
Capital account responses to interest rate changes are now somewhat
larger for the United States, and twice as large for Germany, than they
were in the earlier version.

     Finally, to draw together in summary form some of the key
properties of the domestic and financial sectors of the multicountry
models, we show in Table 4.4 the ratios of the estimated slopes of the
8? and LM curves for each of the three countries in each of the five
multicountry models under review. A ratio less than 1.0, indicating B?
flatter than LW, means that the domestic currency would be expected to
appreciate under an expansionary fiscal policy, assuming unchanged
foreign variables and unchanged values for the expected future exchange
rate. The ratio is equal to zero in those cases where international
aeaet substitutability is assumed to be perfect, as in MCM and TAYLOR.

reported in table 3.1. Where more than one elasticity is reported, we
use M2 in the United States and Japan, and for CBM in Germany, since
these are the monetary aggregates held fixed in the fiscal expansion
simulations to be discussed in section 5.

     This completes our summary of the estimated structures of the
domestic monetary sectors and the international financial linkages of
the multicountry models. In the next two sections, we use this
information to help explain some of the differences, both among models
and among countries, in the international transmission of the effects
of domestic fiscal and monetary policies. We shall start with fiscal
policies, since there has been much discussion of the extent to which
monetary policies and exchange rates influence the linkage between
fiscal policies and current account imbalances.


           5.   International Transmission of Fiscal Policies

     In this section, we use our survey of the Structure and properties
of the financial sectors of the multinational models to shed some light
on some key questions in international macroeconomic policy. What do
multinational models have to say about the role of exchange rate
changes in determining the current account effects of fiscal policies?
To what extent does this role depend on the procedures used for
modelling domestic financial Structures and the determination of
exchange rates? Is the contrast between the United States and the rest
of the OECD (referred to as the ROECO), which is evident in the results
reported in Bryant, Henderson, et al. eds. (1988), also apparent when
                                       ,

U.S. fiscal policy is compared with that in Germany and Japan, the two
biggest national economies in the ROECD? If fiscal policy does have
materially different effects in the three countries, to what extent is
this due to differences in their financial structures, as depicted in
the multicountry models?

     We shall start first by looking at the exchange—rate effects of
fiscal policy, since these provide a potentially important part of the
process by which fiscal policy changes influence the current account.
Other things equal, the domestic currency will appreciate in response
to domestic fiscal expansion if the domestic LM curve is steeper than
the HP curve. Intuitively, the lower the capital flow elasticities
(i.e. the steeper the BP Curve) the smaller will be the capital inflow
associated with a positive interest differential, and the smaller will
be the expected exchange rate appreciation from a positive fiscal
shock. When the slope of the HP curve exceeds that of the LM curve,
this suggests that the induced capital inflow will be too small at
unchanged exchange rates to balance the deterioration in the current
account, thus inducing a currency depreciation.

    However, this analysis assumes unchanged exchange rate expectations
and unchanged foreign interest rates. If an expansionary fiscal policy
raises actual and expected domestic inflation, then this may induce an
expected depreciation (as in OECD) which is greater than the increase
in the domestic interest rate (relative to the foreign rate), so that
the spot exchange rate may depreciate even in a model with a very flat
BP curve.
                                       22


     Table 5.1 gives the nominal exchange rate changes in the first
period and on average over the first year (first period/first year) of
a positive fiscal shock equal to 1% of GNP. As expected, based on the
estimates reported in Table 4.4, the models generally show immediate
own—country appreciations in response to fiscal expansion. The
exceptions are the NIESR results for Japan and Germany, where BP curves
are estimated to be steeper than the corresponding LM curves, On
average over the first year, the models show appreciations for all
three countries, except for the OECD model, which shows a first—year
depreciation for the United States, and LINK, which shows a small DM
depreciation in response to German fiscal expansion. For all three
countries, the exchange rate impact is much larger in TAYLOR than in
the other models.

 NIESR      1.6/1.8        —0.4/0.5            —0.4/1.0



     We have not been able to examine the partial properties of the LM
and EP curves for the LINK model, but it would appear that the slopes
are generally rather similar for all three countries, as the exchange
rate changes are small in all cases.

     One case requiring more explanation is that for U.S. fiscal
expansion in the case of the OECD model. Although the BP curve is
flatter than the LM curve in OECD, the model shows a first—year
                                    23

depreciation of the U.S. dollar in response to fiscal expansion.16 This
occurs for two reasons: first because foreign interest rates rise, and
second because the expected future exchange rate, which is primarily
determined by current and expected future purchasing power parity
(PPP), indicates an expected future depreciation of the U.S. dollar,
since U.S. prices are              more than foreign prices in response
                      increase9 by
to the U.S. fiscal expansion.1

     In earlier papers analyzing asymmetries in the transmission of
fiscal policies (e.g. Bryant, Henderson et al, 1988), it was seen that
multiplier effects were more truncated (i.e. more short—lived) in the
United States than in the ROECD, and that the current account and
foreign GNP effects of U.S. fiscal policies were greater than for ROECD
policies, despite the fact that the ROECD is 50% larger than the United
States. Because interest rates were increased much more in the United
States (in response to U.S. fiscal expansion) than in the ROECD (in
response to ROECD fiscal expansion), it was conjectured that this
asymmetry might be due to a steeper LM curve in the United States than
in the ROECD, and that this result might in turn be due to one—way
effects flowing from U.S. to foreign interest rates. The evidence
prepared for this conference permits a more precise evaluation of this
notion. What do the current results indicate?

     First, as shown in Table 3.1, there is no general evidence from
the models that LM curves are steeper in the United States than in
Japan and Germany. The MCM and NIESR models do show steeper LM curves
in the United States than in the other two countries, as does EPA in
the case where the Japanese interest rate RSEC is endogenous. However,
the TAYLOR and OECD models both have LM curves that are flatter in the
United States than in the other two countries. None of the current
evidence relates o   the rest of the ROECD countries (which together
account for more than 60% of ROECD output), and the model set is
somewhat smaller in these experiments, so complete reconciliation with
the earlier evidence is not possible. However, it would seem that the
higher interest rates in the United States (in response to U.S. fiscal
expansion) than in other countries (in response to their fiscal

     16 Although the dollar appreciates very slightly on impact (up by
0.02% in the first semester), it is lower by 0.12% in the second semester.
     17 The latter factor is substantially the more important of the
two. In simulation F3 for the OECD model, for example, foreign interest
rates change by about .6 as much as do U.S. rates. Assuming a foreign
rate response of this proportion, then the capital account sensitivity
of Table 4.1., which was computed under the assumption of foreign rates
unchanged, would decline, causing an upward revision of the estimated
HP slope from 3.0 to 7.6. This is only a fraction of the increase
necessary to achieve slope equality with the 36.0 slope of the LM
curve, implying that the major explanation is in the relatively rapid
price response of the U.S. model and its impact on the expected
exchange rate.
                                    24

expansion) is perhaps more likely to result from the higher prices
induced in the United States, which have the effect of reducing the
real money supply more there than elsewhere.

     Second, the current results are less uniform than the earlier ones
in showing fiscal multipliers to be more truncated in the United States
than elsewhere. The panels of figure 5.1 compare the fiscal multipliers
of the United States with those for Japan and Germany for each of the
models reviewed in this paper. There is no systematic appearance of
more multiplier truncation for the United States than for the other
countries, except for the EPA model. Since the models surveyed in this
paper are similar to the versions assessed in the earlier experiments
(as shown in Helliwell 1988), this slight difference probably reflects
primarily the properties of the models for ROECD countries other than
Japan and Germany, or the amplifying effects that might exit when all
ROECD economies undertake fiscal expansion simultaneously.1-°

     Third, the evidence from the models assessed at the earlier EPA
conference (EPA, MCM and OECD) indicated that induced nominal exchange
rate changes did not play a very important role in determining the
current account effects of fiscal policies (Helliwell 1988, section 4).
This was seen by comparing results of fiscal policies run with
exogenous and endogenous exchange rates, and seeing that the effects of
the fiscal policies on the current account balance were altered by less
than 10% when nominal exchange rates were made endogenous. This
suggests that the major part of the current account effects flowed
through the changes in income and expenditure, supplemented by the real
exchange rate changes caused by the price—level effects of the fiscal
policy changes. In the discussion in that conference, it was noted that
this result might be altered materially if the model set was expanded
to include models with rational or model—consistent expectations, since
these typically show larger appreciations in response to fiscal
expansions.
     The current results confirm that the model with rational
expectations (TAYLOR) does have the largest induced appreciation of the
U.S. dollar in response to U.S. fiscal expansion, but the role of this

     18 This hypothesis was assessed and
                                         supported by comparing the
effects of sustained ROECD and own—country fiscal expansions for Japan
and Germany, using the adaptive expectations version of the G-7 model
described in the next footnote. As suggested in the text, the
multicountry nature of the ROECD fiscal expansion produces a less
truncated multiplier. This happens because the cross—country GNP
effects are delayed and less truncated than the own—country effects.
For example the first—year Japanese GNP effects of an ROECD fiscal
expansion are 1.25 times as large as those of a Japanese fiscal
expansion. This ratio grows steadily as time passes, reaching 1.9 in
the fourth year. For Germany, the more open of the two economies, the
corresponding ratio is always larger than for Japan, but shows the same
pattern, rising from 2.0 in the first year to 3.6 in the fourth year.
                                    25

exchange rate flexibility is not directly assessed, nor is it possible
to tell how much of the additional appreciation on the Taylor model is
due to the use of model consistent expectations.

     To help cast more light on the role of alternative expectations
                                                      for exchange
processes, we compare in figure 5.2 the consequences,
rates, inflation rates, interest rates, real GDP and price levels, of
U.S. fiscal policies under different assumptions about the formation of
expectations for future interest rates, inflation rates, and exchange
rates. These results are drawn frm simulations of a G7 version of the
recently developed IMF MULTIMOD.1' The results show that the U.S.
dollar appreciates much more sharply in the consistent expectations
version, and then depreciates thereafter, in order to maintain expected
interest arbitrage. The real GNP effects are similar in the two
versions, but inflation is almost twice as great in the consistent
expectations version. With more U.S. inflation and more nominal
appreciation of the U.S. dollar, the consistent expectations version
shows more eal appreciation of the dollar under U.S. fiscal
expansion,2u with the result that the current account effects of the
fiscal policy are larger. However, the differences over the first three
years are not very great, with the consistent expectations version
showing current account effects about 15% larger than the adaptive
expectations version.

          6. International Transmission of Monetary Policies

     In this section we discuss briefly the effects of monetary
expansions in the United States, Japan and Germany, with emphasis on


     19 MULTIMOD is described in Masson, Symansky, Haas and Dooley
(1988). It contains separate country blocks for the United States,
Japan, and Germany, with aggregate treatment of the remaining four
members of the G7, of the next largest 11 industrial countries, of
high—income oil exporters, and of developing countries. The G7 version,
known as INTERMOD, has been developed by the Working Group in
International Macroeconomics in Ottawa. It contains separate country
blocks for each of the G7 countries, with the rest of the world handled
exactly as in Masson et al (1988). Version 1.0 of INTERMOD, as
described in Helliwell, Meredith, Durand and Bagnoli (1988) is used for
the results reported in this paper. The fiscal shock reported in figure
5.2 follows Masson et al. in being 1% of GNP in the first year, and
then declining thereafter. We are currently experimenting with fiscal
shocks that are of constant size over six years, and starting in 1987,
to match more closely the experiments done with other models for this
conference.
     20 Over the first three
                             years, the real value of the U.S. dollar
is 2.1% higher under model—consistent than under adaptive expectations.
                                    26

the roles of interest rates and exchange rates.2' Figures 6.1 to 6.3
show, in summary form, the domestic and international effects of
monetary expansions in the United States, Japan and Germany,
respectively. The upper four panels of each gure show the domestic
effects of a 1% increase in the money supply  , while the bottom four
panels show the effects on interest rates and real incomes in the other
two countries. As much as possible, the scales have been kept the same
in all of the income and interest rate charts, to make comparisons
easier among countries and among models. The figures show annual
averages rather than quarterly values, to better reveal the main trends
of the results.

     Looking first at the own—country effects of monetary expansion,
the real GNP effects are roughly similar in the three countries, at
about 0.5% increase in the second year, trailing quite rapidly away
after that for all models except MCM, which generally shows the
longest—lasting real effects in all three countries. All models show
domestic currency depreciation as a results of monetary expansion, with
the nominal exchange rate falling by about the same amount as the
increase in the domestic price level, although doing so much more
rapidly. Thus the exchange rate flexibility serves to roughly insulate
the other countries from the direct inflationary effects of monetary
expansion.
     The real cross—country effects of monetary expansion are generally
negative. This is the expected result in models, such as these mostly
are, where asset substitutability is high, and the exchange rate
depreciates initially by more than domestic prices are increased. The
size of the negative income effects is quite small, however, with the
exception of the NIESR model, where the initial depreciation is much




     21 Our discussion is kept brief, since the international
transmission of monetary policy in these models is the focus of Erayton
and Marguez (1988). Our concentration is on the links between model
structure and simulation results.
     22 For most models the chosen aggregate is M2 in the United States
and Japan, and CEM in Germany. The Taylor model uses Ml for all
countries. The OECD model uses M3 for Germany, and the EPA uses Ml for
Germany.

higher than in any of the other models.23 The negative cross—country
income effects are largest for U.S. monetary expansion.

     By the tire three or four years have passed, most of the models
show fairly small residual real incqme effects of the monetary
expansion, both at home and abroad.'4 Prices are generally higher, for
the country undertaking the monetary expansion, generally by slightly
less than the 1% increase in money supplies. The EPA model tends to
show the smallest increase in prices in each country, ranging from
about .3% in the United States and Japan to next to nothing in Germany.


                    7. Conclusions and Suggestions

     We shall first list some of    the key similarities and differences
in model structures, then assess    the implications of these differences,
and finally suggest what seem to    us to be some promising lines for
further experimentation or model    improvement.

7.1 Similarities and differences:

    The multicountry models tend to have fairly simple and domestically
oriented monetary sectors. Even those with substantial disaggregation
of monetary assets in some national blocks, as with EPA, can be
reasonably represented by conventional LM specifications.
    Of the five models whose structural detail was analyzed in this
paper., four are quarterly and one semestrial. Three of the quarterly
models (TAYLOR is the exception) use distributed lags in their money

     23 The extreme
                    exchange rate volatility of NIESR, under monetary
shock, tends to make its results the outliers for most domestic and
foreign effects of monetary policy. This required the scales of the
figures to be set so large as to make the results from some of the
other models indistinguishable from zero, and from each other. The
NIESR results appear to flow principally from the quasi—reduced—form
exchange rate equations. The dynamic form of these equations is such
that a temporary shock to interest rates has a permanent effect on the
exchange rate, for a given value of the current account. The exchange—
rate effects of monetary expansion are thus not only much larger on
impact but also more sustained than in the other models.

     24 The
            principal own—country exception relates to U.S. and
Japanese monetary expansion in MCM, and the initially positive and then
negative effects of Japanese policy in TAYLOR. The principal cross—
country exceptions are the continuing negative effects, on Japanese
GNP, of U.S. monetary expansion in EPA (stemming from falling Japanese
income from foreign investments),and the generally large, and possibly
unstable, cross—country effects in NIESR.

curve is much flatter for OECD than for EPA. For the EPA model, the
derived slopes of the LM and BP curves are very similar, while for OECD
the HP curve is much flatter. However, the quasi—reduced-form exchange—
rate equations of NIESR produce BP curves more similar to those of EPA
than of OECD.

     The models also differ in how they determine and use expected
future exchange rates. The Taylor model applies open parity using
expected future exchange rates obtained from the forward solution of
the model. In OECD and MCM the expected exchange rate also plays a
crucial role, since MCM imposes open parity and the OECD exchange rate
equation implies a unit elasticity of the spot exchange rate with
respect to the expected future rate. In both models the expected
exchange rate is based on adaptive expectations of expected relative
GNP or GDP deflators at home and abroad. Exchange rate expectations are
less important in EPA, since expectations have a less direct role in
determining the spot exchange rate.


7.2 Implications of the model differences

     The differences among the models in the estimated properties of
their financial sectors, as represented by the slopes, and the relevant
dynamic properties, of their LM curves, is partly responsible for the
differences in their estimation of the size and international
transmission of the effects of fiscal policies. More detailed
experimentation, involving full—model simulations with alternative
parameters and equation structures, would be required to be much more
precise. In some models, e.g. Taylor and OECD, the estimated
international differences in LM slopes are probably large enough to
influence the nature of the transmission process. Given the finding
that intermodel differences in LM slopes for the same country are large
relative to the estimated international differences, it would seem
desirable to establish more securely the statistical basis for the
international differences before relying too much on the derived
results.

     As was shown in figure 5.1, there is no strong evidence that
fiscal multipliers are more truncated in the United States than in the
other two countries. Thus the systematically more sustained fiscal
multipliers reported for the ROECD as a whole, when compared to the
United States, is likely to be due to factors other than differences in
domestic LM curves, or in own—country fiscal multipliers, among the
largest three economies. Assessment of the possibilities will require
more investigation of the extent to which fiscal expansion in the ROECD
countries is mutually reinforcing, and thus possibly sustaining the
ROECD group multiplier at levels above those that would be achieved by
the two largest ROECD countries acting on their own.

     The Taylor model's application of model—consistent expectations
for the term structure of interest rates, expected exchange rates, and
                                    30

                                                         of results to
expected inflation produces a markedly different pattern
both fiscal and monetary shocks.

     Under expansionary fiscal shock, the exchange rate apprecistes
more and faste in the Taylor model. This is not a necessary result of
consistent expectations, which require only that the open parity
condition be maintained throughout the future path of the simulation.
As the OECD results illustrate, if fiscal expansion gives rise to
expected future inflation, or if future de9eciation is expected to be
necessary to service the accumulating debt  , then the exchange rate
could appreciate less, or even depreciate, under consistent
expectations.
     In circumstances where the short—term interest rate remains above
control for several periods, the Taylor model, or any other model with
model—consistent expectations, produces a larger initial change in the
long—term interest rate, thus tending to increase the effect on real
spending, which generally responds to changes in long—term interest
rates. This truncates slightly the real GNP effects of fiscal policy,
as shown in the figure 5.2 comparisons for consistent and adaptive
expectations versions of a G7 version of MULTIMOD.

7.3 Suggestions for further research

     Given the volatility of asset prices, and the dependence of those
prices on expectations, an explicit treatment of expectations seems
almost inescapable for any fully satisfactory model of financial
markets and their international linkages. The current crop of
multinational models employ two alternative possibilities in their
treatment of expectations, either making them adapt to recent
experience or be determined by the future simulation paths of the model
being used for analysis. Both procedures are informative, although
neither is fully satisfactory.

     To go further, it will be necessary to retain the explicit
forward—locking features of the model—consistent expectations, while
recognizing that market participants are varied in their views, are
either unknowing or unbelieving of the processes depicted by any
particular model of the economy, and are faced by uncertainty about
many factors that are treated as fixed in model simulations. Key among
these are future developments in the structure of financial markets,
and assesaments of credit risks, the likely future paths of policy, and

     26 This
             possibility, which is central to assessing the
sustainability of current account positions, and hence of exchange
rates (as emphasized by, e.g. Krugman 1967), is not embodied in the
Taylor model, because debt accumulation and foreign debt service
payments, are not modelled. Some of these channels are included in
MULTIMOD, which shows a smaller appreciation under fiscal expansion
(Masson et al. 1988).
                                     31
the likelihood of turmoil in financial markets. All of these
possibilities tend in current models to be subsumed in exogenous
variables and structural parameters, or assumed not to exist.

     Models with single—valued paths for future variables, and with
well—articulated and well—understood equilibrium properties, are useful
for many purposes, but they are probably not a very realistic way of
modelling market expectations. To do better will require more explicit
study of learning processes, and of the methods people actually use in
simplifying complex situations to obtain rules for current action.
Since this involves a major and not clearly mapped—out research effort,
it would seem appropriate in the meantime to treat expectations
explicitly, and to use both adaptive and model—consistent processes for
determining these expectations, since they may for some purposes
provide brackets about the behaviour of market participants.

     Although consistent expectations models can now be run efficiently
even on quite small computers (see, e.g. Taylor            require 50
                                                1993 they
or 100 times as much computing to obtain a solution  . To minimize the
cost of maintaining and running models with model—consistent
expectations, it may be helpful to develop benchmark studies of the key
differences between adaptive and consistent expectations results, and
then use adaptive expectations versions for day—to—day assessments. The
benchmark rules of thumb can then be used to give a preliminary
estimate of how the consistent expectation results would differ.

     As international financial integration proceeds, it is becoming
more difficult to assume that demands for national money, at any level
of aggregation, depend only on national short—term interest rates. In
particular returns on financial investments in other currencies, which
are heavily influenced by expected changes in exchange rates, are
likely to play increasing roles in international portfolio allocation,
including currency and bank deposits of the types that enter monetary
aggregates.
     Even transactions balances are likely to become more international
as globalization proceeds. Thus national income, output, or sales may
all provide insufficient measures of transactions demands for any
particular national money. These demands are likely to depend also on
the size and structure of each country's trade and investment
relations, as well as on the nature of the exchange rate systems in
operation.
     Since many of the macroeconomic issues addressed by multicountry
models relate to questions of portfolio balance and the future
building—up and servicing of national and international debts, future
modelling efforts should focus on finding suitable links back from
debts to asset prices and exchange rates. The convenient assumption of

and consistent expectations solutions.

uncovered interest rate parity will probably have to be adjusted to
reflect portfolio balance and risk considerations, even if in a rough—
and—ready manner.
     Because the future sustainability of current account positions

tests may help to reduce the incidence of implausible model properiles
and international differences that we have found in some of the models
embodying less constrained structure and dynamic responses.
     Given the ambitious nature of this shopping list, we should
perhaps add one final suggestion designed to simplify the research
agenda. Our comparison qf models involving different degrees of sectors
disaggregation suggests to us that disaggregation of financial
does not seem to make much difference to the broad pattern of results,
and may therefore be avoided by those who are more interested in
questions of international financial linkages and comparisons.

                             Appendix
          Domestic Financial Sectors in Five Multicountry Models

      In this Appendix we provide obrief description of the
domestic financial sectors of each of the models, with special
reference to their treatment of the United States, Japan and
Germany. We also report the basic interest and income
elasticities for the money demand functions, either in terms of
the aggregates or their components.  These parameter estimates
underlie the estimates of the slopes of the LM curves, as
reported in Table 3.1. Since long-term real interest rates
constitute the key link between the financial sector and the
real side of the economy, the interest rate term structure
relationships are described. A comparative evaluation of the LM
curves and of term—structure relationships appears in the main
text of the paper.

A.l The Federal Reserve Model: MCM.

    MCM links five country models together: the U.S., Japan,
Germany, the United Kingdom and Canada. The prototype model is
based on the following assumptions: asset markets are
                                                       perfectly
competitive, agents are risk neutral, short and long securities
are perfect substitutes, as are foreign and domestic  currency
bonds, expectations are adaptive. There is no equities market in
this model, and with only two domestic assets, money and bonds,
the bond market is redundant (or implicit). The long—term
interest rate is determined by a term structure equation. Since
long— and short—term bonds are assumed to be perfect
substitutes, the long—term rate is a distributed lag function of
short—term rates, based on the assumption of adaptive
expectations.
     The structure of the financial sector, outlined in Table
A.1, is described by means of a balance sheet
                                               representation of
the domestic financial claims and relevant sectors  in the model.
Endogenous asset (or liability) demands (or supplies) applicable
to all three countries are indicated by the symbol D (or 5) under
the appropriate sector heading. In other cases, a specific
country designation is employed, using a slash followed by the
letters U for the United States, J for Japan, or G for Germany.
The fundamental agents in the economy are identified by the
column headings while the rows represent the various asset
markets. The relevant sectors include persons (H), firms, both
financial (FF) and non—financial (NFF), the public sector
including the government (G) and the monetary authorities
(CB),and foreign nationals or non—residents (NR). The interest
rate corresponding to each asset market is indicated under the
                                        39

htrateHcolumn, using the model's mnemonics. The last column
                                     the interest rates either by
designates the method of determining
market equilibrium (ME) equating demand and supply, or via a
reduced—form specification (RF), a particular version of which is
a term—structure relationship (TS). The rate on CDs is
determined by inverting the demand function (DEM). These
conventions apply to our descriptions of all five models.
                                                         flows in
     Although MCM does account for international capital
terms of direct investment and portfolio investments, non—
residents' holdings of domestic securities cannot be
                                              and are therefore
aistinguished by the type of financial claimsof the model is on
not represented in table A.l. The main focus
the demand for money, the decomposition of which reflects
cnsideration of different reserve ratios by deposit type.

    Short—term interest rates are determined by the equilibrium
f  the demand and supply of free reserves. Demand for free
reserves depends on the composition of deposits, reserve ratios,
costs and the volatility of reserves. Demand for the various
components of monetary aggregates, which include currency, model
demand, time and savings deposits, is based on a portfolio
which is homogeneous in wealth (defined as cumulated savings).
The German model also includes deposits held by foreigners
(subject to a different deposit ratio), and allows for partial
adjustment of free reserves as a function of rediscount rates.

          Long run estimates, from Marquez (1988). The interest
rate semi—elasticity, for comparison with the other models, is
equal to the elasticity divided by the average proportionate
interest rate. For M2, using an average interest rate of .06, the
semi—elasticity is 1.67.

      Term—structure equations differ between the major countries
in the model. For Germany, the long—term rate is a distributed
lag function of the short—term rate combined with seasonal
factors; in th9 U.S. model the lagged short rate is supplemented
by adaptive expectations of inflation; in Japan, the conventional
term structure equation is combined with an inverted supply
function of bank debentures. In the long run, long—term interest
rates do not respond proportionately to movements in short—term
rates.



A.2 The EPA World Economic Model.

     The EPA model covers nine countries (including the G—7 plus
Korea and Australia) and six other regions. In the U.S., Japanese
and German models, short-term interest rates are determined by
equating he demand and supply of free reserves, with the
discount rate also having a substantial effect in the Japanese
case. The Eurodollar rate (which in turn depends on the US short
rate) also appears in the current version of the            block,
although it is to be dropped in the next version. panese

     28 In the U.K. and Italian
                                models, short—term rates are
determined by the demand for and supply of Ml (U.K.) or M2
(Italy). Policy reaction functions of the monetary authorities
are used to determine short—term interest rates in the

    Demand for money is based on a components approach in the
framework of a portfolio model. Major explanatory variables
include private net worth (cumulated personal savings) or
financial net worth (c1ams on the government and foreigners),
transactions variables (GNP or domestic absorption), rates of
return on the assets and those of close substitutes. The key
parameter estimates are shown in table A.4.

  Long—term interest rates are determined by a term structure
equation which also takes into consideration market pressure
variables such as government borrowing requirements and net
foreign lending as a proportion of GNP. Expectations of future
inflation are additional factors in the Japanese and German
models. Long—term homogeneity of long—term rates to short—term
rates is not a feature of these models.

     INTERLINK has large blocks for each of the G—7 countries,
smaller blocks for each of the other OECD countries, and for six
non—OECD regions. A standardized representation of the financial
block for the G—7 countries was adopted to enhance the
transparency of the model and to avoid differences in model
properties resulting from different research strategies. Equity
markets are ignored, and the bond market is implicit, so that the
domestic financial block has only three basic components: a money
demand equation, a term structure equation and adaptive

Institute for Economic and Social Research             9 countries
and 7 other regions. The financial blocks for the G—7 countries
share a similar structure. The structure of NIESR is broadly that
of the U.K. Treasurys World Economic Prospects model presented
in Horton (1984). In the financial blocks, narrow and broad money
demand equations exist for each country, where real balances
depend on activity (either total final expenditure or GNP),
nominal interest rates and inflation (CPI or UN? deflator), and a
time trend. Dynamics are usually captured by an error correction
process.
     Nominal interest rates can be determined in- a number of
different ways. Reaction functions are estimated for the major
countries to capture the recent behaviour of the authorities.
Alternatively, nominal or real interest rates can be fixed.
Finally, interest rates can be varied to keep the money stock on
a predetermined path. Term structure relations do not exist, as
there is only a single interest rate for each country.
