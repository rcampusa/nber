                   The Effects of Market Demand,
              Technological Opportunity and Research
        Spillovers on R&D Intensity and Productivity Growth

                                 ABSTRACT


     This paper uses sales and patent distribution data to establish

the market and technological "positions" of firms. A notion of tech-

nological proximity of firms is developed in order to quantify poten-

tial R&D spillovers. The importance of the position variables and the

potential spill—over pool in explaining R&D intensity, patent produc-

tivity and TFP growth is explored.

     I find that both technological and market positions are signifi-

cant in explaining R&D intensity, and that the technological effects

are significant in explaining patent productivity. I cannot distin-

guish between the two effects in explaining TFP growth. Spillovers

are important in all three contexts. Firms in an area where there is

a high level of research by other firms do more R&D themselves, they

produce more patents per R&D dollar, and their productivity grows

faster, even controlling for the increased R&D and patents. These

effects are present controlling for both industry and technological

position effects.

I .Introduct ion1

       This paper uses company cross—section data to investigate two

interrelated questions regarding the determinants of industrial R&D

activity and productivity growth. The questions are:        (1) what is the

relative importance of market conditions and exogenous technological

conditions in determining the allocation of resources to research, and

in explaining the growth of productivity; and (2) are there observable

"spillover effects" among firms' research programs.

     There is a long history of debate in economics on whether innova-

tion   is more often the result of the "pull" of market forces or of the
"push" of exogenous technological factors. Schmookler (1966) argued
that, looking across industries over time, the      effect of expected

market    size on the expected return   was the primary determinant of   the
allocation   of resources to invention.2 Rosenberg (1971t and 1983),

while not denying the importance of the factors cited by Schmookler,

argues that factors on the cost or supply side of invention are also

of major importance in explaining both the allocation of resources to

invention and the resulting growth of productivity. These supply—side

factors include variations in both the intrinsic difficulty of innova-

tion in different technical areas and also variations in the state of

general   knowledge in different areas. Both of these factors are often
summed up in the phrase "technological opportunity." Scherer (1965 and

especially 1982a) finds that dummies for broad technological classes

explain much of the variance in innovative intensity across industries

and argues that this is evidence for the importance of technological

opportunity. In this paper, I use independently derived data on

firms' "market positions" and "technological positions" to distinguish

demand—pull and technological opportunity effects.

    The theoretical possibility and potential importance of R&D

spillovers are more recent concerns in the literature. They have been

discussed by Griliches (19T9), Reinganum (1981), and Spence (l98).

Griliches points out that the extent of spillovers is crucial to

assessing the contribution of R&D to productivity growth, and Spence

emphasizes that in R&D—intensive industries the extent of spillovers

is an element of market structure with important implications for

conduct and performance. Despite this recognition of the importance

of spillovers, there is little empirical evidence on their actual

significance.

    Like technological opportunity, spillovers affect the cost of

innovation. If appropriability is imperfect, then having lots of

other firms doing research in the same areas as you may reduce the

cost of innovating for you. This positive externality should be

observable as a correlation between, on the one hand, the firm's inno-

vative output and productivity growth, and, on the other hand, the


3 . The term "spillovers" is used by different writers to describe
   slightly different phenomena. I use it to describe a transfer of
   knowledge from one firm to another unmediated by any market tran-
   saction. I thereby exclude the phenomenon whereby improved pro-
   ducts are sold at prices that do not fully reflect their higher
   quality, thereby "spilling" research benefits from suppliers to
   customers. See Scherer (1982b) and Griliches and Lichtenberg(198a).
                                    —3—

intensity of research in its "neighborhood" (to be made precise

below). This correlation should remain even after controlling for the

firm's own R&D.

    This positive externality is technological: it derives from the

inherent public good aspect of knowledge. There are also reasons to

expect negative externalities among research programs, generated by

competition. Because of patent laws, other firms' research may reduce

your innovative output, particularly if innovative output is measured

by patents. Similarly, most firms face downward sloping demand cur-

ves, which shift inward when a competitor lowers price or improves

quality. This generates a negative effect of other's research on the

firm's productivity, if productivity is measured in terms of revenues.

Empirically, it would be difficult to distinguish separately the posi-

tive and negative effects. In this paper I simply estimate partial

correlations that capture the net effect of the two.

    It should be emphasized that this paper examines the effect of

variations in spillovers, not variations in the conditions of

appropriability. The distinction can be clarified by reference to the

model of Spence(198l). Assume that for every dollar a firm spends on

R&D, a fraction U "spills over" and is freely available to any firm.

The appropriability environment is then parameterized by 0. Low 0

represents easy appropriation; 0 approaching unity represents R&D as a

pure public good. Increasing 0 (reducing the extent of appropriation)

has two effects: the private rate of return to R&D falls because of
                                      —'i—


the   inability to capture the returns, but the industry—wide produc-

tivity of R&D rises because of the fuller exploitation of the public

good nature of knowledge.

      Spence's firms are identical, so they all enjoy spillovers to the

same extent; in this framework, Spence examines the effect of changing

0. In this paper, I assume, in effect, that 0 is the same for all

firms, but that firms differ in their R&D intensity and their tech-

nological areas of interest. I examine the effect of the variations in

the "pooi" of spilled research available to different firms, these

variations being generated by variations in the intensity of other

firms' research in the relevant technological areas.

      To measure this pooi of relevant spilled research (and to test for

technological opportunity effects), we need a framework for charac-

terizing and differentiating the research interests of firms. The

next section of the paper establishes such a framework. The following

three sections present empirical results for R&D intensity, patent

production and productivity growth. Concluding observations follow.


II. Technology Space, Market Space, and Technological Proximity

      The typical large manufacturing firm is somewhat diversified both

in terms of the products it sells and the research it pursues. These

two patterns of diversification are not unrelated, but they are

distinct. Even the seller of a single product like an automobile will

typically do research in diverse areas, such as aerodynamics, engines,
                                    —5—

and structural properties of materials. For the purpose of this

paper, I do not try to understand these patterns of diversification,

or their mutual relationship. I seek only to characterize the firm's

research interests and market position in a way that takes them into account.

    To do this, I construct two conceptually analagous distribution

vectors for each firm. Firm i's technological position vector

               indicates the fraction of the firm's research effort

devoted to the K diverse technological areas. It's market position

vector gj=(gi...gj) indicates the fraction of its sales that go to

the L distinct markets.

    For concreteness, we can visualize these vectors as locating the

firm in a K—dimensional technology space and an L—dimensional market

space. The question of the importance of technological opportunity

then becomes: Does position in technology space matter in explaining

patterns in the allocation of resources to research and in produc-

tivity growth? The inportance of demand—side effects can be explored

by asking the same question for position in market space.

    In this framework, the existence of R&D spillovers implies

that a firm's performance is affected by the research activity of its

neighbors in technology space. To make this notion operational

requires significant additional structure. I assume that the total

relevant activity of other firms can be summarized by a "potential

spillover pool" that is simply a weighted sum of other firms' R&D,




It. The characterization of technological areas and markets used to
   make this approach operational are discussed below.
                                      —6—

with weights proportional to the proximity of the firms in technology

space. To measure the proximity of firms I and j, I use the angular

separation or uncentered correlation of the vectors fj and fj:

                               fifj
                                                                     (1)
                     Pij= {(fif.)(fjfj)}
Thus, in constructing the pooi for firm i, firms whose position vector

is Identical to f1 get a weight of unity; firms whose vector is ortho-

gonal get zero weight, and others get an intermediate weight that

depends on the degree of overlap of the two firms' research interests.7

    In this formulation, firms with rather diverse research interests

potentially benefit to a small extent from the research of virtually

all other firms. (That is, there may be no j for which Pjj is zero.)

This may seem implausible. An alternative view is that firms are

aware of the activities of a fairly small number of technologically

similar firms; developments by others, even though potentially rele-

vant, are simply not likely to be noticed. To explore this possibi—

lit1, the firms were clustered into groups based on their techno-

logical positions, and the total pooi described above was partitioned

into the part coming from other members of the same cluster, and the

part coming from outside the cluster. In the empirical work below,

the differential effects of these two parts is explored.

    Before going on to describe the empirical results, I pause to

discuss the data used to construct the position vectors and the

spillover pooi. The technological position is based on the distribu—


5. Bernstein and Nadiri (1983) measure spillovers using a cost func-
tion approach and time series data for the chemical industry. Their
pooi variable is the unweighted sum of the R&D of all other firms in
the industry.

tion of the firm's patents over the 328 technology classes used by the

U.S. Patent Office. This information is available for the patents

granted between 1969 and 1981 to about 1700 manufacturing firms in the

R&D panel that has been assembled recently at the NBER. This dataset

is a marriage of Compustat and Patent Office data that is documented

in Cummins, et al (l98) and Bound, et al (l98t). The companies in

the dataset were granted about 260,000 patents. over the period. The

average firm has one or more patents in about 20 of the 328 classes.

The classes themselves vary greatly in importance, from "Chemistry,

carbon compounds" with 20,000 patents taken by 34O different firms to

"Bee culture" which has one patent. (There are eight classes in which

these firms took no patents, including "Land vehicles, animal draft"

and "Whips and whip apparatus.") To make the distribution vectors

empirically usable, the 328 classes were grouped into 149 categories.

This grouping was essentially ad hoc, based on the names, with more

aggregation of classe,s with few patents, and less aggregation of those

that had many.

    For this paper, a subsample of 573   firms   was selected. These

firms all reported R&D in 1976, received at least 10 patents over the

period, and are also available on the Harvard Business School PICA

database. The first two requirements bias the sample toward tech-

nology intensive firms, and the latter toward large firms. The firms

had average 1976 sales of $1.14 billion, they average 29.5   patents   per

year, and they reported average R&D of $25.1 million in 1976. The

technological position is based on all patents applied for by 1972.6

Table One lists the 19   patent   categories with some statistics for the

sample used in this paper.


    The nErket position vectors were constructed using the firm's

distribution of shipments over 4digit nnufacturing SIC's in 1972.

These data were taken from the PICA database at Harvard Business

School, described in Shesko (1982).      They are based on the assignment

of the firms' establishments to SIC's, and the aggregation of

establishment shipments. I aggregated these 1450 SIC's up to the 19

industry groups used in Bound, et al, which were designed to

correspond to the product field categories used by the NSF in its R&D

surveys. Table 2 shows these industries with some statistics; the

definition of the industries by constituent SIC's is given in Appendix A.

    To give some idea of what these vectors look like, Figure One

shows the distribution of the Herfindahi indices (the sums of the

squared fractions) of the patent category and industry shares for each

firm. It shows that, in this data, firms are far more diversified in

technology space than in market space. The median patent class

Herfindahl is about .18, while for the industry fraction vectors it is

about .68. This is not due primarily to the larger number of patent

categories; calculating the industry Herfindahi at the 3—digit level

   the database.

(139 industries) decreases it only to .31. I believe the difference

is partly real, due to the tendency for even narrow product lines to

incorporate several technologies. It is also partly an artifact of the

data. Patents are a much less lumpy observation than establishments,

so it is much easier to have a smattering of patents in many cate-

gories than it is to have a smattering of establishments in many

industries.

    Turning to the pool variable, this is constructed using the tech-

nological position vectors and some measure of the R&D of each firm.

As discussed below, for some purposes we want the pooi of R&D annual

flows, and for some we want the pooi of accumulated R&D stocks. If,

for example, rj is the 1976 R&D expenditure of firm j, then the 1976

R&D potential spillover pooi for firm i is:

              s P r     j
                                                                     (2)


where Pjj is the technological proximity of i and j as defined in (i).7

Note that Spence's 8 has been omitted from Eq. (2). As long as 0 is

constant across firms, this means only that the units of the pooi

variable are arbitrary. Since I will be estimating elasticities, this

is of no concern. To the extent, however, that 0 varies across firms,

the pooi variable is not measured correctly.

    A within—cluster spillover pool is calculated in the same manner,


7. In empirical work below, the variables ii••iK and s will be
   used as regressors in the same equation. Therefore, it may be use-
   ful to note the relation between s and the f's in matrix terms. Define
   F as the 573x49 matrix whose rows are the f1Ts. Let FN be the
  matrix derived from F by normalizing each row so its sum of squares
  is unity. Then the column vector s is given by s = (FNFN— I)r
  where r is the vector of firms' R&D spending.

but with the summation running only over firms in the same cluster.

The procedure for clustering the firms into technological groups is

described in Appendix B. Basically, I assume that the distribution of

each firm's patents over classes is generated by a stable im.iltinomial

distribution; I group firms so that the likelihood is high that the

patents of firms in the same group could have come from the same

underlying irultinomial distribution. This approach yields an itera-

tive clustering algorithm that simultaneously estimates the underlying

multinomial distributions for each group and assigns firms to groups.

The resulting groups are shown with some relevant statistics in Table

Three. Table Four presents a cross—tabulation of firms by these

groups and industries. For this purpose, the PICA industry distribu-

tion data was ignored, and the firms were assigned to industries on

the basis of their Compustat primary SIC.

    For these pools to be reasonable measures of the potential R&D

spillovers, it must be the case that the firms in the sample account

for most of the relevant R&D. The amount of R&D done by out of sample

firms is, of course, difficult to quantify, but two relevant com-

parisons can be made. First, the sample firms did 9)4% of the R&D

reported by all Compustat manufacturing companies in 1976. Second,

the current sample reported R&D equal to 86%   of   that reported to NSF

in its annual survey in manufacturing product areas. Table Five

presents a comparison by the 19 industry groups of the R&D of the

sample firms and the R&D reported to the NSF in the corresponding

product field. For this purpose, each firm's R&D was allocated to

industries in proportion to its (1972) sales. This, of course, under—

allocates to R&D—intensive industries, and to those that grew faster

than average 1972—76. The former is visible in the Table in the fact

that Food and Textiles both show more R&D by these firms than was

reported to NSF; the growth problem may partially explain the computer

shortfall. Even allowing for these tendencies, there appears to be

significant under—representation in the current sample in Computers,

Electrical Equipment, Communications and Aircraft and Aerospace. This

introduces a potential bias of unknown importance into the subsequent

analysis.


III. Research Intensity

    We test for technological position, industry and spillover effects

in 3 areas: the distribution of R&D effort itself, the production of

new knowledge, and the growth of total factor productivity. For R&D

intensity, we estimate an equation which is an extension of that used

in Bound, et al (1981):

            iog(r.)1log(.) +   2log(C.)   +   3M.   +   log(sT)   +


                           + kik +            ag+ c.
where r1 is the annual R&D of the 1th firm qi is its sales, C is its

capital stock, Mi is its sales—weighted average market share, and s1

is the pool of spilled research potentially available to it.8 The


8. Throughout this paper, the subscript k will refer to the tech-
   nological areas and the subscript 2 will refer to industries.
   Capital letters represent stocks, and lower case letters the
   related flows.
                                    —12—

superscripts T and C refer, respectively, to the total and within—

cluster poois. The ik and g1 are the patent class and industry

fractions defined above. All the ej's in this paper are stochastic

errors assumed independently but not necessarily identically distributed.

    This equation is not an R&D demand equation derived from optimal

firm behavior; it is simply a device to examine patterns of R&D

intensity descriptively. It is ntivated by heuristic arguments about

things that affect the cost and benefits of R&D. Since R&D is like a

fixed cost, greater sales imply a greater return to R&D, at least to

the extent that the external market for innovations is imperfect and

innovation itself cannot be expected to increase sales dramatically.

I include physical capital to allow for input complementarity, and for

comparability with Bound, et al.

    The firm's average market share is included on the notion that, in

an environment of imperfect appropriability, the knowledge that your

research nay help your competitors is a disincentive to your doing

R&D. Firms with large market shares may be less worried about this,

and hence choose a higher R&D intensity.

   The spillover pooi affects R&D by increasing its productivity;

this should cause the optimizing firm to choose a higher R&D intensity

where the pooi is greater.9 The inclusion of the log of the total

pool and the fraction that is within—cluster is an approximation to a



9. A more satisfactory story about the market share and pool effects
   requires explicit modelling of the firms' competitive interaction
   in the presence of spillovers. This will be a focus of future work.

specification where the "effective pool" is given by:
           s=(l   +   6)s   + s9 =   6s   +   s = s{l + 6(s?/s)]            (Ii)



where the superscript 0 refers to the out—of—cluster pool; 6 is then

the premium associated with the within—cluster portion. If 6(sd/sT)

is small, then log(sE)log(sT) + 6(5C/5T)•            For this sample, 5C75T has

a mean of .15; S turns out to be less than 1.

    If   variations in technological opportunity are a major factor in
determining the cost of R&D, then we would expect the technological
position   effects in Eq. (3) to be important; that is, we should reject

the hypothesis that the Ik's are all equal. Similarly, if variations

in demand are important determinants of the returns, this should be

reflected in the industry effects (the cL.'s).

    To estimate equation (3), a cross—section of firms for 1976 was

chosen, 1976 being the year in which R&D was reported for the greatest

number of firms. The definition of the R&D, sales, physical capital

and market share variables is described in Appendix A. The pool

variables are constructed using the weighted sum of other firms'

reported 1976 R&D. In order to use the same sample in this and the

next section, firms with no patents 1975—77 were dropped (though their

R&D is still in the pool), leaving 537 firms.

    The first column of Table 6 tests for market share and spillover

effects without allowing industry or technological position effects.

Both effects are positive and significant quantitatively and statisti-

cally. The cluster premium 6 is also positive and significant. These

effects remain, though the pool effect is diminished, when we add

industry- effects in Column 2; in addition, the industry effects are

highly significant. Column 3 gives the results controlling for tech-

nological position effects but not industry effects. Again the pooi

variable is significant, but the cluster premium now goes to zero.

The technological area effects are also significant themselves.

    Column 14   allows for all effects. The pool coefficient is signifi-
cant, with no evidence of a premium for the within—cluster portion.1°

The elasticity of own R&D with respect to the weighted sum of all

others is between .2 and .3. It should be emphasized that the absence

of a premium for the within—cluster firms says only that after

weighting by proximity, there is no further differential to the in—

cluster firms (who are proximate by construction).

    These results imply a significant effect of the spillover pool

at a given location in technology space, over and above the ttpurefl

positional effect that is interpreted in terms of technological

opportunity. There is no way of knowing, however, that the pattern of

technological opportunity can be captured completely by a linear rela-

tionship with the position variables as specified here. Since the

pooi variable depends (non—linearly-) on position, it could be picking

up residual higher—order technological opportunity effects. If we

were to allow for an arbitrarily complicated pattern of technological

opportunity, we could not distinguish a separate effect of spillovers,

even in principle, since any reasonable definition of the spillover


10. It should seem peculiar that the t—statistic for the pool coef-
   ficient is so much more significant than the F—statistic for both
   pool—related coefficients. This is due to the fact that the white
   correction, in this case, reduces the estimated si.andard error; the
   F—statistics have not been corrected.
                                    —15—

pool imist depend on technological position. Restricting technological

opportunity effects to being linear in technological position should,

therefore, be viewed as an untestable identifying restriction.

    The market and technological position effects are also both

significant, as theory would predict. Note that the difference in

significance between the two is nostly due to degrees of freedom; the

fraction of the variance explained by the market effects is only

slightly larger. (See Table Ten and related discussion below.)


IV. Knowledge Production

    The next area in which the effects of spillovers should be detec-

table is in the innovative output of the firm. We postulate a pro-

duction function for new knowledge which, after taking logs, has the form:

         log(k.)1log(r.) +
                                    T
                             2log(s.)   +
                                               CT
                                            6(s./s.)
                                +
                                    k1k + czg+ 2i
where k is the new knowledge produced by the firm and the other

variables are as above.1-1- In practice, we use patents as an indicator

for k.-2 Note that this formulation implies that spillovers increase

the productivity of own R&D; below I allow them also to influence


11. Actually, we expect knowledge production to depend on a distributed
   lag of R&D, but this lag structure is difficult to identify, and
   much of the weight appears to fall on the contemporaneous R&D. See
   Fakes and Griliches (198)4) and Hall, Griliches and Hausinan (1983).
12. There has been a long debate on the general question of the use-
   fulness of patent data as an indicator of inventive output. For pre-
   sent purposes, suffice it to say that patents have repeatedly
   passed tests of their economic relevance. See Schmookler (1966),
   Fakes and Griliches (198)4), Bound, et al (198)4), Fakes (198)4), and
   Hirschey (1982).

conventional output productivity directly. As above, the parameter 6

is the premium for the in—cluster pool.

    The interpretation of the technological position and industry

effects in (5)      requires   comment. Differences in technological oppor-

tunity should again cause technological area effects to be important.

In addition, there are significant variations in the "propensity to

patent" different, kinds of knowledge. This is because the value of

patent protection differs for different technologies, as does the dif-

ficulty of successful application. This has the effect of associating

differing amounts of knowledge and differing amounts of R&D with each

patent. These variations will appear as technological position

effects. A priori, we do not expect industry effects to be important

here, but   allow    for them to see if the data are consistent with this view.

    The knowledge production function (5) was estimated on the same

1916 cross—section of 537 firms. iFor k, we use the average patent

applications l975—1977, attempting to average out some of the noise in

the patent data. The correct way to model the patent process is to

take into account the integer nature of patents. This is done using

Poisson—type models as in Hall, Griliches and Hausman (1983). To

simplify, I ignore this complication and estimate the log—log regres-

sion This is why the zero patent observations had to be dropped.13

   The columns of Table Seven are analagous to those of Table Six.

The spillover effect is significant throughout. Interestingly, its



13 . There are relatively few of these firms, since 10 or more patents
   1969—79 were required for initial inclusion in the sample.
                                    —17—

magnitude is greater when we control for technological position and

such control also results in a within—cluster premium that is positive

and significant. The coefficients imply that the positive externality

from spillovers outweighs any negative competitive effects; a 10%

increase in the R&D of all firms would increase total patents by about

17%; 7% from the effect of their own R&D on their own   patents,   and 10%

from the collective effect of the increased pool (ignoring the feed-

back effect which the previous estimation implies would induce addi-

tional increases in R&D).

    At first glance, this may seem like an implausibly large spillover

effect. I believe, however, that it is consistent with a reasonable

picture of R&D as a partial public good. In terms of marginal pro-

ducts evaluated at the mean of the data, the coefficients imply a

return of 1.7 patents per million dollars of own R&D, .05 patents per

million dollars of other firms' relevant R&D if they are outside the

firm's cluster, and .09 patents per million dollars of other firms'

relevant R&D if they are in the same cluster.

    Allowing for industry effects has little effect on the pooi coef-

ficient, and the industry effects are not significant after controlling

for the other two. Thus we get the expected result on the unimpor-

tance of industries in knowledge production. The technological area

effects are marginally significant when controlling for spillovers and

industry effects.

V. Total Factor Productivity

    The final area investigated is the conventional overall produc-

tivity of the firm. We postulate a Cobb—Douglass production function



                     23E'
for the firm's output:


               L1   Ct Kt (s1) exp(L 1kfk)eXP(L a,g)                        (6)

                                             k                £

where Lit is labor input and Kt is the stock of knowledge of the firm.

   is the effective pool of the stocks of other firms' research, ana—

lagous to the pooi of their research flows above. I take logarithmic

time derivatives and convert this into an equation for growth rates:



    (/)1= {L/L)t      +
                          2(/c)1 + 3(/R)         it
                                                         +   (E/E)
                                  +              +   .                (T)




Thus, in this formulation, the technological position effects are

interpretable as differing rates of exogenous technological progress.

In a perfect world, we would again expect no industry effects to be

important in this equation. In such a world we would be measuring

true shifts in the production function, which should not be explained

by industry assignments once we control for technological position.

In reality, however, there are three reasons to allow for industry

effects. First, to get a measure of real output we need price

deflators; these are imperfect and the errors in them have a distinct

industry pattern (Griliches and Lichtenberg, l984). Second, since
                                               —19—

    input measures are not corrected for capacity utilization, changes in

    this affect measured productivity. We certainly expect the growth

    rate of capacity utilization to show an industry pattern. Finally,

    including industry effects should mitigate the simultaneity bias that

    may   be   present due to the influence of the (expected) growth rate of

    demand     on R&D.

          I   postulate    once again that the effective spillover pool is a

    weighted sum of the in—cluster and out—of—cluster pools. It turns

    out, however, that the approximation used above does not work empiri-

    cally in this equation. Instead, we write:
•

                S=       s + xs = s[i + A(s/s)];                               (8a)



                                                                               (8b)
                 (SE/SE)      (SC/SC) + A(S0/SC)

    where A is the relative value of the out—of—cluster portion with the

    in—cluster portion given weight of unity, and the • indicates the time

    derivative of the entire expression in parentheses. The approximation

    is now valid only if X(SO/SC) is small. Though S° is larger than

    A turns out to be essentially zero, so the approximation is valid.

          There are two conceptual issues that must be addressed regarding K

    in Eq. (7).      First,    in most work along these lines, the R&D stock is

    substituted for the knowledge stock, giving R&D a role directly anala—

    gous to physical investment in the production of output. Here,

    however, such an approach would be inconsistent with the previous

    assumption that the growth of the knowledge stock does not depend on
                                                    —20--


R&D investment alone. A more consistent approach is to use the patent

stock as an indicator of accumulated knowledge. Both of these

approaches are utilized in the empirical work described below)-

    The second issue relates to the interpretation of                                  and is most

clearly stated in the context where the R&D stock is used for K. If

we were to estimate Eq. (7) as written, we would be assuming that the

output elasticity of the R&D stock is constant across firms. If firms

choose inputs optimally, this is inconsistent with the large observed

variations in R&D intensity)-5 An alternative is to assume that the

marginal product, not the elasticity, is constant (Griliches and

Lichtenberg (198}4)). That is:

         3    (3q/3R)(R/q)            p(R/q)                                                    (9)
where the stock of research R has been used instead of K and the firm

subscripts have been suppressed. If we substitute (Bb) and (9) into

(7) and note that the time derivative of R is r (neglecting depreciation):l6


    (q/q) =
         it   1
                  (L/) it   +
                                2
                                    (c/c) it   +   p(r/q) it         +       (SC/SC)
                                                                                        it


                                  .
                            + X(SO/SC)         +    g   f   +         a g        + 6           (10)

                                                                         2.12.         31


14. One might also argue that the pooi variable should be based on the
   output (patents) rather than the input. There are two reasons to
   avoid that approach. First, the, variations in the propensity to
   patent make the interpretation of patent spillovers difficult
   (Jaffe (1983)). Further, patents do, after all, have something to
   do with appropriation. It seems problematic to use them as a
   measure of the potential leakage.
15. R&D intensity varies across firms far more than does capital or
   labor intensity (Schankerman (1978)).
16. In applying this formulation to industry data, Griliches and
   Lichtenberg (198I) found that a zero depreciation rate yielded a
   better fit than any other.
                                    —21—



Estimating (10) instead of (7) means assuming that it is the marginal

product of R&D, not its output elasticity, that is constant across

firms, as suggested by economic theory.

    In the formulation that uses the patents for the growth in

knowledge rather than R&D, it is less clear that this approach is

superior. The marginal product of patents is not likely to be equal

across industries, since their cost varies greatly, as discussed

above. The constant elasticity approach may therefore be more

reasonable a priori. In empirical work it was found that only the rate

of return form yields significant coefficients, so that form is

reported below.

    The same issue, and the same ambiguity, arise with the pool

variable. Here, there is no economic force whatsoever equalizing

rates of return because this is an input over which the firm has no

control. Also, since we do not know Spence's 0, the units of the pool

variable are not really right. We choose therefore to stick with the

conventional elasticity approach for this variable.


    The TFP equations were estimated using logarithmic differences,

1972—1977. The poois of other firms' R&D stocks were calculated for

each of these years. The construction of the R&D stocks is described

in Appendix A. For the R&D version, ratios of R&D to sales were

calculated as the average of the 1972 and 1977 ratios.1T   For the

patent version, average patents 1975—1977 was divided by the average


17. This eliminated 1)46 firms that did not report R&b in one of those
   years.

     Table 8 presents the result of the R&D version. Again the

columns are arranged in the same pattern. With no industry or tech-

nological area effects (Column 1), the pool effect is insignificant.

Adding industry effects improves things greatly. The physical capital

coefficient becomes more reasonable, and the pool coefficient becomes

significant; the industry effects themselves are also significant.

Adding the technological position variables has a similar effect on

the other coefficients, and the technological effects are significant

when added alone. When all three effects are allowed, the pool

variable is marginally significant, but neither industry nor tech-

nological effects are significant after allowing for the other and the

pool effect. The parameter A is essentially zero throughout, indi-

cating that only the within—cluster pool has a discernible affect on

TFP growth.

     The estimated R&D coefficient of about 1.3 (over 5 years) implies

that each dollar of R&D yields an annual sales increase of about 25

cents. The interpretation of this figure is clouded because R&D

employees and machines are also included in L and C. The R&D

coefficient may be roughly a measure of the excess return to R&D (See

Schankerman (1981)). Since, however, we are not controlling for

materials, this 25 cents is not pure profit. If materials are roughly

half of sales, this implies an excess return to own R&D in the neigh-

borhood of 10—15%. Another way to evaluate the own R&D effect is to

look at the implied elasticity of sales with respect to R&D, which, by

(9), is pK(R/q.). Using the estimate of 1.34 from column , we get
                                       —23--


1.311/5=.268 for PK   in   annual terms. Evaluating R/q at the sample

means, this yields an estimate of the elasticity of .030.

    The pooi coefficient is directly an elasticity. It says that when

all your neighbors increase their R&D by 10%, you can produce 1% more

output with the same amount of capital and labor.

     Table 9 presents the results for the sales equation using patents

rather than R&D as the measure of new kno1edge. Because patents

measure new knowledge production only with a large amount of error,

OLS estimates in this case would be severely biased. Therefore, we

utilize 2SLS with the R&D to sales ratio and pool (flow) to sales

ratio as instruments. The results are broadly similar to the R&D

form. Here, the pool effect is significant throughout; again neither

technological position nor industries is significant after controlling

for the other.l8

    The patent/sales coefficient shows a slightly different pattern

than the R&D coefficient. The latter fell when we controlled for

technological position effects, a pattern consistent with the tech-

nological opportunity story, if R&D and productivity growth are both

high where opportunity is high. The patent coefficient, however,

increases when we add technological area effects. It is not clear

what interpretation to give to this.



18. The instrumental variable method renders the usual F—test invalid,
   since the restricted and unrestricted sum of squares are no longer
   independent. We must resort to an asymptotic chi—square test,
   called the test of over—identifying restrictions by Hausman (198k).

      If we    take   the   patent coefficient from Column 4, we get an esti.—

mate of the marginal product of a patent of about 1.0 million dollars

over 5 years, or about $200,000 in terms of the annual sales increase.

By   the   same argument as     above,   this implies a return to patenting over

and   above the normal return to the R&D that produced it on the order
of $100,000 per year per patent granted.19 The patent elasticity eva-
luated at the sample mean for K/q             is   about .039.
VI. CONCLUSION

      This paper attempts to address an old question ——            market   pull
versus     technology push —— and        a newer question —— the importance of

spillovers    —— by thinking about the location of firms in technology and

market space. I find that, when allowing for all 3 effects, both

technological position and industry are significant in explaining R&D

intensity; the technological effects are significant in explaining

patent productivity, and we cannot distinguish between the two in

explaining TFP growth (at 1% significance). In interpreting these

statistical statements, it is important to remember that different

degrees of freedom are involved in each case. For perspective, Table

Ten shows the simple analysis of variance for these and the spillover

effects. Note, for example, that the technological effects actually

explain considerably more of the TFP           residual   than do the market

effects. Overall the pattern of effects is roughly what we would




19. The zero depreciation assumption implicit in this formulation may
   be more problematic for patents than for R&D.

expect on the basis of theory,   with   the qualifications discussed above

regarding price indices and capacity utilization in the TFP equation.

Both technolor and industry are important in explaining R&D intensity

and measured TFP growth; in patent productivity the technological

effects predominate.

    If we were to view the patent equation in isolation, there is no

way to distinguish whether the technological position effects repre-

sent differences in opportunity or in the propensity to patent. If,

however, it were only the latter, we would not expect the effect to

carry over to the other equations.

    One question raised by the degrees of freedom issue is the sen-

sitivity of the results to the fineness of classification used in

constructing the patent and sales distribution vectors. Exhaustive

sensitivity analysis on this point would be quite expensive, but I did

make a few experimental attempts to find a 20 category patent break-

down and a 50 category SIC grouping. I found that using the former

reduced the fit quite a bit, while using the latter improved the fit

very little over the results reported herein.

    I find evidence of the effects of spillovers in several aspects

of the innovation process, with the positive externalities apparently

outweighing any negative competitive effects. When R&D in a firm's

vicinity increases, the firm does more R&D itself, it produces more

patents per R&D dollar, and its productivity grows faster, even

controlling for the increased R&D and patents. These effects are pre—

sent controlling for both industry and technological position effects

as measured by sales and patent distributions.
                                     —26--


    It is interesting, and perhaps surprising, that these spillover

effects "travel" quite far in technology space. In both the R&D and

patent equations, a significant portion of the spillover effect is

generated by firms outside the receiving firm's cluster. Only in the

TFP growth equation is the spillover effect apparently localized. It

is not clear whether this difference is substantive or an artifact of

the pooi variable, construction. For the TFP equation, it is the ratio

of the 1977 to 1972 pooi of R&D stocks that is relevant. For this

variable, the variance of the total pool is only 6.5% of the within

cluster pool. By contrast, for the pool of annual flows the variance

of the total is twice that of the within—cluster portion. Thus it may

simply be that the overall pool changes too slowly to discern its

impact in this type of regression.

    The strongest spillover effect was found in the patent equation.

As noted above, the estimates imply that the majority of the patents

produced by a general increase in R&D come from the spillover effect.

There is one possible problem with interpretation in this equation

that should be noted. Patents are an indicator of innovation, but

they are also a tool of appropriation. It could be that when others

do more R&D, the firm worries more about protecting its own results

and hence takes out more patents without necessarily producing more

innovation. While there is probably something to this explanation, it

seems unlikely that it is the dominant effect. If it were, I would

expect the within—cluster premium to be much greater. As it is, the

out—of—cluster portion is typically contributing 2/3 or more of the
                                    —27'—


total effective pooi. These "long distance" spillovers are likely to

be in the nature of basic research results, rather than very specific

developments. Such research would not seem likely to induce an

increasing propensity to patent.

    There are three logical next steps that will be explored in sub-

sequent research. The technological relationships embodied in the TFP

and patent equations will be combined with assumptions about com-

petitive behavior to yield an R&D demand equation incorporating

spillovers. This should permit estimation of the three equations as a

consistent system. In addition, this paper did not utilize fully the

panel nature of the available data. Both the Compustat data and the

patent class data are available over time. This may permit a fuller

exploration of the spillover effects.

    Finally, we have assumed herein that the conditions of appropri—

ability do not depend on industry or technological area. This is

surely wrong. To get a really useful picture of the spillover pheno-

menon, it will be necessary to allow for variations in the appropri—

ability environment. This is not, however, simply a matter of

allowing the coefficients to vary across the sample. Rather, varia-

tions in the appropriability environment have to be incorporated in

the construction of the pooi variable, since what is relevant is the

environment of the spilling firm, not the receiving firm.

   With multiple caveats on the interpretation of the present

results, it is still interesting to dramatize their implications for

the importance of the spillover phenomenon. As a thought experiment,

imagine generating somehow an exogenous increase of 10% in the R&D of
                                     —28—

all manufacturing firms. Ignoring the feedback to even greater R&D

implied by the R&D intensity equation, the estimates herein predict a

17% increase in patents as a result. This, in turn, would lead to a

1.8% increase in output with given capital and labor, partially from

the direct effect and partly from the spillovers. Without spillovers

at either stage we would have predicted oniy a 7% increase in patents

and only a .3% increase in output.

II.OTHER VARIABLES

Sales:   Deflated sales was calculated from Compustat sales figures
         using firm—specific price deflators, constructed as weighted
         averages of price series at the 14—digit SIC level. These
         price deflators are from the Bureau of Industrial Engineering
         of the U.S. Commerce Department. The firm weights are based
         on 1978 Compustat Business Segment Data. For more detail,
         see Addanki, et al (1983)
R&D:     Taken from Compustat, with some addition of data from 10K
         reports where Compustat data was missing. See Cummins, et al (1982)
Net
Plant:   An estimate of the inflation—adjusted depreciated capital
         stock of the firm. It is based on the book value of net
         plant times the ratio of an investment deflator for the year
         to the investment deflator n years ago, where n is an esti-
         mate of the average age of the firm's capital. For details,
         see Cummins, et al (1982)
R&D
Stocks: The R&D stocks used to construct the pooi of stocks were
         calculated from R&D flows assuming 15%/year depreciation, and
         using as a starting value the first reported flow value
         divided by .22 (15% depreciation plus an assumed 7% annual
         growth in the flow since to). See Addanki, et al (1983)
Market
Share:   The PICA database gives market shares for each b—digit SIC in
         which a firm has sales. To form the firm average, these were
         weighted by the fraction of the firm's sales going to the SIC.

                             APPENDIX B:

               DESCRIPTION OF THE CLUSTERING PROCEDURE



    Clustering is a generic term for a variety of techniques for

grouping observations on multivariate data. The objective is to

arrange the data in groups so that, in some sense, the observations

are similar to other observations in the same group and dissimilar to

all others. The easiest way to think of this is to visualize the

observations in multi—dimensional space, and imagine grouping them so

that the distances from the group means are minimized.

    For many observations and even a few potential groups, the number

of possible clusterings is a big number——not big like the federal

budget deficit, but big like the number of atoms in the solar system.

This fact, plus the fact that the objective function is grossly non—

concave with respect to rearrangements, means that no clustering pro-

cedure exists that is guaranteed to find the best clustering for any

real data. All procedures are somewhat ad hoc, results are sensitive

to initial conditions, and no meaningful statistical tests of the

resulting clustering can be performed. Clustering is a data descrip-

tion or simplification tool, not an analytic one. Its usefulness

rests on facilitating subsequent analysis.

    In the present application the goal is to identify groups of firms

doing research in similar areas. The data to be used for this purpose

is the distribution of the firms9 patents over classes. The key attri-

bute of these data is that they can be viewed as being generated by some
                                    —33—

(unknown) underlying niultinomial distribution: for each patent granted,

the firm takes a draw from this distribution to determine what class the

patent will be in. This particular structure of the data makes it

possible to construct a clustering procedure with an explicit probabi-

listic basis. The clustering problem is the identification of groups

of firms whose patents are generated by the same distribution; firms in

different clusters draw their patents from different distributions.

These underlying distributions must be estimated as we do the

clustering, giving the procedure a bootstrap flavor.

    The procedure utilized here is derived from something called the

k—means algorithm in the clustering literature (Hartigan (1975),

McQueen (1967)). In the k—means algorithm, observations are somehow

grouped into k initial groups; the k means of these groups are calcu-

lated, and firms are then reassigned to the group such that the

Euclidean distance to the group mean is minimized. Here, the multino-.

mial nature of the data is exploited to derive an assignment criterion

other than Euclidean distance. Instead of calculating group means, we

calculate the fraction of all patents granted to firms in that cluster

that occurred in each category:

         jk( 'ik1            'ik                                    (Al)
             icj     icj k

where j indexes clusters, i indexes firms, and k indexes categories.

jk is the probability of a patent issued to a firm in cluster,j being

in category k; nik is the number of patents issued to firm i in

category k. On the provisional assumption that all firms in cluster j
                                       —34—

derive their patents from the same multinomial distribution, these

fractions   are the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters of
the distribution.
    We now consider reassigning the firms to other clusters.     For each

firm/cluster combination, we calculate the probability of the firm's

observed distribution having come from the estimated inultinomial para-

meter vector for the cluster. This probability is:

                                                                     (A2)
            pij=[ni.!/ nik!Jffjkik

where n. is firm l's total patents. For the next iteration, the firm

is assigned to the cluster where this probability is greatest.

Fortunately, this can be simplified by noting that the term in

brackets does not depena on j, and hence is irrelevant to the maximi-

zation and can be ignored. Also, maximizing log(pjj) is the same as

maximizing pij so what we really do is to choose j for each i to

maximize:

            log()jjk nlog(1rj)                                       (A3)



When this is finished, we recalculate the vectors Jrj using the new

assignments; then we begin again. The process is continued until no

reassignments occur • 20

    Using this procedure, it is natural to develop a measure of good—

ness of fit based on the log likelihood of the data conditional on the




20. Fq. (A3) is not defined for lTjkO. In practice,, if    is zero and
   ik is not, we set Pij to zero, preventing assignment of i to
   cluster i. If           is zero and 51k is also, we set nlog(nj) to zero.

final   clustering. The actual log likelihood is a mess, because it

includes the bracketed term in Eq. (A2). We can, however, calculate a

likelihood ratio in which these terms all cancel out. If we define

    as the fraction of all firms' patents taken in category k, we can

calculate the log probability that each firm's patents come from that

grand multiriomial distribution. If we sum these over all firms, and

subtract this from the sum of log probabilities conditional on the

clustering, the bracketed terms drop out, leaving:

          LR=fl n. log(ir )
             1k ik      jk
                              — n. log(ir
                              ik ik         k)                        (1)

This "statistic" measures the improvement in the likelihood gained by

considering the firms' patents as coming from the cluster multinomial

distributions rather than one grand distribution. The word statistic

is in quotes because it has no known distribution, and probably no

knowable distribution. It is only a qualitative and comparative

measure of the fit.

    This multinomial clustering procedure has several problems.

First, it is not guaranteed to converge. Since the firms are con-

sidered for reassignment one at a time, it is quite possible for a

firm to be assigned to a cluster that is in fact worse than its

current one, once all reassignments are taken into account. The process

can wander about, repeatedly moving firms back and forth. This beha-

vior was observed and will be discussed below. It is not even assured

that the likelihood function will improve at each iteration, although

behavior where this was not the case was not observed. Even when the
                                    —36—


procedure does converge, there is no guarantee that it is to a global
maximum. In practice, one can only try various initial conditions and

pick the best fit found.

   Finally, this procedure does not determine the number of clusters

to be identified. One can only try various numbers; of course, the

fit should always improve when the number is increased. It maybe

possible to calculate something like an adjusted R2 that would measure

the quality of the fit, controlling for the number of clusters. This

has not been done. In this application, it was found that the con—

vergence properties of the procedure deteriorated quite suddenly if

the number of clusters was made too small, so the smallest number that

worked reasonably well was used.

    The initial conditions for the clustering are specified by a set

of unique hypothetical multinomial distributions, as many distribu-

tions as clusters desired; the iterative process is begun by assigning

firms to these vectors using the likelihood criterion. Two general

methods of obtaining these starting distributions were used. One

method was to use the actual distributions over particular groupings

of the data itself, as in the McQueen k—means algorithm. The other

method was to specify arbitrarily distributions designed to be "far

apart" in technolor space and yet expected to attract significant

numbers of firms. The results from several attempts are summarized in

Appendix Table One. The approach which seemed to work the best was to

choose a subset of the patent categories themselves, specifically

those that had many firms having that category as the firm's primary
                                    —37—

one. For this subset of categories, vectors were formed with .95 as

the probability for the category- and .001 as the probability for all

others.21 This set of pseudo—unit vectors was used as the starting

seeds. Thus, on the first iteration, each firm is assigned to the

cluster corresponding to its primary category, if its primary category-

is one of the targets; if not, it Is assigned to its second, third,

fourth, or whatever is necessary. Then, the actual distribution vec-

tors of these clusters are calculated, and away we go.

    The question of the number of clusters was settled when the

program refused to converge if asked to find less than about 20

clusters. The final run, which was used in the regressions described

in the body of the paper, to be used below, resulted in 21 clusters,

which are summarized in Table 3. The name of the cluster is the

name of the patent category that served as the initial cluster seed.

This clustering was arrived at by starting with 23 targets, and then

dropping two clusters that were small and close to others. Having

done this, the program was also run starting at the beginning with

the corresponding 21 pseudo—unit vectors, and a very similar

clustering resulted.

    Although it is obviously difficult to tell, the final clustering

seems to be doing what we want it to do: distinguishing firms' tech-

nological focus. For example, Adhesives and Coatings picks up a mix—




21. Zeros are avoided because no firm can be assigned to a cluster
   that has a zero probability in any category for which the firm has
   even a single patent. (See note 20 above.)

ture of textile and paper companies. A few oil companies get nved in

with the chemical companies. Xerox, an "office equipment" company- by

SIC, is at the center of the Chemistry-, Electrochemistry cluster,

along with Kodak and Polaroid. Interestingly, the big auto companies

end up in Power plants (i.e. engines), leaving the equipment makers

like John Deere and International Harvester in the Vehicles c1uter.22

    A known problem with clustering techniques in general is that they

are capable of finding clusters where none exist. To get some indica-

tion of whether these data are "truly" clustered, a simulation experi-

ment was conducted. Fake patent vectors for each firm were generated,

using the firm's true total patents, but distributing them over classes

randomly based on draws from the grand multinomial distribution of all

the data. That is, observations were generated that truly- belonged in

one cluster. The clustering program was run on this data, using as

starting seeds those used in the 21 cluster final run. After 10

iterations, the procedure was still reassigning over 100 firms at each

iteration. The likelihood ratio was about 6000 (compared to 81000 in

the chosen clustering) and was not improving,23 providing some evidence

that, when the procedure convergences in a well—behaved manner, some

true clustering of the data does exist.

23. The fact that this clustering yielded a LR of 6000 is an indication
   of why the usual chi—square tests do not apply.
