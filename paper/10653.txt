                                        ABSTRACT

Women have worse self-rated health and more hospitalization episodes than men from early
adolescence to late middle age, but are less likely to die at each age. We use 14 years of data from
the U.S. National Health Interview Survey to examine this paradox. Our results indicate that the
difference in self-assessed health between women and men can be entirely explained by differences
in the distribution of the chronic conditions they face. Although on average women have worse self-
rated health than men, women and men with the same chronic conditions have the same self-rated
health. The results for hospital episodes are somewhat different. While the effect of poor health on
hospital episodes is the same for men and women, men with respiratory cancer, cardiovascular
disease, and bronchitis are more likely to experience hospital episodes than women who suffer from
the same chronic conditions, implying that men may experience more severe forms of these
conditions. The same is true for mortality. Although the effects of many chronic conditions on the
probability of death are the same for women and men, men who report having cardiovascular disease
and certain lung disorders are significantly more likely to die than women with these conditions.
While some of the gender difference in mortality can be explained by differences in the distribution
of chronic conditions, an equally large share can be attributed to the larger adverse effects of these
conditions on male mortality. Is smoking the smoking gun? Conditions for which we find excess
male hospitalizations and mortality are generally smoking-related.

I. Introduction

Research on gender differences in health has brought to light an important paradox. Studies from a

large number of countries find that women use more health services and report worse self-rated

health than men. However, women are less likely to die than same-aged men throughout life,

indicating that they may in fact be healthier.

        There are several possible explanations for the worse self-rated health but lower mortality of

women. There may be gender differences in the distributions of chronic conditions, driven by

biological, behavioral or psychosocial factors (Verbrugge, 1989; Lawlor et al, 2001; Molarius and

Janson, 2002). Women may be more likely than men to suffer from health conditions such as

arthritis or headaches that result in poorer self-rated health but contribute relatively little to mortality

risk; men may be more likely to have conditions such as cardiovascular disease or respiratory

conditions that, although they contribute to worse self-rated health, also have relatively large effects

on the probability of death. Although this explanation does not address why women and men have

different distributions of health conditions, it can potentially account for the gender differences in

self-rated health and mortality observed in the data.

        Another possible explanation is that women are in fact healthier than men (as evidenced by

their lower mortality), but simply report worse health on surveys. A commonly-held view is that

women, being less stoical than men, are more likely to factor less serious ailments into their reports

of poor health (Spiers et al, 2003). A twist on the same idea is that women are more accurate health

reporters than men: they know more about their own health, perhaps due to their greater health care

utilization, and are more willing to discuss their health and admit health problems to interviewers

(Verbrugge 1989, Idler 2003). While these ideas are expressed in many papers, they are not

uncontroversial. Some evidence contrary to this view comes from MacIntyre, Ford and Hunt (1999),

who report on a study that asked men and women open-ended questions about health problems,

followed by probes for specific health conditions. They find that men provided more complete

information than women in response to the open-ended question. Although this evidence is not
paired with “objective” data on health that could be used to assess the accuracy of reports, it suggests

that men are not less forthcoming than women in interviews.

        A final possible explanation for the paradox is that the ‘facts’ underlying it are incorrect.

Although the higher mortality of men is not in dispute, there is a literature that questions whether

women have worse self-rated health and, more generally, higher rates of many measures of

morbidity than men (Hunt and Annandale 1999). For example, MacIntyre, Hunt and Sweeting

(1996) find evidence from two (relatively small) British samples that gender differences in reports

of fair or poor health are significant only in very early adulthood, and that although women have

higher rates of psychological distress than men, they do not have higher rates of many specific

physical conditions. Some researchers find that gender differences in self-rated health become

smaller at older ages (Case and Deaton 2003), and others find gender difference in self-rated health

disappear in old age (Leinonen et al, 1997; Arber and Cooper, 1999).

        The first explanation of the paradox — that gender differences in self-rated health and

mortality are driven by differences across genders in the distributions of chronic conditions—is

entirely consistent with women having higher rates of some illnesses than men, but lower rates of

others. In fact, this first explanation requires that gender differences in prevalence rates vary across

health conditions. Much of the literature that disputes whether women have higher rates of

morbidity than men is concerned with establishing that women do not suffer from excess levels of

all measures of ill health—a point with which we agree, and will provide evidence in support of

below. We are concerned with the more precise issue of why women have worse self-rated health

but lower mortality than men. As part of our investigation into gender differences in self-rated

health and mortality, we also examine gender differences in hospital episodes. Unlike doctor’s

visits, which may be influenced by patient’s demand for health care and perceptions of illness,

hospital episodes provide a more “objective” measure of health status that can be compared with

both self-rated health and mortality, and help provide a bridge between these two health measures.



                                                    2
       Our analyses are based on fourteen years of U.S. data from the National Health Interview

Survey (1986-1994, 1997-2001 NHIS) and its associated Multiple Cause of Death file, which

provides information on deaths of those interviewed between 1986 and 1994. The surveys are ideal

for our purpose because they contain information on self-rated health, hospital episodes and

mortality, as well as detailed information on chronic health conditions that may contribute to both

self-rated health and mortality. In addition, the survey covers large numbers of adult men and

women: our analyses of self-rated health and hospitalization use a sample of 147,996 adult men and

women surveyed between 1997 and 2001, and our analyses of mortality use a sample of 237,140

men and women ages 45-84 surveyed from 1986 to 1994. These large samples make it possible to

obtain precise estimates of the gender differences in health measures at each age and of the effects

of (sometimes rare) chronic health conditions on self-rated health and mortality.

        Section II discusses the data and show that it is consistent with the basic facts of the puzzle:

women have worse self-rated health and more hospitalization episodes than men from early

adolescence to late middle age; but they are less likely to die at each age. Section III examines the

validity of the explanations offered for this paradox. Our results indicate that the difference in self-

assessed health between women and men can be entirely explained by differences in the distribution

of conditions. Although on average women have worse self-rated health than men, women and men

with the same sets of chronic conditions have the same self-rated health. The results for hospital

episodes are somewhat different. While the effect of poor health on hospital episodes is the same for

men and women, men with respiratory cancer, cardiovascular disease, and bronchitis are more likely

to experience hospital episodes than women who suffer from the same chronic conditions, implying

that men may experience more severe forms of these conditions. The same is true for mortality.

Although the effects of many chronic conditions on the probability of death are the same for women

and men, men who report having cardiovascular disease and certain lung disorders are significantly

more likely to die than women with these conditions. While some of the gender difference in



                                                    3
mortality can be explained by differences in the distribution of chronic conditions, an equally large

share can be attributed to the larger adverse effects of these conditions on male mortality.

       Our results move us some distance in understanding the paradox between self-assessed

health and mortality. That men and women with the same health conditions report the same self-

rated health status, and the fact that poor health is equally predictive of hospitalization episodes for

men and women, casts doubt on the idea that women and men use different standards for assessing

self-rated health. However, our mortality results cannot be explained solely by differences in the

distribution of chronic conditions. Men with smoking-related conditions are significantly more

likely to die within two years than are women with the same conditions. These men will, on

average, have had longer exposure to smoking in their lives, and their reports of (say) emphysema

may indicate more advanced cases than do women’s reports.

       Our findings and their interpretation are important for several reasons. Self-reported health

status is a tool often used to assess wellbeing. If women and men take different aspects of health

into account, or weight them differently in their self assessments, it is important to understand why

and how this is the case. In addition, if historically higher rates of smoking are responsible for the

higher mortality rates men face in middle age, then we would anticipate the gap in age-adjusted

mortality rates will close, given the changes observed in women’s and men’s smoking patterns over

the last century. Finally, if the chronic conditions that lead to higher risk of mortality are given

budget priority over those that lead to poorer self-assessed health, then research and treatment of

important health conditions observed in women may be underfunded.



II. Data and Preliminary Evidence

A. Data

The data for this study are drawn from the National Health Interview Surveys (NHIS) conducted

between 1986 and 1994, and 1997 to 2001, and from the associated NHIS Multiple Cause of Death

Public Use Data File that contains information on deaths (as of 1997) of individuals surveyed

                                                    4
between 1986 and 1994. The NHIS is a cross-sectional household interview survey that covers the

civilian non-institutionalized population living in the United States. The survey collects information

on self-rated health, chronic health conditions, health care utilization, and socio-demographics.

       Between 1986 and 1996, health information was collected for each member of sampled

households. While all households were administered the same basic questionnaire, each household

was randomly assigned to one of six “Condition Lists,” and information was collected only on

household members’ experience with the chronic conditions included on the assigned list. The

structure of the survey changed in important ways in 1997. While basic health information

continued to be collected for all household members, information on chronic conditions among

adults was collected only from a single “sample adult” in each household, who was asked about a

full range of chronic conditions.

       Because of the redesign and the timing of the Multiple Cause of Death File, we mainly rely

on two distinct samples to study self-rated health and mortality. The 1997-2001 sample, consisting

of 147,996 “sample adult” men and women ages 18 to 84, is used mainly for our analyses of self-

rated health. We remove women who are either pregnant or have a child aged 1 or younger, in order

to focus on non-pregnancy related health and hospitalizations. The fact that we have a complete set

of information on chronic conditions on all sample adults is an advantage, since it permits us to

more easily deal with co-morbidities across chronic conditions. The 1986-1994 sample is used

primarily for our analyses of mortality. The sample includes men and women for whom vital status

can be identified from the Multiple Cause of Death File. Because there are so few deaths among

younger adults, we restrict our sample to 237,140 men and women ages 45-84 for whom vital status

is known. Details on variable definitions are included in the Appendix.



B. Gender Differences in Self-Rated Health and Mortality

The NHIS data can be used to illustrate the paradox discussed in the last section. The two left-hand

panels of Figure 1 present data on self-rated health status (SRHS), which in the NHIS is asked on a


                                                  5
5-point scale, where 1=Excellent, 2=Very Good, 3=Good, 4=Fair and 5=Poor. These figures use

data on all household members from the combined 1986-2001 surveys, and show the average of

SRHS, and the fraction of those who rate themselves in fair or poor health, by exact year of age for

males and females.1 These measures yield similar patterns of changes in health status with age.

Boys have somewhat worse health status than girls prior to adolescence. However, the health status

of girls becomes worse than that of boys around age 14. The gender gap in self-rated health status is

greatest at age 20, and then slowly declines. By age 65 (using mean SRHS) or age 60 (using the

indicator of fair or poor health), the female disadvantage in self-rated health status has vanished.

        The top right panel shows the average number of hospitalization episodes over the previous

12 months, by age, for women and men. Between the ages of 20 and 60, women’s number of

hospitalizations is roughly constant, at 0.10 episodes a year. Only after age 60 do we observe the

average number of episodes rising with age for women. In contrast, men’s reports of

hospitalizations rise with age from age 20. The pattern here mirrors what we observed for self-

assessed health: women’s excess hospitalizations is greatest at age 20. By late middle age, men’s

and women’s reported hospitalizations equalize.

        The bottom right panel of the figure shows the fraction of respondents in the 1986-1994

surveys (aged 25 to 74 at the time of the survey) who died within 24 months of their interviews.2

This graphs show the well-known pattern of excess mortality among men at all ages. Although

mortality is much lower at younger ages, the “excess” of male mortality is greatest at the youngest

ages. The ratio of male to female mortality is fairly flat after age 40, increasing slightly at the oldest

ages.




         1
          These results are based on data for 1,602,650 individuals. Sample weights are used in the
 calculations. The health of those aged 16 and under is rated by an adult respondent. Children
 aged 17 have the option of reporting for themselves.
         2
         This graph is based on 586,703 respondents of all ages for whom vital status could be
 determined.

                                                    6
       Although women report worse health than men at all but the oldest ages, they are not

uniformly more likely to report suffering from all chronic health conditions. Figure 2 shows

prevalence rates for a selection of chronic health conditions for women and men by exact year of

age. These chronic conditions were chosen to illustrate the diversity of patterns that appear in the

data. Several of the chronic conditions, including frequent headaches, arthritis, and depression, are

more prevalent for women at all ages. Others, such as asthma, display higher prevalence for women

than men in middle age but not at the oldest ages. Yet others, such as reproductive cancers and

cardiovascular disease, are more prevalent for women at younger ages but cross over to greater

prevalence among men at older ages. Diabetes is equally prevalent for men and women at all ages.

Emphysema and, to some extent, hypertension, are equally prevalent among younger men and

women but more prevalent among men past age 60. These varied patterns confirm the view that

women are not uniformly more likely than men to suffer from all types of ailments. However, they

also suggest that women are more likely than men to suffer from conditions such as arthritis and

frequent headaches that are not life-threatening but which could lead to poor self-rated health, and

that men are more likely, at least at older ages when most deaths occur, to suffer from diseases such

as cardiovascular disease and emphysema that are risk factors for mortality.



III. Chronic Conditions, Self-Rated Health and Mortality

A. Self-Rated Health

Methods

To assess routes into women’s poorer health, we examine the prevalence and severity of chronic

conditions collected in the 1997-2001 National Health Interview Surveys. We ruled out conditions

that were benign enough to pose little health hazard (for example, hay fever), and restrict our

attention to conditions for which a consistent definition was used over all years. We analyze 18

conditions that fall into six broad categories: pain (headache; neck/back ache; arthritis); respiratory

conditions (bronchitis, emphysema, asthma, lung problems); circulatory conditions (cardiovascular


                                                   7
disease, diabetes, hypertension, circulatory problems); cancers (skin, stomach, reproductive,

respiratory); chronic vision and hearing problems; and depression. Our ‘condition’ list is comprised

of both diseases (for example, emphysema), and illnesses that may be symptoms of diseases (e.g.

vision problems may be due to diseases of the eye, or a bi-product of diabetes.)

       To quantify the extent to which sex differences in health status are due to differences in the

presence of chronic conditions, or to differences in the impact of these conditions, or to unobserved

factors, we need a method for decomposing health status. Initially, assume that only one chronic

condition (C) exists, and that some subset of people suffer from this condition. (We extend this to

multiple conditions in the empirical work below.) Then the probability of reporting fair or poor

health (here referred to as “poor” health), can be decomposed into the probability of reporting poor

health, conditional on the presence of the chronic condition, times the probability of observing the

condition, plus the probability of reporting poor health, in the absence of the chronic condition,

times the probability that the condition is absent:



Using this decomposition, and noting that the probability of the condition’s absence is equal to 1

minus the probability of the condition’s presence, we can characterize the difference in the

probability that women and men report poor health, as follows:



                                                                                                      (1)



This expression decomposes the gender difference in poor health into three components. The first

quantifies the difference in poor health due to the difference in prevalence of the chronic condition

between women and men. We will refer to this as the prevalence effect. The second term quantifies

the difference in poor health due to the gender difference in the impact of the chronic condition on

poor health. This we will refer to as the severity effect. The last term captures the difference in the

probability of reporting poor health that is not due to the chronic condition.


                                                      8
       This framework can be extended to multiple chronic conditions. Assume that the probability

of reporting poor health depends linearly on indicators for the presence of a set of N chronic

conditions (denoted as       , i=1...N) and indicator variables for age, race, and survey year, and a

control for education (X):

                                                                                                        (2)

We estimate equations of this form separately for men and women, and use the parameter estimates

to compute prevalence and severity effects in the difference in poor health between women and

men.

       We estimate two variants of (2) that differ in their measures of chronic conditions. In the

first variant, each of the N chronic condition indicators measures the presence or absence of one

single ailment (e.g. arthritis, asthma, etc.) Individuals may have values of 1 for more than one of the

18 conditions we consider. This specification is parsimonious, but does not account for the fact that

interactions between conditions may have additional effects on health status. In other words, the

probability of poor health, given two chronic conditions, may not be the simple sum of the

probability of poor health for each chronic condition observed individually:



In our NHIS data, 45% of respondents suffer from more than one chronic condition. The second

variant allows for a large number of interactions between chronic conditions. In theory, we can

incorporate the presence of multiple conditions by redefining our chronic conditions to measure

each unique combination of ailments. In practice, it is not possible to allow for all possible

combinations of the 18 ailments we follow. There are, for example, 153 different ways in which a

person could suffer from exactly 2 of the 18 ailments, and 816 different ways in which a person

could suffer from exactly 3 ailments. We can, however, capture the first-order interactions between

conditions by defining “conditions” as single chronic ailments and all possible combinations of two

chronic ailments. Individuals who suffer from cardiovascular disease and emphysema have a

“CVD/emphysema” condition. To avoid double-counting, these individuals are not assigned the

                                                     9
“CVD only” or “emphysema only” conditions. We thus define 171 new conditions: 18 singletons

plus 153 pairs of ailments (so that N=171). 73% of individuals report 2 or fewer ailments. For this

group of respondents, the conditions we identify provide a complete accounting of the ailments that

they face. For the remainder, the estimation yields an approximation for the effects of their

conditions on health.



Results

We present a preliminary look at the extent to which the 18 ailments we follow affect men’s and

women’s health status in Figure 3, which graphs the coefficients from ordinary least squares

regressions as in equation (2), run separately for men and women. We regress an indicator variable

for reporting fair or poor health (which we will refer to as ‘poor’ health) on all 18 chronic ailments,

together with a complete set of age indicators, race indicators, survey year indicators, and a control

for years of completed schooling. For both men and women, the condition that has the largest effect

on self assessed health is stomach cancer, which is associated with an increased probability of

reporting poor health of roughly 25 percentage points. Respiratory cancer and diabetes are each

associated with an 18 percentage point increase in the probability of reporting poor health, for both

men and women; depression and cardiovascular disease with a 15 percentage point increase; neck

and back pain with a 5 percentage point increase. One condition that is not significantly associated

with reported health status is skin cancer, which takes a small, negative insignificant coefficient for

both men and women. Skin cancer is the only condition on our list that is not significantly

associated with poor health.

          The solid line in Figure 3 marks the 45 degree line: if the increase in the probability of

reporting poor health in the presence of a given chronic condition were equal for men and women,

then the regression coefficients reported for the two sexes would fall on this line. Figure 3 shows

remarkable similarity between the sexes in the association between poor health and the presence of

each chronic ailment. Tests for differences between men and women in the 18 ailment coefficients


                                                     10
were significant for only 6: headaches, back and neck pain, arthritis, hypertension, depression, and

lung problems. Of these six, only the difference associated with lung problems is large in

magnitude, where the probability of poor health is 7.0 percentage points higher for men than for

women. Lung disorders, and more generally chronic illnesses associated with smoking, will be seen

to affect hospitalizations and mortality in what follows.

        The near equality between men and women in their health responses to chronic conditions

suggests that gender differences in response to chronic conditions is unlikely to lead to an

explanation of gender differences in reported health status. Indeed, in the formal decomposition

presented below, we find no role for the severity effect in explaining the self-assessed health

differentials.

        Table 1 presents prevalence rates for chronic conditions, and the differences in the

prevalence rates between women and men for the 18 ailments we use in our analysis. The last

column shows the age- and race-adjusted excess percentage point prevalence among women for

each ailment, above that expected for men. These were estimated by regressing each ailment on a

complete set of age, race and survey year indicators, a measure of completed education, and an

indicator that the respondent is female, for 147,996 individuals surveyed between 1997 and 2001.

An asterisk (*) denotes those conditions for which the prevalence rates are significantly different

between women and men at a 5% level. Women have significantly higher rates of pain (headache,

other pain, arthritis), and some respiratory conditions (bronchitis, asthma, lung problems other than

cancer). They are also significantly more likely to suffer from reproductive cancers, hypertension,

vision problems and depression. Men are significantly more likely to suffer from smoking-related

ailments (emphysema, respiratory cancer), some circulatory problems (cardiovascular disease,

diabetes), and hearing loss. Men are significantly more likely to have two-ailment conditions that

involve emphysema, respiratory cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, while women are

significantly more likely to have two-ailment conditions that involve pain, asthma, bronchitis,

vision, and depression. The prevalence rates for the set of 171 chronic conditions and condition


                                                  11
interactions are presented in Figure 4, where it is clear that the difference in prevalence rates

between women and men are larger for conditions that women are more likely to report.

        To estimate the severity and prevalence effects of these conditions, we first regress an

indicator for reporting fair or poor health on a vector of chronic conditions, as in equation (2) above,

in separate regressions for men and women. Differences in men’s and women’s chronic condition

coefficients, multiplied by the average prevalence rate of each condition (denoted as      ), form the

basis of our severity effect:



Differences in these prevalence rates between men and women, multiplied by the condition’s $

(averaged between the $ estimated for men and women), form the basis of the prevalence effect:



The residual difference in women’s and men’s self-assessed health—that unexplained by the

severity and prevalence effects above—combines differences produced by gender differences in

average values of X (age, education and race), gender differences in the effects of these variables on

health (e.g. in (), and unexplained differences.

        Our estimates of these effects are presented in Table 2. The first column presents results

from regressions that include 18 chronic conditions with no interactions between the conditions.

The second column presents results from regressions that included 171 chronic conditions and

chronic condition interactions. On average, 14.3% of women aged 18 to 84 reported fair or poor

health. The likelihood of a woman reporting poor health is 2.5 percentage points greater than is that

for a man. With or without the chronic condition interactions, we find that the difference between

women’s and men’s health is fully explained by differences in the prevalence of conditions they

face. From our analysis that includes condition interactions (column 2), we predict women to be 2.3

percentage points more likely to report poor health based on the conditions they report. There is

little role for the severity effect: we find men are 0.13 percentage points more likely to report poor

health than are women with the same chronic conditions.


                                                   12
        In tests run on the health status regressions, we found that the condition interaction variables

were jointly significant. However, their absence (column 1) makes little difference to the health

status decomposition.



B. Hospitalizations

A different look at health is provided by the number of hospitalization days and episodes men and

women report having had in the past 12 months. (Hospitalization refers only to in-patient stays.)

Hospitalization may provide a more objective measure of health status than do self-reports. Unlike

doctors visits, which patients can generally schedule themselves, hospital admission is controlled by

health providers, who may fail to admit patients with less serious health problems.

        If it were the case that women were less stoical than men, and more likely to factor minor

ailments into their reports of poor health, then we would expect women’s hospitalizations to be less

responsive to their reports of poor health than are men’s. Instead, we find equally large responses

between hospitalization episodes and reports of poor health for men and women. In regressions of

the number of reported hospitalization episodes on an indicator of reporting fair or poor health, with

a complete set of indicators for age, race, survey year and a measure of educational attainment, we

find:



Women:         Number of episodes = 0.341 Fair/Poor Health
                                    (0.006)

Men:           Number of episodes = 0.338 Fair/Poor Health
                                    (0.007)


For both women and men, a subjective report of fair or poor health translates on average into one-

third extra hospitalization episode a year.

        Women on average have 0.034 more hospitalization episodes per year than do men, and

0.052 extra hospital days. As observed in Figure 1, these differences are largest in young adulthood.


                                                   13
Using the same methods presented for health status above, we can decompose hospitalization days

and episodes into severity, prevalence and residual effects. We present these decompositions in

Table 3, where the first three columns present results for hospitalization episodes, and the second

three for hospitalization days. For both episodes and days, we present results for our 18 chronic

conditions without condition interactions (columns 1 and 4), and with interactions (columns 2 and

5). Consistent with our findings for self-reported health status, the difference in the distribution of

chronic conditions goes some way toward explaining women’s greater hospitalization. We find a

prevalence effect for hospitalization episodes of 0.0176, in our analysis containing the 171

conditions and condition interactions. This is half of the total difference we observe in

hospitalization episodes between men and women. We find a prevalence effect for hospital days of

0.0941, which is almost twice as large as the total gap between women and men’s hospitalization

days. Based on the distribution of conditions alone, we would expect women to spend even more

days in the hospital, relative to men, than we observe in the data.

       These prevalence effects are offset by differences in the impact of chronic conditions on

hospitalizations for men and women. We find, for both episodes and days, that when men and

women report the same chronic conditions, men have more episodes and more hospital days than do

women. The conditions responsible for this severity effect can be seen in Figure 5, which presents

coefficients from regressions of men and women’s hospitalization episodes on 18 chronic

conditions. Men suffering from respiratory cancer, stomach cancer, bronchitis, and cardiovascular

disease report significantly greater numbers of hospital episodes than do women reporting the same

conditions.



C. Mortality

Methods

The last two sections provided evidence that the worse self-rated health of women can be entirely

explained by gender differences in the distribution of chronic health conditions, but that men are


                                                   14
more likely than women with the same health conditions to have hospitalizations. This section turns

to mortality. We study whether men and women who report the same health conditions are equally

likely to die in the two years following the survey, or whether men have excess mortality given

health conditions. We also decompose gender differences in mortality into prevalence and severity

effects, as was done for self-rated health and hospitalizations.

       As in the last sections, we start by specifying mortality as a function of health conditions

(   ) and other sociodemographic factors (X):


                                                                                                    (3)
where D is indicator that the respondent died within 24 months of the survey. These equations are

estimated separately for women and men. Because there are few deaths among younger adults, the

samples include only those aged 45 to 84. Our primary focus is on whether the effects of chronic

conditions on mortality differ for women and men.

       Although the framework is identical to that described in the last sections, data issues require

that we use different and somewhat more complex estimation methods. The NHIS mortality

information is available only for those surveyed before the 1997 redesign. As discussed in the data

section, the NHIS followed very different procedures for collecting information on health conditions

before 1997: instead of asking a subset of adults about all health conditions, the survey asked all

adults about a subset of health conditions on the condition list to which they were randomly

assigned. As a result, we have only incomplete information on the variables in C for any one

individual. While this method of collecting information allows for the calculation of accurate

prevalence rates with minimal respondent burden, it complicates analyses that require information

on co-morbidities. Consider, for example, the strategy of estimating equation (3) one “condition

list” at a time, so that we regress the death indicator on the conditions included in Condition List 1

using the sample that was assigned to this list, and repeat this for each of the condition lists. The

estimates of the effects of the conditions on the probability of mortality (i.e. the estimates of   ) will

be biased, since they will reflect the effects of conditions that are unmeasured but correlated with

                                                   15
the conditions that are measured. For example, if those who have heart disease also have an

elevated risk of emphysema (perhaps because smoking increases the risk for both diseases), the

estimates of the effects of both heart disease and emphysema, which appear in different condition

lists, are likely to be biased upward.

        The bias due to incomplete information on chronic conditions can be corrected with

supplementary information on the covariance of each pair of chronic diseases that appear in

different condition lists. Our strategy is to use information on these covariances from the 1997-2001

NHIS surveys to correct for bias due to missing information on co-morbidities.3 To see how these

biases can be corrected, consider a simplified version of (3) in which the controls for the

sociodemographic variables have been suppressed:

                                                                                                     (4)
where       represents an      matrix of indicators for whether individuals have chronic conditions

included in condition list j, and there are a total of M condition lists. (In practice, we include

controls for sociodemographic variables. The methods described below are easily extended to the

case in which other control variables are included.) Note that the 1986-1994 data, which we refer to

as the “censored” sample, contain information on D but incomplete information on          . The 1997-

2001 data, which we refer to as the “supplemental” sample, has complete information on C but no

information on D.

        The equation for bias correction can be obtained by first defining a matrix     , which is equal

to C but with unobserved values of conditions set to zero, and considering the ordinary least squares

estimates of $ that result when    is used in place of C:

                                                                                                        (5)

and

                                                                                                     (6)


        3
          The strategy of using supplemental data in this way has been used to correct for biases in
 the estimates of the effects of lead on IQ (Marais and Wecker, 1998).

                                                   16
where        is the variance-covariance matrix of the censored data matrix    and      is the

covariance matrix of      and   . Equation (6) indicates that   is an inconsistent estimator of   , and

suggests the following corrected estimator (denoted       ):

                                                                                                    (7)

where        and       are consistent estimators of the covariance matrices. The former can be

obtained from the censored sample. The matrix           contains cross-products for pairs of conditions

that are from the same condition lists (and so can be estimated from the censored sample alone) and

for pairs of conditions that appear in different condition lists (and so must be estimated from the

supplemental sample.) Details on how these covariance matrices were estimated, and on estimates

of the standard errors for   , are in the Appendix.

          Although this estimation method delivers consistent estimates of     for women and men, the

lack of complete information on all conditions is restrictive. We cannot, for example, estimate

models similar to those shown for self-rated health and hospitalizations, in which interactions

between conditions are included. We also cannot use non-linear functional forms for (4)—for

example, logit or probit models—since the bias correction formula are only correct for the linear

model. Finally, we must restrict the list of health conditions to those that are measured in similar

ways in the earlier censored sample and the later supplemental sample. We examine fourteen

chronic conditions, including arthritis and skin cancer (from Condition List 1); digestive cancer

(List 3); diabetes, frequent headaches and reproductive cancer (List 4); CVD, hypertension, and

other circulation problems (List 5); and bronchitis, asthma, emphysema, other (non-cancerous) lung

disorders, and respiratory cancer (List 6).



Results

Table 4 shows results from two sets of estimates of the effects of chronic conditions on the

probability of death within 24 months of the survey. The first two columns show estimates of very

                                                   17
simple variants of (3), in which the indicator for death is regressed on only one of the chronic

conditions indicators, plus a set of indicators for age and race, and a control for years of education.

Thus, each cell of each row shows the marginal effects of the condition on the probability of death

for women (row 1) and men (row 2), controlling for no other conditions. The third column provides

the p-value from a test that the coefficients for women and men are identical. These simple results

are shown so that they can be contrasted with those in the last three columns, which contain results

from the complete model that includes the bias correction discussed above.

        The results with and without bias correction are generally consistent with those shown above

for self-rated health and hospitalizations. The chronic conditions that lead to the largest increases in

the probability of death—CVD, emphysema, other lung problems, respiratory cancer, digestive and

reproductive cancers and diabetes—also elevate reports of poor health and hospitalizations.

Conditions that have smaller or even no effects on mortality, such as headaches or hypertension,

have smaller (although significant) adverse effects on self-rated health.

        Estimates of the marginal effects of conditions on mortality are generally smaller when the

complete set of conditions is included and the bias correction is used. For example, cardiovascular

disease (CVD) is estimated to increase the probability of death by 2.9 percentage points for women

and 4.6 percentage points for men when no conditions other than CVD are included. In the bias-

corrected model, these effects decline to 2.1 (for women) and 3.6 (for men) percentage points.

These declines reflect the fact that individuals often have multiple conditions, something illustrated

in the results in the last section.

        Correcting the bias tends to reduce the men’s coefficient by more than the women’s

coefficients. For example, without adjustment for co-morbidities, the difference in the effects of

CVD on mortality is –1.7 percentage points (2.9 for women minus 4.6 for men). The adjustments

for co-morbidities reduces this difference to –1.5 (2.1 for women minus 3.6 for men). The pattern of

greater reductions in men’s than women’s coefficients is evident for 10 of the 14 conditions. This is

consistent with the evidence on patterns of co-morbidities discussed in Section A, above, which


                                                   18
noted that men are more likely than women to have combinations of more life-threatening

conditions (e.g. emphysema, respiratory cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease), whereas

women’s co-morbidities are clustered around conditions that are less likely to be fatal (e.g.

conditions that involve pain, asthma, and bronchitis).

       Even after adjusting for co-morbidities, the presence of health conditions is often associated

with larger increases in mortality for men than for women. This can be seen from the last three

columns in Table 4, or in the graphs of these coefficients in Figure 6. (The top panel of Figure 6

shows all fourteen conditions. The bottom panel excludes respiratory and digestive cancer, which

have very large effects of the probability of death.) Of the eight conditions that have marginal

effects on the probability of death in excess of 0.01, five have larger effects on male mortality

(these include stomach cancer, CVD, emphysema, other lung disorders, and respiratory cancer) and

three have larger effects of female mortality (diabetes, reproductive cancer, and bronchitis).

Although the majority of these differences are not statistically significant (see last column of Table

4), the results taken together suggest that serious health conditions pose a greater threat to men than

women.4

       This can be seen more formally by decomposing the difference between female and male

rates into prevalence and severity effects, as was done for self-rated health and hospitalizations in

the last two sections. In this sample of 45-84 year olds, 2.6 percent of women and 4.2 percent of

men die within two years of the survey, resulting in a difference between women and men of –1.6

percent. This –1.6 percent difference can be decomposed into a prevalence effect of –0.2 percent, a

severity effect of –0.6 percent, and a remainder unexplained by health conditions of –0.8 percent.

Thus, of the 50% of the gender difference in mortality that can be explained by these 14 chronic

health conditions, 25% (–0.02/–0.08) can be explained by men being more likely to suffer from the


        4
        Consistent with our finding for respiratory cancer, other research indicates that being
female is associated with longer survival after surgery and chemotherapy treatments for lung
cancer (Patel et al, 2004).

                                                  19
chronic conditions that have larger effects of mortality, and 75% (–0.06/–0.08) is explained by men

having a greater probability of dying than women with the same chronic conditions. However, this

decomposition provides a misleading estimate of the size of the severity effect. Fully half of the

severity effect is due to the gender difference in the estimated effect of arthritis on mortality. As

shown in Table 4, arthritis is not associated with male mortality and is negatively associated with

female mortality, so that it contributes to the severity effect for men. In addition, since arthritis is

very prevalent, it is heavily weighted in the calculation of the severity effect. When the effects of

arthritis on mortality are set to zero for both women and men—which seems sensible, given that we

do not think that arthritis really protects women against death—the severity effect drops to –0.2

percent, equal to the prevalence effect.



Is smoking the smoking gun?

Cardiovascular disease is the major contributor to the severity effect (because of its high prevalence

combined with the gender difference in its effect on mortality). Stomach cancer, emphysema, other

lung disorders and respiratory cancer are also contributing factors. All of these conditions are

associated with smoking.5 It is possible that the higher smoking rates of men result in more severe

forms of these conditions when they occur. The 1986-1994 NHIS surveys do not contain

information on the smoking history of respondents, so we cannot examine directly whether the

effects of these conditions on mortality are higher among smokers. We can, however, use the 1997-

2001 NHIS to document that men do have substantially greater life-time exposure to smoking than

women. Figure 7 shows the average number of years of smoking for men and women, by age at the



         5
         The link between smoking and stomach cancer is not as well known as the association of
 smoking with the other four conditions. However, the American Cancer Society reports that
 “Smoking increases stomach cancer risk, particularly for cancers of the proximal stomach (the
 upper portion of the stomach closest to the esophagus). The rate of stomach cancer is
 approximately doubled in smokers.”

time of the survey, for sample adults in these surveys.6 Here we see stark differences in lifetime

smoking between men and women. Even including those who never smoked, 75-year-old men

surveyed between 1997 and 2001 report an average of more than 25 years of smoking, in contrast to

fewer than fifteen years of smoking for women. Years of smoking are lower among those in

younger cohorts so that, among 45-year-olds, men have on average only 2 more years of smoking

over their lives than women. If gender differences in life-time tobacco use are generating excess

male mortality, then smaller gender gap in smoking among these younger cohorts may reduce

excess male mortality both through the prevalence effect and the severity effect.

       This explanation for the differences in the mortality effects that we find is consistent with

research by Pampel (1997), who concludes that smoking fully explains the recent narrowing in

mortality differentials observed between men and women. Pampel cites Valkonen and van Poppel

(1997) as having concluded that 40% of total sex differences in life expectancy at age 35 could be

explained by smoking. If Valkonen and van Poppel are correct, then combining the smoking results

with differences in the distributions of non-smoking related chronic conditions may bring us most

of the distance needed to explain excess male mortality.



IV. Discussion and Conclusions

The results presented above go partway to resolving the paradox with which we started, but do not

resolve it entirely. The hypothesis that gender differences in self-rated health can be entirely

explained by gender differences in the distribution of conditions is confirmed. The hypothesis that

women and men form assessments of their health in different ways is not consistent with either the

evidence that women and men with the same health conditions are equally likely to report being in


        6
         For those who never smoked, years of smoking is set to zero. For those who report ever
smoking, years of smoking is calculated as the year the respondent quit (or the current year if she
or he still smokes) minus the year in which he or she began smoking. This, years of smoking
will be overstated for those who do not smoke constantly between the start date and their most
recent quit date (or the date of the interview.)

                                                   21
poor health, or with our findings that reports of poor health are equally predictive of hospitalization

episodes for men and women. However, the evidence for hospitalizations and mortality indicate that

men with some health conditions are more likely to be hospitalized and to die than women with the

same conditions. The “severity effects” that disadvantage men are driven mainly by a small number

of smoking-related conditions: CVD (for hospital episodes), and CVD, emphysema, and other lung

disorders (for mortality).7 The remaining question is why, if these conditions are more likely to

result in hospitalizations and death for men, do they not also result in greater reports of poor health

for men?

       One partial answer to this question is that some of these conditions do produce both excess

male mortality and higher reports of poor health for men relative to women. The results in Figure 3

indicate that men with emphysema and “other lung” problems are more likely than women to report

poor health. Although gender differences in these coefficients are statistically significant only for

lung problems and not for emphysema, they point to the possibility that men experience more

severe forms of these conditions—something that is consistent with the evidence of greater rates of

smoking among men presented above. However, the finding that men with CVD are equally likely

to report poor health but more likely to experience hospitalizations and die than women with CVD

is more difficult to explain.

       Another possible answer is that men tend to report health conditions only when they are at

more severe or advanced stages. For example, a woman with mild angina might report having CVD,

whereas a man might not report CVD until he has experienced a heart attack. This would explain

why reported CVD has a larger effect on male than female mortality. However, to reconcile the

results for self-rated health with those for mortality, it would also have to be the case that women

with milder forms of CVD are as likely to report poor health as men with more severe forms of


        7
         Stomach and respiratory cancer also have larger effects on mortality and hospitalizations
 for men than for women. However, because these conditions have very low prevalence rates, they
 contribute little to the overall severity effects for mortality or hospitalizations.

                                                   22
CVD. In other words, women would have to be more likely than men to report less severe forms of

conditions and to factor milder forms of conditions into their reports of poor health.

       Although logically possible, we do not think this answer is plausible. For many health

conditions we examine, there are no gender differences in the effects on both self-rated health and

mortality. This is true even for conditions such as diabetes and bronchitis, that can display varying

degrees of severity. If women systematically reported milder forms of all conditions, we would

expect to see these conditions having smaller effects on women’s mortality. Additional evidence

comes from looking at samples of individuals who died from specific causes (e.g. acute myocardial

infarction, stroke) within two years of the survey, and examining whether those individuals reported

conditions associated with those causes of death. If men are more likely than women to under-report

conditions, then men who died should be less likely than women to have reported having the

condition that resulted in the death. The results in Table 5 indicate that this is not the case. Women

and men whose causes of death were digestive cancer, diabetes, heart attack, stroke, hypertensive

disease, and respiratory cancer were equally likely to have reported the relevant condition at the

preceding interview. Men who died of respiratory disease (bronchitis, asthma, emphysema or

chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) were more likely than women to have reported one or more

of the conditions leading up to this cause of death. It should be noted that reports of the relevant

conditions are often low for both men and women, indicating that there may be under-reporting of

chronic conditions, due either to unwillingness to disclose health conditions or lack of knowledge

about those conditions.8 However, we find no evidence that men report conditions less than women.

       A final explanation is that, for at least some conditions, the symptoms individuals

experience may convey little information about the severity of the disease. This may be especially

relevant for CVD, several components of which can be symptomless. It is possible that women and

men who report having CVD experience similar symptoms and therefore report (on average) the

        8
        Additional evidence on under-reporting of health conditions in Canada can be found in
Baker, Stabile and Deri (2001).

                                                   23
same self-rated health, when in fact the men’s disease is more severe (perhaps due to their greater

levels of smoking). This explanation is consistent with our finding that men and women with CVD

are equally likely to report poor health, that men with CVD are only slightly more likely than

women to experience hospital episodes, and that men with CVD are more than 1.5 times more

likely to die than women who report CVD.

       Additional evidence on this point comes from the 1988-1994 National Health Examination

Study (NHANES III), which collected health information using both interviews and medical exams

for a nationally representative sample.9 We use NHANES III data for a sample of men and women

ages 30-74 to compare measures of cardiovascular health for men and women who report having

cardiovascular disease.10 Specifically, we examine whether men who self-report CVD have had

more heart attacks, are more likely to report episodes of severe chest pain, are more likely to smoke,

and have higher blood pressure, triglycerides, and cholesterol than do women who report CVD. The

first three of these measures—heart attacks, chest pain and smoking—are self-reported and are

certainly not “symptomless”. However, measures of blood pressure, triglycerides and cholesterol are

obtained from the examination and laboratory tests. These cannot be subject to gender-specific

reporting bias, and respondents do not know the results of their examinations and blood work when

they report whether they have cardiovascular disease.

       We also compare men’s and women’s values of the Framingham risk score, which provides

a useful summary measure of the propensity to develop coronary heart disease (CHD), defined as

defined as angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, coronary insufficiency, and coronary heart disease

death, over a 10-year period. This scoring method was developed by researchers using data from the




        9
        Additional information on the NHANES III can be found at the NCHS website:
http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/elec_prods/subject/nhanes3.htm
        10
        This age range is used since the Framingham risk score, discussed below, was
developed only for individuals aged 30-74.

                                                 24
Framingham study, and is described in detail in Wilson et al (1998).11 The ingredients that go into

calculating the score include age, current smoking, diabetes, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and

blood pressure. It is important to note that method of scoring CHD risk varies by gender, and that

men generally receive higher (worse) scores than women with the same profiles of risk factors. For

example, a man with very low HDL (below 35 mg/dl) is assigned more points on the scale than a

women with very low HDL, indicating that men from the Framingham sample with low HDL were

(all else equal) more likely to develop CHD than women. The Framingham result, that men are

more likely to develop CHD than women with the same risk factors, is consistent with our finding

that men who report cardiovascular disease are more likely to die than women with the same

conditions.

       Table 6 shows that men who self-report cardiovascular disease at baseline are more likely to

experience some, but not all, risk factors. They are significantly more likely to currently smoke, and

have experienced more heart attacks on average than women who also report cardiovascular

disease. Men are 6 percentage points more likely than women to report severe chest pain, although

this difference is only marginally significant. Men are also significantly more likely to have

diastolic blood pressure and HDL cholesterol in the “high risk” range. Women, however, are

significantly more likely to have high total cholesterol. The Framingham risk score, which

summarizes the combined effects of blood pressure, total cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol, as well

as smoking and diabetes, is nearly twice as high for men as for women who self-report

cardiovascular disease. The Framingham 10-year risk of developing CHD for men is 19.6 percent,




        11
         The scoring system is based on age-adjusted Cox proportional hazard models, estimated
by gender, that relate the development of coronary heart disease (defined as angina pectoris,
myocardial infarction, coronary insufficiency, and coronary heart disease death) within a 12-year
follow-up period to baseline measures of total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, diastolic blood
pressure, diabetes and smoking. The raw score in then scaled so that it measures the 10-year risk
of experiencing CHD given the individual’s baseline characteristics.

                                                  25
and for women is only 10.7 percent.12 These results indicate that, among men and women who

report cardiovascular disease, men generally have worse risk profiles than do women, which may

account for their higher mortality rates.

       In summary, our results indicate that women and men who experience the same health

conditions are equally likely to report being in poor health. And, many health conditions have

effects on hospitalizations and mortality that are similar for men and women. However, men with

some health conditions—notably those associated with smoking—are more likely than women with

these conditions to experience hospitalizations and death. Overall, the results suggest that the

paradox of worse self-rated health for women and higher mortality for men has a fairly

straightforward explanation that does not rest on systematic differences between women and men in

how health is reported.

          It should be noted that the 10-year risks are likely to be higher for this sample of men
and women who report having CVD. The Framingham method assigns raw scores to risks for
individuals who have not yet been diagnosed with CHD at baseline. In addition, the Framingham
risks are based on samples of white individuals from a New England suburb. However, the risk
scores provide a useful method of aggregating across the different risk factors for heart disease,
ven if they do not assign accurate risks to individuals in the NHANES III sample.

Notes: The results shown in the first three columns are from linear regressions of an indicator that
the respondent died within 2 years of the survey on an indicator that the respondent had the
condition listed in the row, plus a set of age indicators, indicators for race (black or other non-
white), and years of education. Separate regressions were estimated for each condition. Each cell
shows the regression coefficient and standard error for the condition listed in the row. The third
column is the p-value for a t-test of the hypothesis that the effects of each condition on male and
female mortality are identical. The results in the last three columns are from regressions of an
indicator that the respondent dies within 2 years of the survey on a set of indicators for whether the
respondent had each of the conditions, plus a set of age and race indicators and a control for years of
education. These estimates have been corrected to account for the fact that not all conditions are
observed for each individual, using the procedure described in the text and in the Appendix.

A. Definitions of the variables

All regressions included a complete set of indicators for age and race (black, white or “other”) and a
control for years of education. The chronic health conditions used in the analyses are defined as
follows for each of the two survey periods. In coding the conditions, we attempted to make the
definitions for conditions from the earlier and later periods as close as possible. For the 1986-1994
surveys, we provide the diagnostic codes that were aggregated to create each condition. The
reference periods over which conditions are assessed are noted for the 1997-2001 period :

                                               1986-1994.

B. Bias corrections for mortality estimates

The equation to be estimated is:

                                                                                                                     (A1)

where it is assumed that , is i.i.d. with E[, | C]=0.            is a matrix of demographic variables (age,
education and race) that are observed for all individuals. For j=1...M,                is an N x kj matrix of 0/1
variables that indicate whether the individual has each of the conditions included in condition list j,
where there are a total of M condition lists. Assume that the number of individuals who are asked
about the conditions in each list is equal to n=N/M, and that the total number of explanatory

variables is               . The matrix C is censored, so that for individuals assigned to condition list j,

only variables in       and      are observed. The outcome D is observed for all individuals.




                                                          42
Define a matrix Z which is equal to C but with censored elements set to zero, so that:




                                     and




where     is an n x kj matrix of information for individuals assigned to condition list j.

In what follows, it will be useful to have probability limits of the matrices          ,     , and
       . Assume that:




                                                                                                (A2)




Then:




                                                                                                (A3)




and:




                                                                                                (A4)




                                                   43
Finally, assume that there is an supplemental data set that contains      observations on all variables,
with the          data matrix denoted     . Assume that:




The starting point of the bias correction is the OLS estimator of $ using Z in place of C, i.e.
                . The bias-corrected estimate of shown in equation (7) is:

                                                                                                       (A5)

The estimate of       is obtained from the censored data as          . Note that, as in (A4), the lower
right portion of this matrix is block diagonal, with estimates of the matrices       for j=1..M along the
diagonal. Note that the elements of these matrices are equal to:



where      is the fraction of individuals assigned to condition list j who have both the ith and kth
condition within that list. When i is equal to k, this is simply equal to the prevalence of the
condition.

The matrix        is estimated using the censored and supplemental samples. Specifically, cross-
products that are based on within-condition-list terms are taken from the censored sample, and are
identical to the corresponding blocks in the estimate of     . The off-block-diagonal terms
that represent cross-products that cross condition lists are estimated as follows:

                                                                                                       (A6)


where      and    equal the fraction of the censored sample that has condition i and k, respectively,
and     is the correlation between condition i and k that is estimated from the supplemental sample.
An alternative method of obtaining            would have been to compute the fraction of the
supplemental sample that has both condition i and k. However, for some pairs of rare conditions, we
found that the fraction of the supplemental sample that had both condition i and condition k
exceeded the fraction of the censored sample that had either i or k. The use of (A6), which draws
only the correlation coefficient between i and j from the supplemental sample, prevents this from
occurring.

The proof that   is consistent is straightforward. Substituting the formula for   into (A5), we get:




the first term of which has a probability limit of $ and the second term of which has a probability
limit of 0.

The estimate of the variance-covariance matrix for     is:


                                                                                                  (A7)


where is the variance of ,. A consistent estimate of ,denoted , is obtained by starting with
the estimate of the error variance using the error-ridden estimate . Specifically, let:




Then:




and:


                                                                                                  (A8)


The estimate is obtained by subtracting the first term on the right-hand-side of (A8) from        .
Substituting in for , this yields:




where    is constructed from      . Specifically, where      equals   with all elements of the first
rows divided by M (compare A2 and A3, above).
