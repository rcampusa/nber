Revisiting the Commodity Curse: A Financial Perspective

                                           ABSTRACT

We study the response of a three-sector commodity-exporter small open economy to a
commodity price boom. When the economy has access to international borrowing and lending, a
temporary commodity price boom brings about the standard wealth effect that stimulates demand
and has long-run implications on the sectoral allocation of labour. If dynamic productivity gains
are concentrated in the traded goods sector, the commodity boom crowds out the traded sector
and delays convergence to the world technology frontier. Financial openness by stimulating
current demand, amplifies the crowding out effect and may even lead to a growth trap, in which
no resources are allocated to the traded sector. From a normative point of view, our analysis
suggests that capital account management policies could be welfare improving in those
circumstances.

1         Introduction

The commodity cycle starting at the turn of this century has reversed in the last years. The
boom phase in commodity prices has contributed to boost growth and economic performance
in resource rich economies, but the reversal has severely impacted their growth rates.1
        Commodity prices are characterized by longer cycles (of around thirty years or supercy-
cles, see -Erten and Ocampo (2013)) than overall business cycles. Since 1960 (IMF (2015))
two supercycles can be identi…ed in the energy and food sectors: one from the mid-seventies
to the end of the nineties and the current supercycle which peaked around 2010. The length
of the commodity price cycles suggests that shocks in this sector are persistent but they
might eventually reverse.
        In this paper we re-examine the link between commodity booms and resource allocation
by emphasizing the international …nancial dimension of this interaction. Our focus is in
understanding how the access to international …nancial markets shapes the allocation of
resources within an economy subject to commodity price cycles.
        Indeed, the impact of commodity booms on resource rich economies has a long tradi-
tion in economic analysis. More precisely, the commodity resource curse or Dutch disease
underscores the perverse impact that a positive commodity shock may have on the economy.
        An increase in commodity prices represents a positive terms of trade shock that pushes
up domestic relative prices and income. The increase in internal relative prices negatively
a¤ects the rest of the tradable sector and increases domestic demand, both of tradable and
non-tradable goods. As a result, there is a reallocation of factors out of the tradable sector
and into the commodity and the non-tradable sector. Corden and Neary (1982) provided
the seminal model to analyze this resource reallocation of factors and the process of de-
industralisation in a simple framework.
    1
    A recent study of the importance of commodity price ‡uctuations for emerging market economies is
Fernandez et al. (2015).




                                                 2
       The deeper meaning of the disease from the commodity booms is that they can also
inhibit long term growth. However, absent some form of frictions, this relocation of resources
would be entirely e¢ cient and the Dutch disease wouldn’t really constitute a "disease".
The idea that the manufacturing sector is the driving force of the economy and that de-
industrialization can lead to an impoverishment of the country is supported by the notion
that resource-rich economies tend to show lower growth rates than economies endowed with
few natural resources. For this to happen, there should be di¤erential productivity dynamics
among sectors and the sectoral reallocation induced by the commodity shock must hamper
the ability to attain the productivity gains from technological development for the economy
as a whole. This outcome hinges on two assumptions: i) faster productivity growth in the
tradable sector relative to the other sectors of the economy and ii) the presence of (stronger)
externalities in the tradable sectors.2
       The perception that commodity booms can generate a misallocation of resources that
impinges negative on growth is well entrenched and has been present in policy debates in
commodity rich economies during the ascending phase of the cycle and, more intensely, when
the cycle has reversed.
       Figure 1 shows the evolution of sectoral ratios since 2000 for a subset of commodity
exporters (shaded areas represent periods of high commodity prices). While the share of the
commodity sector relative to total GDP and the rest of the tradable sector increases during
the boom period, the ratio of non-traded goods over tradeable suggests a decrease in the
relative importance of the traded sector following the recent decline in commodity price.3
   2
     The most widespread intuition to explain this outcome is that a large share of the tradable goods are
manufactures, which tend to enjoy higher productivity growth, as they are more prone to convey technological
progress than other sectors. As a result, a commodity price boom may reduce the ability to grasp the
productivity gains from technology and depresses long-term growth. Theoretically, this result is built into
models through the introduction of dynamic productivity gains (by spillover, or by a learning-by-doing e¤ect
or increasing returns to scale) in the tradable sector of the economy.
   3
     However, the evidence on Dutch disease is mixed (see IMF (2015), box 2.1 for a survey), both on the
sectoral reallocation and on long-term growth inhibition.
  Older studies (Spatafora and Warner (1995), Bjørnland(1988) …nd no evidence of a reduction in manu-
facturing following the commodity boom, and the latter actually …nds that that sector bene…ted in Norway

   While the reference model of Corden and Neary (1982) assumes a …nancially closed
economy (i.e. trade balance is always in equilibrium), the dynamics of external accounts
have gathered less attention in the academic literature on commodity shocks. In practice,
the concern about the fallout of the commodity cycles has been increased by the evolution
of external positions in commodity exporters, which is displayed in …gure 2.

are expected to decline and a higher overall domestic demand of tradeable can be satis…ed
by higher imports. The trade and current account balances impact is, in principle, unde…ned
as the worsening of the tradable balance could be more than o¤set by the expected large
improvement in the commodity balance. The actual pro…le of the external balances –see
…gure 2- is an inverted U-shaped: an initial improvement followed by a deterioration of the
trade and current account balances, as the increased domestic demand and the reduction in
tradable exports dents the initial boost coming from commodity exports.
   In terms of the …nancial account this means that, on impact, the country improves its
net debtor position and experiments capital out‡ows. Furthermore, if the initial debtor
position is in foreign currency, the increase in domestic relative prices would reduce external
debt. These two factors would reduce the perception of risk and facilitate …nancing and, as a
matter of fact, a negative correlation between terms of trade and risk premia exists (see IMF
(2015)). But the relaxing of the …nancing constraint facilitates the turnaround of the current
account to the point that commodity booms can lead to external imbalances even before its
peak, which is the case of several countries in our sample. These facts underscores the
potential relevance of the external …nancing channels to analyses the impact of commodity
booms in the economy.
   In this paper, we develop a model of the commodity curse and explore the …nancial
channels to study the interaction between commodity cycles and access to international
…nancial markets. We take as starting point the three-sector (traded, commodity and non
traded) …nancially-closed economy model of Corden and Neary (1982) and we introduce
two main extensions: we allow for open …nancial account to examine a …rst …nancial channel
through the capacity to save or borrow from abroad and the role of net foreign asset position;
second we allow for dynamic productivity gains in the traded sector as in Benigno and
Fornaro (2014).to assess possible long-run consequences on growth and its interaction with
international …nancial markets.



                                              6
       We …rst focus on the economy in which there are no dynamic productivity gains and study
the impact of a temporary commodity price shock. The …rst result is that, independently
of the …nancial structure, there is a possibility for complete de-industrialization (during the
commodity boom) of the traded sector as long as its technology displays constant return to
scale. This result depends on the fact that the shock could potentially a¤ect the compar-
ative advantage that an economy has in the production of the traded good relative to the
commodity good. Secondly we show that under …nancial account openness, a commodity
boom leads to an (initial) accumulation of net foreign assets that results in a permanent shift
of resources out of the traded sector. This comes about through the standard wealth e¤ect
that arises in a bond only small open economy.4 When we introduce dynamic productivity
gains into the traded sector, a commodity boom crowds out the traded sector and delays
convergence to the world technology frontier. Financial openness by stimulating current de-
mand, ampli…es this crowding out e¤ect. Finally, there is a possibility that the commodity
boom can lead to a growth trap in which no resources are allocated to the traded sector and
the economy does not grow.
       We then study the welfare implications of commodity price boom in the context of our
model economy. In the simplest case in which there are no dynamic productivity gains, a
commodity price boom is always welfare improving. On the other hand in the presence of
growth externalities, we show how an increase in commodity prices can be welfare reducing
as the economy shifts resources, during the boom, out of the traded sector where the pro-
ductivity gains are concentrated. Moreover during a commodity boom under open …nancial
account can be more costly from a welfare point of view relative to the …nancial autarky
case. Since agents do not internalize the e¤ects of the growth externalities, the wealth e¤ect
coming from higher commodity prices, induce them to borrow to consume more, an e¤ect
   4
    We thank Martin Uribe for stressing this point. We acknowledge here that the wealth e¤ect is a well
known result in a bond only small open economy. To the best of our knowledge, we are not aware of
studies that have emphasized its implication for resource allocation and the possibility that it might lead to
a complete de-industrialization in the long-run as we discussed in the paper.



                                                      7
that further shift resources out of the traded good sector.




Related literature: This paper is related to several strands of literature. First, our
paper is related to the literature on the “Dutch disease” Corden and Neary (1982) is the
reference work within this strand of literature. We borrow their structure but we focus on
temporary shocks emphasizing the role of international …nancial markets in the transmission
of commodity price shocks. Krugman (1987) introduces positive growth externalities in
the manufacturing sector: his paper shows how comparative advantage evolves over time
when a learning-by-doing externality is introduced, leading to dynamic economies of scale.
In this case, the shift in country’s comparative advantage from the manufacturing sector
to the production of natural resources will entail a problem when eventually, the natural
resource will run out and the lost manufacturing sector will not come back.5 We also adopt
a similar structure in which the traded sector is the source of dynamic productivity gains.
van der Ploeg and Venables (2013) study the e¤ects of a windfall of foreign exchange in a
two-sector small open economy, focusing, as we do, here on the issue of structural change
that occurs following a temporary windfall. While we share the same insight in terms of
the role of …nancial openness and its long-run implication, our three-sector economy allows
us to study how the evolution of relative comparative advantage between the traded and
the commodity sectors interact with the structure of international …nancial market and the
presence of dynamic productivity gains.6
       Another strand of literature studies the business cycle and policy implications of com-
   5
      In Krugman (1987) there is no explicit consideration given to the oil sector, but the increased in‡ow
of foreign currency that follows natural resource discoveries is approximated with a direct transfer payment
from the foreign to the home country.
    6
      Their framework is richer in other dimensions from which we are abstracting. They consider the role
of physical capital accumulation and di¤erences in capital intensities and capital mobility between sectors.
They emphasize the role of imperfection in explaining the adjustment towards the new steady state following
commodity windfall. In our case the dynamic of the adjustment towards the new steady state depends on the
possibility that comparative advantage in‡uences how resources are allocated during the commodity price
change.

modity price ‡uctuations. Garcia-Cicco and Kamawura (2015) develop a rich small open
economy model with …nancial frictions, a learning by doing externality and a fraction of
non-Ricardian (credit constraint) consumers. Their focus is mainly normative and they as-
sess the relative merits of rules for government expenditures, capital controls and taxes on
domestic lending. Hevia and Nicolini (2015) on the other hand study the optimal monetary
and exchange rate policies in small open economy with price and wage rigidities subject to
oil price shocks. Similarly, Catao and Chang (2015) analyze the optimal monetary policy
response to changes in world food prices in a framework in which food plays a distinctive
role in the utility functions. Bergholt (2014) uses a rich model applied to the Norwegian
economy to study the conduct of optimal monetary policy for an oil exporting economy in
which the oil sector a¤ects the rest of the economy through the supply chain channel. This
channel is modelled by considering the case in which producing oil requires intermediate
home goods produced in the manufacturing and the service sector. He …nds that this supply
chain channel does not alter the standard monetary policy prescriptions.
   While we share some of the features of these papers, our focus is more on the medium-run
‡uctuations and less on short run policy stabilization issues.
   A third strand of literature studies the interaction between commodity price ‡uctuations
and the optimal resource extraction problem: recently Hamann et al. (2015) propose an
interesting model to study the impact of permanent commodity price ‡uctuations on mon-
etary policy for a small open economy along those lines by combining both short-run and
long-run aspects of commodity price ‡uctuations. Finally, our paper is also related to Be-
nigno and Fornaro (2014) who study how …nancial market shocks in‡uences the allocation
of resources between traded and non-traded sectors: our framework here is more general as
we consider explicitly the role of the commodity sector and the allocation of resources in a
three-sector economy and also because we study the possibility that the economy might face
the possibility of full de-industrialization. Moreover, this paper focuses on the role of the

structure of …nancial markets to study the adjustment following a commodity price shock.



2         Model

We …rst start from a model that borrows its structure from the original paper by Corden and
Neary (1982). The framework that we adopt is one of a three sectors small open economy
that produces two goods (that we interpret as commodity and a consumption good) which
are traded at an exogenously given world prices and a third non-traded goods, the price of
which equalizes domestic demand and supply. We allow for few but key di¤erences with
respect to Corden and Neary (1982): …rst, on the external side we are going to study a
…nancially open economy, in which there are trade imbalances and the current account can
be di¤erent from zero.7 Secondly, we assume the presence of dynamic productive externalities
in production are present in the traded sector as in previous contributions by Van Wijnbergen
(1984) and Krugman (1987).8 Finally, the characterization of the commodity good is such
that the commodity good is produced using labor as variable input, serve as inputs in the
other production processes but it is not directly consumed.
        We consider a perfect foresight in…nite-horizon small open economy so that in our analysis
we can focus on two possible international …nancial asset market structures: one in which
there is no trade in assets (…nancial autarky) and another one in which agents can trade in
a real risk free asset.9 Time is discrete and indexed by t. The economy is populated by a
continuum of mass 1 of identical households and by a large number of …rms operating in the
three sectors.
    7
     Corden and Neary (1982) consider an economy that is subject to permanent shocks so that the current
account is balanced. In our analysis, the case of …nancial autarky coincides with the analysis of Corden and
Neary (1982).
   8
     In particular, as in Torvik (2001) we also allow for the general case in which there are dynamic productive
externalities and learning spillovers across all sectors.
   9
     In the robustness section, we allow also for the case in which, under …nancial openness, the interest rate,
at which the small open economy borrows, is debt-elastic.

2.1    Households

The representative household derives utility from consumption and supplies inelastically L
units of labor each period. The household’s lifetime utility is given by

                                                       X
                                                       1
                                                                 t
                                              U=                     u (Ct ) :                                      (1)
                                                       t=0


In this expression,    < 1 is the subjective discount factor and Ct denotes the consumption
of a composite good. Ct is de…ned as a CES aggregator of tradable CtT and non-tradable
CtN consumption goods. We assume that the period utility function is isoelastic:

                                                             1                  1
                                           u Ctj                        Ctj           :
                                                        1

The consumption basket, Ct , is a CES aggregate of tradable and nontradable goods

                               h       1           1                        1                 1   i   1
                         Ct        !       CtT         + (1            !)           CtN                   :         (2)


where 0 < ! < 1 denotes the share of expenditure in consumption that the household assigns
to the tradable good and      is the elasticity of intratemporal substitution between traded and
non-traded goods.
   The budget constraint of the household is

                                             Bt+1
                      CtT + PtN CtN +             = Wt L + Bt +                       O
                                                                                      t   +       N
                                                                                                  t   +       T
                                                                                                              t :   (3)
                                              Rt

The budget constraint is expressed in units of the tradable good, whose price is constant and
normalized to 1. The left-hand side represents the household’s expenditure. We de…ne PtN
as the relative price of the non-tradable good in terms of the tradable good, so CtT + PtN CtN
is the household’s consumption expenditure expressed in units of the tradable good. Bt+1 is



                                                            11
the stock of one-period risk-free bonds purchased by the household at price 1=Rt . Rt is the
gross world interest rate, which is exogenous from the perspective of the small open economy.
   The right-hand side represents the income of the household. We denote with Wt the
wage rate, and so Wt L is the labor income received by the household. Bt is the gross return
on the stock of bonds purchased by the household at time t                                1. Finally, domestic …rms in
                                                                                 j
all sectors are wholly owned by domestic households and                          t   (with j = O; N; T ) denotes the
pro…ts received from …rms’ownership by the representative household.
   Each period the representative household chooses CtT , CtN and Bt+1 to maximize utility
(1) subject to the budget constraint (3). The …rst order conditions of this problem are:

                                                                   1

                                                                                         N
                            CN : (Ct )                            (1    !) =         t Pt ;                        (5)

where    t   denotes the Lagrange multiplier associated with the budget constraint, i.e. the
household’s marginal utility of wealth. By combining the optimality conditions (4) and (5),
we obtain the standard intratemporal equilibrium condition that links the relative price of
non-tradable goods to the marginal rate of substitution between tradable and non-tradable
goods:
                                                   1               1
                                    (1        !)        CtN
                                              1               1        = PtN :                                     (7)
                                          !       (CtT )

According to this expression, PtN is increasing in CtT and decreasing in CtN . In what follows
we will use PtN as a proxy for the real exchange rate.
   The last …rst order condition (6) is the standard Euler equation which determines the
intertemporal allocation of tradable consumption between a generic period t and the subse-
quent period t + 1.

2.2    Firms

Firms operate in three sectors: one sector produces the tradable good, one produces the
commodity good (oil) and the other one produces the non-tradable good. This structure
resembles Corden and Neary (1982) and Hamann et al. (2015) in which the commodity
goods is used as an input in the production process of the traded and non-traded goods.


Tradable sector. In the tradable sector there is a large number of …rms that produce
using labor LTt , the commodity good M O;T and the stock of knowledge At , according to the
production function
                                                       T               T
                                YtT = ATt LTt              (M O;T )1       ;               (8)

where YtT is the amount of tradable goods produced in period t.
   The stock of knowledge is non-rival and non-excludable and so it can be freely used by
…rms producing tradable goods. Hence, pro…ts can then be written as


                                 T
                                 t   = YtT       Wt LTt       PtO MtO;T ;


where Wt denotes the wage rate in units of traded goods and PtO is the relative price of the
commodity good. Pro…t maximization implies that


                                             T   YtT
                                                     = Wt                                  (9)
                                                 LTt


                                             T        YtT
                                     (1          )     O;T
                                                           = PtO                          (10)
                                                     Mt

   These expressions say that at the optimum …rms equalize the marginal pro…t from an
increase in its variable input, the left-hand side of the expression, to its marginal cost, the




                                                     13
right-hand side. We note that by combining (9) and (10), we obtain:

                                                             T          1     T
                                                (Wt )             PtO
                                      1=                     T                     T
                                                                                       ;       (11)
                                            ATt (    T)          (1         T )1



that de…nes the real marginal cost for the traded sector. From this expression we can see
that the real wage is going to be determined by the evolution of the stock of knowledge and
the relative price of the commodity good which in our case are both exogenously given.


Non-tradable sector. There is a representative …rm producing a homogeneous non-
traded good in a perfectly competitive environment. The …rm chooses two inputs, labor
and a commodity good , according to the production function


                                                                 N                 N
                                     YtN = (AN  N
                                             t L )                   (M O;N )1         :       (12)


YtN denotes the output of the non-tradable good, AN
                                                  t is total factor productivity speci…c

to the non-traded sector, LN
                           t is the amount of labor employed by …rms in the non-tradable

sector and M O;N is the amount of commodity used in the production of the non-traded good.
Pro…ts10 in the non-tradable sector are


                                     N

     From the expression of the marginal cost in the traded and non-traded sector, (11)

 N       T
     =       the real exchange rate will be determined by supply side only and will be a function
of relative productivity in the traded and non-traded sector.


Commodity Sector. The commodity sector produces under a decreasing return to scale
technology using just labor as a variable input according to the following production function:

                                                                     O

YtO denotes the output of the commodity good, AO
                                               t is total factor productivity speci…c to the

From this expression we note that an increase in the price of the commodity good leads to
an increase in the demand of the labor for a given wage. We will refer to this e¤ect as the
resource movement e¤ect (as in Corden and Neary,1982) as mobile resources (in this case
labor) are directed toward the commodity sector.

Knowledge accumulation. One of the key feature of our small open economy is the
endogenous process of knowledge accumulation. In our baseline case we allow for the stock
of knowledge to evolve endogenously only in the traded sector.11
       In particular, the stock of knowledge available to …rms in the tradable sector evolves
according to
                                                                    ATt
                                ATt+1 = ATt     1 + cT T LTt   1            ;                            (18)
                                                                    At

where cT T > 0 is a parameter determining the impact of the sectoral labor allocation on
productivity growth, and At denotes the stock of knowledge of the world technological leader,
which grows at the constant rate g .12 ,13
       This speci…cation is similar to the one adopted in Benigno and Fornaro (2014) in which
the stock of knowledge in a generic period t depends not only on the past knowledge, but
also on the amount of labor employed in the tradable sector. The more the amount of labor
that is allocated towards the traded sector the faster is the convergence towards the world
technology frontier. As in Nelson and Phelps (1966) and Benhabib and Spiegel (2005), this
formulation captures the idea that human capital contributes to the absorption of foreign
knowledge. Secondly, under this speci…cation in which dynamic productivity gains arise only
in the traded sector, the source of convergence in productivity is given by the traded sector,
in the spirit of the empirical …ndings of Duarte and Restuccia (2010) and Rodrik (2013).
       Moreover, the allocation of labor across the three sectors also in‡uences the transition
toward the steady state. In particular, in the numerical simulations we will consider the case
of a country that starts below its steady-state proximity to the frontier. In this case, during
the transition to the steady state the stock of knowledge of the economy grows at a rate
  11
      In the robustness analysis we will allow for the stock of knowledge to evolves endogenously in the three
sectors depending on the amount of labor employed in each sector and we will also consider the possibility
that there will be spillovers transmitted from one sector to the others.
   12
      The assumption of an exogenous world technological frontier means that our small open economy is too
small to have an impact on the evolution of the world’s stock of knowledge.
   13
      In what follows, we denote with at = At =At the proximity of the country to the world technological
frontier.



                                                     16
higher than the one of the world technological frontier.
       As mentioned above, we assume that knowledge is a non-rival and non-excludable good.
This assumption, combined with the presence of a large number of …rms in the tradable
sector, implies that …rms in the traded sector, do not internalize the impact of their actions
on the evolution of the economy’s stock of knowledge. This is a typical growth externality:
…rms do not internalize the value of allocating labor to the traded sector, because they don’t
consider the impact of their actions on the growth rate of productivity in the traded sector.
This is a feature of the most in‡uential endogenous growth models (as in Romer (1986),
Romer (1990) and Aghion and Howitt (1992)).

       In terms of production structure there are three assumptions in our baseline framework.
We …rst assume that there is faster productivity growth in the tradable sectors compared to
the other sectors (non-tradable and commodity sectors). Secondly, in our baseline case, we
allow for the traded sector to be the only sector that experiences dynamic productivity gains
and …nally we rule out any spillover from productivity gains in the traded sectors to other
sectors in the economy and viceversa. Benigno and Fornaro (2014) provide a discussion on
the empirical evidence that underpins our …rst two assumptions. To summarize, there is a
substantial body of literature that support the idea that faster productivity growth arises in
the traded sector compared to other sectors of the economy for both advanced and emerging
                       14
market economies.
       Secondly, cross-country knowledge spillovers have a key role in the context of the growth
literature (Grossman and Helpman (1991) and Parente and Prescott (1994), Santacreu
(2015)): the empirical evidence suggests that the traded sector bene…ts more from these
spillovers.15 Moreover, there is a body of literature that emphasizes the role of trade in
  14
     Indeed, using data from OECD countries during the period 1970–1985, De Gregorio et al (1994) …nd
that TFP grows faster in the tradable goods sector relative to the non-tradable sectors while Duarte and
Restuccia (2010) reach the same conclusion, using data from both OECD and emerging economies, for the
period 1956–2004.
  15
     Rodrik (2013) considers cross-country convergence in productivity at the industry level and …nds that



                                                   17
facilitating the transmission of knowledge and productivity growth across countries. The
empirical analysis of Coe et al. (1997) and Amiti and Konings (2007) emphasize the role
of imports while Blalock and Gertler (2004), Van Biesebroeck (2005), Park et al. (2010) in
China, and by Manjon et al. (2013) in Spain, for micro evidence focus on the role of exports.
   Finally, in our baseline case, we rule any technology spillovers from the traded sector to
the other sectors of the economy. While there is some evidence that a booming energy sector
has spillover e¤ects on the non-oil sector (see Bjornalnd and Thorsrud (2016) for the case of
Norway) we focus …rst on the simpler structure to highlight the mechanism and later discuss
the e¤ects of spillovers among sectors.



2.3     Market clearing and competitive equilibrium

Market clearing for the non-tradable good requires that the amount consumed is equal to
the amount produced:
                                              CtN = YtN :                                             (19)

Combining equation (19), with the households’budget constraint (3), the equations for …rms’
                                                       T       N       O
pro…ts and the equilibrium condition          t   =    t   +   t   +   t ,   we obtain the market clearing
condition for the tradable good:

               Bt+1 Bt
      CAt =            = YtT         CtT + PtO YtO         MtO;T       MtO;N + Bt (1      1=Rt ):     (20)
                  Rt

Here we note that when the commodity good is not used as an input in the production
process of traded and non-traded goods, its only possible use is to be exported. On the
other hand, when it is used as an input in the production process, it might happen that
depending on its price, it might be optimal for the country to import the commodity good
this is present only in manufactures, which may the bulk of the tradable sector. Similarly, Duarte and
Restuccia (2010) …nd that convergence in productivity takes place in agriculture and manufacturing,but not
in services


                                                      18
and not producing it. Equation (20) represents the current account (CA) equation for our
small open economy. The current account is given by net exports, YtT            CtT , plus net interest
payments on the stock of net foreign assets owned by the country at the start of the period,
Bt (1   1=Rt ) plus the trade balance for the commodity sector, PtO YtO            MtO;T     MtO;N .
   Finally, in equilibrium labor supply by households must equal labor demand from …rms


                                        L = LTt + LN   O
                                                   t +L :                                         (21)



2.4     Dynamic equilibrium conditions and balanced growth path

The equilibrium conditions that de…ne the dynamic equilibrium of the model for the case of
…nancial account openness are given by the following set of equations: (note that the price
of commodity is exogenous to the small open economy). From the household optimization
problem, we obtain the Euler equation and the intratemporal allocation of consumption
between traded and non-traded goods.


                                       Pt+1 Ct+1 = Rt Pt Ct                                       (22)
                                                          1         1
                                               (1    !)       CtN
                                     PtN   =         1          1       :                         (23)
                                                    ! (CtT )
   We then have from the tradeable …rms’ problem (9) and (10), from the non-tradeable
…rms’problem (13) and (14), while (10) will be the relevant …rst order condition from the
commodity sector. The system is then closed by the market clearing conditions (20), (19)
and (21) along with the law of motion for technologies (25), (27), (26). and the three

    The equilibrium under …nancial autarky replaces the current account equation (20) with
the balanced trade condition in which


                    CAt = 0 =) CtT = YtT + PtO YtO       MtO;T   MtO;N :


Under …nancial autarky (and zero initial net foreign assets position) the value of consumption
of the traded goods and the value of the commodity input used in the production processes
is equalized to the value of traded and commodity outputs. The key di¤erence is that
under …nancial autarky, the real interest rate (the intertemporal price of consumption) is
endogenously determined. This characterization of …nancial market would be the one that is
implicitly adopted in Corden and Neary (1982). Moreover, we note that the case of …nancial
autarky will allow us to implicitly analyze the possibility of permanent shocks: indeed when
there is a permanent shift in our exogenous states, consumption will immediately adjust to
the new steady sate value without any changes in the net foreign asset position.



3     Revisiting the commodity resource curse

In this section we consider an episode in which commodity prices increase temporarily: in
particular, we assume that the price of commodity goods increases by 50% for 10 years and
then returns to its initial value. This experiment is meant to capture in a simple stylized
way long-lasting swings in commodity prices.
    Our experiment is di¤erent from the exercise conducted in Corden and Neary (1982):
they focus on comparative static analysis in which they study a permanent change in com-
modity prices or equivalently permanent shift in the technology in that sector. Motivated
by historical evidence on long-lasting swings in commodity prices (see IMF (2015)), here
we examine temporary changes rather than permanent ones. As we shall see, this aspect


                                                20
becomes relevant for understanding the allocation e¤ects of commodity price booms since
temporary changes in prices lead to current account adjustments that have long-run e¤ects
on the economy.
   In what follows, before presenting our results, we brie‡y describe our parametrization
strategy and then discuss di¤erent simple cases.

   We study the properties of the model using numerical simulations. We solve the model



                                                21
using a standard shooting algorithm.16 ,17 Our framework is too simple to lend itself to a
careful calibration exercise, hence our strategy consists in choosing reasonable values for the
parameters in order to illustrate the model’s properties, while we leave the study of a more
realistic framework for future research with richer models.
       A period in the model corresponds to one year. We follow Benigno and Fornaro (2014)
for the parametrization of the growth process. We set the growth rate of the technological
frontier to g = 0:015, to match the average annual growth rate of TFP in the United States
between 1960 and 1995 as computed by Benhabib and Spiegel (2005). In the benchmark
parametrization the world interest rate is assumed constant and equal to R = 1:04. The
discount factor is set to         = 0:976, so that in steady state consumption of tradable goods
grows at the same rate of the world technological frontier. This essentially means that the
economy shares the same discount factor as the rest of the world. The endowment of labor
is normalized to L = 1. We assume that the economy starts with a net foreign asset position
              B                  B
such that    GDP
                       = 0 or   GDP
                                      =   50% depending on the exercise that we run, where GDP
stands for gross domestic product and is measured in units of traded goods.
  16
    More precisely, we make a guess for the path of consumption of the traded good. Using the guess we
solve the model and check whether the intertemporal resource constraint of the economy is satis…ed. If this
is not the case, we update the guess for the consumption of the traded good.
                                                                                                     t
  17
    A solution satis…es the dynamic equilibrium conditions and the transversality condition CBt t ! 0. For
any given C0 , we can solve contemporaneous variables and simulate a sequence of C t so that the equation
systems is satis…ed by construction. It remains to …nd the initial consumption C0 = C0 such that the
transversality condition is satis…ed.
                                                             t                            t
  This can be done by a bi-section algorithm. If C0 > C0 , CBt t ! 1. As a result, if CBt t ! 1 in a
                                                                      t                          t
simulation, we …nd the upperbound of C0u > C0 . If C0 < C0 , CBt t ! 1. As a result, if CBt t ! 1 in a
simulation, we …nd the lowerbound of C0l < C0 . As long as we have the initial two bounds we can simulate
            C u +C l
from C0 = 0 2 0 and update the upperbound or lowerbound according to the transversality condition. The
gap between upperbound and lowerbound closes by one half in each iteration. The iteration stops either until
                                               t
the gap of the bounds is small enough or until CBt t is close enough to 0 for a large periods of simulation.
  When a balance growth path (BGP) exists, another terminal condition can be BBt+1      t
                                                                                           ! Rt . It is a
su¢ cient condition for the transversality condition to satisfy. This is because, noting the Euler equation
                                          t
                                            Bt
Ct+1 = Rt Ct , so BCt ! constant and Ct ! 0.

                                          Bt+1
  It turns out the terminal condition      Bt    ! Rt leads to more precise solution of C0 for a …nite T period
                                                                          t
simulation. This is because, the …nite period approximation of CBt t ! 0 is equivalent to BT = 0, while
BT > 0 is indeed the case. This advantage even carries to the senario when BGP fails to exist.

      The initial values for the stock of knowledge of the home country and of the world
technological leader are chosen with values consistent with the TFP estimates reported by
Benhabib and Spiegel (2005). In particular, we set the initial stock of knowledge of the
technological leader to A0 = 7.18 The initial stock of knowledge for our small open economy
is set to A0 = 3. This calibration implies an initial proximity to the frontier equal to
a0 = 0:42. Moreover we set in the technology parameter for the commodity sector to AO
                                                                                    0 = 2

but we study the adjustment of the economy under di¤erent scenarios for higher TFP in the
commodity sector (AO
                   0 = 2:5):

      In our baseline case, we allow for dynamic productivity gains to be concentrated only in
the traded sectors and we do not allow for any spillovers e¤ects. At this stage, we set the
other parameters following Benigno and Fornaro (2014) as a way to illustrate the properties
of the model. In particular we set cT T = 0:167, the share of tradable goods in consumption
is chosen equal to ! = 0:414 so that after 26 years the ratio PtN YtN =YtT is compatible
with the ratio of non-tradable-to-tradable GDP provided by Hamann et al. (2015) for the
Colombian economy.19 We set the elasticity of intertemporal substitution                   = 1; and the
elasticity of intratemporal substitution between traded and non-traded goods to 0.75 a value
that is consistent with the international business cycle literature. In terms of the production
                     T          N             o
function, we let         = 1;       = 1 and       = 0:66: in doing so, we allow for decreasing returns to
scale in the commodity sector while we eliminate the e¤ects of commodity goods on marginal
costs in the other sector. In the robustness section we will allow for di¤erent labor share in
the traded and non-traded sectors to capture the fact that labor share is higher in the traded
sector. We then set the risk premium elasticity to               = 0:01 for the debt-elastic case higher
than the 0:005 estimated by Bergholt and Larsen (2015) for the Norwegian economy.

 18
      The value of TFP in the US in 1995 was around 6.4.
 19
      Their value is equal to 1.76.

3.2    Analysis

We now analyze the properties of our economy. We are going to focus on two aspects of our
model. The …rst is related to the patterns of specialization (i.e. the allocation of resources
among the three sectors within our small open economy). The second aspect is related to
how unexpected shocks a¤ect the long-run pattern of specialization within our economy. We
will then examine di¤erent special cases. In the …rst two cases our aim is to understand
how the …nancial channel operates and to do so we abstract from the endogenous growth
component of our model and technology spillovers (we set cii = 0 8i = T; N; O) by studying
the impact of a commodity price booms under …nancial account autarky and openness.
Then we examine the case of endogenous growth along with …nancial account openness to
understand the interaction between growth and …nancial account.
   Our …rst result, though, is independent on the structure of …nancial markets and the
existence of the endogenous growth component and is related to the pattern of specialization
determined by changes in the exogenous terms of trade between commodity and traded
goods (i.e. P O ). The following proposition states that following commodity price changes it
is possible for our economy to specialize completely in the production of commodity good.
   The following proposition holds:



Proposition 1 Under a constant return to scale production functions and perfect competi-
tion in the traded sector and commodity sector, then for su¢ ciently high value of P O , the
economy does not produce traded goods.



Proof. From (11), we obtain an expression for the determination of the real wage in terms
of traded goods price as

                                                                                                               O
price of the commodity good. From (17), (under constant return to scale, i.e.                                      = 1), we
have
                                                  Wt = AO PtO :

We note that the wage in both equations is a function of exogenous factors (the price of the
commodity good, the productivity levels in the two sectors). When

is no longer pro…table to produce traded goods and the economy produces only commodity
and non-traded goods. This happens for a su¢ ciently high value of P O :

                                                          (AO )        T




   Our result about the pattern of specialization is related to the Ricardian theory of compar-
ative advantage. When the relative price of the commodity goods exceeds its relative costs,
then resources tend to move towards the commodity sector. In the absence of non-traded
goods, all labor will shift towards the commodity sector and the economy will specialize in
the production of the commodity good. In the presence of non-traded goods, part of the
labor supply is allocated to the production of non-traded goods that are consumed within
the domestic economy, while the rest will be absorbed by the commodity sector. Conversely,
if the price of the commodity goods drops beyond a critical level our economy will import
the commodity goods for production purposes and will specialize in the production of traded
goods.
   We note here that our result on the pattern of specialization depends on the assumption

                                                          25
of constant return to scale technology in the traded good sector only. More generally, we do
not need constant return to scale in the commodity sector. Moreover, if we would assume
decreasing return to scale in the traded sector, we would get an interior solution and the
economy will always produce both traded and commodity goods.
       As we noted above our proposition is independent of the …nancial market structure: it
holds under …nancial autarky and …nancial openness. It is also independent on the presence
of the endogenous growth component. Similar to the Ricardian economy, supply side factors
matter for determining the pattern of specialization. The demand side here will determine
the variable labor supply available to the commodity and traded sector: indeed, changes in
the commodity price will a¤ect the demand of non-traded consumption that will determine
the amount of labor allocated to the non-traded good sector and as such the residual amount
that will be available to the other two sectors.20
       The second aspect of the analysis that we want to highlight is speci…c to the structure of
…nancial markets. Under …nancial openness, in our one bond small open economy any (tem-
porary) shock generate a wealth e¤ect that has permanent consequences on consumption,
the allocation of labor among sector and relative prices. The existence of a wealth e¤ect
is a well-known property of a one-bond small open economy. Here we want to emphasize
how this channel has implication for the allocation of resources among sectors following one
particular type of shock (the commodity shock). The wealth e¤ect could also lead to a
permanent de-industrialization of the economy.21

  20
     The allocation of resources towards the non-traded goods is determined by (23) along with (15) and
the current account equation (20). When the commodity sector has constant return to scale (as in the
proposition) there is no feedback from this set of equations for determining the path of resources between
traded and commodity sector.
  21
     We are thankful to Martin Uribe for emphasizing this aspect in his discussion. To illustrate this case, we
simplify our economy by further considering the case in which N = T = O = 1; so that the only variable
                                                                                        AT

3.2.1    The e¤ects of a commodity price boom: the no growth case


We now study the response of our economy when there is no endogenous growth (cT T = 0).
We focus on two cases: …rst we study the response of our economy under …nancial autarky
and then under open …nancial account.

and (by assuming ! = 0:5) from (23) and (20) we obtain (in steady state):

                                  CT   AT (1         LN      LO ) + RR 1 B + P O LO

  We can combine the two expression that determine the relative price of non-traded goods as in (in steady
state):
                                                                        AT O

                              A                        A L
This expression shows that as the asset position rises there is an increase in the quantity of labor allocated
to the non-traded sector. For a su¢ ciently high level of the asset position

we have that the traded sector disappears and the economy experiences full de-industrialization in the long-
run.

                                            Figure 3: commodity boom with no growth


   Figure 3 summarizes the adjustment of the economy following an increase in commodity
prices for 10 periods under …nancial autarky and …nancial openness (bond economy). In the
…gure we also plot the “benchmark”case in which the economy is not subject to any shock.
   We …rst discuss the autarky case. As in Corden and Neary (1982), there are two e¤ects.
The resource allocation e¤ect and the spending e¤ect. The boom in the commodity sector
raises its marginal product of labour, drawing resources out of the other sectors. The spend-
ing e¤ect arises from the increase in real income following the commodity price boom and
leads to a higher consumption of traded and non-traded goods.
   In our economy and under our parametrization, the resource movement e¤ect leads to an
increase in the labor share employed in the commodity sector and a full de-industrialization
as labor share in the traded sector drops to zero. Because of the spending e¤ect, households

                                                                                     28
consume more of both traded and non-traded goods. Higher non-traded goods consumption
is accommodated by a shift of resources towards the non-traded sector while the increase
in traded consumption is obtained by importing traded goods from abroad and …nancing
them by commodity exports. Once the commodity boom ends the economy goes back to its
initial state. An interesting aspect of the adjustment mechanism is that when the economy
experiences a period of complete de-industrialization 22 (the traded labor share goes to zero),
then the real exchange rate initially appreciate and then goes back to its initial value once
the boom ends. Indeed, when there is de-industrialization, the determination of the relative
price is no longer given by the supply side (since traded goods are no longer produced) but
is obtained from the demand side.23
       When …nancial account is open, there are few di¤erences relative to the autarky case.
When a country borrows and lend from abroad, accumulation or decumulation of net foreign
assets (as long as the world interest rate is positive) give rise to a wealth e¤ect. This is a
general property of a one bond small open economy.24 As discussed earlier, this wealth e¤ect
plays a key role in determining the pattern of production and the resource allocation among
the three sectors of our economy.25 Earlier we have shown that even under a temporary
commodity price boom there could be a permanent shift of resources out of the traded
goods sector. When the economy is richer (due to temporary higher commodity prices) it
runs a current account surplus and smooth traded consumption. The increase in tradeable
consumption leads to an increase in non-traded consumption and a shift of resources towards
the commodity and non-traded goods sector. When the commodity boom ends, the only way
for the economy to sustain higher non-traded consumption is by shifting resources towards
  22
     The possiblity of full de-industrialization is ruled out in Corden and Neary (1982) and van der Ploeg
and Venables (2013).
  23
     We note here that when the commodity price returns to its initial value, there is a one-period adjustment
in the real interest rate. Indeed, under …nancial autarky the real interest rate is endogenously determined.
  24
     See also van der Ploeg and Venables (2013) on this.
  25
     This wealth e¤ect is not present in Corden and Neary (1982) as they focus on permanent shocks or
…nancial autarky case.

the non-traded good sector out of the traded sector. The wealth e¤ects generated from the
…nancial channel has permanent consequences in terms of resources allocation.
   Moreover, similar to the case of …nancial autarky, and depending on the size of the
commodity boom, the economy could experience a period of complete de-industrialization
that generates ‡uctuations in non-traded consumption and the real exchange rate despite
the possibility of smoothing consumption and even when all technologies are constant return
to scale (as in the …gure).



3.2.2   The e¤ects of a commodity price boom: growth case


We now study the response of our economy when the traded sector experiences dynamic
productivity gains and the economy converges eventually to the world technology frontier.
As before we distinguish between …nancial autarky and …nancial openness.
   In general, the presence of dynamic productivity gains, and in particular the anticipation
of these gains, induce agents to borrow as the economy is expected to converge towards
the balanced growth path as long as the economy starts below its steady state proximity
to the foreign technological frontier. This e¤ect results into a current account de…cit that
counterbalance the e¤ect of a temporary commodity price boom (which tends to generate a
current account surplus).
   In Figure 4, we represent the adjustment of the economy following a temporary commod-
ity price boom (dashed line) under …nancial autarky. The solid line shows the transitional
dynamic of the economy without commodity price boom. In the latter case, the stock of
knowledge grows faster than the growth rate of the world technological frontier. Indeed,
initially, annual productivity growth is above 2 percent, higher than in the steady state (1.5
percent). As the economy approaches the steady state, we observe an increase in the share of
labor allocated to the traded sector and a declining share to the commodity and non-traded



                                             30
sector. Note here that in both scenario (with and without the commodity price boom), the
economy converges towards the same equilibrium path.

  Figure 4: commodity boom under …nancial autarky with learning by doing and growth


   When there is a commodity price boom, the transition towards the steady state is delayed
and in the extreme case of complete de-industrialization, there is no productivity growth as
long as the economy experiences the boom since labor is reallocated towards the commodity
and the non-traded sectors.

   Finally, in Figure 5, we show the response of the economy under …nancial openness.

        Figure 5: commodity boom under …nancial openness with LBD and growth


   We note that a commodity boom leads to an improvement in the current account com-
pared to the benchmark economy (solid line) that worsen once the boom ends. Again, during
the boom, the economy stops producing traded goods but then, after the boom ends, it starts
allocating resources towards the traded sector and eventually the economy converges (slowly)
towards the world technology frontier. The key di¤erence with respect to the case of …nan-
cial autarky is that the temporary boom has permanent e¤ect on the allocation of resources
among the di¤erent sectors. The size of the commodity price boom determines the patterns
of the resource allocation. In our example there is a signi…cant increase in commodity prices
and a shift of resources out of traded and non-traded sector towards the commodity sector.
Under …nancial openness, the economy initially runs a current account surplus and, once
the boom ends, it borrows as long as the economy converges towards the world technology
frontier. The commodity boom delays the catching up process and once the boom ends the
economy shift resources back towards the traded goods sector and …nances the consumption
boom by borrowing more heavily from abroad. Lower net foreign assets position eventually

                                                                        32
results in lower consumption of both traded and non-traded goods as the economy is rela-
tively poorer (compared to the benchmark case of no commodity shock) due to the delayed
convergence towards the technology frontier.

                   Figure 6: commodity boom under …nancial openness, growth trap

   Interestingly, there is now the possibility that the economy ends up in a growth trap.
In Figure 6, we allow for a relatively more productive commodity sector at the beginning
of the economy (from AO         O
                      0 = 2 to A0 = 2:5). As before, the commodity boom triggers

complete de-industrialization. When the boom ends, labor shift back to the traded sector
but the rate of growth of the traded sector is not high enough compared to wage growth and
eventually producing traded goods becomes non-pro…table. There are few aspects of this
result that we want to emphasize: under our parametrization, if there were no commodity
shock, the economy will converge towards the balanced growth path so the commodity boom
is the causal factor in determining the outcome. Alternatively, the possibility of a growth
trap depends crucially on the initial conditions of the technology in the traded versus the
commodity sector. In our example, the commodity price boom makes the traded sector

                                                                        33
non-pro…table but it might well happen that, for higher TFP in the commodity sector,
the economy converges towards a growth trap even in the absence of an external shock.
Moreover, under …nancial openness there are permanent implications on resource allocation
caused by wealth e¤ects as the economy run a surplus in the current account. Indeed, when
the commodity boom ends and the economy has accumulated net foreign assets, resources
shift towards non-traded sector and the economy can consume higher non-traded goods
compared to the boom phase.



4     Extensions and Robustness Analysis

In this section we extend our model and we conduct some robustness analysis along some
potentially critical assumptions and parametrization that we have chosen.


4.1    Debt-Elastic Interest Rate

One aspect of interest in understanding the …nancial channel associated with the commodity
curse is given by the observation that during the commodity boom, spreads on sovereign
bonds of exporting countries are lower (see IMF (2015)). In order to capture changes in
borrowing conditions from a country’s point of view, we allow for the possibility that the
interest rate on foreign debt is debt-elastic:



                                                       Bt
                                                     At PtT
                             Rt = R +            e            for Bt < 0              (24)

                             Rt = R otherwise


    so that when a country borrows from the rest of the world, it pays a premium that is a
function of the current net debt position. In principle, a commodity boom, should lead to
an improvement in the external debt position and as such a reduction of the interest rate

                                                 34
at which the country borrows. We label this e¤ect "interest rate channel" that would by
stimulating expenditure when the interest rate at which the country borrows declines.
   We now examine numerically the situation in which the economy starts with an external
debt position.

Figure 7: commodity boom under …nancial autarky, with no LBD or growth, and elastic
interest rate



   We assume that initial debt position is 50% of gross domestic product and examine
the impact of commodity price boom under this scenario where the interest rate, at which
the country borrows, depends on the amount of external debt as in (24). This exercise is
meant to capture another …nancial channel through which commodity boom might a¤ect
the commodity-exporting economy. In Figure 7, we compare the adjustment of the economy
following a commodity price boom, starting from the same debt/GDP ratio, under the
scenario in which the interest rate is …xed and when the interest rate depends on the amount
of external debt.


                                                                        35
   With debt-elastic interest rate, as long as the country holds a debt position, consumption
is lower compared to the …xed interest rate case. This allows more resources to be shifted
toward the commodity sector during its price boom, resulting in higher current account sur-
pluses and faster reduction in the external debt position. Eventually the country accumulates
higher net foreign assets and consumes more of both traded and non-traded goods. Once the
commodity boom ends, the …nancial channel that works through a reduction of the foreign
interest rate has also permanent e¤ects in terms of resource allocation: indeed, similarly to
what we have described before, higher consumption requires further shift of resources out
of the traded goods sector towards the non-traded sector. We note here though, that under
our parametrization, the e¤ects of this channel on the resource allocation among sectors are
quite small.



4.2      Dynamic productivity gains and technological spillovers

In our analysis we have focused on the case in which dynamic productivity gains are concen-
trated only in the traded sectors. We have shown that there is a possibility of a growth trap
following a commodity price boom that depends on the relative productivity of the oil price
sector at the start of the boom cycle. One might argue that the assumption that the trade
sector is the sole contributor to dynamic productivity gains is restrictive and might not be
a realistic approximation for some countries. For example, in the case of Norway, Bjornalnd
and Thorsrud (2015) show, empirically, that a booming energy sector has spillover e¤ects
on the non-oil sector, while Torvik (2001) discusses the theoretical implications of a more
general setting similar to the one that we propose.
   We now allow for a more general case in which technology evolution is then represented
by the following set of equations:

where cii > 0; with i = T; N; O is a parameter determining the impact of the sectoral
labor allocation on productivity growth, and At , as before, denotes the stock of knowledge
of the world technological leader, which grows at the constant rate g . Our assumptions
about technology evolution imply that the stock of knowledge in a generic period t for sector
i = T; N; O depends not only on the past sector speci…c knowledge, but also on the amount
of labor employed in each sector. Moreover,there is a possibility that there are positive
spillovers from other sectors. We assume in general that the direct e¤ect is bigger compared
to the spillover e¤ect so that cT T > cT N ; cT O ; cN N > cN T ; cN O and cOO > cON ; cOT :
   Once we allow for dynamic productivity gains as in (26), (27) and (25), it will always
be the case that the commodity sector and the non-traded sector will eventually grow at
the same rate as the technological frontier. Indeed, commodity will always be produced
under decreasing return to scale while non-traded goods will be always produced as long as
household preferences are well-behaved. As in the previous situation, a growth trap could
arise if the traded sector disappears and all resources are allocated in the other two sectors.
   Resource allocation in the traded sector is now in‡uenced by two di¤erent channels.
Higher spillover e¤ect into the traded sector (cT N and cT O relatively higher) tends to limit
the occurrence of a growth trap as resource will shift in to the traded sector, while stronger
dynamic productivity gains in the commodity and non-traded sector (cN N and cOO relatively
higher) and spillovers into those sectors (cN T ; cN O and cOT ; cON relatively higher) generates


                                                 37
a crowding out e¤ect resulting in a shift of resources out of the traded sector, increasing the
likelihood of a growth trap.

case of the growth trap under …nancial openness, and then cT N = cT O = 0:03; cN N = cOO =
0:05: As before, during the commodity boom, there is complete de-industrialization. In this
case, as the bene…t of a growing commodity and non-traded sector spreads over productivity
in the traded sector, once the boom ends, resources shift back to the traded sector that
eventually converges at the speed of the world technology frontier. Again, the presence of
a wealth e¤ect, generates permanent shift of resources out of the traded sector towards the
non-traded sector to sustain higher consumption in the long-run.

      Not surprisingly, once we compare the social planner allocation with the competitive
equilibrium one, we …nd that the main di¤erence relates to how the social planner allocates
labor towards the traded sector compared to the competitive allocation. Once PtN =                                                  1;t

When the social planner values higher ATt+1 , we have that                                     t    > 026 . As a result, the right-hand
side of (29) is smaller. Due to decreasing returns to scale for LT , we have LT;soc > LT;com .
The social planner would like to allocate more labour to the tradable sector for given wage.
      In what follows, we use the social planner allocation as our benchmark case in conducting
our comparative welfare analysis that studies the implications of alternative …nancial market
structures when the economy is subject to a boom in commodity prices.
      We compute the impact on welfare of ten years of high commodity prices as the percentage
increase in consumption that the representative household has to receive in any future date
in order to be indi¤erent between staying in the benchmark economy or moving to the
economy with relatively higher commodity prices. Formally, the certainty equivalents                                              from

   where in our case the benchmark economy is the social planner allocation under the
baseline calibration so that higher value of the certainty equivalent imply higher welfare
compared to the benchmark case.
   In our experiments we have focused on two scenarios. In the …rst scenario we have
studied the allocation of resources when there are no dynamic productivity gains: we have
shown that, under …nancial openness, a temporary commodity shock can have permanent
e¤ects on resource allocation. Moreover, during the temporary boom, the economy might
de-industrialize and could stop producing traded goods. From the characterization of the
social planner problem, it follows that these adjustments are always e¢ cient and there is no
scope to improve upon the competitive equilibrium allocation.
   Under this scenario (see Figure 9), …nancial openness is always welfare improving as
the economy accumulates foreign assets and enjoys a permanent increase in consumption.
Moreover, a commodity price boom has a positive welfare e¤ects on the economy.
   The second scenario allows for dynamic productivity gains in the traded sector. We
learnt that depending on initial conditions, the economy could end up in a growth trap. In
Figure 10, we plot the certainty equivalence consumption gains/losses as we vary the initial
technological factor in the commodity sector.

   Conditional on our parametrization, welfare gains and losses are nonlinear.
   Let’s consider the case of …nancial autarky …rst (represented by the red line when there
is a commodity boom and a blue line when there is no commodity boom). As long as
the technology in the commodity sector is relatively weaker than the traded sector one,
we observe that a commodity boom reduces welfare as the technology in the commodity
sector improves: this is so because the economy delays its convergence towards the world
technological frontier. This e¤ect dominates the bene…ts from the higher technology level in
the commodity sector. Under our parametrization, once AO
                                                       0 is bigger than 2:9; a commodity

boom is always welfare improving. However, there is a region after which there is a signi…cant
increase in the welfare losses (for values of 2:8 < AO
                                                     0 < 2:9): the losses occur because the

economy enters a growth trap in which the traded sector is not produced.

                                                                     42
       A similar pattern arises when we examine welfare gains and losses under …nancial open-
ness (represented by the purple line when there is a commodity boom and a yellow line when
there is no commodity boom). One aspect to emphasize here is that, depending on the initial
value of AO
          0 the economy could be worse o¤ under …nancial openness relative to …nancial

autarky. Under our parametrization, this occurs for values of AO
                                                               0 just below 2:3: The ability

to borrow leads to a increase in consumption and in particular of non-traded consumption
that shift labor out of the traded sector delaying the process of convergence. Eventually, for
higher values of AO
                  0 ; when there are no dynamic productivity gains and the economy is in

a growth trap, opening up to international …nancial markets is bene…cial for the standard
consumption smoothing argument.27
       Finally, we examine the extent to which commodity price booms are bene…cial for our
small open economy. As in the case of no commodity price boom, welfare gains and losses are
U-shaped and for relatively low value of AO
                                          0 , the autarky economy dominates in consumption

equivalent terms, the economy under …nancial openness. For both …nancial autarky and
…nancial openness, a temporary commodity price boom has a negative e¤ect on welfare for
relatively low value of AO
                         0 : Indeed, for higher commodity prices, there is a shift of labor

out of the traded sector that delays the convergence process. For higher values of AO
                                                                                    0 ; the

economy does not produce traded goods (i.e. it enters a growth trap) and eventually bene…ts
from higher commodity prices since they generate a positive wealth e¤ects for a commodity
exporter economy.
  27
    Eventually, as the technology in the commodity sector improves, there are welfare gains relative to the
benchmark case. This is because once technology in the commodity sector becomes very productive shifting
resource in that sector is not that costly. Also in the benchmark social planner case we keep the technnology
level in the commodity sector at the value of AO  t = 2.

6                           Conclusion

In this paper we have studied the consequences of commodity price ‡uctuations for a small
open economy that is open to international …nancial markets. We show that under …nancial
account openness, a temporary commodity boom leads to an (initial) accumulation of net
foreign assets that results in a permanent shift of resources out of the traded sector. This
comes about through the standard wealth e¤ect that arises in a bond small open economy.
When we introduce dynamic productivity gains into the traded sector, a commodity boom
crowds out the traded sector and delays convergence to the world technology frontier. Fi-
nancial openness by stimulating current demand, ampli…es this crowding out e¤ect. Finally,


                                                                     44
in the presence of learning by doing externalities concentrated in the traded sector, commod-
ity prices boom can lead to costly permanent de-industrialization ("growth trap”). From a
normative point of view, policies of capital account management which would limit inter-
national borrowing and lending in the adjustment following a commodity shock could be
welfare enhancing for our small commodity exporter economy. Similarly, …scal instruments
such a stabilization fund or a tax where commodity revenues could accrue and be redirected
to traded goods sector would also reduce the drive towards de-industrialisation and improve
welfare.
   There are several ways in which it would be interesting to generalize further our analysis.
On the production side it would be interesting to study the situation in which the supply
chain is modeled in a richer and more realistic way as in Bergholt and Larsen (2015): in their
case traded goods serve as an input in the production processes of non-traded and commodity
goods enriching the analysis with a further demand e¤ect. Another interesting extension
would be to study the role of capital accumulation and its role in the adjustment process.
It would be also of interest to study the case of a small open economy that specialize in the
production of di¤erentiated traded goods: in this case the economy would no longer stop in
producing its own traded good and scope for policy intervention arises from the presence of
a terms of trade externality (see De Paoli (2009)). These insights could be complemented by
the consideration of borrowing in international currency (i.e. there is liability dollarization)
so that changes in the real exchange rate a¤ects debt/credit position of an economy that
could have long-lasting impact on the resource allocation. Finally, a full-‡edged normative
analysis of alternative …scal instruments and the role of a stabilization fund would be also
desirable.

In our baseline calibration28 we have focused on the case in which the only variable input
                                                                                          T                N

could consider two alterntive cases. One (more realistic) in which the share of labor in the
                                                                                                  N                T
traded sector is higher relative to the traded one (                                                   >               ) and the opposite situation
                   T        N                                         N           T

is lower in the traded sector and following a commodity price shock that increases the
possibility of full de-industrialization and the delay in growth convergence relative to the
baseline parametrization. Here we report two …gures focusing on the case in which there is
                                                                                                                                       N                          T

   We note that under Case A, the commodity price shock triggers a permanent full de-
industrialization which reinforces our analysis, while under case B despite the larger dif-
ference in factor intensities we still have the same qualitative pattern as in our baseline
parametrization.

7.2    Higher substitutability between traded and non-traded goods


In our baseline parametrization, we have considered the case in which traded and non-
traded goods are complements ( = 0:75). When the degree of substitutability increases,
there is less need to shift resources towards the non-traded sector as the two goods becomes
substitutes. This reduces the possibility of full de-industrialization and increases the speed
of convergence relative to our baseline case. The following …gure shows the adjustment when
  = 2:3: (this would be the minimum level of substitutability above which there is no de-
industrialization for our baseline parametrization). As we can see consumption and relative

prices adjust immediately to the new long-run equilibrium since in the transition there is no
full-deindustrialization.
