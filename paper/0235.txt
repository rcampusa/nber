                                         Abstract




         Among   the   different kinds of economic behavior which may   account   for

the familiar Fisherian relationship between nominal interest rates and ex—

pected price inflation, portfolio behavior is the most plausibly flexible

in the short run. Since substitution into real assets is not a practical

portfolio alternative for many investors, however, it is not obvious a priori

how important lenders' portfolio behavior can be in bringing about the adjust-

ment of interest rates which Fisher's theory associates with expected infla-

tion. Given the importance of this adjustment for questions of both monetary

theory   and monetary policy, the underlying economic behavior merits explicit
investigation.
      The empirical results presented in this paper provide evidence that

lenders' portfolio behavior does play an important role in the expected-price-

inflation/nomjnal-jnterest..rate relationship. First, results indicate that

five of the six major categories of investors in the U.S. long—term bond

market reduce their demands for bonds in response to an increase in expected

inflation. Secondly, the results of multi—equation partial—equilibri ex-

periments indicate that ,with all other things unchanged, this response by

investors will raise the equilibrium nominal bond yield by about 2/3% in

response to a 1% increase in expected inflation.

         The   belief that expectations of future price inflation tend to result
 in higher nominal     interest rates ——   the proposition which Irving Fisher, in a
 perhaps more optimistic era, labeled "preciation and            interest"1   ——
                                                                                   is   now
 conunonpi.ace among both economists and financial
                                                       market participants. The rise
 of nominal interest     rates in the   United States to record high levels in 1974,
 just when     the U.S. economy was
                                      undergoing its first experience of peacetime
 double-digit inflation, dramatically
                                            demonstrated this relationship at even
 the most unsophisticated
                              eyeball level. Many economists have also undertaken
 statistical investigations of this
                                          relationship, using a variety of devices to
 obviate the analytical difficulties due to the unobservability of
                                                                   the relevant
expectations.2 With its inunediate implications for real
                                                         yields, the Fisher
relationship is central to the classic
                                              questions confronting monetary theory
and policy.

                     aspects of the
        Many important

rate relationship remain undetermined, however. In the
                                                       comparative statics
context of a long-run steady-state
                                    equi1jbrj, do nominal yields adjust                 on a
one-for-one basis with fully anticipated inflation, thereby
                                                            leaving real
yields unaffected? In the dynamic context of a transition from one such

equilibrium   or from gradual changes in saving and investment behavior? At the

most fundamental level, what is the exact nature of the process by which

economic behavior causes nominal interest rates to respond to price expecta-

tions in the specified way? Fisher himself was curiously sketchy in his

"interpretation" of the relationship,3 and most subsequent writers on the sub-

ject have followed his lead in seeking more to document and quantify the

relationship than to investigate in any precise way the underlying economic

behavior which causes it.

       The object of this paper is to explore in some detail one of the possible

sources of the Fisher relationship —-   in   particular, the portfolio behavior of

lenders. The starting point for this analysis is the simple truism that, for

expectations of price inflation to affect interest rates, they must affect the

behavior   of lenders or borrowers (or both). Responses to such expectations on
the   part of lenders and borrowers could logically involve not only their port-

folio behavior (the composition of their assets held and liabilities issued)

but also their saving and investment behavior (the amounts of their assets

held and liabilities issued). This paper's specific focus is on the role of

lenders' portfolio behavior in the relationship between price expectations and

nominal interest rates, and the paper investigates this role using behavioral

equations directly explaining lenders' willingness to enter into long-term

fixed—income loan contracts.4 To anticipate, the conclusion of the paper's

partial—equilibrium analysis is that lenders' portfolio behavior is an important

component of the economic process generating the Fisher relationship. Results

based on U.S. data indicate that, with all other aspects of economic behavior

held unchanged, lenders' portfolio behavior would cause the equilibrium level

of nominal bond yields to rise by 0.65% for each 1% of expected price inflation.

       Section I discusses several different hypotheses about economic behavior

which would logically support Fisher's relationship between price expectations

and nominal      interest rates, and   explains the particularly interesting features
of   those   which turn on portfolio behavior. Section II develops the key

behavioral equations describing lenders' demand for long-term fixed-interest

loans,    and   Section III presents estimation results for these equations based

on U.S. data for six major     categories   of lenders. Section IV presents partial-

equilibrium simulation results showing the implications of lenders' portfolio

behavior, as represented by these estimated equations, for the relationship

between   expected price inflation and     nominal   yields. Section V briefly sum-
marizes   the paper's conclusions.

I. Portfolio Behavior and the Fisher Relationship

       Since there is widespread agreement not only on the importance of expected

real yields in influencing economic activity but also on the ability of monetary

policy to cause price inflation, the equilibrium extent and the dynamic speed of

the adjustment of nominal interest rates to expected inflation are crucial

determinants    of the ability of monetary policy to       influence economic activity

in the long    and short   runs, respectively. The great concern which economists

have   shown with the expected—price-inflation/nominal-interest-rate relationship
is   therefore hardly surprising.

       Fisher assumed that, in long-run steady-state equilibrium, nominal yields

adjust on a one—for—one basis with expected price inflation, thereby leaving

real yields (and hence real economic activity) invariant to fully anticipated

inflation. By contrast, Mundell (50] and Tobin [69] have argued --            in    static

and dynamic models, respectively —-      that,    given the fixed nominal yield

(conventionally zero) on money balances, the inevitable reduction in the real

yield on money which is consequent upon price inflation will cause a correspond-

ing reduction in real yields on other assets. According to the Mundell-Tobin

view, therefore, nominal yields will adjust less than one—for—one with expected

inflation, and real economic activity will itself depend on the rate of

inflation. ?.bre recently, Darby [9] and Feldstein [13] have conversely argued

that the distortion introduced by price inflation under non-indexed taxation

will cause the adjustment of nominal yields to be greater than one-for-one. The

precise equilibrium nature of the Fisher relationship -- and with it the equilib-

rium effectiveness of monetary policy ——         is   therefore an open question.

       Even   if nominal   yields do adjust fully for expected inflation in long-run

steady—state equilibrium, there remains the question of the short-run effective-

ness of monetary policy if the adjusthent is not instantaneous. Fisher relied
                                            —5-.



largely   on lags in (autoregressive) expectation formation to explain the

observed lag of nominal interest rate movements behind actual price movements,

but --   in   sharp contrast to the typical modern       rendering   of his views -- he did

not assume either that real yields are constant (or constant to a white noise),

or that they remain invariant to price inflation in the short run.5 In addition,

at least in his early work Fisher argued that, in the short run, asymmetrical

behavior between lenders and borrowers further rendered real yields systematically

dependent on the rate of price inflation.6 The well documented lags associated

with a number of relevant aspects of economic behavior, including construction

and delivery times for physical investment and the transactions costs of port-

folio adjustment, provide yet additional potential sources of a lagged relation-

ship and further suggest that even fully anticipated price inflation may influence

real yields —- and, consequently, that monetary policy may influence real

economic activity ——     in   the short run.

     Many economists have investigated these important questions by working

directly with the relationship between nominal interest rates and price expec-

tations.7 It is clear, however, that this relationship is at best (if price

expectations are meaningfully exogenous) a reduced-form relationship which

presumably follows from --         but   does not explicitly reveal -- some underlying

behavioral structure.8 In the more general case without the exogeneity

assumption     for price expectations, the Fisher relationship is a connection
between two     endogenous   variables within a structural model.
     In   attempting   to   shed   light on the    questions   posed above about the
equilibrium extent and dynamic speed of Fisher's adjustment of nominal interest
rates to expected price inflation, therefore, it is useful first to identify
the specific kinds of individual optimizing behavior which may plausibly
                                       —6—


produce the observed adjustment. Nominal interest rates are relative prices

set on loan agreements struck between lenders and borrowers. Since these

nominal yields (or, conversely, prices of loan agreements) are proximately

determined in a market in which loans are extended and received, it is a

truism that any factor hypothesized to influence such yields (prices) must do

so by influencing some lender's demand for loans, or some borrower's supply
                     9
of loans, or both.       For expectations of future price inflation to increase

nominal interest rates, therefore, the behavioral process by which they do so

must involve creating a net excess supply of loans by reducing lenders'

willingness to lend and/or increasing borrowers' willingness to borrow at a

given nominal yield.

     In what way may price expectations have this effect? Two broad groups of

hypotheses, both based on the appealing assumption that it is the expected

utility of real wealth which matters for economic behavior, are able to provide

some explanation.

     First, saving and investment behavior may plausibly be responsive to

anticipated real yields. From the standpoint of lenders, the simplest example

is a household which decides to consume more and save less, at a given nominal

interest rate, when expectations •of price inflation shift the perceived inter-

temporal consumption possibility frontier infavor of current consumption.

Hence the demand for total portfolio wealth in general, and for loans in partic-

ular, is smaller. From the standpoint of borrowers, the analogous example is a

firm which decides to do more loan—financed investment, at a given nominal

interest rate, when expectations of price inflation increase the expected

revenue stream from sales of future output. Hence the supply of loans is

greater. In either case the resulting net excess supply of loans means that

the nominal interest rate must rise to clear the loan market.
                                       —7—




       Secondly,   portfolio behavior may also be plausibly related to anticipated

real yields, so that price expectations may affect choices with respect to

the composition of assets held and liabilities outstanding, wholly apart from

the respective totals)0 In a world of risk neutrality and zero transactions

costs, for example, a straightforward extension of the principle of Hicks (36]

and Lutz [44] is that lenders (investors) would presumably fully arbitrage

any difference in expected real holding-period yields among all nominal-interest

loans and all storable commodities. In practice, however, the available

opportunities for such portfolio substitutions involving consumption commodities

are usually extremely limited. Furthermore, while many investors can substitute

equities for fixed—return assets (money or loans) in their portfolios, recent

empirical and theoretical work has shown that equities are hardly an effective

"inflation hedge" in any short or intermediate run and    has   even cast doubt on

the   long-run relationship between equity returns and price inflation.11 Hence
simple propositions, framed as if    investors could actively arbitrage between

nominal interest bearing assets and the consumer—price-index basket of goods,

are inadequate for understanding the workings of the Fisher relation.

      Nevertheless, even absolute barriers to portfolio substitution between

commodities and nominally denominated assets need not preclude investors'

portfolio behavior from having a key influence on the dynamics which connect

expected price inflation and nominal interest rates. As long as investors have

at least the choice between money (or, equivalently, short—term interest bearing

assets) and loans (of long duration), and as long as price inflation will

eventually affect some real variable, then investors' portfolio behavior can

still be the immediate vehicle by which expected price inflation affects

nominal yields. For example, investors expecting higher goods prices in the
                                     —8—


future will probably expect that the associated greater nominal volume of

transactions will increase the demand for money and therefore drive up nominal

interest rates (drive down loan prices) in the future. To avoid the resulting

capital losses on holding loans, such investors will act currently to substitute

money for loans in their portfolios, thereby causing a rise in nominal yields

(a fall in loan prices) to occur even while the anticipated higher goods prices

remain only an expectation rather than a reality.12 Similarly, investors

expecting price inflation may anticipate higher nominal interest rates to

follow, either because of the monetary authority's policy response to the

inflation or because of eventual induced changes in saving and investment

behavior. Once again, portfolio substitutions of money for loans, intended to

avoid capital losses, will cause an immediate rise in nominal yields)3

     Hence el/en under the assumption of severely limited substitution possibili-

ties, which preclude investors' portfolio behavior from being the ultimate source

of the adjustment of nominal interest rates to price expectations, this behavior

may still substantially influence the dynamics of the adjustment process.

Especially since the changes in saving and investment behavior which may

ultimately   underlie the Fisher relationship presumably involve substantial
time lags, the role of portfolio behavior is a crucial determinant of whether
expected   real yields reach their equilibrium (perhaps unaltered) levels

quickly or with a (perhaps exploitable) lag.

     The specific object of attention in this paper is the role of lenders'

portfolio behavior in producing the adjustment of nominal interest rates to

expected price inflation. Sections II and III below develop and estimate

equations representing, with special attention to the influence of price

expectations, the maximizing behavior of lenders in the market which many
                                       —9—


previous researchers have also chosen to reflect most     clearly   the Fisher rela-
tionship —-   in   particular, the market for long—term fixed-interest loans

(bonds). Section IV then uses a partial-equilibrium methodology to examine

the implications of lenders' portfolio behavior, as represented by these

equations, for the relationship between nominal interest rates and      expected
price inflation.

II. A Model of Lenders' Demand for Loans

        It is well known that, for risk averse investors maximizing the expected

utility of either terminal wealth or portfolio rate of return, the optimal port-

folio allocation depends not only on the means but also on the higher moments of

the distributions describing the expected holding-period rates of return on

each individual asset available for portfolio investment. Under the simplifying

assumption of joint normally (or lognormally) distributed rates of return,

therefore, optimal portfolio allocation depends on the means, variances and co-

variances of the individual expected asset yields)4 In the familiar linear homo-

geneous form, the resulting model of desired portfolio allocation is the expression15



                 =           krk +            1ik'kt + E         ikjCkjt +                 i=l,... ,N   (1)

                 =
                     8LLrL +
                               kLkt      +

 where the coefficients of the holding-period yield expectations and variances

 satisfy8>O>yand8<O<y kL.
       What is the role of expected price inflation within a portfolio choice

framework like (1) and (2)? If real assets constitute a plausible asset for

portfolio investment, then the effect of price expectations here is striaght-

forward. The increase in goods prices is then simply the holding-period

return on investment in such real assets, and the associated expectation re is

an argument of (2). The associated coefficient
                                                          is negative so that, for

all other things equal, greater expectations of price inflation reduce lenders'

demand for loans. Following the discussion of Section I, however, purchasing

the consumer—price—index basket of goods is not in fact a practical portfolio

alternative.

       For expected price inflation to influence lenders' portfolio behavior under

limited portfolio Substitution possibilities, therefore, inflation expectations

must differentially affect the expected holding—period returns (or variances or

covariances) on those assets which do constitute
                                                       plausible portfolio choices.
For example, expected inflation may increase the expected return to equities

relative to expected returns on money and loans (of all maturities) which have

fixed nominal yields. Alternatively, again in the term—structure context,

investors may expect  the future price inflation to bring higher future nominal
interest rates, thereby increasing the expected long—holding_period return or
a series of short-term loans relative to that on a long-term loan —- or,
                                      —12—


equivalently, to bring lower future loan prices, thereby reducing the expected

short—holding--period return on a long-term loan relative to that on a single

short—term loan)6 Even for an investor who cannot practically invest in real

assets, therefore, the demand—for—loans expression (2) may depend on expectations

of price inflation via their influence on the expected asset returns r. Moreover,

if the investor associates uncertainty of asset returns with uncertainty of

price inflation, then the variance (and relevant covariances) of price expecta-

tions will also be a determinant of the demand for loans.

        The general portfolio allocation model (1), as well as the specific loan

demand expression (2), describes the determination of variables which are

unobservable in the presence of transactions costs. Consequently, it is

necessary to apply some model of portfolio adjustment to translate the implications

of   such expression into an operational model of behavior. The "optimal marginal
adjustment"   model developed in Friedman (23]   is useful for this purpose, in
that    it generalizes the familiar stock adjustment model so as to relate the

investor's short—run portfolio adjustments not only to the discrepancies

(Are -   At...i),   i=l,...,N, between the desired asset holdings from selection

model    (1) and the corresponding previous-period holdings but also to the current
investable cash flow. The primary rationale for distinguishing the cash flow in
this   context is that current cash flows are typically more easily (costlessly)

allocated than are existing asset holdings. Since transactions costs constitute,

in the first instance, the underlying motivation for using a model which admits

discrepancies between actual and desired portfolio holdings,17 it is worth while

to model the implications of transactions costs with some care. The optimal

marginal adjustment model incorporates in a tractable form the differential

transactions costs between the investor's allocation of a new cash flow and
                                                —13—


re-allocation of existing asset holdings by positing the allocation of the

current cash flow according to whatever proportions portfolio selection model

 (1) indicates are desired for the total                 portfolio.
        Given   an   investor' s beginning-of—period wealth and                current—period cash
flow,    the optimal marginal adjustment model is

follow from (1), and the 0ik are fixed coefficients of adjustment satisfying

  0J.k = 8   for all k, with 0 arbitrary. Heuristically, the first term on the

right—hand side of (3) represents the re-allocation, according to a standard

multivariate stock—adjustment model, of the investor's existing asset holdings
          i =    l,...,N     (which sum to the beginning-of—period wealth
                                                                                       W_1), while
the second      term represents the allocation of the investor' s current—period cash
flow       according to the desired equilibrium proportions                     a1, i l,...N. The
key advantage of the optimal marginal adjustment model in the context of this paper
is that it captures the greater sensitivity to expected holding—period yields
(and inflation) of the allocation of the flow AWt in comparison with the re-
allocation of the stock W1.
       Expanding     portfolio adjustment model (3), using the desired loan demand

Here it is useful to distinguish the particular right-hand-side terms which do

and do not have coefficients of known sign a priori. Each expected holding-

period yield r and variance vkl k =          1,... ,N   (including the own-yield r and

own-variance
               vL) enters (5) twice, in nonlinear form both times. In each case
the product of r or vk and the flow              bears a coefficient which consists of

a single parameter of known sign from (1). Similarly, the lagged own-stock

L1 enters (5) with coefficient 0LI. < 0 from the stock—adjustment component

of (3). All other right—hand-side terms in (5) ——            including   the linear terms

     W1 and                      as well as all nonlinear terms consisting of products

of r or vk with            —-   bear coefficients which are of unknown      sign a   priori)8
     Since the models of desired equilibrium portfolio behavior (1) and short—run

portfolio adjustment (3) underlying loan demand equation (5) deal with the

investor's demands for all assets (and supplies of all liabilities),

(5) is implicitly an element of a set of demand equations which satisfy the

various "adding-up" constraints specified above. By contrast, the more limited

focus of this paper is on the nature of investors' demands for loans -— more

specifically, long-term loans -- and on the partial-equilibrium implications

of these demands for the relationship between expected price inflation and

nominal   interest rates. As Ladenson [37] and Smith (66] have shown, it is not
                                     —15-.



necessary   to use constrained estimation techniques to guarantee that the
parameter estimates of the full set of demand equations satisfy the "adding-up"
constraints,   so that   there is no inconsistency involved in estimating only one
demand equation rather than the entire set. In principle, however, even for

the limited objective at hand, a complete model including all assets (and

liabilities too) would be preferable. In particular, a complete model would

not only facilitate a general—equilibrium analysis but also permit the researcher

to adopt the philosophy as well as the mechanics of Brainard arid Tobin (6] by

examining the implications for other asset demand equations of the presence of

a given variable in any one asset demand equation. The construction of such a

complete model, however, lies well beyond the scope of this paper.

     Section III presents the results of estimating loan demand equation (5)

applied to the demand for long-term fixed-interest loans by six separate

categories of U.S. lenders.

 III. Estimation Results

      Preliminary Issues. it is useful at the outset to comment briefly on

 several aspects of the specification and estimation of the loan demand equa-

 tions presented below.

      Disaggregation: The equations presented below represent the demand for

 long-term loans to private borrowers (that is, long-term corporate bonds) by

 six categories of U.S. lenders which together held approximately 93% of all

 such loans outstanding in the United States as of yearend 1976: life insurance

companies (34.4%), other insurance companies (4.0%), private pension funds (11.0%),

state and local government retirement funds (19.3%), mutual savings banks (5.7%),

and households'9 (18.4%). This disaggregation is useful because such diverse

lenders —-which face different legislative and regulatory constraints, and play

different roles in the markets' highly complex intermediation structure ——   are
unlikely to exhibit identical portfolio responses to expected price inflation.

For example, although life insurance companies must earn real dividends, since

their liabilities are almost exclusively in nominal form it is not obvious that

their asset demands are highly sensitive to expected real yields in the short run.

In addition, life insurance companies in most states can invest only a small

fraction of their portfolios in equities. By contrast, many pension funds face

liabilities which are either explicitly or implicitly indexed to consumer goods

prices, and private pension funds in particular have substantially more latitude

in allocating their portfolios.

     Data: The primary data source for the stock and flow quantities used to

estimate these equations is the Federal Reserve System's flow—of—funds accounts

[1, and subsequent issues].2° These data are seasonally adjusted and are

denominated in millions of dollars. The sample period consists of 56 quarterly

observations beginning in 1960:1 and ending in l973:IV.
                                       —17—



       The particular nominal interest rate rL used in these equations is the

observed new-issue yield on long-term bonds issued by utility companies rated

Aa by Moody's Investors Ser,ice, Inc. Aa-rated utility bonds provide the

greatest continuity, in terms of the frequency of new issues; they are also

most representative of new-issue activity in the U.S. market. Previous studies

of   long—term nominal interest rate     determination using the reduced—form
term—structure     approach have   relied on indices of yields either on new issues

or   seasoned issues,    but the new—issue yield is likely to be superior for

several   reasons. First, trading in      the corporate bond market involves either

new   issues or   recent issues to a far greater extent than     seasoned issues, and
quoted   price movements among seasoned issues are often just a reflection of

what is happening in the new-issue market. Secondly, because of thin trading

markets, problems of measurement are considerably smaller for new issues than

for   seasoned issues. Thirdly, differences in coupon rates between current new

issues and the issues used in constructing seasoned yield indices introduce a

form of bias into the seasoned yield index itself.
       Instrumental   variables estimation: Since the own—yield on      long-term loans

is jointly determined by lenders' demands for loans and borrowers' supplies of

loans, it is necessary to allow for this simultaneity in deriving consistent

estimates of the loan demand equations. The relevant set of instruments used

here for deriving consistent estimators includes not only the exogenous vari-

ables in the six respective disaggregated demand equations but also the

exogenous variables in the two disaggregated loan supply equations developed in

Friedman   (22]. As is     typically the case in multi-equation models, it is impos-

sible to apply the two-stage least-squares method directly because there are

too   many exogenous    variables to permit   ordinary   least—squares estimation of

the system's reduced form as this method requires.           The procedure used here
                                  —18—


follows Brundy and Jorgenson [5] in using as instrumental variables not only

the leading principal components of the full—system set of exogenous variables

but also, on an equation—by—equation basis, the single-equation sets of

exogenous variables themselves.

     Intercepts: Equation (5) has no intercept term, but it is probably accurate

to consider the portfolio behavior model developed in Section II as a linear

approximation to a more complex behavioral pattern, and an intercept may follow

from linearization. The procedure used here includes or excludes an intercept

in each loan demand equation according to the t-statistic.

     Expectations proxies: Since lenders' expectations are unobservable, both

for price inflation and for nominal holding-period returns on assets subject to

capital gains or losses, it is necessary to use some indirect representation in

their place. Nevertheless, no sharp consensus exists on the best form of

expectations proxy to use for such purposes. The approach adopted here, there-

fore, is to estimate each of the six loan demand equations twice —- once using

an autoregressive and once using a rational representation of lenders'

expectations.

     Results Based on Autoregressive Expectations. A familiar representation

of expectations, used by many of the researchers who have explored the rela-

tionship between expected price inflation and nominal interest rates, is that

market participants form their expectations of relevant variables on the basis

of previously observed values of these variables. Following Nerlove [53], a

general autoregressive expectation mechanism of the form

                   =                                                       (6)

                       i=O

where E(.) is the expectation held at time t, the w. are lag weights and the

tilde indicates that variable x1 is unknown as of time t, is consistent

with the optimal linear prediction of a time series from its own past history.

Several familiar simple expectations mechanisms, such as the "naive" model that

next period will be like last period, or Cagan's (6] adaptive expectation, are

special cases of autoregressive expectations. More generally, Modigliani and

Shiller (48] have usefully illustrated, also in the context of interest rate and

price expectations, that autoregressive expectations are consistent with a

combination of extrapolative and regressive components. To emphasize the

contrast to the more restrictive adaptive schemes, some writers have referred

to such general autoregressive expectations mechanisms as "partly rational" or

"weak—form rational."21

        Table 1 shows the results of estimating loan demand equation (5), for

each of the six categories of lenders indicated above, using autoregressive

representations   of the relevant expectations. The variable symbols are con-
sistent for all six equations, with letter superscripts indicating distinctions
among corresponding variables for the respective categories of lenders.

Asterisk superscripts indicate terms for which an equation is estimated using

fitted values of the variable from the first stage of the instrumental vari-

ables   procedure.22 The numbers in parentheses are ratios of estimated
coefficients to the corresponding standard errors.23
     Following the autoregressive model, these equations use distributed lags
on past percentage changes of the consumer price index, past percentage changes
in the one-period loan yield, and past percentage changes in equity prices to
represent the influence of these past observations on lenders' expected
holding-period   yields. Similarly, these equations use computed   moving-average
variances   to represent the second moments of the distributions describing

 lenders'   expectations. The distributed lags on consumer prices and one—period
 loan   yields   are estimated, within the estimation of the loan demand equations,

 with lag weights constrained to follow a third-degree polynomial pattern, the

 right-hand tail of the lag constrained to
                                                pass through zero, and the lead lag
weight free of the polynomial constraint.24 The coefficients shown in Table 1

 for the several distributed lag variables are in each case the sums of the

estimated lag weights. The equity price distributed lags and the moving-average

variances, by contrast, rely on uniform fixed weights.

        The results shown in Table 1 are broadly consistent with the model of

portfolio behavior developed in Section II. The estimated equations explain

a large percentage of the variation of the changes of holdings (net purchases)

of long—term loans by all lender categories other than private pension funds.

The demand for loans in each case responds
                                                positively to the currently prevail-
ing nominal yield on long-term fixed-interest loans; negatively to currently

prevailing nominal yields on competing assets; negatively to the expected yield

on a series of one—period loans, as represented by the distributed lag on past

one-period loan yields; and negatively to expected price inflation, as repre-

sented by the distributed lag on past price movements.       Some lenders' loan

demands also respond negatively to the expected capital gain on equities, as

represented by the distributed lag on past equity price movements. The dif-

ferent moving—average variances appear in these equations in an irregular way;

but   the own—variance (calculated from realized net returns to holding corporate
bonds) and the price variance enter negatively in each case, while the variances
of competing asset yields enter positively in each case.25
      Table 2 summarizes, for all six categories of lenders, three key coeffi-

cients of the loan demand equation which
                                              are particularly relevant for assessing

 the   role of lenders' portfolio behavior in the relationship between expected

 price inflation and nominal interest rates.

       First, the estimated own—yield coefficients
                                                       B, from the specific loan
 equation (2) of the desired portfolio selection
                                                      xxdel (1), indicate the
 responsiveness of the desired fraction of loans
                                                      in the portfolio. With the
exception of mutual savinqs banks (for which
                                                       is implausibly large), these
estimates are all of credible magnitude in
                                                 addition to being significantly
greater than zero at high confidence levels. In each case the value of

indicates the fractional increase in the share of the portfolio which the

lender will want to allocate to long-term fixed-interest
                                                               loans if, with all
other things equal, the nominal own—yield on loans rises by one percentage

point (that is, by 100 basis points).

       Secondly, the estimated price expectations coefficients 8,, again from

 (2), indicate the responsiveness to expected inflation of the desired fraction

of loans in the portfolio. These estimates are significantly
                                                                    different   from

zero, with the expected negative sign, for five of the six categories of

lenders.26 Hence the greater the expected inflation as inferred from recent

observed inflation --     all   other things, including the nominal loan interest
rate, equal ——   the   smaller are these lenders' demands for fixed—interest loans.

       Following the discussion in Section II, this
                                                       response may represent an
explicit utility maximization of real rather than nominal wealth (or rate of

return), or it   may indicate    that investors draw inferences about future interest
rate  movements (about future capital gains) from observations of price infla-
tion. The magnitudes of the      estimates provide support for the hypothesis
that lenders seek to maximize the utility of some real quantity      since, for
four of the six lender groups, it is impossible to
                                                   reject at the     10%   confidence

level the hypothesis          =           Nevertheless, since the estimated lag weight

sums reported here are not identifiable as             estimates without an arbitrary

(though plausible) assumption that the true lag weights in the autoregressive

expectation sum to unity,27 it is not in general appropriate to assign these

estimates a specific economic interpretation strictly comparable to the

corresponding .          These estimates reflect the effect of observed price infla-

tion on the demand for loans, including not only the effect of expected inflation

on portfolio behavior but also the effect of observed inflation on expected
•        .      28
inflation.

     Thirdly, the 0LL estimates reflect the stock-adjustment component of the

optimal marginal adjustment model (3). These estimates are significantly

different from zero, with the expected positive sign, for all six categories

of lenders. Their magnitudes roughly correspond to intuitive judgments of

various lenders' respective likely speeds of portfolio adjustment based on

institutional considerations; private pension funds, for example, which are

typically managed very actively, undertake the most rapid re-allocation of

their existing assets.29 Although these estimated adjustment speeds are fairly

rapid in comparison to those typically found by previous researchers, they

still indicate the existence of lags in portfolio behavior which will, in the

short run, prevent nominal yields from immediately achieving their full

adjustment to any stimulus affecting lenders' behavior --         including   expected

price inflation.

     In addition, for purposes of comparison with the alternative set of loan

demand       equations estimated using the rational representation of the relevant
unobservable expectations,        Table 2 shows the root—mean—square forecast error
                                     30

       Results Based on Rational Expectations. Recent researchers have broadly

 applied Muth's [52] concept of rational expectations, especially in the con-

 text of models dealing with the effectiveness of monetary policy.31 Expecta-

 tions are rational, according to Muth's definition, if

                  =
                      E(;i)   +
                                                                                (7)



where Et(.) is again the expectation conditional on all information available

as of time t, and u is a zero—mean finite—variance random disturbance which is

serially uncorrelated as well as uncorrelated with Et(.). In other words,

expectations are rational in Muth's sense if the lender's expectation equals

the mathematical expectation of the corresponding variable, conditional on all
information available as of time t.32 As Frenkel [21] and Mussa [51] among
others    have shown in the specific context of price inflation, if the nature

of the process generating realizations of the x series is such that all

relevant information is contained in past values of x itself, then the auto-

regressive expectation is also the rational expectation.        Nevertheless, even
in simple models the necessary conditions for rational and autoregressive

expectations to be identical are typically severe, so that it is useful to

treat these two representations of expectations as distinct alternatives for

estimation purposes.

      As McCallum [46] and others have emphasized, in the absence of perfect

foresight Muth's definition of rationality renders the realization
                                                                       x+1 in
(7) distributed around, rather than equal to, the
                                                      expectation Et (x+1),
thereby   leading to a classical errors—in—variables problem for estimation if
actual values are simply used in place of the relevant expectations. The
procedure used here to estimate loan demand equation (5) under rational
expectations therefore replaces the   actual   values corresponding to the three
                                         —24—


 relevant expectations -—   of   price inflation, capital gains on bonds, and
 capital gains on equities —-     with   their respective Brundy-Jorgenson instrumented

 values. While any valid instrument will give a consistent estimate of the

 coefficient of such an expectation, this instrument will give a more efficient

 estimate than the commonly suggested simpler one based only on past realizations

 of the series themselves if lenders, in forming their expectations, take account

 of the additional information on which the instrument is based.33 In the

 absence of any clear interpretation of the rationality definition •for higher

moments of distributions, the variance representations included in these equations

are the same moving—average variances used in the equations presented above

based on autoregressive expectations.

     Table 3 shows the estimates and standard error ratios for two coefficients

of the loan demand equations based on rational expectations. The estimated

coefficients     again indicate the responsiveness, to the (rational) expecta-

tion of price inflation, of the desired fraction of loans in the portfolio.

The estimated coefficients 8LC analogously indicate the responsiveness of

desired portfolio allocation to the (rational) expectation of capital gains

on bonds. In sharp contrast to the corresponding estimates shown in Tables 1

and 2 for the loan demand equations based on
                                                    autoregressive expectations,
these coefficient estimates are significantly different from zero, with the

expected signs (negative for 8, positive for 8) for only two and zero

categories of lenders, respectively.

     Table 3 also shows the root-mean—square forecast errors for each of

the six loan demand equations estimated using the rational expectations pro-

cedure. In each of the six cases, this error is greater than the error shown

in Table 2 for the corresponding loan demand equation based on autoregressive

expectations. These root-mean-square errors are essential to a valid comparison

of the two sets of results, since high multicollinearity between the price

inflation and capital gain series (as would be expected under perfect arbitrage)

could in principle explain the weakness of the        and 8LC estimates. By

contrast, the respective root—mean—square errors are not sensitive to multi—

collinearity, and their comparison --   which uniformly favors the equations
based on the autoregressive expectations proxies —-   is   analogous to an F-test

rather than the t-tests reported for the individual parameter estimates.

     Section Iv presents a partial-equilibrium analysis of the role of lenders'

portfolio behavior in the relationship between expected price inflation and

nominal interest rates, based on the autoregressive expectations version of

the loan demand equations shown in full in Table 1.

 IV.    Expected Price Inflation and Nominal Interest Rates
        The equations developed and   estimated    in Section III represent lenders'

 demand for loans. These six equations, together with some representation of

 borrowers' supply of loans, therefore constitute a complete model of the loan

market. Adding the market-clearing equilibrium condition

where L is the supply of loans, thereb4y enables the model to determine the
nominal loan yield which is an argument of each of the six estimated loan
demand equations.34      Furthermore, since five of these six equations explicitly
include    expected price inflation as another independent variable, the nominal
loan    yield determined in   this model is    an implicit   function of   expected
inflation.


        Figure 1 illustrates in (rL L)   space how a partial-equilibrium analysis
based   on the six estimated loan demand equations and equilibrium condition (8),
with loan supply taken as given, isolates the contribution of lenders' portfolio
behavior   to the
                                                                           relationship.
The object of this analysis is to show how the nominal loan yield would respond

to expected inflation if all aspects of economic behavior other than lenders'

portfolio behavior remained unchanged. In particular, the assumption of given

investable   cash flows (which are important arguments of the loan          demand equations)
holds   unchanged   all decisions about how much to save, and the assumption of a

given loan supply analogously holds unchanged not only all decisions about how

much to invest but also borrowers' decisions with respect to the composition of

their liabilities.

 demand for loans conditional on some fixed expectation of price inflation

       intersects the fixed loan supply L at interest rate rL. Curve L(Pe + 1%),

which represents the demand for loans conditional on an inflation expectation

 1% greater, is shifted to the left from L(e), indicating lenders' reduced

willingness to hold bonds at any     given      nominal interest rate. Curve L(Pe + 1%)
therefore    intersects L at interest rate rL >          and the difference (r rL) --
that   is, the "upward shift" measured by the vertical distance between L(Pe + 1%)

and L(Pe) for a given L —-     indicates    the increase in rL which makes lenders

content to hold exactly L loans after an increase of 1% in their expectation

of price inflation.

       Figure2 and Table 4 summarize the results of a dynamic version of such
a partial-equilibrium analysis based on the six estimated loan demand functions
from Section III, the market equilibrium condition (8), and given loan supply.
The heavy solid line in Figure 2 plots the observed historical values of the

nominal loan yield which, as Table 4 shows, averaged 6.07% over the 1960-73

sample period. The light solid line in the figure plots the simulated values

of the nominal loan yield from the nxdel of lenders' portfolio behavior. This

"control" simulation, based on historical values of all exogenous variables

(including distributed lags on observed price inflation in place of the unobservable

inflation expectation), is fully dynamic in that, after the first quarter of
thesimulation, the solution uses internally generated values for the lagged
own-stock variables     in each of the six loan demand equations.
       This control simulation indicates that the partial—equilibrium loan market
model reproduces the relevant historical experience with reasonable accuracy.
There is no significant bias for any       of   the model's seven jointly determined
variables,   and, as Table 4   shows, the   mean   simulated value of the nominal loan

yield is precisely 6.07%. For the six loan demand variables, the root—mean-

square dynamic simulation errors are about in line with those shown in Table 2,

indicating that the errors made by individual equations have no observable

tendency to compound one another.35 For the nominal loan yield, the root-mean-

square dynamic simulation error is 0.21% (that is, 21 basis points) --   about
comparable to the "fit" achieved by previous researchers who have directly

estimated reduced-form equations for long-term nominal interest rates.36

This within—sample performance seems quite creditable, especially since the

methodology of the structural model does not estimate an equation directly for

this yield but, instead, implies an equation for the yield which is restricted

by the underlying structural hypotheses about lenders' portfolio behavior.37

     What equilibrium adjustment in the nominal interest rate, equivalent to

the difference between r and rL In Figure 1, will lenders' portfolio behavior

induce in response to greater expectations of price inflation? The broken line

in Figure 2 plots the simulated values of the nominal loan yield from an

alternative simulation which differs from the control only in that the expected

rate of price inflation is 1% greater throughout the simulation period. Specifi-

cally, this simulation experiment is based on values of the rate of change of

consumer prices which, from as long before 1960 as is consistent with the

distributed-lag price expectations terms in the estimated loan demand equations,

are 1% greater than the corresponding historical values. In all other respects

this simulation is identical to the control.

     Since the demand for loans by five categories of lenders responds negatively

to the greater expectations of price inflation,38 the nominal loan yield must

rise as in Figure 1 if total loan demand is still to equal total loan supply.

As the broken line in Figure 2 shows, the market—clearing level of the nominal
                                         —29—


yield in this experiment is strictly greater than           the   control simulation

level throughout the simulation period. The mean simulated value of the

nominal yield in this experiment (r) as Table 4 shows, is 6.72% —- an

increase of 0.65% above the control simulation mean (rL).

        Finally, what is the dynamic     speed    by which lenders' portfolio behavior will

bring about this 0.65% equilibrium adjustment? The dotted line in Figure 2 plots
the simulated values of the nominal loan yield from a further experiment in
which   the 1% increase in the assumed rate of price inflation, .in comparison

with the control, is effective only in l966:Iv and thereafter. Hence this

experimnt's results for 1960—66 are identical to those of the control simula-

tion. As of 1967:1, however, the simulated nominal loan yield begins to rise

above   the    control path. By 1971:1 —-     that   is, after four years --   the
adjustment      to the new equilibrium   path,    which is identical to that of the

first simulation experiment, is essentially complete.

       These simple partial-equilibrium experiments cannot, of course, represent

the complete nature of the

relationship. In the first instance, the intent motivating their construction

is not to model all of the underlying economic behavior but rather to isolate

the role of lenders' portfolio behavior. Borrowers' portfolio behavior, for

example, presumably corresponds to a downward sloping loan supply curve instead

of the vertical L      in Figure 1, and the      equilibrium adjustment of the interest

rate   will,   be greater (less) than 0.65% if the "upward shift" of the supply

curve is greater (less) than     the   0.65% found here for the aggregated demand

curve.40 This analysis also abstracts from the influences of saving and

investment     behavior as discussed in Section I. In addition, as the discussion

of Section II notes, even the lenders' portfolio behavior modeled here applies
                                    —30—



only to one market —— that for long—term fixed-interest loans -- rather than
to the complete set of all asset and liability markets. Nevertheless, these
partial—equilibrium   experiments are instructive in showing that lenders'

portfolio behavior is an important part of the Fisher relationship, that this

behavior alone is likely to yield a large (but less than   one-for—one)   equilibrium

adjustment of nominal interest rates to expected price inflation, and that the

dynamic path toward the equilibrium adjustment involves a substantial time lag.

V. Suimnary of Conclusions
     Both the equilibrium extent and the dynamic path of the adjustment of
nominal interest rates to expected price inflation are important questions
for monetary theory and policy. The role of portfolio behavior is especially
interesting in this context because, of the different kinds of economic
behavior which may underlie the Fisher relationship, it is the most plausibly
flexible in the short run. Even so, since substitution into real assets is
not a practical portfolio alternative for many investors, it is not obvious
a priori how important lenders' portfolio behavior is in this relationship.
     The empirical results presented in this paper indicate that lenders'
portfolio behavior does play an important role in the expected-price-inflation/
nominal—interest—rate relationship.
     First, at the single—equation level, the results provide evidence that,
with all other things equal, five of the six major categories of lenders in
the U.S. long—term fixed—interest loan market reduce their demands for loans
in response to an increase in expected inflation. Even life insurance com-
panies, whose liabilities are almost entirely in nominal form, respond to
price expectations in this way.
     Secondly, at the multi—equation partial—equilibrium level, the results
indicate that, with all other things equal, this response by lenders will
raise the equilibrium nominal loan yield by 0.65% in response to a 1% increase
in expected inflation. The results also indicate that this 0.65% adjustment
requires approximately four years for completion.

3. See Fisher [19, pp. 438-442]. Somewhat astonishingly to the modern reader,
    Fisher's suggested "interpretation" followed Wicksefl [71] in noting that
    higher prices usually meant a greater nominal volume of trade, which in
    turn increased the demand for money, and hence increased nominal interest
    rates for given bank reserves. What is surprising about this
      is                                                          "interpretation"
       that, as rendered by Fisher, it has nothing whatever to do with expecta-
    tions. In addition, the association of higher prices with a greater nominal
    transactions volume is necessarily valid only if the source of the infla-
    tion is a demand shock to the economy; under a supply shock prices rise
   but real transactions volume falls, so that the change in nominal trans-
   actions volume remains ambiguous in general.

5. On invariance of the real rate with respect to inflation [19, p. 493]:
    "...in actual practice.. .the appreciation or depreciation of the monetary
    standard does produce a real effect on the rate of interest... This effect,
    in times of great changes in the purchasing
                                                  power of money, is by far the
      greatest of all effects on the rate of interest." On constancy of the real
      rate for given inflation [19, p. 411]: "...there are...so many other
      causes affecting the rate of interest besides changes in the price level."
      These views clearly contradict such  interpretations as the "Fisherian"
      proposition tested in Faina [12].

6.    See Fisher (17, pp. 75-78] and the useful discussion in Rutledge (56].

7. See again the references cited in footnote 2. Froyen and Davidson (30]
    argued (along the lines taken below) in favor of a structural modelling
    approach, but their empirical work also relied on a reduced-form model.

8. See Sargent [63] for a forceful statement of this point.
9. The concept of the nominal yield's being "proximately determined" in the
   loan market is not inconsistent with the principle of general equilibrium
     in the asset markets (see, for example, Tobin [70])or for the economy as
     a whole (see, for example, Grossman [34]). In well developed financial
      markets, of course, the relevant group of "lenders" include not only those
      who make primary loans directly to borrowers but also those who may under
      certain circumstances be willing to acquire debt securities in a secondary
      market.

10. In simple consumption—loan models there is typically no meaningful dis-
     tinction between saving behavior and portfolio behavior in the conventional
     sense as meant here; see, for example, Samuelson (58]. It is also worth
     noting that, even in models in which the two kinds of behavior have distinct
     meanings, they are not in general independent; see, for example, Fama (11],
     Merton [47], and Samuelson (59]. Hence the portfolio behavior analyzed
     in Section II below implicitly relies on a single-period horizon.

11. See, for example, Bodie (2], Cagan [7], and Lintner [40].

12. This argument is parallel to that of Fisher and Wicksell, but it differs
     in that it involves expectations in a fundamental way; see again footnote 3.

13. While capital loss avoiding behavior as in these two examples clearly
     indicates a connection between expected price inflation and long-term
     interest rates, this argument does not carry over to short—term interest
     rates. Hence it may be more accurate to refer to such effects as "term-
     structure effects" rather than "Fisher effects," but it is difficult to
     support any such sharp distinction on the basis of Fisher's own work; see
     again footnote 12.

14. See Lintner (39,    41], for example, for the precise derivation of asset
     demand functions   from maximization of a negative exponential (or logarithmic)
      utility function under the normality (or lognormality) assumption. Alterna-
      tively, as Tobin (68] and Markowitz (45] have shown, the first and second
      moments of the yield distributions are sufficient to determine asset demands,
      regardless of the distribution assumed, if utility is quadratic.

15. See Friedman [25] for a review of the alternative sets of assumptions which
     permit the derivation of asset demand functions that satisfy the homogeneity
     property and that are linear in expected asset yields; de Leeuw [10] and
     M. Friedman (29] also provided discussions of the rationale behind the
     homogeneity constraint. Asset demand functions of this form are familiar
     in both empirical (e.g.,de Leeuw) and abstract (e.g., Brainard and Tobin [41)
     work on portfolio behavior in monetary economics. A particular advantage
     of the homogenous form, in the context of this paper's concern with price
     inflation, is that rising dollar magnitudes per se do not affect the
     portfolio allocation.

16.   See Stiglitz (67] for a demonstration that these two propositions are
      equivalent. Modigliani and Shiller (48] provided a useful discussion of the
      role of price expectations in differentially influencing the expected
      holding yields on short- versus long-term bonds.

17. See Foley [20] for a useful analysis of this issue.
18. See Friedman [23]. It is worth noting explicitly that the nonlinear way
     in which the flow     matters for short-run portfolio behavior in the optimal
     marginal adjustment model is in sharp contrast to the work of Bosworth and
     Duesenberry [3] and Henderghott and Lemon [35] who, without explicitly
     developing an underlying model of portfolio adjustment, emphasized linear
     dependence on the cash flow.

19. The household sector as defined here primarily consists of individuals but
     also includes non-profit organizations and bank—managed personal trusts.

20. See Friedman [23] for further details on precise definitions of variables,
     in particular the cash flows of life insurance companies and households
     and dummy variables in the two insurance company equations.

21. See, for example, Sargent [64], Rutledge [56] and McCallum[46].

22. Because of the nonlinear way in which both expected yields and variances
     enter the model, as indicated in (5), all such terms are products. The
     correct instrument to use in each such case, for purposes of deriving
     consistent estimators, is the first—stage fitted value of the entire
     product; this procedure is used here.

23. Because     of the instrumental variables estimation procedure, the standard
      error ratios shown are asymptotically distributed as t-statistics but are
      not necessarily distributed as t—statistics in small samples.

24.   The estimation of these distributed lags presents an interesting identifi-
      cation problem due to the potential appearance of each distributed lag in
      two separate nonlinear terms on the right-hand side of each single loan
      demand equation. See Friedman and Roley [27] for the derivation of the
      method used to solve the resulting estimation problem.
25. See Friedman [23] and Friedman and Roley [28] for further details of the
     exact procedures used in deriving the equations' final specifications.
      It is interesting that the standard error ratios of the variance terms
      are uniformly smaller (in absolute value) in these equations than in the
      corresponding ordinary—least—squares estimates.
26. This coefficient was insignificant in the loan demand equation for non-
     life insurance companies, and so the CE t.Pt j).w term is omitted from
     the final specification. That equation includes the price expectations
     distributed lag in the term CE t              but, as the discussion of
                                      .Pt
     (5) in Section II indicates, the coefficient of this term is a sum of
     products of parameters in the underlying model consisting of (1) and (3).
      The   standard   error ratio for the coefficient of the CE C.P .)tW term
                                                               it—i     t
      in the equation for mutual savings banks is small, but the F-test indicates
      that this lag structure is significant at the 5% confidence level.
27. The unit sum constraint implies that lenders believe that the stochastic
     process generating the price inflation is borderline stationary/nonsta—
     tionary -- that is, any rate of inflation which has persisted for a long
     time will continue to persist. U.S. survey evidence suggests that inflation
     expectations in the 1970s do differ from those of the 1950s and 1960s in
     such a way as to render this borderline stationary/nonstationary specifica-
     tion plausible. Alternatively, for the process to be stationary, the lag
     weights in the estimated equations would have to sum to less than unity,
     and the expectation would also have to include a constant term. Several
     other writers have also emphasized this point; see, for example, Lucas
      [42] and Sargent [61].

28. Another reason for caution in interpreting the     estimates is the
    potential difficulty of distinguishing first— from second—moment effects.
    Gordon and Halpern [33], for example, have argued that the mean of the
    inflation rate is a good proxy for the associated uncertainty; such an
    effect here would bias upward the absolute values of the     estimates.
    In addition, the estimated equations for the two categories of taxable
    investors do not allow for specific tax effects, which have shifted during
    the sample period; see, for example, Feldstein and Summers [16].

29. This interpretation of the 0.. estimates is merely heuristic, however,
    since in a multivariate stock-adjustment model the "speed of adjustment"
    depends on the eigenvalues of the entire matrix of 0. . coefficients, not
    just the on-diagonal 0.. values.
                          12.


30. For equations estimated by an instrumental variables procedure, the root-
     mean-square forecast error (computed from the actual values of all right-
     hand-side variables) is a better measure of statistical performance than
     is the estimated standard error (computed from instrumented values of the
     right-hand—side variables).

31. See, for example, Lucas [43] and Sargent and Wallace [65].

32. It is worth pointing out that the information available as of time t must
     include, to within a set of additive white noise disturbances, knowledge
     of the model which will generate the actual outcome x+i; hence this
    definition of rationality is stronger than the usual notion of using
    efficiently all available information. For further discussion of the
    informational implications of assuming rationality in this sense, see
    Friedman [24].

33. Fully efficient estimates, of course, would require instruments based
     on the model which lenders actually used to form their expectations.

34. Since the six categories of lenders whose portfolio behavior is explicitly
     represented in the estimated loan demand equations do not hold all of the
     outstanding loans, L is more precisely the supply of loans minus those
     loans held by other lenders.
35. The RMSE values for the six lender categories, in their order of
     appearance in Table 2, are 120, 36, 176, 87, 114 and 247, respectively.

36. Modigliani and Shiner's [48] preferred equation had SE= 0.13% for the
     less volatile Aaa yield over the sample period 1955:1114971:II. Re-
     estimating the Modigliani-shjller equation using the Aa yield and the
     1960:I—1973:IV sample period leads to an equatior with SE = 0.22% but
    with the coefficients of the distributed lag on the short-term yield
     not significantly different from zero. Feldstein and Eckstein's [15]
    preferred equation had SE = 0.09% for the Aaa yield over the sample
    period 1954:1—1969:11. Re—estimating the Feldstein—Eckstejn equation
    using the Aa yield and the l960:I-l973:Iv sample period leads to an equa-
    tion with SE = 0.29%. Feldstein and Chamberlain's [14] preferred equation
    had SE =0.21% for the Aaa yield over the sample period 1954:1-1971:1.

37. This point is especially relevant to the presence of other long—term
     yields in the estimated loan demand equations for several categories of
     lenders. Including other long-term yields as independent variables in
     an unrestricted equation with the bond yield as dependent variable would
     presumably increase greatly such an equation's fit. In the context of
     the structural model, however, the contribution of other long—term yields
     is restricted to their role in influencing the net purchases variables.
     See Friedman [23] for a discussion of the structural modeling methodology
     as specifically applied to the determination of long—term interest rates.

38. Since the Pt).w1 terms which           appear in the loan demand equations

      for three categories of lenders reflect these lenders' behavior in other
      markets, the solution used the historical P values for these variables
      and introduced the 1% increase only in the (E             terms. See
      again footnote 24.                             1

39.   An alternative to taking means over simulated values is simply to solve
      the model using the sample-period means of the exogenous variables. This
      reverse strategy yields an estimate of 0.70% instead of 0.65%. The
      difference is due to the model's nonlinearity.

40. The analogous experiments in Friedman (26] indicate that the loan supply
     curve actually "shifts upward" by slightly less than 0.65% for an additional
     1% of expected price inflation, so that the net upward adjustment of the
     interest rate is slightly less than that indicated by the analysis of
     lenders' behavior alone, and the resulting quantity L is slightly below -L.
