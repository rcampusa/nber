                                         ABSTRACT

On the basis of a country*industry unbalanced panel data sample for 14 OECD countries and
18 industries covering the years 1988 to 2007, this study proposes an econometric
investigation of the effects of the OECD Employment Protection Legislation (EPL) indicator on
capital intensity for four capital components, and on the share of employment for two skill
components. Our results relying on a difference-in-difference approach are the following:
i) positive and significant effects for non-ICT physical capital intensity and the share
of high-skilled employment; ii) non-significant effects for ICT capital intensity; and (iii)
negative and significant effects for R&D capital intensity and the share of low-skilled
employment. These results suggest that firms consider that the strengthening of Employment
Protection Legislation is equivalent to a rise in the cost of labor, resulting in capital-to-labor
substitution in favor of non-ICT capital and working at the disadvantage of low-skill relatively
to high-skill workers. They indicate to the contrary that structural reforms for more labor
flexibility weakening this legislation could have a favorable impact on firms’ R&D investment
and their hiring of low-skill workers.

1. Introduction

Numerous papers have been devoted to exploring the impact of labour market regulations on innovation
and productivity (see among others: Acharya, Baghai and Subramanian, 2013; Bassanini, Nunziata and
Venn, 2009; Cette, Lopez and Mairesse, 2016; Conti and Sulis, 2016; Griffith and Macartney, 2014; Micco
and Pages, 2006). They usually find a detrimental impact of regulations on patents, TFP level or TFP
growth. Fewer papers have been devoted to exploring the impact of labour regulations on the
combination of production factors, although the latter are essential for anticipating the many effects of
labour market reforms. Some of these papers investigate the impact of labour regulations on total
capital intensity, i.e. the total capital-to-labour ratio, yielding opposite results (see Autor et al. 2007,
Calgagnini et al. 2014, Cingano et al. 2010 and 2014, Janiak and Wasmer 2014).1 Other papers
investigate the impact on capital quality in terms of ICT intensity, showing a negative impact of EPL on
ICT intensity (see, for instance, Aghion et al. 2009, Cette and Lopez 2012, Guerrieri et al. 2011).2 Most of
these papers show complementarities between capital accumulation and skills, but none investigates all
the different effects of labour regulations on the combination of production factors.

The originality of our paper is to study the effects of labour market regulations on capital intensity,
capital quality and the share of employment by skill level using a symmetric approach for each factor
using a single original large database: a country-industry panel dataset of 14 OECD countries, 18
manufacturing and market service industries, over the 20 years from 1988 to 2007. Another original
contribution is the use of a difference-in-difference approach: we investigate whether the impact of EPL
is growing with the intensity of use of labour input (Cette, Lopez and Mairesse, 2016, uses a similar
approach to estimate the impact of labour and product market regulations on productivity). Our main
estimation results show an EPL effect: i) positive for non-ICT physical capital intensity and the share of
high-skilled employment; ii) non-significant for ICT capital intensity; and (iii) negative for R&D capital
intensity and the share of low-skilled employment. These results suggest that an increase in EPL would
be considered by firms to be a rise in the cost of labour, with a physical capital to labour substitution
impact in favour of more non-sophisticated technologies and would be particularly detrimental to
unskilled workers. Moreover, it confirms that R&D activities require labour flexibility. According to
simulations based on these results, structural reforms that lowered EPL to the “lightest practice”, i.e. to
the US EPL level, would have a favourable impact on R&D capital intensity and would be helpful for
unskilled employment (30% and 10% increases on average, respectively).

1
    Autor et al. (2007) show that the adoption of wrongful-discharge protection by state courts in the US from 1970
    to 1999 increased the capital-to-labour ratio and Cingano et al. (2014) show that the implementation in Italy in
    1990 of a reform that introduced unjust-dismissal costs for firms below 15 employees had increased in these
    firms the capital-to-labour ratio. But using a panel of European firms, Cingano et al. (2010) and Calcagnini et al.
    (2014) had found a negative impact of EPL on the capital-to-labour ratio and on investment dynamics
    respectively. These results may be reconciled by idea of Janiak and Wasmer (2014) of an inverted U-shape
    relationship between the employment protection legislation and the capital-to-labour ratio: at a low (high) EPL
    level, a positive (negative) correlation appears between EPL and capital intensity.

    To our knowledge, there are no studies focusing on the impact of labour market regulations on R&D spending,
    but some previous papers have dealt with the similar topic of the impact of labour market regulations on
    patenting behavior. Griffith and Macartney (2014) give a survey of this literature and show an ambiguous
    relationship between EPL and innovation.

The paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 presents a brief literature review, Section 3 and 4 give the
model and data. Section 5 shows the main econometric results and Section 6 proposes, from these
results, a simulation of the impact on capital intensity of structural reforms consisting in adopting the
best labour regulation practices. Section 6 concludes.



2.    Literature review

There are no papers on the impact of labour market regulations on all production factors, but there are a
few papers that investigate the impact of labour regulations on some production factors. This section
presents briefly this literature.

The empirical literature on the impact of labour market regulations on total capital intensity provides
different results. Author et al. (2007) use a large US establishment-level dataset (of more than 120,000
observations) and show that the adoption of unfair-dismissal protection by state courts in the US from
1970 to 1999 reduced employment flows and firm entry rates, reduced TFP and increased the capital-to-
labour ratio and labour productivity. Their interpretation of these results is that an increase in
employment protection corresponds to an increase in labour adjustment costs. Higher labour
adjustment costs result in a decrease in TFP as well as an increase in the capital-to-labour. This capital
deepening effect dominates the TFP effect and so labour productivity increases. Cingano et al. (2014) use
a large Italian firm-level dataset (of more than 25,000 observations) and show that the implementation,
in 1990, of a reform that introduced unfair-dismissal costs for firms below 15 employees had increased
in these firms the capital-to-labour ratio, particularly in labour-intensive firms. But in a previous study
carried out using a large panel of European firms, Cingano et al. (2010) had found a negative impact of
EPL on the capital-to-labour ratio, and Calcagnini et al. (2014) also found a negative empirical relation
between EPL and investment dynamics using a small European firm-level dataset (2,600 firms in 10
European countries). For Cingano et al. (2014), these differences in the results of their two studies “may
be reconciled by adopting the view, proposed by Janiak and Wasmer (2014)”. Indeed, Janiak and Wasmer
(2014) observe at the country level an inverted U-shape relationship between employment protection
legislation, measured by the usual OECD indicator of EPL , and the capital-to labour ratio. Their
interpretation, using a theoretical model, is that two opposite effects are at play: a higher EPL decreases
profits and consequently investment, explaining the negative correlation between EPL and capital
intensity, but it also has a positive effect on human capital accumulation which is complementary to
physical capital, explaining the positive correlation. The last effect dominates at low level of EPL and the
first effect at high level of EPL. This interpretation based on complementarity is supported by Cingano et
al. (2014): according to their estimation results, the adoption of unfair-dismissal protection had
increased the share of high-tenured workers with high specific human capital who are likely to be
complementary with capital investments. These various results underline the importance of investigating
simultaneously physical capital intensity and workers’ skill composition. But in modern economies,
capital quality is also essential.

Cette and Lopez (2012) propose a survey of the literature on the influence of labour market regulations
on capital quality in terms of ICT investment or the share ICT in the capital stock. Their estimates using a

                                                     3
country panel dataset show that labour regulations, measured by the usual EPL indicator, have a
negative impact on ICT investment and on the share of ICT in capital, like previous studies (among
others, see Aghion et al., 2009, or Guerrieri et al., 2011). They also show the favourable impact on ICT
diffusion of post-secondary education among the working age population and the detrimental impact of
product market rigidities. These results suggest that an efficient use of ICT requires a higher degree of
skilled labour than in other technologies and firm reorganisations which can be constrained by strict
labour market regulations.

To our knowledge, there are no studies focusing on the impact of labour market regulations on R&D
spending. But some previous papers deal with the similar topic of the impact of labour market
regulations on innovation measured by the patenting behaviour. Griffith and Macartney (2014) give a
survey of this literature and show, from an original large dataset of big European firms, that EPL has two
types of effect on innovation: a higher EPL increases job security and hence worker investment in
innovative activity but, at the same time, it reduces investment in activities that are likely to require
adjustment, including technologically advanced innovation.



3.    The model

The estimated specification of the impact of Employment Protection Legislation (EPL) on production
factor combination is derived from firm maximisation, assuming perfect markets for products but not for
labour, of the following profit function (individual and time indices are omitted in order to lighten the
equations):

                                 𝜋 = 𝑃. 𝑄 − � 𝐶𝑓 𝑋𝑓 −       �        𝜇𝑓 �𝑋𝑓 �
                                               𝑓         𝑓∈{𝐻,𝑀,𝐿}

With 𝜋 the firm profit, P the value added price, Q the value added quantity, 𝐶𝑓 and 𝑋𝑓 the unit user cost
and quantity of production factor f. We distinguish seven different production factors f: ICT capital, R&D
capital, non-ICT capital equipment (i.e. non-ICT and non-R&D equipment), non-residential capital
construction, High (H), Medium (M) and Low (L) -skilled employment. 𝜇𝑓 is the adjustment cost of labour
factor f, 𝑓 ∈ {𝐻, 𝑀, 𝐿}, growing with the level of employment.

We assume a Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) production function:
                                                                     𝑠
                                                         𝑠−1 𝑠−1
                                                    1/𝑠
                                      𝑄=    𝐴. �� �𝜃𝑓 . 𝑋𝑓 𝑠 ��
                                                𝑓


Where A is the disembodied technical change, s the elasticity of substitution and 𝜃𝑓 the factor share
coefficient of production factor f (or factor f efficiency).

Therefore, the first order conditions of profit maximisation lead to:


                                                     4
                                                             −(𝑠−1)                   −𝑠
                         𝐶𝑓∗ . 𝑋𝑓              𝑠−1
                                                       𝐶𝑓∗               𝑋𝑓 𝜃𝑓 𝐶𝑓∗
                                    = 𝜃𝑓 . 𝐴         .� �              ⇒   =   .� �        ∀𝑓
                          𝑃. 𝑄                         𝑃                 𝐸   𝜃𝐸 𝑊 ∗

                                                                      𝜕𝜇𝑓                   𝜕𝜇𝑓
With 𝐶𝑓∗ = 𝐶𝑓 for the capital factors and 𝐶𝑓∗ = 𝐶𝑓 + 𝜕𝑋 for the labour factors,             𝜕𝑋𝑓
                                                                                                  the marginal labour
                                                                        𝑓

adjustment cost, 𝐸 = 𝐻 + 𝑀 + 𝐿 total employment, 𝜃𝐸 the factor share coefficient of total employment
and 𝑊 ∗ the average labour cost per worker, taking into account of the marginal adjustment cost of
labour. 3

Beyond its impact on observed labour costs (𝐶𝑓 , 𝑓 ∈ {𝐻, 𝑀, 𝐿}, and W), EPL may influence the production
factor combination through its impact on marginal labour adjustment costs (𝜕𝜇𝑓 ⁄𝜕𝑋𝑓 ) and labour
organisation, thus affecting factor efficiency (𝜃𝑓 ). Concerning physical capital, we expect two different
effects of EPL. Due to its influence on labour adjustment costs, an increase in EPL may have the same
impact on physical capital intensity as an increase in the observed labour cost, thus EPL would have a
positive impact on physical capital intensity (𝑋𝑓 ⁄𝐸 ). However, if the lack of labour flexibility reduces the
relative factor efficiency of a capital factor (𝜃𝑓 ⁄𝜃𝐸 ), EPL would have a negative impact on capital
intensity. This negative impact may be particularly large for ICT as it requires stronger labour
reorganisation and flexibility. Therefore, we expect that the positive impact of EPL to dominate for non-
ICT physical capital, whereas the impact on ICT is more ambiguous. Concerning the impact of EPL on
R&D, it is important to note that: (i) R&D is more risky than the other investments, in terms of results,
and requires higher labour flexibility; and (ii) R&D expenses are mainly labour costs, so the R&D user cost
may increase in line with the labour cost. This last remark suggests that the positive impact of EPL on
R&D intensity would be small. Thus, we expect that the impact of EPL on R&D intensity would be
negative. Finally, the impact of EPL on the share of employment by skill level depends notably on the
differences of EPL effects on labour adjustment costs. When a job is impacted by a negative productivity
shock, the opportunity cost to remain in this job is lower for low-skilled workers as they suffer from the
highest unemployment level. Hence, with strict EPL it would be particularly difficult for firms to adjust
their low-skilled employment level in response to productivity shocks (i.e. the marginal labour
adjustment cost would be high). As the ease to find another job increases with the skill level, the impact
of EPL on the adjustment cost should decrease with the skill level, so we expect EPL to have a negative
impact on the share of low-skilled employment and a positive impact on that of high-skilled
employment.

In order to estimate these effects of EPL on capital intensities and employment shares, we assume linear
relationships of EPL with the marginal labour adjustment cost (𝜕𝜇𝑓 ⁄𝜕𝑋𝑓 ) and factor efficiency (𝜃𝑓 ). Our
main estimated specification (table 1) assumes also that: (i) the elasticity of substitution may differ
between factors, which is consistent with various degrees of complementarity/substitutability between
factors, notably a possible complementarity between high-skilled workers and capital; 4 and (ii) the


3
    Total employment E is introduced in order to take into account of industry sizes. It also makes it possible to
    focus on the capital available per worker and share of employment by skill level.
4
    The estimation results are robust to various constrained values of the elasticity of substitution, notably when
    𝑠 = 1, as it would be with a Cobb-Douglas production function specification.

                                                                  5
impact of EPL depends on the intensity of use of labour, measured by the industry i labour share over
production in the USA in 2000. Rearranging the terms of the equations, the estimated specifications are
(with small letters for logarithms):

                   �𝑥𝑓 − 𝑙�       = 𝛼𝑓 − 𝑠𝑓 . �𝑐𝑓 − 𝑤�      + 𝛽𝑓 . 𝜆𝑖 . 𝐸𝑃𝐿𝑐𝑡 + 𝜂𝑓,𝑐𝑖 + 𝜂𝑓,𝑐𝑡 + 𝜖𝑓,𝑐𝑖𝑡
                            𝑐𝑖𝑡                       𝑐𝑖𝑡

                                                                                                                  (1)

Where c, i, t are the country, industry and time indices, 𝜆𝑖 industry specific characteristics, EPL the OECD
indicator of Employment Protection Legislation, 𝜂𝑓,𝑐𝑖 and 𝜂𝑓,𝑐𝑖 the fixed effects, and 𝜖𝑓,𝑐𝑖𝑡 the residual
terms. The variable 𝜆𝑖 . 𝐸𝑃𝐿𝑐𝑡 is called further EPL impact.

Relation (1) presents a difference-in-difference approach to estimate the effects of EPL. The introduction
of several fixed effects, notably the country*year fixed effects, prevents various sources of endogeneity
such as reverse causality and omission bias which could stem from governments modifying their EPL
depending on the economic situation. This specification allows us to investigate whether the impact of
EPL increases with the intensity of use of labour (the results are robust to another industry characteristic,
see Appendix B). The above-mentioned EPL effect expectations result in the following values of the
coefficient 𝛽𝑓 : positive for the non-ICT capital intensities and the share of high-skilled employment,
negative for the R&D intensity and the share of low-skilled employment and ambiguous for the ICT
intensity. Of course, these expectations lead to an ambiguous impact of EPL on the total capital intensity.



4.      Data

Our study sample is an unbalanced country-industry panel dataset of 3,625 observations from 1988 to
2007. It covers 14 countries (Australia, Austria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany,
Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States) and 18
manufacturing, network and service industries. 5 Six industries (almost) do not invest in R&D and are
excluded from the R&D intensity estimation sample (estimation results are robust when the estimation
sample include these industries, see Appendix B). Appendix A presents the descriptive analysis of data.

Relation (1) estimations require data on capital stocks and their user cost, employment by skill level and
a measure of EPL. We compute capital using the permanent inventory method 𝑋𝑓,𝑡 = �1 − 𝛿𝑓 �. 𝑋𝑓,𝑡−1 +
𝐼𝑓,𝑡−1 , where 𝐼𝑓 corresponds to the investment in factor f, using the EU-KLEMS physical investment data,
OECD ANBERD R&D expenses and the following depreciation rates 𝛿𝑓 : Non-residential structures, 5%;
non-ICT equipment, 10%; ICT equipment, 20%; R&D, 25%. We compute the user-cost of capital according


5
     These industries are (ISIC Rev. 3 codes in brackets): food products (15-16), textiles (17-19), wood products*
     (20), paper (21-22), chemicals products (23-25), non-metallic mineral products (26), metal products (27-28),
     machinery not elsewhere classified (29), electrical equipment (30-33), transport equipment (34-35),
     manufacturing not elsewhere classified (36-37), energy* (40-41), construction* (45), retail distribution*(50-52),
     hotels & restaurants* (55), transport & communication (60-64), banking services* (65-67) and professional
     services (72-74). The six industries with a `*’ almost do not invest in R&D.

to the Jorgenson (1963) formula: 𝐶𝑓,𝑡 = 𝑃𝑓,𝑡−1 . �𝛿𝑓 . +Δ𝑙𝑛�𝑃𝑓,𝑡 � + 𝑟𝑡 �, where 𝑃𝑓 is the investment price of
factor f and r the long-term interest rate.6 We measure total employment as the number of persons
employed, using the OECD STAN database, and EU-KLEMS data on hours worked for the share of
employment by skill level. Finally, our analysis uses the OECD EPL indicator. Based on detailed
information on laws, rules and market settings, this indicator measures the procedures and cost involved
in dismissing individual workers with regular contracts and regulations on temporary contracts, including
regulations on fixed-term and temporary work agency contracts (see OECD Employment Outlook 2013
for more information).



5.      Main estimation results

Table 1 gives the main relation (1) estimate results. 7

The estimated coefficients of relative cost are always negative, as expected, and significant. Concerning
capital components, they are quite similar and within the interval -0.61 (for non-ICT equipment, column
[2]) to -0.37 (for construction, column [3]), whereas they are lower (in absolute value) for the two skill
components of employment: -0.23 (high-skilled, column [6]) and -0.21 (low-skilled, column [7]). In other
words, the price sensitivity is higher for capital intensity than for the share of employment by skill level,
maybe because of the significant inertia of human capital accumulation.

The estimated coefficients of the impact of EPL differ among factors and have the expected signs.
Concerning non-ICT physical capital components (non-ICT equipment, column [2], and constructions,
column [3]) they are positive and significant (but only at a 0.1 threshold for constructions). This means
that, for these two components, more labour regulations increase the capital-to-labour ratio. This result
suggests that the impact of labour regulations on the non-ICT physical capital-to-labour ratio is
qualitatively similar to that of a change in the labour cost. Concerning the two high-quality capital
components, the estimated coefficients of the impact of EPL is negative, non-significant for ICT (column
[4]), and significant for R&D (column [5]), so labour regulations have a detrimental impact on high-
quality capital components. Investment in high-quality capital is more risky in terms of results, than
investment in lower quality capital, and firms would take this risk less often as labour regulations
increase. These results are consistent with those of Conti and Sulis (2016) which suggest a detrimental
impact of EPL on high technology adoption.

The estimated coefficient of the impact of EPL on the total capital stock is positive but small and non-
significant (column [1]). This estimated coefficient is consistent with those obtained on the different
capital components, which means that this elasticity could be positive or negative, depending on the

6
     Physical investment prices are from EU-KLEMS, but in order to improve comparability we have assumed, as
     suggested by Shreyer (2000) and have done so after in numerous studies, that for the ICT investments in
     hardware, software and telecommunications equipment the ratio of investment prices to the GDP prices is the
     same for all countries as for the USA, since the USA is the country that uses most systematically hedonic
     methods during the study period. Because of the lack of specific price information for R&D, we have used as a
     proxy the manufacturing production deflator.
7
     Table 1 does not show the estimation results for share of medium-skilled employment. We do not find any
     statistically significant impact of EPL on the share of medium-skilled employment, but this result is not
     meaningful as medium-skilled employment accounts for the majority of total employment.

share of high-quality capital components (ICT and R&D) in the total capital. These results are original and
more detailed than the previous empirical ones from Autor et al. (2007) or Cingano et al. (2010) and
(2014) which find positive or negative impacts of EPL on the capitalto-labour ratio. This difference in
results between this and previous studies may be explained by the capital share of high-quality capital
components in their estimation samples.

The estimated coefficients of the impact of EPL also differ for the two shares of employment skill levels:
positive for the share of high-skilled employment (column [6]) and negative for that of low-skilled
employment (column [7]). This suggests that labour regulations are particularly detrimental to low-
skilled employment, which is an interesting paradox as one of the main goals of labour regulations is
usually to protect low-skilled workers. These regulations seem to frighten employers, who consider that
they lead to an increase in labour costs with a negative impact on low-skilled employment. From our
knowledge of the literature, this result is also original. The positive impact on the share of high-skilled
employment supports the idea of Janiak and Wasmer (2014) that higher labour regulations increase the
capital-to-labour ratio and, due to the complementarity between capital and high-skilled workers, the
share of these high-skilled workers in total employment. But our results give more detail on this channel:
this added capital is not the most sophisticated one as, from higher labour regulations, the ICT capital-to-
labour ratio does not significantly change and the R&D capital-to-labour ratio even decreases
substantially.

                                              TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE

Different robustness checks have been carried out and are presented in Appendix B. We first analyse the
sensitivity of the estimation results to the two assumptions already mentioned for Table 1: (i) the
elasticity of substitution may differ between factors, which is consistent with various degrees of
complementarity/substitutability between factors; and (ii) the impact of EPL depends of the intensity of
the use of labour. The estimation results are robust to different alternatives to these two assumptions.
Indeed, when we constrain the elasticity of substitution to a same value, notably the Cobb-Douglas
unitary elasticity, as presented in Table B1, or when we use other industry characteristics, for instance
the industry layoff propensity suggested by Bassanini and Duval (2006), as presented in Table B2, the
coefficients of the impact of EPL are similar to Table 1 estimates. The estimate results are also robust to
various other sensitivity analyses: (i) the change of the employment measurement in the capital intensity
ratio, using medium-skilled employment instead of total employment (see Table B3); (ii) various estimate
samples (see Table B4 and B5); and (iii) the removal, in the dataset, of any country, any industry and any
year. 8


6.      Simulation

To illustrate the meaning of our results, we compute from them and for all countries in our dataset the
impact of the adoption of the US 2013 EPL level, the US being the country with the lightest level of
regulation according to the OECD EPL indictor and 2013 being the last year the EPL indicator was
available. The adoption of this US EPL level would require very largescale labour market structural
reforms in some countries, such as France and Italy. So this simulation cannot be considered politically
and socially realistic in a short time. But considering the favourable impact of labour market reforms on

     The corresponding estimate result Tables can be obtained on request to the authors.

productivity and growth (see numerous papers including Cette, Lopez and Mairesse, 2016) these reforms
could be considered a long-term political goal.

The impact of structural reforms is calculated at the industry level using the main estimate results (given
in Table 1) for our 18 sample industries, then these effects are aggregated at the national level using the
2000 US industry share in the whole economy for each factor. The country level impact depends, for
each variable, on the EPL gap with the US. It corresponds to a long-term impact, after dynamic
adjustments not evaluated here. The results of this simulation are the following:

- The impact is always the largest in France, followed by Italy, Spain and the Czech Republic; these four
  countries suffer from the highest EPL level. At the other end of the scale, it is always the smallest in
  the UK which appears to be the least regulated country after the US.
- The capital-labour ratio would decrease from 1.4% to 8.1% for non-ICT equipment and from 0.5% to
  3.0% for construction (Chart 1-A). Conversely, it would increase from 0.7% to 4.1% for ICTs (Chart 1-A)
  and from 9.5% to 54.1% for R&D (Chart 1-B). This large impact for R&D must be related to the fact
  that R&D only accounts on average for 9.7% of the capital stock in industries where R&D investment
  is not negligible, and 7.1% in all industries.
- The proportion of the share of low-skilled employment increases from 3.1% to 17.8% and the
  proportion of the share of high-skilled employment decreases from 3.8% to 21.9% (Chart 1-C).



7.    Concluding remarks

The main results of our difference-in-difference approach using a large and original unbalanced country-
industry panel dataset are that: i) non-ICT physical capital intensity increases overall with EPL; ii) ICT
capital intensity is not significantly impacted by EPL; iii) R&D capital intensity decreases with EPL; and iv)
the share of high- (low-) skilled workers in total employment increases (decreases) with EPL. These
results support the fact that an increase in EPL would be considered by firms to be a rise in labour costs,
with a capital-to-labour substitution impact in favour of more non-sophisticated technologies and would
be particularly detrimental to unskilled workers.

It appears that labour regulations are particularly detrimental to low-skilled employment, which is an
interesting paradox as one of the main goals of labour regulations is to protect low-skilled workers.
These regulations seem to frighten employers, who see them as a labour cost increase with
consequently a negative impact on low-skilled employment. From our knowledge of the literature, this
result is original. It supports the idea by Janiak and Wasmer (2014) that higher labour regulations
increase the capital-to-labour ratio and, due to the complementarity between capital and high-skilled
workers, the share of the latter in total employment. But our results provide more details about this
channel: this added capital is not the most sophisticated one: from higher labour regulations, the ICT
capital to labour ratio does not significantly change and the R&D capital to labour ratio even decreases
hugely.




                                                      9
From these results, the proposed simulations suggest that structural reforms that reduce EPL could have
a favourable impact on R&D investment and would be helpful for unskilled employment. The simulated
impact of a decrease in EPL to the US level appears large for several countries. But, this decrease in EPL
would require a very ambitious reform programme in these countries, and the simulated impact is a
long-term one. This confirms that the potential gains from the implementation of ambitious labour
market programmes could be sizeable.

Appendix A: Descriptive analysis

Table A1 and A2 present means, standard-errors and the main quantiles of the distribution of our
principal variables in level and in growth respectively, while Chart A1 to A4 present country sample
averages of our main variables, showing large country differences. 9

As regards hours worked, the share of medium-skilled employment is on average the largest, i.e. more
than 60%, whereas the average share of high-skilled employment is only 11% (Table A1). But these
shares differ significantly across countries: the higher proportions are observed (on average over the
2000-2006 period) in the US (21%) and in Germany (25%) (Chart A3). It is also interesting to note the
large decreases in the OECD EPL indicator from 1994 to 2006 in some previously highly-regulated
countries, such as Denmark, Finland and Netherlands (Chart A4). In 2006, the level of labour market
regulations (EPL) is the lowest in the US and the highest in France and Italy.

Table A3 presents the variance analysis of equation (1) variables. It shows that for most of our variables a
large part of their variances is accounted for by the fixed effects. Apart from the EPL, the three single
fixed effects (country, industry and years) together explain at least 64% of the variability of each variable,
and even more than 90% for the capital intensity indicators (column [1]). And the three potential crossed
fixed effects (country*industry, country*year, industry*year) explain at least 76% of the residual
variability, and even often more than 90%. Therefore, our main specification does not introduce the
industry*year fixed effects, but includes the country*industry, country*year fixed effects in order to
prevent various sources of endogeneity.

This Table summarises the results of an analysis of variance for all the variables in our analysis in terms of separate
country, industry and year effects as well as a sequence of two-way interacted effects. Column [1] documents the
variability of the variables lost in terms of “first step” R² when we include in the regressions of our model the three
one-way fixed effects separately, as a basic control for the usual sources of specification errors. The three following
columns [2], [3] and [4] document what is the additional variability lost (within the first step residual variability) in
terms of “second step” R² when we also include interacted two-way effects, in order to control for other potential
sources of specification errors.

Appendix B: Sensitivity analysis

This appendix presents the different robustness checks that have been carried out.

First of all, all the estimated coefficients of relative cost differ significantly from the Cobb-Douglas unitary
elasticity, which suggests that our unconstrained specification is preferable. We cannot exclude the fact
that estimates of relative cost elasticities lower than one (in absolute value) could partly reflect the
impact of relative cost measurement errors. Therefore, we also estimate relation (1) with an elasticity of
substitution equal to -1 and the estimated coefficients of impact of EPL are robust to this constraint, as
shown in Table B1. The only change is that the impact of EPL coefficient for low-skilled employment
becomes non-significant (column 7) but as the coefficient remains positive and significant for high-skilled
employment (column 6), a rise in the impact of EPL still increases the share of high-skilled labour relative
to low-skilled employment.

Another question relates to the measure of the industry-specific characteristic (𝜆𝑖 ), which is equal to the
industry i labour share in the USA in 2000 for Table 1 estimates. Alternatively, we can also test whether
EPL is more binding in industries which require more labour flexibility. As suggested by Bassanini and
Duval (2006), we use the layoff propensity as an indicator of the labour flexibility need. This indicator
appears to be quite volatile over time, and for this reason we measure the industry-specific characteristic
(𝜆𝑖 ), by a simple fixed effect: 𝜆𝑖 = 1 in the half industries with the highest layoff propensity in the US in
2000, and 𝜆𝑖 = 0 in other industries. 10 The estimate results appear robust to this choice, as shown in
Table B2. The only changes are that the EPL impact coefficient becomes non-significant for construction
(column 3) and low-skilled (column 7) but we retain the contrast between a positive and significant EPL
impact coefficient for non-ICT equipment (column 2), a non-significant coefficient for ICT (column 4) and
a negative and significant coefficient for R&D (column 5). We also find that a rise in the impact of EPL
increases the share of high-skill labour (column 6).

Estimate results are also robust to several other sensitivity analyses, notably the change of the
measurement in the capital intensity ratio, using medium-skilled employment instead of total
employment (see Table B3). Estimate results presented in Table 1 use specific estimate samples for R&D
intensity, column (5), and for the share of employment by skill level, column (6) and (7). For R&D
intensity, industries that almost do not invest in R&D are excluded, but Table B4 shows that the negative
impact of the relative cost and EPL are robust to the inclusion of all the industries in the estimate
sample. For skills, the estimate samples are smaller than for the other assets because of data availability.
When this smaller estimate sample is used for the other assets, the estimate results are quite similar, as
shown in Table B5. The only exception is that the impact of EPL on construction capital would be smaller
and no longer statistically significant. Finally, estimate results are also robust to the removal, in the
dataset, of any country, any industry and any year. 11




10
     The high layoff propensity industries (with 𝜆𝑖 = 1) are: textiles (17-19), wood products (20), non-metallic
     mineral products (26), metal products (27-28), machinery not elsewhere classified (29), electrical equipment
     (30-33), manufacturing not elsewhere classified (36-37), construction (45), transport & communication (60-64).
