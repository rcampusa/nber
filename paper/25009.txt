The Life Expectancy of Older Couples And Surviving Spouses

                                              ABSTRACT

Comparisons of individual life expectancies over time and across demographic groups provide information
for individuals making retirement decisions and for policy makers. For couples, analogous measures
are the expected years both spouses will be alive (joint life expectancy) and the expected years the
surviving spouse will be a widow or widower (survivor life expectancy). Using individual life expectancies
to calculate summary measures for couples is intuitively appealing but yields misleading results because
the mortality distribution of husbands and wives overlap substantially. To illustrate, consider a wife
aged 60 whose husband is 62. In 2010, her life expectancy was 24.4 years and his 20.2 years. The
intuitions that the spouses will die at about the same time (e.g., within 5 years of each other) and that
she will not live for a long time after his death are incorrect. The probability that the wife will outlive
her husband is 0.63 and, if she does, her survivor life expectancy is 12.5 years. Using 2010 data, we
investigate differences in joint and survivor life expectancy by race and ethnicity and by education.
We then calculate trends and patterns in joint and survivor life expectancy in each census year from
1930 to 2010.

1. Introduction

    Using male and female life expectancy data from the National Center for Health Statistics

(NCHS), we calculate the joint life expectancy of older couples entering their retirement and the life

expectancy of surviving spouses. Using 2010 data, we calculate these measures separately for non-

Hispanic whites, blacks, and Hispanics and, within racial groups, by educational attainment.1 We also

calculate joint and survivor life expectancy for each census year beginning in 1930, and analyze trends

in joint and survivor life expectancy from 1930 to 2010. With the exception of Goldman and Lord

(1983), demographers, economists, gerontologists, and sociologists have generally ignored the joint

life expectancies of married couples and the life expectancies of surviving spouses.

    We illustrate our measures of joint and survivor life expectancy by considering a non-Hispanic

white couple in which the wife was 60 and the husband 62 in 2010 -- that is, the wife was born in

1950 and her husband in 1948. We focus on 60 year old wives and their husbands because these are

ages at which many couples make crucial retirement-related decisions such as leaving career

employment and claiming social security benefits. Thus, these are ages at which we would expect

joint and survivor life expectancies to be especially salient. Census data show that in 2010 the average

age gap between 60 year old non-Hispanic white women and their husbands was about 2 years. The

2010 NCHS life tables show that the life expectancy of a 60 year old non-Hispanic white woman was

24.4 years and that of a 62 year old non-Hispanic white man was 20.2 years. The intuitions that the

spouses will die at about the same time (e.g., within 4 or 5 years of each other) and that the wife will

not live for a long time after her husband’s death are incorrect. These intuitions would be correct if




1
 We ignore unmarried individuals but it is important to bear in mind that marriage rates differ
substantially by race and ethnicity. In 2010, 65.2 percent of 60 year old non-Hispanic white
women were currently married. For black women the corresponding figure was 36.8 percent and for
Hispanic women 55.0 percent.
                                                                                                      1
60 year old women lived for exactly 24.4 years and 62 year old men lived exactly 20.2 years. More

generally, if the mortality distributions of the men and the women were so tightly concentrated that

they did not overlap, it would be correct to use the minimum of husband and wife life expectancy as

the couple’s joint life expectancy and to use the difference between the individual life expectancies

as the survivor life expectancy. And, if the overlap were small, these measures would be good

approximations. But the overlap is substantial and calculations that rely solely on the individual life

expectances provide poor approximations of joint life expectancy and very poor approximations of

survivor life expectancy.

        The calculation of joint and survivor life expectancies requires the mortality distributions of

both spouses. We use the NCHS life tables for men and women to construct mortality distributions

and life tables for couples to calculate measures of joint life expectancy – i.e., the life expectancy of

the couple, or expected number of years that both spouses will live.2 We then calculate the probability

of becoming a widow or widower at each age and use the individual life tables to calculate survivor

life expectancy conditional on the identity of the surviving spouse (e.g., if the wife is the surviving

spouse, we calculate her expected number of years as a widow).3

        The construction of mortality distributions for couples is straightforward but tedious. To

illustrate, we continue to focus on the case in which the wife was 60 and the husband 62 in 2010.

From the individual life tables for men and for women, we calculate the probability that one or both




2
  We assume that the mortality of the couple arises only from the death of one or both spouses
and ignore the possibility that the marriage ends in divorce. Thus, we are calculating the
expected number of years that both spouses are alive, regardless of whether or not they remain
married. Brown and Lin (2012) estimate that in 2010, 0.45 percent of married individuals 65
years and older divorced in the previous year.
3
  Although we use the terms "widow" and "widower," these terms are not quite accurate. We are
calculating how long an individual can expect to live after the death of his or her current spouse,
regardless of remarriage.
                                                                                                       2
spouses will die in 2010. This probability is the sum of the probabilities of three mutually exclusive

events:

(a) the husband will die between 62 and 63 AND the wife will not die between 60 and 61

(b) the wife will die between 60 and 61 AND the husband will not die between 62 and 63, and

(c) the husband will die between 62 and 63 AND the wife will die between 60 and 61.

          The sum of these three probabilities is, of course, equal to one minus the probability that

neither spouse will die in 2010. Thus, if our only aim were to calculate joint life expectancy, it would

be easier to focus on the probability that neither spouse would die at each age or in each year. The

drawback of proceeding in this way is that to calculate survivor life expectancies we need to calculate

the probability that the wife (husband) will become a widow (widower) at each age.

          For couples that survive into 2011, we proceed in the same way, calculating the probability

that the husband will die between 63 and 64 and the wife will not die between 61 and 62, etc. These

calculations give “mortality rates” for the couple for each year, and from these we can construct a

“couple life table.” More specifically, beginning with a cohort of 100,000 couples with the wife aged

60 and the husband aged 62, we can calculate expected transitions to widows, widowers, and “couple

death” in each year. This corresponds to the L(X) column in the standard individual life table, with X

denoting year rather than age.4

          From the couple life table, we calculate the couple’s joint life expectancy using the standard

life expectancy calculation typically applied to individuals. The vertical lines in Figure 1a show the

joint and individual life expectancies for a non-Hispanic white couple in which the wife was 60 and

the husband 62 in 2010. For our focal couple, joint life expectancy is 17.7 years (recall that her

 Appendix 1 provides details of the standard life table and the calculation of joint life
expectancy.
                                                                                                      3
individual life expectancy is 24.4 and his individual life expectancy is 20.2 years). Figure 1b shows

the focal couple transitions.

        The survivor life expectancy answers questions such as: “If the wife is the surviving spouse,

how many years can she expect to live after her husband’s death?" The survivor life expectancies are

appropriately weighted averages of individual life expectancies at each age, where the weights are the

probabilities of couple death in each year, conditional on couple survival to that year and conditional

on the identity of the surviving spouse.

        The probability that our focal 60 year old wife will predecease her 62 year old husband is

0.37, a surprisingly high probability that reflects the substantial overlap of their mortality

distributions. Hence, the probability that the wife will be the surviving spouse is .63 and, if she is the

surviving spouse, her survivor life expectancy is 12.5 years. The probability that the husband will be

the surviving spouse is 0.37 and, if he is the surviving spouse, his survivor life expectancy is 9.5 years.

        Although Goldman and Lord (1983) proposed couple life expectancy measures more than

three decades ago, these measures have not been widely discussed or adopted.5 In models of intra-

household decision making (e.g., regarding the timing of retirement and the claiming of social security

benefits), the difference between wives' and husbands' life expectancies is sometimes treated as an

informal measure of survivor life expectancy.6 Browning (1995, 2000) and Lundberg (1999) allude

to the difference between husbands’ and wives’ life expectancies to motivate their discussions of



5
  Goldman and Lord (1983) estimated joint and survivor life expectancies at the time of marriage,
using median age at marriage (first and higher order) for white and non-white men and women in
1970, and for brides and grooms at ages 20-50 for 1977-78. The actuarial literature addresses these
issues; see, for example, Bowers et al. (1997). Brown and Poterba (2000) investigate an alternative
notion of "joint life expectancy" -- the number of years that at least one spouse is expected to be
alive. Similarly, the IRS provides race-ethnicity-gender-neutral tables to enable taxpayers to
calculate the tax liabilities associated with joint life annuities and distributions from IRAs
(https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590b).
6
  Uhlenberg (1980) is an early example of the use of such informal measures.
                                                                                                         4
saving and other retirement-related decisions. As shown in our focal example, couple life expectancy

measures cannot be deduced from individual life expectancy measures.

       To the extent that demographers, economists, gerontologists, and sociologists have considered

couples and surviving spouses, they have focused on age-specific joint and survivor mortality rates

rather than on summary measures such as life expectancies (Hurd (1999), Mitchell et al. (1999), van

der Klaauw and Wolpin (2008), Nishiyama (2015)). Although age-specific mortality rates are the

basic building blocks, they are much more complex and thus less accessible than summary measures

such as the probability that the wife will predecease the husband, and joint and survivor life

expectancy. We focus on couples approaching retirement age because we think this is most relevant

to policy makers and to couples.

       Evidence suggests that the life expectancy of married individuals is greater than that of

unmarried individuals both because healthier individuals select into marriage and because marriage

has protective effects; see Goldman (1993), Hu and Goldman (1990), Frees, Carriere and Valdez

(1996), Drefahl (2010), Sanders and Melenberg (2016). Our calculations, which are based on NCHS

life tables, ignore these effects and assume that individuals' age-specific mortality probabilities are

independent of their marital status.7 Our calculations also assume that spouses' mortality probabilities

are independent of each other, although we expect that assortative mating, shared environments, and

behavioral habits would create correlations in mortality probabilities. We make these assumptions




7
  It is reasonable to compare the survival probabilities of married and unmarried individuals on a
year-to-year basis – the probability that a married 60 year old woman survives to 61 may differ
from the probability that an unmarried 60 year old woman survives to 61. However, calculating
the life expectancy of a married 60 year old woman based on survival probabilities that are
specific to marital status adds a bias, because doing so assumes that she remains married until
her death (i.e., if her husband predeceases her or they divorce, she immediately remarries).
                                                                                                      5
because publicly available life tables do not provide the information that would allow us to condition

on marital status or take account of the correlations between spouses' mortality probabilities.8

       In the following sections, we compute the joint life expectancies of couples nearing normal

retirement age and the life expectancies of surviving spouses. In section 2 we use 2010 Census and

NCHS data to calculate joint and survivor life expectancy separately for non-Hispanic white couples,

black couples, and Hispanic couples.9 Bound et al. (2015) estimate individual mortality rates by

education for non-Hispanic whites and for blacks, and we use their estimates to calculate joint and

survivor life expectancies for non-Hispanic white couples and for black couples.

       In section 3 we describe trends in the life expectancies of older white and black couples from

1930 to 2010.10 We use census data to calculate the age gap between 60 year old wives and their

husbands in each census year. Using the 1930-2010 NCHS life tables for white men, white women,

black men, and black women, we calculate joint life expectancy and survivor life expectancies. The

proximate causes of the trends we describe are changes in the age gaps between spouses and changes

in the mortality distributions of older men and women, but the trends are driven by changes in the

mortality distributions. In section 4 we discuss briefly the dispersion around the summary measures.

Section 5 concludes.




8
  To account for the dependence in mortality rates of spouses would require detailed longitudinal
data on couples.
9
  We treat Hispanic blacks as blacks rather than as Hispanics.
10
   Unfortunately, we are unable to calculate the historical trends separately for Hispanics, as the
NCHS life tables only began providing separate life tables for Hispanics in 2006.
                                                                                                    6
2. Patterns in the Life Expectancies of Older Couples and Surviving Spouses by Race, Ethnicity,

and Education: 2010

         In this section, we first discuss joint and survivor life expectancy measures by race and

ethnicity. We then discuss how these racial and ethnic differences in joint and survivor life expectancy

are affected by education using the Bound et al. (2015) data linking educational attainment with

mortality.

         Before doing this, however, we generalize our analysis beyond focal couples consisting of

60 year old women married to 62 year old men. We begin with an example. Retaining our focus

on 60 year old women, we recognize that some of them are married to 61 years old men, others to

62 year old men, and still others to 63 year old men. In this example, the way forward is first to

calculate the joint and survivor life expectancies of these three types of couples and then to

compute the appropriately weighted average. We generalize the procedure used in this example to

calculate joint and survivor life expectancy for couples consisting of a 60 year old woman and her

husband, regardless of her husband's age. That is, using census data about the age gap between 60

year old married women and their husbands, we calculate joint and survivor life expectancies for

each race and ethnicity and for each education category as appropriately weighted averages. 11

Thus, the differences we report in joint and survivor life expectancy across groups reflect

differences in both age-specific mortalities and in the age gaps between 60 year old women and

their husbands.




11
     Census data was obtained through IPUMS. (Ruggles et al. (2017)).
                                                                                                      7
2a. Race and Ethnicity

       Table 1 shows the 2010 measures of life expectancy for non-Hispanic white, black, and

Hispanic couples.12 We present individual life expectancy of women aged 60, the average life

expectancy of their spouses, and measures of joint and survivor life expectancy for the appropriately

weighted average of couples in which the wife was aged 60.

       Both Hispanic men and Hispanic women have longer life expectancies than their non-

Hispanic white and black counterparts, and Hispanic couples have a higher joint life expectancy.13

Black men and black women have shorter life expectancies than their non-Hispanic white and

Hispanic counterparts, and black couples have a lower joint life expectancy. The pattern for survivor

life expectancy is the opposite: conditional on becoming a widow, black women have a longer

survivor life expectancy (13.5 years), than Hispanic women (13.1 years), and white women (12.5

years). Hispanic men have the shortest survivor life expectancies (9.3 years), followed by white men

(9.5 years), with black men having the longest expected survivor life expectancies (10.1 years). While

Hispanic men and women have the longest individual life expectancies at age 60, they have the lowest




12
   We define race of couples by the race of the wife. There is little intermarriage reported in the
2010 census for non-Hispanic white women or for black women aged 60. Fully 99 percent of
married non-Hispanic white women are married to non-Hispanic white men, and over 97 percent
of married black women are married to black men. Hispanic women are more likely to
intermarry. In 2010, 79.2 percent of married Hispanic women were married to Hispanic men,
19.5 percent were married to non-Hispanic white men, and 1.4 percent were married to black
men. When we limit the sample to exclude interracial couples, the results do not change
substantially.
13
   We have taken at face value the mortality distributions and life expectancies for Hispanic men and
women reported by the CDC, but these should be viewed with caution. The CDC life tables report
that Hispanics have substantially longer life expectancies than non-Hispanic whites, despite
Hispanics' lower incomes and lower levels of educational attainment. Demographers have termed this
the “Hispanic Paradox” and have offered a variety of explanations; see Smith and Bradshaw (2006),
Goldman (2016). Black et al (2017) argue that the longer Hispanic life expectancy are probably
due to measurement error.
                                                                                                    8
expected number of years in widowhood. Black men and women have the shortest life expectancies

at age 60, and they have the highest expected number of years in widowhood.



2b. Education

       Bound et al. (2015) estimate individual age-specific mortalities by education. We use their

mortality estimates to calculate couple-based life expectancy measures by education for non-Hispanic

white couples and black couples, but not for Hispanic couples.14 We classify couples into four

education categories, using the "power couples" terminology introduced by Costa and Kahn (2000)

and extended by Compton and Pollak (2007). Couples are defined as "low-power" if neither spouse

has a college degree; "half-power-her" if only the wife has a college degree; "half-power-him" if only

the husband has a college degree; and "full-power" if both spouses have college degrees.15




14
   NCHS life tables do not condition on education. Bound et al. (2015) estimate mortality
probabilities by education categories, conditional on survival to age 25, for non-Hispanic white
men and women and for black men and women. We provide estimates for four education
categories -- less than high school, high school graduate, some college, and college graduate. We
have extended the Bound et al. estimates in two ways. First, we convert their five-year estimates
to one-year age estimates using a cubic spline. Second, we extend their estimates for ages above
age 85 using the NCHS data for the full population and assuming that all four education groups
follow the proportional increases in mortality for ages above 85.
15
   The estimates from Bound et al. (2015) are based on administrative data that have been
criticized for underestimating education. Rostron (2010), Hendi (2015), and Sasson (2016) have
shown that when education is reported by next-of-kin (as in administrative data) there is
substantial undercounting of the population with high school diplomas and an over-counting of
the population with less than high school, compared to the self-reports in survey data. Use of
administrative data to code education leads to greater reported disparities in life expectancy by
education, compared to the results using self-reported survey data. However, the discrepancies in
reported education are concentrated at the lower end of the education scale (a high proportion of
those with high school diplomas are listed as less than high school). Since we combine these two
groups and focus on the differences between college graduates and non-college graduates, the
concerns about the administrative data used in Bound are less relevant.
                                                                                                    9
         Table 2 presents the life expectancy measures by education. For both men and women,

education is associated with lower mortality and substantially greater life expectancy.16 Due to

positive assortative marriage on education, the education differences in individuals' life expectancies

translate into substantial differences in joint and survivor life expectancies. Consider first the joint life

expectancy measure. For both non-Hispanic white couples and black couples, as we move from low-

power couples, to half-power-her, to half-power-him, to power couples, joint life expectancy

increases steadily. For non-Hispanic white couples, joint life expectancy increases across education

categories from 15.5 to 19.0 years; for black couples, joint life expectancy increases from 13.6 to 16.4

years.

         While the joint life expectancies are approximately three years longer for non-Hispanic white

couples in each category, the survivor life expectancies are slightly higher for black men and women

compared with non-Hispanic white men and women. For non-Hispanic white couples and for black

couples, the husband’s survivor life expectancy is highest when he has a college degree and she does

not (10.1 and 10.5 years). For these half-power-him couples, his life expectancy is higher than average

and hers is lower than average, which results in a higher expected years of widowerhood for the

husband. The husband’s survivor life expectancy is lowest when she has a college degree and he does

not (9.0 for non-Hispanic white couples and 9.4 years for black couples). For these half-power-her

couples, his life expectancy is lower than average and hers is higher than average, resulting in lower

expected years of widowhood for the husband.




16
  For more discussion on this topic, see Meara, Richards, and Cutler (2008), Olshansky et al.
(2012), Bound et al. (2015), and Chetty et al. (2016). We do not speculate on what portion of this
association is causal and what portion reflects correlations between education and other factors,
both genetic and environmental.
                                                                                                          10
       We find that the differences in life expectancies by education are, in all cases, greater than the

racial differences. Similarly, the difference in the probability that the husband dies first is greater

across education categories than the differences between blacks and non-Hispanic whites. For black

couples and for non-Hispanic white couples, the probability that the wife will die first is lowest for

couples in which only the husband has a college degree (half-power-him couples, at 0.59), and highest

for couples in which only the wife has a college degree (half-power-her couples, at 0.68). Although

these numbers reflect both differences in life expectancy and age gap across education groups, this

pattern continues to hold when we fix the age gap at two years and consider only differences in life

expectancies between blacks and non-Hispanic whites.



3. Trends in the Life Expectancies of Older Couples and Surviving Spouses: 1930-2010

       We next describe the trends in joint and survivor life expectancies for white and black couples

from 1930-2010.17 Our discussion here differs from our discussion of trends in section 2 because,

unlike the 2010 life tables, the NCHS life tables for earlier census years do not include mortality

distributions for Hispanics. We analyze couples consisting of 60 year old women and their husbands,

so that the changes we report in joint and survivor life expectancy between 1930 and 2010 reflect

both changes in age-specific mortalities and changes in the age gaps between spouses.18 In Table

3a we present joint and survivor life expectancies for white couples in which the wife was aged

60, and in Table 3b we present the corresponding life expectancies for black couples. 19 Figure 2



17
   We begin in 1930 because the mortality data for older individuals from 1920 and before is not
comparable with the data from 1930 and after. The difficulty is that prior to 1930, the survivor
tables end at age 89 (i.e. the probability of death between ages 89 and 90 is one). The tables from
1930 onwards extend to 101.

shows the trends in individual life expectancies for 60 year old white women and their husbands and

for 60 year old black women and their husbands. Life expectancy for women of this age has increased

steadily over the decades, and the gap between white and black women has remained fairly constant.

The life expectancy of their husbands has increased both because the age gap has fallen (so husbands

in 2010 are on average younger than husbands in 1930) and because the life expectancy of older men

has increased.

        The effect of the increasing life expectancy of older men is evident in Figures 3a and 3b. Until

1980, a white woman of age 60 who outlived her husband could expect to spend as much of her

remaining life in widowhood as years with her husband. From 1930 to 1980, joint life expectancy for

white couples increased from 10.0 years to 14.0 years, and her survivor life expectancy followed a

similar pattern, increasing from 10.9 years to 13.4 years. After 1980, the joint life expectancy of white

couples continued to increase, while her survivor life expectancy fell. By 2010, joint life expectancy

exceeded her survivor life expectancy by 5 years – joint life expectancy was 17.7 years and her

survivor life expectancy was 12.5 years. For married black women of age 60, joint life expectancy

did not exceed her survivor life expectancy until 2010. Between 1930 and 2000, joint life expectancy

for black couples increased from 8.4 years to 13.4 years and her survivor life expectancy increased

from 11.3 years to 13.3 years. In 2010, joint life expectancy (15.5 years) finally exceeded her survivor

life expectancy (13.5 years).

        The survivor life expectancy of the husbands of 60 year old women has slowly increased

between 1930 and 2010. In 1930, a white (black) husband who outlived his wife could expect to live




these cohorts. For all years, the percentage of white married women aged 60 who are married to
white men exceeds 99 percent. For black married women aged 60, the percentage married to
black men exceeds 98 percent prior to 2010; for 2010 the percentage was 96.4 percent.
                                                                                                      12
8.5 years (8.7 years) as a widower. By 2010, the survivor life expectancy for white (black) husbands

increased to 9.5 years (10.1 years).

       The probability that the wife will be the surviving spouse follows an inverted u-shaped pattern

similar to her survivor life expectancy. In 1930, the probability that a 60 year old white woman would

outlive her husband was 0.56. This probability increased steadily, reaching a peak of 0.69 in 1980

before falling to 0.63 in 2010. The pattern for black women is similar: the probability of being the

surviving spouse was 0.58 in 1930, rose to 0.70 in 1990, and then fell to 0.63 in 2010.

       Two factors underlie these observed patterns. In recent decades, the life expectancy of older

men has increased faster than the life expectancy of older women, implying an increase in joint life

expectancy and a decrease in her survivor life expectancy. The age gap between spouses has also

fallen, and fell markedly between 2000 and 2010, but the change in the life expectancies of older men

and women, not changes in the age gap, are the primary drivers of the observed patterns.20



4. Dispersion

       Like individual life expectancies, joint and survivor life expectancies are summary measures

of mortality distributions, and provide no information about the dispersion of these distributions.




20
   We performed counterfactual calculations of joint life expectancy holding the age gap fixed at its
2010 level. Because the average age gap exceeds two years in all census years except 2010,
replacing the actual age gaps with the 2010 age gap raises the joint life expectancy and lowers
survivor life expectancy. With one exception, however, the decade-to-decade patterns noted above
remain. The only exception is for black couples between 2000 and 2010. For these couples, the
change in the age gap is responsible for an increase in joint life expectancy of 2.2 years and a fall
in survivor life expectancy of 0.1 years. Survivor years as a proportion of joint life expectancy as
well as the probability that the husband will die first both fell slightly. When we hold the age gap
constant, however, the increase in joint life expectancy is only 1.6 years and there is an increase
in survivor life expectancy of 0.5 years. Applying the 2010 age gap would have resulted in an
increase in ratio of survivor life expectancy to joint life expectancy, as well as the probability
that the husband dies first.
                                                                                                   13
Consider again our focal couple in which she is aged 60 and he is aged 62. Recall that for this couple,

joint life expectancy is 17.7 years, the probability that she is widowed is 0.63, her survivor life

expectancy is 14.6 years, and his survivor life expectancy is 8.6 years. To provide information about

the dispersion of the mortality distributions around the joint life expectancy and survivor life

expectancies, we calculate the probability that a couple will survive ten, twenty, thirty, or forty years

and present the resulting 4×4 matrix in Table 4.21

        If mortality were evenly distributed across the 16 element of the matrix, each would have a

probability of 0.0625. Consider first the four corner elements, which correspond to the cases in which

one or both spouses die in either the first decade or the last decade. (These are the lowest probabilities

in the matrix). The probability that the wife will be a widow for approximately 30 years is 0.034; the

probability that the husband will be a widower for approximately 30 years is 0.027. It is almost equally

likely that they both die within the first decade (0.031), and that they will both live at least another 30

years (0.030). The most likely scenario is that both spouses live between 20 and 30 additional years,

but even this probability is only 0.129. The wide dispersion of these distributions is due not to the

differing mortality rates of men and women, nor to the age gap between spouses, but rather to the

large overlap of the underlying mortality distributions. If we conduct the same calculation for a same-




21
   The 4×4 matrix shows the probabilities of various realizations of the timing of death for a non-
Hispanic white couple in which the wife is 60 and the husband 62. For example, top left cell
corresponds to the case in which both spouse die within the first decade; 3.1 percent of couples
fall into this category. The bottom right cell corresponds to the case in which both spouses live
into the fourth decade (i.e., both into their 90s); 3.0 percent of couples fall into this category. In
these two cases, and in the other two cases on the principal diagonal, the wife or the husband
may be the surviving spouse. In cells above the principal diagonal, the wife is the surviving
spouse; in cells below, the husband is the surviving spouse. For example, the bottom left cell
corresponds to the case in which the wife dies within the first decade and the husband lives at
least until age 92; 2.7 percent of couples fall into this category.
                                                                                                        14
sex couple consisting of two 60 year old women or of two 60 year old men, the resulting matrix is

very similar.

       The wide dispersion in mortality rates around joint and survivor life expectancies suggests the

need for caution when interpreting these summary measures, but similar caution is also required when

interpreting individual life expectancy.



5. Conclusion

       We have defined and calculated measures of the joint and survivor life expectancies of older

couples. Although it is intuitively appealing to calculate couple-based measures of life expectancy

directly from men's and women's life expectancies, such calculations are misleading because they fail

to take account of the substantial overlap in spouses' mortality distributions. The resulting measures

overstate joint life expectancy and dramatically understate survivor life expectancy. We calculate

joint and survivor life expectancy using 2010 data disaggregated by race and ethnicity and by

education, and using historical data from 1930 to 2010. Because we base our calculations on

individual life tables, we cannot take account of the possibilities that (a) healthier individuals may

select into marriage, (b) marriage may itself increase life expectancy, and (c) mortality rates of

husbands and wives may be correlated. Because taking account of these possibilities requires richer

data, we leave these refinements for future research.

       Measures of joint and survivor life expectancy are potentially useful to those designing or

evaluating policies affecting older couples and to couples making savings, retirement, and long-term

care decisions. Policy makers need to forecast future social security claims and assess future demand

for nursing home care. To do this they need estimates of the number of years both spouses will be

alive and the number of years the widow or widower will survive after the spouse's death. Couple life



                                                                                                   15
expectancy matters for long-term care because when one spouse becomes disabled, the other typically

provides care; after the death of one spouse, adult children or nursing homes paid for by Medicaid

usually provide care for the disabled surviving spouse. Couples making saving and retirement

decisions and deciding when to claim social security benefits need estimates of their joint life

expectancy and the life expectancy of the surviving spouse. With the exception of Goldman and Lord

(1983), demographers, economists, gerontologists, and sociologists have generally ignored the joint

life expectancies of married couples and the life expectancies of surviving spouses.

        For definiteness, we have focused on trends affecting women aged 60 and their husbands but

our analytical structure applies to couples regardless of age, or, more generally, to pairs or larger

groups of individuals.22 Although the measures are tedious to calculate, tools such as the "Life

Expectancy Calculator" on the Social Security website could easily be augmented to allow individuals

and couples to calculate their joint and survivor life expectancies.23
