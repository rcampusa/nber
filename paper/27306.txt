Medicaid Expansion and the Mental Health of College Students

                                         ABSTRACT

Reported mental health problems have risen dramatically among U.S. college students over time,
as has treatment for these problems. An open question is how healthcare access affects diagnosis
of mental illness and treatments such as prescription psychotropic medication use. We examine
the effect of state-level Medicaid expansion following the 2014 implementation of the Affordable
Care Act on the diagnosis of mental health conditions and psychotropic prescription drug use of a
national sample of college students. We find that students from disadvantaged backgrounds are
more likely to report being on public insurance after 2014 in expansion states relative to non-
expansion states, while more advantaged students do not see this increase. Both diagnosis of
common mental health conditions and psychotropic drug use increase following expansion for
disadvantaged students relative to advantaged ones, which translates into an elimination of the
pre-treatment gap in these outcomes by family background in expansion states. However, these
changes are not associated with short-term improvements in measures of mental health status or
academic outcomes.

Introduction
Mental health challenges are pervasive among college students. According to the University of
Michigan's Healthy Minds Study, 18% of college students experienced major depression and
31% experienced anxiety disorder during the 2018-19 academic year. 1 In 2014, these
percentages were 12% and 22%, respectively. 2 Treatment of mental health conditions have also
risen dramatically among U.S. college students over time. The percentage of students reporting
they received mental health treatment in the past year rose from 19% in 2007 to 34% in 2017
(Lipson, Lattie, and Eisenberg, 2019). Roughly 22% of students in 2017 reported using
psychotropic medication in the past year for medical use (Cimini and Rivero, 2018). 3 Finally,
though reports of adverse mental health symptoms are similar across family background
variables or higher for more disadvantaged students, diagnosis and treatment are more
common for more advantaged students (Lipson et al., 2018).

The goal of this paper is to examine how access to inexpensive healthcare--and mental health
care in particular--contribute to the diagnosis, treatment, and symptoms of mental health
conditions among college students. To do so, we exploit the expansion of Medicaid under the
Affordable Care Act (ACA) to include all individuals with qualifying incomes up to 138% of the
federal poverty line. A Supreme Court ruling gave states the option to expand Medicaid, and 27
states did so in 2014 while 24 did not (Courtemanche et al., 2017). A notable feature of
Medicaid is its coverage (with little or no co-pays) of mental and behavioral health coverage,
which stands in contrast to many private insurance plans. 4

Prior to the ACA, Medicaid was traditionally confined to specific low-income populations such as
children, parents, pregnant women, and the disabled. States that expanded Medicaid opened
the program both to other groups (e.g. childless adults) and individuals with higher incomes than
would have qualified in the past. In expansion states, college students would typically qualify for
Medicaid if they were claimed as dependents (up through age 24) by their parents and their
parental modified adjusted gross income were below the 138% threshold. Alternatively, if
students were not claimed on another person's tax return, their own income would be used to
determine their Medicaid eligibility. 5

In addition, 13.1 percent of all 18-25 year-olds had major depression in 2017, far higher than the
percentage among older age groups (see https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/major-
depression.shtml).
3 Nonmedical use of prescription drugs is also high among college students: roughly 12% reported

misusing prescription drugs in the past year (see
https://www.campusdrugprevention.gov/sites/default/files/Prescription%20Drug%20Misuse%20among%2
0College%20Students%20%28Final%29%20%285-26-17%29.pdf).

Medicaid expansion was not the only component of the ACA to change in 2014. Others include
the individual insurance mandate, the opening of state and federal insurance exchanges, and
federal subsidies for lower-income families to purchase insurance. 6 McMorrow et al. (2015) find
that from 2013 to 2014, the uninsured rate among low-income young adults ages 19-25
decreased by roughly 8-10 percentage points (with no effect for high-income young adults).
Notably, the reduction in uninsured rates are similar across Medicaid expansion and non-
expansion states, but the increase in public insurance coverage is only in expansion states (11
percentage points).

Because Medicaid carries no premiums and little or no co-pays (Kaestner et al., 2017), its
expansion may lead to increased use of healthcare services relative to private insurance
(Sommers et al., 2016). Our main identifying assumption is that states that did not expand
Medicaid proxy for the trend in outcomes that would have occurred in expansion states if
expansion had not taken place. In particular, any effects of federal changes related to the
insurance mandate and exchanges are controlled by differencing out time effects for non-
expansion states. In addition, however, we expect Medicaid expansion to affect only eligible
(low-income) students, which helps us to further account for any factors that might have
changed particularly in expansion states. This strategy is similar to the one employed in
Courtemanche et al. (2017, 2019), who examine how different components of the ACA have
affected insurance coverage. We return to this point below.

Our study is not the first to examine how Medicaid expansion has affected prescription drug
use. Ghosh, Sommers, and Simon (2017) use a similar strategy to examine how Medicaid
expansion affects aggregate prescriptions by prescription class. One of their findings is that
Medicaid mental health-related prescriptions increase by 19% overall following expansion.
Maclean et al. (2019) also use state-level prescription data to examine how Medicaid expansion
affects psychotropic medications specifically. They find that Medicaid-reimbursed prescriptions
for anti-depressants increase by 34%, anti-anxiety drugs by 23%, and psychostimulant drugs by
16% (effects on anti-psychotic drugs and mood stabilizers were smaller).

There is likewise a new literature on Medicaid expansion and mental health diagnoses and
conditions. Baicker et al. (2013) find that those who were given Medicaid via lottery in Oregon
were less likely to have a positive screening for depression based on their symptoms
(suggesting Medicaid improved mental health overall) but more likely to be diagnosed with
depression (suggesting it increased the rate of diagnosis conditional on a positive screening).
Winkelman and Chang (2018) find that Medicaid expansion was associated with an
improvement in poor mental health days and a reduction in depression diagnoses among low-
income adults with chronic conditions (but not among those without such conditions).
Courtemanche et al. (2018) also find that lower-income adults experienced fewer days in poor
mental health after Medicaid expansion.


6 Prior to that, in 2010, the dependent coverage rule went into effect, whereby insurance plans were
required to cover dependent children on family plans until age 26 (see
https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20131216.035741/full/).
                                                                                                  3


Our paper makes several contributions relative to the ones addressed above. First, we examine
college students specifically, a population for which mental health problems are a particularly
acute issue. Second, we use individual data on self-reported usage of prescription drugs rather
than administrative data on prescriptions issued (which may not all be taken as prescribed).
Third, we can examine a rich set of outcomes beyond specific prescription medication use,
including diagnosis by a healthcare professional, measures of mental health status, use of other
drugs/alcohol, and academic outcomes. Lastly, because our data is at the individual level, we
can differentiate between individuals within expansion states who are more or less likely--
based on family background characteristics--to be affected by Medicaid expansion. This allows
us to home in on a population of specific interest--low-income college students--and to further
scrutinize our identification strategy for isolating the effects of Medicaid expansion.

We find that students from more disadvantaged family backgrounds are more likely to report
being on public insurance after 2014 in expansion states relative to non-expansion states, all
relative to the same difference prior to 2014. Diagnosis of mental health conditions and
psychotropic drug use increases according to the same pattern. These effects are either not
present for or much more muted for students from more advantaged family backgrounds. These
findings imply that the pre-treatment gap in prescription rates and diagnosis for "low-SES"
relative to "high-SES" students, which we highlight below, disappears following Medicaid
expansion (in expansion states).

We do not find evidence that these increases in diagnosis and prescription drug use are
associated with mental health status (based on symptoms), changes in substance use, or
academic outcomes. Effects on these variables are generally small, imprecisely estimated, or
both. We note that these results do not imply that the increase in mental healthcare associated
due to Medicaid expansion has had no positive impact on treated students. However, it does
suggest that closer examination of the effects of treatment on these and related outcomes is
warranted, a subject we return to later in the paper.


Methodology
We implement a classic difference-in-differences (DD) regression model to examine the effect of
Medicaid expansion on student insurance type, mental health diagnoses, prescription drug use,
and other outcomes. In particular, we estimate models of the following form:

(1)  = 0 + 1  +  +  +   +  .

Equations (1) is estimated for many different outcomes via OLS with standard errors clustered
at the state level to account for intra-state correlation in errors both in a cross section and over
time (Bertrand et al., 2004). In this equation,  takes a value of one if the individual lives in
a state that has expanded Medicaid and a value of zero if the individual lives in a non-expansion
                                                                                                          4


state or in an expansion state but in a pre-expansion year. 7  and  represent state of
residence dummies and year dummies, respectively.  contains dummies for gender, race
and ethnicity, and age categories as well as controls for parental education and family financial
situation, and finally state-level controls for k-12 per pupil spending at age 17, total higher
education expenditure per capita, medical and recreational marijuana laws, and whether the
state has a Medicaid managed care program. 8 We include educational spending to control for
changes in mental health treatment and outcomes that may be associated with changes in
school programs (Ketchen Lipson et al., 2015). We control for marijuana laws as the past
decade has seen many changes in state laws and there may be a link between marijuana use
and certain mental health symptoms (Black et al., 2019). Lastly, managed care programs have
been shown to affect the ADHD diagnosis rate in youths and may affect treatment of other
mental health conditions as well (Chorniy, Currie, and Sonchak, 2018).

Because we do not expect Medicaid expansion to affect the insurance status or
diagnosis/prescription drug use of students with ample parental resources, we further
differentiate our sample by proxies for income/wealth (since we do not directly observe these in
our data) and estimate Equation (1) separately for each group. We classify an individual as "low
SES" if neither of their parents was a college graduate and if the individual reports that their
financial situation growing up was "always stressful," "often stressful," or "sometimes stressful"
(as opposed to "rarely stressful" or "never stressful"). If either of these conditions fail, the
student is classified as "high SES."




7 For a list of expansion and non-expansion states in our sample, see Appendix Table 1. For those states
in our sample that expanded Medicaid by the end of 2018, all but five did so on 1/1/2014. These are New
Hampshire (expanded 8/15/2014), Pennsylvania (1/1/2015), Indiana (2/1/2015), Montana (1/1/2016), and
Louisiana (expanded 7/1/2016). We only observe students from Indiana in 2010, from Louisiana in 2013,
from Montana in 2016, and from New Hampshire in 2017. We classify all of these as expansion states,
but in practice it makes no difference because with state fixed effects in the model they do not contribute
to the identification of the treatment effect. We observe students from Pennsylvania in multiple years but
not 2014. Thus, defining treatment as taking a value of "1" in expansion states in 2014 or later has exactly
the same effect as defining treatment based on the specific year in which each state expanded Medicaid.

We chose to split the sample this way because the combination of both conditions predicts a
larger difference in public insurance status (the closest proxy we have to Medicaid receipt in our
data) than either condition alone. Roughly 9% of our "low SES" students claim they are insured
through public insurance, while 2% of "high SES" students do. As we show in the Results
section, Medicaid expansion is associated with a large increase in public insurance for low-SES
students but not high-SES students.

Our model is identified by differences in outcomes in Medicaid expansion states from before to
after the time of treatment all relative to the same differences in non-expansion states. Thus,
threats to our strategy include any unobserved factors that were changing in expansion states
relative to non-expansion states over this time period. We deal with such a possibility in two
ways: first) because we also differentiate by family SES status, any change in outcomes that is
not due to Medicaid expansion but is rather universal across family SES type should be picked
up in the effect for high-SES students. Thus, the difference in DD effects for low-SES and high-
SES students (i.e., the triple difference or DDD) would be immune to any threats of this type (in
practice, we typically find that the DD effects for high-SES students are small or zero). Second,
we perform an event study analysis that allows us to directly examine relative pre-treatment
trends in the outcome variables of interest.


Data
The Healthy Minds Study (HMS) is an annual web-based survey run by the University of
Michigan that focuses specifically on mental health and mental health services among college
students across the U.S. 9 The HMS has been used extensively in public health research. 10 For
participating colleges and universities, a random sample of students is selected for the survey.
The survey was first conducted in 2007. In this study, we use data from the 2010-2017 waves of
the HMS (participants interviewed from 2010-2018) because they contain all relevant variables
for our analysis. The overall participation rate in these years is roughly 25%. Non-response
weights are used to make the sample of responders representative of the overall student body
at their institutions.

We restrict our sample to domestic students who are 25 or younger. This represents 175,322
individuals. When we include only those students with non-missing information on key
dependent and independent variables included in our baseline regressions (mental health
condition diagnoses, psychotropic prescriptions, and family background variables), we are left
with 132,423 students from 37 states (see Appendix Table 1 for the list of states). We show how
the means of several key variables compare for our regression sample and other respondents
(who have at least one missing value for these variables) in Appendix Table 2. As seen in the
table, those with missing information are appreciably less likely to be white, somewhat more
likely to have public insurance, less likely to have taken medication, and more likely to have had

a mental health diagnosis. Expansion state and SES status are very similar across the two
groups.

We now describe in detail the set of dependent variables used in our analysis. Our main
outcomes of interest include receipt of public insurance as well as other insurance types,
diagnosis of common mental health conditions, use of prescription psychotropic medications,
and mental health status based on self-reports of symptoms. For diagnosis of mental health
conditions, respondents are asked, "Have you ever been diagnosed with any of the following
conditions by a health professional (e.g. primary care doctor, psychiatrist, psychologist, etc.)?"
We focus on several potential categories then given including attention disorder or a learning
disability (including ADD/ADHD), depression, anxiety, or an eating disorder. 11 These four
conditions make up the vast majority of mental health diagnoses in our data. 12

For medications, respondents were asked about prescription medications that they had taken
regularly in the past year. We focus on psychostimulants (typically used to treat ADD/ADHD),
anti-depressants, anti-anxiety medications, and prescription sleeping aids. 13 Once again, other
medication types (mood stabilizers, anti-psychotics, and "other" medications) make up just a few
percent of prescription drug use in the data.

Regarding mental health status based on self-reports of mental health symptoms, we focus on
students' subjective overall mental health, depression, sleep problems, anxiety, and suicide
ideation. We use the Diener score to measure the subjective psychological well-being of
students. Calculated from a battery of 8 questions, the score ranges from 8 to 56 with higher
scores representing better mental health (Diener et al., 2010). Regarding depression, we use
two binary measures including screening for "moderate depression" and screening for "major
depression," which are defined, respectively, as a score of 10 or higher and a score of 15 or
higher on the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) that was developed by Kroenke, Spitzer,
and Williams (2001). Two binary measures of sleep problems, "moderate sleep disorder" and
"severe sleep disorder," are used, which are defined as having trouble sleeping (having trouble
falling or staying asleep or sleeping too much) for more than half the days and having trouble
sleeping nearly every day over the last 2 weeks, respectively. Regarding anxiety, we again use
two binary measures, "any anxiety" and "major anxiety," which are defined, respectively, as
being bothered by feeling nervous, anxious, on edge, or worried for several days and more than


11 The survey includes the following examples for each of categories:

Attention disorder/learning disability: attention deficit disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,
learning disability.
Depression: major depressive disorder, bipolar/manic depression, dysthymia, persistent depressive
disorder.
Anxiety: generalized anxiety disorder, phobias, obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress
disorder.
Eating disorder: anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa.
12 Other categories include psychosis, personality disorder, and substance abuse disorder, but these

make up only a few percent of individuals with diagnosed conditions.
13 Specific examples of drugs are given to help students answer about use of medications in each

category.
                                                                                                          7


half the days over the past several weeks. 14 Finally, "suicide ideation" is defined as having
seriously thought about attempting suicide over the past year (0 or 1).

When students are asked about their health insurance coverage, there are nine (not mutually
exclusive) categories they can choose from (students can report multiple insurance types) plus
being uninsured. "Public insurance" is one of these categories (there is no separate category for
Medicaid coverage specifically). These categories are displayed along with summary statistics
on variables used in our analysis in Tables 1a and 1b.

Lastly, we examine three measures of academic success along with three measures of
substance use. The academic outcomes include self-reported GPA converted to a four point
scale from categorical responses from which students are supposed to choose the one that best
describes their grades (A, A-, B+, etc.), the average number of hours students report spending
on schoolwork every day, and whether they report at least one day in the past four weeks on
which mental or emotional problems hurt their academics. For substance use, we examine
whether the student binge drank (4+ drinks at one time for females and 5+ for males) in the past
two weeks, whether they smoked cigarettes in the past month, and whether they used
marijuana in the past month. We note that many of these variables were not asked in all years
of our data or were only asked of a subset of all students. This explains much of the difference
in sample sizes for these variables relative to our full baseline regression sample.

Table 1a and 1b show summary statistics broken out by student financial background and state
Medicaid expansion status, respectively. As expected, Table 1a shows that low-SES students
are less likely to be white and to be on their parents' insurance but more likely to be uninsured
or on public insurance (note that the survey does not ask about Medicaid coverage specifically,
only public insurance). Low-SES students are somewhat less likely to be diagnosed by a doctor
with a mental health condition, use psychotropic medication, or engage in risky health behaviors
(binge drinking, marijuana use)--and each of these differences are significant at the 1% level.
Importantly, however, they are somewhat more likely or equally likely to experience negative
mental health symptoms, including more depression, sleep trouble, and anxiety.

Turning to Table 1b, we see that students in Medicaid expansion states are less likely to be
white, less likely to be on their parents' health insurance or uninsured and a bit more likely to be
on a student plan or public insurance, and more likely to have used marijuana. Overall, rates of


14 HMS changed its battery of anxiety questions from the GAD-7(old) in the 2007-2012 HMS (Spitzer et
al., 1999) to the GAD-7(new) (Spitzer et al., 2006) starting in 2013. The skip logic changes between these
two versions of the questionnaire. As a result, we use only the first question of the GAD-7 (both old and
new), which is very similar across our sample years (2010-2017). In the 2007-2012 HMS, the first
question of the GAD-7 is "Over the last 4 weeks, how often have you been bothered by feeling nervous,
anxious, on edge, or worrying a lot about different things?" with the choices "1=Not at all; 2=Several days;
3=More than half the days." Starting in 2013, the first question of the GAD-7 is "Over the last 2 weeks,
how often have you been bothered by the following problems? Feeling nervous, anxious or on edge" with
the choices "1=Not at all; 2=Several days; 3=Over half the days; 4=Nearly every day." We define "any
anxiety" as "several days" or higher and define "major anxiety" as "more than (over) half the days" or
higher.

diagnosis and psychotropic medication use are similar between expansion and non-expansion
states. Symptoms of poor mental health are generally more pronounced in expansion states
than in non-expansion states. Expansion states also spend more on education in per-capita
terms, have a higher percentage of Medicaid enrollees in managed care, and are far more likely
to have medical or recreational marijuana legalization.


Results
1. Baseline results

Table 2 contains results from models estimating the effect of Medicaid expansion on whether an
individual is uninsured, whether they have public insurance, psychotropic medication use, and
diagnosis of common mental health conditions. Medicaid expansion is associated with a 7.6
percentage point decline (significant at the 10% level) in the probability of being uninsured for
low-SES students, with a small and statistically insignificant effect for high-SES students. This is
almost exactly offset by a 7.2 percentage point increase (significant at 1%) in the likelihood of
public insurance for low-SES students. Note that because our proxy for Medicaid eligibility is
based in part on a subjective question about family economic stress, it is likely that some
eligible students wind up in the "high SES" category. Nevertheless, as expected, the effect of
Medicaid expansion on public insurance receipt for high-SES students is much smaller at 1.3
percentage points. The differences in corresponding coefficients between low-SES and high-
SES respondents are significant at the 5% (no insurance) and 1% (public insurance) levels. The
combination of these two results suggest that our identification strategy is plausibly uncovering
the effects of Medicaid expansion on our outcomes of interest. 15

In analyzing psychotropic medication use and mental health diagnoses, we begin with a binary
measure indicating use of at least one of the four medication types described above in the past
year and a binary measure indicating diagnosis of at least one of the four common mental
health conditions described above, respectively. Treatment effects for low-SES students on
prescription drug use in the past year and mental health diagnoses are estimated at 3.6
percentage points and 6.5 percentage points, respectively. Corresponding effects are much
smaller and statistically insignificant for high-SES individuals. The differences in corresponding
coefficients between low-SES and high-SES respondents are significant at the 10%
(medication) and 1% (diagnosis) levels.

Though results for prescription drug use and diagnosis are consistent with the results on
insurance status (in the sense that all effects are concentrated on low-SES students), it is
striking how large these effects are: the effect on prescription drug use is half as large--and the
effect on diagnosis is nearly as large--as the effect on public insurance receipt (in percentage


15 In Appendix Table 3, we show estimates of Medicaid expansion on each of the other insurance

categories. That table shows that the effects of Medicaid expansion on types of insurance other than
public insurance are small and generally statistically insignificant at conventional levels (for both low-SES
and high-SES students).
                                                                                                   9


point terms). One possible explanation for this is that Medicaid coverage is underreported, with
the majority of misreporting individuals claiming they have private health insurance instead
(Sommers et al., 2012). Indeed, Boudreaux et al. (2019) find that undercounting of Medicaid in
the American Community Survey became relatively worse in expansion states compared with
non-expansion states following Medicaid expansion. This effect was substantial: in the full
population, Medicaid expansion is estimated to have increased coverage by 5 percentage
points using administrative data but only 3 percentage points using the ACS. Thus, our
estimated effects on public insurance coverage using self-reports in the HMS may be biased
downward.

Prior to Medicaid expansion in expansion states, 24% of "high-SES" students had been
diagnosed with at least one common mental-condition and 16% were on a common prescription
psychotropic medication (see Appendix Table 4a for details). The corresponding figures for
"low-SES" students were 18% and 12%, respectively. These gaps are in spite of the fact that
symptoms associated with poor mental health are similar or worse for low-SES students in
these states over this time period. 16 Our estimation suggests that Medicaid expansion increases
diagnosis of low-SES students relative to high-SES ones by 6.5 percentage points and
prescription drug use by 3.6 percentage points. Thus, Medicaid expansion essentially closes the
diagnosis and prescription drug use gap between low-SES and high-SES students in expansion
states.

To further explore how Medicaid expansion affects these outcomes for different groups of
students, we split our sample into non-white and white students. Table 3 shows how the results
compare for non-whites and whites in the low-SES category. The effect on being uninsured is
stronger for non-whites, though coefficients for both groups are only significant at the 10% level
(possibly owing to smaller sample sizes in this sub-group analysis). However, effects on public
insurance receipt are similar, suggesting that 1) low-SES white individuals are more likely to
switch from another type of insurance to Medicaid after expansion rather than from no insurance
to Medicaid, or 2) underreporting of Medicaid after expansion is more severe for non-whites.
Notably, effects on psychotropic medication use and diagnosis are larger and more precisely
estimated for non-whites, particularly in the former case. This is perhaps because the change in
mental healthcare when going from no insurance to Medicaid is larger than when going from
private insurance to Medicaid, as appears to be more common for white students. Appendix
Table 5 repeats this same analysis for high-SES individuals; in that case, treatment effects for
both non-whites and whites are generally small and statistically insignificant.

2. Effects on specific prescription drug use types and mental health diagnoses

Table 4 shows how Medicaid expansion affects use of our four specific prescription medication
types for both low- and high-SES students. The first is psychostimulants, commonly used to
treat Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The others are anti-depressants, anti-
anxiety medication, and sleeping aid medication. Effects for high-SES individuals are

16 Appendix Tables 4a-4d show summary statistics in expansion and non-expansion states prior to
treatment as well as after treatment.
                                                                                               10


consistently small and statistically indistinguishable from zero. On the other hand, treatment
effect coefficients for low-SES individuals range between roughly one and four percentage
points and are statistically significant at the 5% level for anti-depressants and sleeping aids.
Point estimates for low-SES students are uniformly larger than their counterparts among high-
SES students.

Table 5 contains results from regressions in which the dependent variables are specific
diagnoses related to mental health conditions. The results are largely consistent with those for
prescription drug use (Table 4), though there are some interesting differences. There is a large
effect of Medicaid expansion on diagnosis of an attention/learning disability for low-SES
individuals (4.5 percentage points) in spite of the fact that use of psychostimulants increases
only weakly. The effect of treatment on a depression diagnosis is 3.4 percentage points for low-
SES students; the effect on an anxiety diagnosis is 2.0 percentage points but insignificant at
conventional levels. The effect of expansion on an eating disorder diagnosis is much smaller
and statistically insignificant.

3. Effects on mental health status

We explore how Medicaid expansion is related to measures of mental health status based on
self-reports of symptoms in Table 6. Strikingly, Medicaid expansion is not associated with
improved mental health in any category for low-SES students in spite of meaningful effects on
diagnosis and prescription drug use noted earlier. Treatment is negatively associated with
mental health for low-SES individuals in every category though only two coefficients (Diener
score, any anxiety) are statistically significant at conventional levels. We are cautious about
interpreting this as evidence that expansion has hurt mental health symptoms given the
corresponding (but smaller) negative effect on Diener score for high-SES students and the
possibility for false positives when analyzing a large number of outcomes (8). Overall, these
results run counter to some of the evidence we cited earlier suggesting Medicaid has
ameliorated mental health symptoms (Baicker et al., 2013; Winkelman and Chang, 2018;
Courtemanche et al., 2018)--but we note that none of those studies examined college students
specifically.

We note several possibilities for these results besides the one that the increase in mental
healthcare associated with Medicaid receipt has not been efficacious for low-SES college
students. First, the increased mental healthcare from expansion may have created more
awareness of mental health challenges leading respondents to be more likely to report
associated symptoms on surveys. This of course would bias our results away from indicating
positive mental health effects of Medicaid expansion. Another possibility is that we only observe
students in the first few years after Medicaid expansion. Thus, over time, mental health status
may respond differently to the additional care afforded by expansion. Evaluating these
possibilities is beyond the scope of this paper, but we consider it an important area for further
research.

4. Effects on other outcomes
                                                                                                       11



Table 7 shows how Medicaid expansion has affected binge drinking, smoking, and marijuana
use among college students. 17 Theoretically, if student mental health improves with proper
diagnosis and treatment (including use of psychotropic medication), recreational drug use
(which may be done for self-medication) may decline. At the same time, abuse of prescription
drugs and recreational drugs sometimes go together (McCabe et al., 2006). Medicaid expansion
may also affect recreational substance use through other channels--for example, coverage of
smoking cessation therapy or treatment of substance use disorders may be more generous in
Medicaid than in private insurance plans. We do not find evidence of a clear effect of expansion
on these behaviors; none of the coefficients for low-SES students are statistically significant at
conventional levels. Though all coefficients are negative, corresponding coefficients for high-
SES students are also uniformly negative, and pairwise differences are not statistically
distinguishable.

We next turn our attention to academic outcomes, which are shown in Table 8. The increases in
diagnoses and medication could theoretically improve academic outcomes for low-SES students
relative to high-SES students. However, our ability to measure academic outcomes is somewhat
limited: we have data on self-reported GPA, average time spent doing schoolwork each day,
and whether students reported that mental/emotional problems hurt their academics. The
results in Table 8 do not suggest that the increase in mental health diagnosis/treatment due to
Medicaid expansion has improved the academic outcomes of low-SES students. Low-SES
students' GPA and schoolwork time (the latter of which could theoretically be raised or lowered
by improved mental health through treatment) are essentially unaffected. The effect on whether
students report that mental/emotional problems hurt their academics is positive at 4.3
percentage points and significant at the 10% level. However, as stated earlier, this may be a
result of awareness of such difficulties increasing with diagnosis and treatment as opposed to a
true deleterious effect of treatment on academic outcomes.

5. Robustness

In this section, we take up the question of whether our results are robust to different
specifications and samples. This also allows us to indirectly examine the soundness of our
identification strategy.

One possible weakness of our analysis is that the composition of our sample changes over
time, since the institutions (and states) in the survey change from year to year. This may be
particularly problematic if the percentage of low-SES students changes from before to after
treatment in expansion states relative to non-expansion states. Appendix Table 6 displays the
results of regressing "low SES" status on Medicaid expansion and our other covariates. The
estimated coefficient is extremely small (0.5 percentage points) with a standard error of around


17We note that sample sizes with these outcomes are generally smaller than those available for our main
outcomes. This is because these variables (as well as other auxiliary variables analyzed below) are often
included in special modules that are only presented to a subset of students in each year.
                                                                                                 12


one percentage point. As a result, we think it is unlikely that changes in the fraction of low-SES
students are driving our DD results.

Another question is how changes in the representation of states over the 2010-2016 sample
period affect the results. Indeed, institutions from some states appear only once in this period
while other states are represented many times (though not necessarily by the same institutions).
To see how our results are affected by state compositional changes, we restrict our analysis to
only those states that appear at least four times over our sample period. This includes nine
expansion states: California, Colorado, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada,
New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island; and three non-expansion states: Florida,
North Carolina, and Virginia. We repeat the baseline analysis found in Table 2 with this
restricted sample and display the results in Appendix Table 7. Compared with Table 2, the
estimated treatment effects for the restricted sample are remarkably similar given that the
sample of individuals is reduced by 30% and the number of states is cut from 37 to 12.

Our last analysis is an event study that explicitly examines pre-treatment trends in our outcomes
of interest across expansion versus non-expansion states. In particular, we would like to know
whether having no health insurance, public insurance receipt, mental health diagnosis, and
prescription drug use were on an upward trajectory (relative to non-expansion states) even
before Medicaid expansion. If they were, it would call into question whether expansion itself is
responsible for our DD results.

To do this analysis, we aggregate our sample into four data periods: 2010-11 (baseline), 2012-
13 (pre-treatment), 2014-16 (post-treatment), and 2017-18 (post-treatment). This way, our
estimates are less likely to be affected by noise from changes in the sample over time. Table 9
shows the results of regressions in which expansion interacts with each of these time periods
(rather than simply interacting with pre- and post-2014, as in the DD analysis). This analysis is
done for low-SES students only, since they are the ones for which Medicaid expansion has
been shown to have meaningful effects.

Each column of Table 9 shows no statistically significant effect of living in an expansion state in
2012-13 relative to 2010-11 (and point estimates are generally very small). This suggests that
expansion states were not trending away from control states prior to treatment in 2014. The
point estimates for 2014-16 and 2017-18 (relative to 2010-11) are all much larger in absolute
value. 2014-16 is associated with an 8.3 percentage point increase in public insurance receipt
and 2017-18 is associated with a 6.7 percentage point increase. Post-treatment increases in
psychotropic medication use and diagnosis of mental health conditions are estimated with less
precision than their corresponding estimates from our DD regressions, but they tell a similar
story.

Our interpretation of our results as a whole is that Medicaid expansion increased the diagnosis
of common mental health conditions and the use of prescription drugs to treat these conditions
among relatively disadvantaged college students. We believe this interpretation is bolstered by
the results presented above in several ways: first, we do not see a corresponding increase in
                                                                                                 13


diagnosis/drug use for relatively advantaged college students (in expansion states relative to
non-expansion states). Second, our main results are robust to the use of different estimation
samples. Third, we do not observe a pre-treatment trend in diagnosis/medication for low-SES
students in expansion states compared to non-expansion states.


Conclusion
This study examines the role of an increase in access to medical care (via Medicaid expansion
under the ACA) in the diagnosis of common mental health conditions and associated
prescription psychotropic drug use among college students. We find economically meaningful
effects of Medicaid expansion on these outcomes for students from disadvantaged
backgrounds, with no corresponding effects for more advantaged students. This is consistent
with the fact that Medicaid expansion should have had little effect on healthcare access for
richer families.

Because more advantaged students are more likely to be diagnosed with a mental health
condition and use psychotropic medications to begin with, our estimates imply that Medicaid
expansion effectively "closed the gap" between low-SES and high-SES students in
diagnosis/prescription drug use in expansion states. The consequences of this change are of
course important for public policy. We take a small step toward that goal by examining
indicators of mental health status as well as substance use and academic outcomes. We do not
find any protective short-term effects of expansion on these behaviors and outcomes, though
we note that this is merely scratching the surface of potential consequences of the rise in
diagnosis and psychotropic medication use induced by Medicaid expansion.

Notes: The sample consists of all domestic students age 25 or younger with non-missing information on key variables.
Standard deviations for binary variables are not shown. We assign an individual to the "low SES" category if neither of an
individual's parents was a college graduate and if the individual reports that their financial situation growing up was "always
stressful," "often stressful," or "sometimes stressful" (as opposed to "rarely stressful" or "never stressful"). If either of these
conditions fail, the student is classified as "high SES." Estimates are weighted with HMS non-response weights.

Notes: *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1. There are 28,707 low-SES and 103,716 high-SES
students. Standard errors clustered by state. "Treat" is equal to 1 if the student lives in a
Medicaid expansion state after expansion (and zero otherwise). Additional covariates (not
shown) include state and year dummies, dummies for gender, race, age, parental education, and
family financial situation; and state-level controls for k-12 per pupil spending at age 17 and higher
education spending per capita (and their squares), and dummies for whether the state has a
Medicaid managed care program, medical marijuana law, and recreational marijuana law.

Notes: The sample consists of all domestic students age 25 or younger with non-missing information on key variables. We
assign an individual to the "low SES" category if neither of an individual's parents was a college graduate and if the individual
reports that their financial situation growing up was "always stressful," "often stressful," or "sometimes stressful" (as opposed
to "rarely stressful" or "never stressful"). If either of these conditions fail, the student is classified as "high SES." Estimates are
weighted with HMS non-response weights.

Notes: The sample consists of all domestic students age 25 or younger with non-missing information on key variables. We
assign an individual to the "low SES" category if neither of an individual's parents was a college graduate and if the individual
reports that their financial situation growing up was "always stressful," "often stressful," or "sometimes stressful" (as opposed
to "rarely stressful" or "never stressful"). If either of these conditions fail, the student is classified as "high SES." Estimates are
weighted with HMS non-response weights.

Notes: *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1. There are 17,574 non-white and 86,142 white students in this high-SES sample. Standard
errors clustered by state. "Treat" is equal to 1 if the student lives in a Medicaid expansion state after expansion (and zero
otherwise). Additional covariates (not shown) include state and year dummies, dummies for gender, race, age, parental
education, and family financial situation; and state-level controls for k-12 per pupil spending at age 17 and higher education
spending per capita (and their squares), and dummies for whether the state has a Medicaid managed care program, medical
marijuana law, and recreational marijuana law.
