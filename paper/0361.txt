              New Evidence that Fully Anticipated Monetary
                 Changes Influence Real Output After All

                                 SUMMARY


     A new empirical study of the relation between money, nominal income,
prices, and real output in postwar quarterly U.S. data rejects virtually all
of the conclusions reached by Robert Barro in his three papers on the topic
(AER 1977, JPE 1978, and 1978 conference paper with Mark Rush). A distinction
is drawn between the Lucas—Sargent--Wallace (LSW) theory that only unanticipated
monetary changes influence real output, and the orthodox view that anticipated
monetary changes influence real output in the short run during the interval of
adjustment of prices to the monetary change. The LSW proposition requires for
its validity a contemporaneous and equiproportionate response of the expected
price level to the anticipated level of money or nominal CNP, whereas the
orthodox approach requires that price expectations depend at least partly on
the past history of prices rather than entirely on the expected level of
nominal demand.
     The results uniformly support the orthodox approach. The Livingston
expectations series exhibits a highly significant response to past price
changes, and only a slight response to current expectations about nominal GNP
or money. The actual inflation rate also depends heavily on past price changes,
with an insignificant impact of current expectations of nominal GNP, or money.
The equations that relate real output to the deviation of changes of nominal
income (both anticipated and unanticipated) from past price changes fit the
data significantly better than Barro's approach using current and lagged
values of money tisurprises!! The pure version of the LSW approach relating
real output only to current surprises is decisively rejected.

1. INTRODUCTIQN

     The. point   of departure for this series of empirical papers by Robert

Batro is the proposition, associated with. the names of Lucas, Sargent, arid

Wallace. (LSW), that real output is independent of predictable movements in
                     1
the. money supply.       The. innovative and controversial feature of this hy-

pothesis is nQt that money is neutral in the long run, for this proposi—

tion—'tthe. natural rate" hypothesis (NRE)-.—was accepted by a substantial

majority of economists by the time the LSW hypothesis was advanced. In-

stead, if it is to have    any   independent content, the LSW hypothesis must

state that systematic monetary stabilization has no effect on output In the

short—run.

     If   valid, the LSW hypothesis would undermine much of the existing

literature on stabilization policy. Regular countercyclical activist inter-

vention, implemented as a predictable response to movements in output or
                                                           2
unemployment, would be both. futile and unnecessary.           The entire optimal

control branch of the stabilization policy literature, and existing demon-

strations that    particular   derivative or proportional feedback control f or—

mulae are more effective stabilizers than a constant—growth—rate—rule,
                                  3
would be rendered irrelevant. The concept of the political business cycle,

and of the manipulation of the economy for electoral purposes, would be
                                                       4
relegated to a museum for obsolete economic ideas.

     Because of the radical Lmplications of the LSW hypothesis for the theory

and practice of stabilization policy, it is understandable that macroecono—

mists should have eagerly awaited a convincing empirical verification. But
                                                                             2


it is surprising to me that the series of papers by Robert Barro would be
                                                      5
regarded as providing any such empirical support.         For the Bca"ro pccpers

proviTde   no test at all of the short—run neutrczZ-ity proposition of ESW that
would dstin h t from the widely-accepted long—run "natural rate"
neutralCty ypotesis CNREJ. Barros papers fail to provide any support             for

the   LSW hypothesis    for three separate reasons:

             1. There is no explicit empirical test of the leading competing

hypothesis upon which. the orthodox stabilization literature rests its case——

that short—run inertia and stickiness of price adjustment allows any change

in nominal income (whether anticipated or unanticipated) to affect real out-

put in the short run. The Gradual Adjustment of Prices (GAP) hypothesis is

fully compatible with the long—run neutrality of NRH if the inflation rate

gradually but continuously accelerates whenever output exceeds its tinaturalt?

level. GAP combined with NRH implies that any permanent shift in the growth

rate of nominal income is initially divided between faster growth in both

output and prices, but that gradually the output stimulus vanishes until

higher Inflation has fully absorbed the nominal income acceleration.

            2. Far from attempting to distinguish, the LSW and NRB.—GAP ky-

potheses, Barro compares as determinants of output on the one hand unantici-

pated money   change,   and on the other hand rati noney change. The statistical

defeat of the. latter appears to be the only evidence put forth tosupport

the. LSW hypothesis. But this is like setting up a World Series between the

Yankees and a team of geriatric invalids. The real Yankee—Dodger World

SerIes for the output-determination trophy (see. below) pits unanticipated

money change as one explanatory variable versus.the deviation between actual
                                                                                3


money change and an adaptively—adjusting expected price change as the

competing variable. Barro's correlations between the output gap and rcm.'

money change make no contribution whatsoever to distinguishing the dubious

L hypothesis from tha widely accepted NRH, becáüse any such long—run re-

lation between   a   real variable (output) and a nominal variable (raw money

change) would violate the NRH. We know that the acceleration of monetary

growth between the.. 1950s and 1970s did not produce a 'tpermanent economic

high," but this fact does not by itself constitute evidence against the

short—run potency of stabilization policy.

          3. Not only do Barro's output and unemployment equations fail to

provide any evidence supportvng the LSW hypothesis, but, worse yet, his

price equations strongly undermine the theoretical rationale of the LSW hy-

pothesis by validating the competing NRH—G.AP hypothesis. Barro estimates

that the full adjustment of prices to changes in the money supply takes

between four and six years, while the formation of anticipations
                                                            6
about monetary changes takes only a single quarter.             For LSW to be

valid, any fully anticipated monetary change that raises nominal income must

raise prices s-CmutaneQuly., since the hypothesis states that real output

must remain unaffected. Thus Barro's price equations fail to validate the

one—quarter lag between    zctua7   money and the price level that would be

necessary to confirm the required contemporaneous response of the price level

to an anticipated money change.      \   In   the long interval between the single—

quarter adjustment of expectations about monetary change, and the fourth or

sixth year required for the full price. response..tooccur, anticipated mone—

tary change can affect real output.           The     result of Barro's research on
                                                                              4



prices, with its finding of a 24—quarter time interval between a monetary

change and the full adjustment of prices, seems to amount to little more

than a reconfirmation of my earlier study (1975) which found a 28—quarter
       8
lag.


2. A STATE1fENT OF TEE IDENTIFICATION PROBLEM


           The Lucas supply function on which the LSW hypothesis is based states

that the gap (Ht) between log output               and log natural output (Q) depends on

the difference between the actual and expected rate of change of prices
    —
           p):
                  (1)    Ht =                  +

                                                           9
where         is a stochastic error term with mean zero.


       Most current econometric models which generate orthodox conclusions about

the short—run potency of stabilization policy determine prices by an expec—

tational Phillips curve equation that relates the same variables as follows:


                  (1')
                         Pt
                                     +     +

The difficulty of distinguishing between the LSW hypothesis based on (1) and

the orthodox conclusions based on (1') is evident in comparing the two equa-

tions, since (1') is just an inverted version of (1), and vice versa.

       If expectations are rational, and the p term in (1) incorporates

all past information (including the serial correlation properties of

then the forecast error          —   p)   should be serially uncorrelated, leading to

the criticism that equation (1) cannot explain the high degree of positive

serial correlation observed in actual data on Ht. However, the LSW hypothesis
                                                                          5

can be rescued from this line of criticism if the output gap depends at

least partly on its own past values:


             (2)     Ht =        — i') + Z         +
                                         1=1

For   instance, Blinder and Fischer (1978) have rationalized (2) on the

grounds that a positive price "surprise" will lead firms to raise sales

more than production, decuniulating inventories, and then to rebuild their

stocks of inventories gradually in future periods. Thus, even if there

is no price surprise in period t-#-1, the output gap (H+i) would depend

positively on the output gap last period (He) and in earlier periods as

well.

        It is possible to derive Barro's estimated equation linking output

to a distributed lag of past monetary changes from equation (2), if we

begin by calling upon the "quantity identity" to provide a connection

between the rates of change of prices, money, velocity, and real output:


                    Pt      mt+v
Further, if prices are known to clear markets, then a rational expectation

of the price level will equal the difference between the expected level of

nominal income and output, with all level variables in logs:

             (4)    E1(P) = E1(M) + Ei(V) —
'1hen we substitute the expectation of the output gap equation (2) into (4),

we obtain:

             (5)    E_1(P) = Et1(M) + E1(V) —             — ze.Htl.
                                                                         6


 Using the definitions that relate expectations of the rates of change of

 variables to expectations of their levels, (5) is equivalent to:

            (6) p =            + ye        + Ht_l —
                                                        EOIHt_I.

When the difference between (3) and (6) is, substituted into (2), we can

solve by recursion to obtain a direct relation between the current output

gap and current and lagged "surprises" in the growth of both money and

velocity.

            (7) H =       z -1-fct(m
                         i=O
                                       —    e
                                                ÷   —
                                                        v). +
 where      = 1.


     Note in (6) that the expected change in the price level depends on ex-

pected nominal GNP growth, adjusted both for the growth of natural output

 (q) and for the influence of arty non—zero output gaps that may have occurred

in previous periods. Thus in this version of the LSW model that allows for

persistence in the output gap, as in equation (2), the expected change in

prices does not simply echo the expected growth of nominal GNP. Depending

on whether the total influence of the lagged gap terms is positive or

negative, a one—percentage—point increase in expected nominal GNP growth

could be accompanied by an increase in expected price change of either more
                                   10
or less than one percentage point.

     The estimated output equation in Table 1 of Barro—Rush (1979) can be

viewed as an empirical representation of equation (7). Barro—Rush find that

monetary surprises (rn_me) in ten past quarters are significant in explaining

output. Significant positive serial correlation is present in the estimated
                                                                     7

Barro—Rush output equations, corresponding to the presence in (7) of the

past error terms         The only important difference is that Barro—Rush

agents are assumed to be able to predict velocity with precise accuracy,

while their uncanny predictive powers do not extend to perfect foresight

about the money supply——thus only monetary surprises are included in their

estimated output equation rather than the more general form (7) which calls

for real output to depend on surprises in nominal GNP growth.

     How can the LSW hypothesis that real output is independent of antic-

ipated changes in nominal GNP be distinguished from the NRH—GAP hypothesis

that anticipated nominal GNP changes influence real output during the in-

terval of price adjustment? Clearly, no empirical research on the hy-

potheses can make headway if it simply involves a comparison of the Lucas

supply equation in (1) with the expectational Phillips curve in (1'), since

the two equations are just inverted versions of each other. Instead, a

different approach is required. Leaving aside the lagged gap terms, it is

apparent in (6) that the LSW approach requires expected inflation to be

based on expectations of nominal GNP growth, whereas the essence of the

competing NRH—GAP hypothesis is that inertia in the adjustment of prices

prevents an instantaneous response of expected price change to expected

nominal GNP change. In its most extreme version, NRH—GAP would state that

expected inflation responds only to past inflation, with no response at all

to anticipated demand conditions:


          (8)      p =    ZA1p
                         1=1


A more rational version of the formation of expectations under the NRE—GAP

hypothesis would take account both of inertia and of knowledge of the
                                                                      8

structure of (1'), that is, of the partial dependence of inflation on
                          11
shifts in demand (H):-



           (9)        p =       Z          + bH.
                               i=l


      We can compare (9) with a version of the LSW price expectation equa-

tion that is similar to Barro's owii price equation. Substituting the re—

lation between the output gap and lagged "surprises" from equation (7) into

(6), we obtain:



           (10)
                      e
                   p. =        m

                                     + ve — q.
                                                        i
                                                 + Z u. Z y..
                                                           1  3,
                                                  1=1 1=1 3

where u =
          t/(l)1[a(m_me+v_ve)t+ct1, and y1(l—O1), while y.= —0. for 1>1.

      Two main differences are evident in comparing the NRR—GAP approach in (9)

with the implied LSW equation in (10). First, the influence of past his-

tory is represented in (9) by actual price change, but in (10) by past nom-

inal GNP surprises. Second, given the past history of surprises, (10)

states that there should be a contemporaneous and equiproportionate "jump"

in the expected rate of price change to any "jump" in anticipated nominal

GNP growth, whereas in (9) there is no such implication.


3.   ESTIMATED EQUATIONS THAT DISTINGUISH LSW FROM NRH-GAF

      The present section proposes three tests of the relative explanatory

power of the two competing hypotheses of the formation of price expecta-

tions, fitted to U.S. postwar quarterly data.

           (1) Using as the dependent variable the Livingston data on the

price expectations of a panel of economic forecasters, (9) and (10) can be

estimated directly.
                                                                                               9

           (2) Employing as price data the same GNP deflator series used by

Barro, the alternative expectations equations (9) and (10) can be substi-

tuted into (1') to test their relative ability to explain the postwar be-

havior of the inflation rate.


           (3) Employing as output data the same real GNP series used by Barro,

the LSW supply equation (7) can be compared with an alternative NRB—GAP version

obtained by substituting (9) into (1') and solving for the current output gap.

     1. Exp7aining Inflation Expectations. The central assumption of the

LSW short—run neutrality hypothesis is a unit—elastic contemporaneous re-

sponse of the expected price level to any change in the expected level of

nominal GNP, holding constant the influence of past nominal GNP ttsurprisestt.

Translated into rates of change, as in equation (10) above, the partial

elasticity of the expected inflation rate to the expected rate of change in

nominal GNP is unity. The validity of this assumption, as well as the re-

lation between price expectations and past nominal GNP surprises, can be

tested on the price expectations of the Livingston panel of economic fore-

casters, as compiled by Carlson (1977).

     A series for expected nominal GNP growth (y =                        + v) can be de-
veloped by fitting an autoregressive equation analogous to Barro's expected

money equation, with past changes in money and in the share of goverument

spending in GNP () as additional explanatory variables:

    (11)         =     010    + 367 y_ + 064 t—2 —                       182   t—3 —          148

                                                                                            [—1.41]

 Then the fitted values from equation (11) can be used to test the validity

 of equation (10), which states the LSW proposition that expected inflation

 should depend on the current expectation of nominal GNP growth, adjusted

 for the effect of past nominal GNP surprises.

      The basic estimate of the LSW price expectation equation (10) is pre-

 sented in Table 1, column (1). There is little support in the 1954—75

 U.S. data for the LSW hypothesis, since the elasticity of expected in-

 flation to expected nominal GNP growth (holding constant lagged nominal GNP

 surprises) is not 1.0 but only .124, indicating that forecasters expect 88

percent f an anticipated change in nominal GNP to take the form of a change

in real output. Stated another way, the Livingston forecasters act as if
                                                    12
they belz.eve the LSW   hypothesis   to be false.

     The influence of the nominal GNP surprise last period (_e)

separated in Table 1 from earlier surprises, since in equation (10) the first

lag is the only coefficient the sign of which can be determined a pr-ion

(the e terms should be fractions less than unity, so that the first lag

should have the positive coefficient
                                         1—el). In column (1) it appears that
the coefficients on both the first lagged surprise and on earlier surprises

are insignificant.

     All equations in this paper allow for two extra variables representing

"supply shocks" that cause inflation to change relative, to expected in-

flation for any given level of the real output gap (Hr). The first is a

dummy variable for the 1971—74 Nixon—era price controls, and the second is

a proxy for the influence of foreign prices on U.S. domestic
                                                                        prices (p).
While the NIXCON dummy has the wrong sign in column (1), the foreign price

term is extremely important. This variable may           partially be   acting as a
                                                                      11

proxy for lagged domestic prices, which play an important role in explain—
                                                     13
ing price expectations in the NR}I—GAP   approach.
     Column (2) of Table 1 presents the same equation corrected for the

positive serial correlation present in column (1). This correction alters

the sign on the NIXCON dummy, reduces the foreign price coefficient to a

more plausible size, and yields the conclusion that the response of ex-

pected price change to anticipated nominal GNP growth is zero, not unity as

postulated by the LSW approach. The lagged nominal GNP surprise terms are

insignificant, as in column (1).

     Columns (3) and (4) present parallel results, replacing the role of

anticipated and unanticipated changes in nominal GNP by anticipated and un-

anticipated changes in the money supply (Ml), using the Barro—Rush money

Supply equation to provide estimates of m. The results in both columns

indicate a response to anticipated monetary change of zero, rather than the

required elasticity of unity. The main difference between the nominal GNP

and money results is the significant explanatory role of the distributed

lag of past unanticipated monetary change in columns (3) and (4).

     Columns (5) and (6) present the alternative results for equation (9),

the statement of expectation formation under the NRH—GAP hypothesis. The

corrected results in column (6) indicate that expectations respond to past

price changes with an elasticity that is insignificantly different from

unity, when the domestic and foreign price contributions are added to-

gether. Expectations are also influenced by the level of the real output

gap and by the Nixon price controls. In fact, it is interesting that the

coefficients on the price control dummy are almost identical in columns (2),

(4), and (6). In this final equation it appears that the Livingston
                                                                        12

forecasters act as if they believe that prices adjust gradually to changes

in    demand conditions. The mean lag on the past change in the CPI is 9.9
quarters, and a full 24 quarters of past price information is regarded as
relevant in the formation of expectations; thus the lag distributions on
lagged   unanticipated monetary changes in column (4) and on the lagged CPI

changes in column (6) are approximately the same.

       Is there any role for nominal GNP or money changes in explaining the

price expectations of the Livingston forecasters? When added to the equa-

tion in column (5), the nominal GNP variables (both current anticipated and

lagged unanticipated changes) are jointly insignificant (the F—value for

joint significance is 0.38, compared with the 5 percent critical value of

3.11). However, the money supply variables are jointly significant (F—value

of 4.75), while the lagged consumer price variables are very significant

jointly when added to the money equation in column (3) (F—value of 14.9).

Thus a complete explanation of the Livingston inflation expectations series

appears to require use of data on lagged changes both in the CPI and in

money.

       There is no need to choose the "best'1 equation in Table 1, since the

results are entirely consistent with the NRH—GAP approach. Expected price

changes do not respond at all to anticipated changes in nominal GNP or

money, implying that these anticipated changes influence real output.

Further, the lag coefficients on unanticipated money in columns (3) and (4)

also support the hypothesis of gradual price adjustment. Recall that in

the Barro—Rush money equation m depends almost entirely on mci. Thus the

lagged surprise terms represent nothing more than a five—year distributed
                                               lLf
lag   on actual changes in the money supply.

      2. &rplaining the Inflation Rate. Equation (1') above states that the

difference between the actual and expected inflation rates is a function

of the real output gap. If inflation expectations are formed by the LSW

hypothesis, represented by equation (10) above, then equation (1') would be

completely consistent with the LSW hypothesis that real output is independent

of anticipated changes in nominal GNP. The rate of change of prices in this

case would be calculated by substituting (10) into (1'):

                                e            *

                                                  i=1   j=l

The alternative hypothesis that price expectations are formed in a manner

that is consistent with the gradual adjustment of prices would involve sub-

stituting (9) above into (1'):

                       Pt       I Ai—i + (b+)Ht + y t
                               1=1

     In Table 2 column (1) displays the direct estimate of equation (12),

while column   (2)   is a "money—only" version which assumes that the actual

and expected growth rates of velocity are both zero. Column (3) represents

an estimate of equation (13).

     Most of the results in Table 2 duplicate those in Table 1. The elas-

ticity of price change to current expectations of nominal GNP or money

growth is not unity, as required by the LSW hypothesis, but only .14 in

column (1) and .05 in column (2). As in the previous Table, the money—only

version fits better than the nominal GNP version; the coefficients on the

NIXCON and foreign price variables in the money—only equation are significant

and have the expected sign; and the long distributed lag on unanticipated

monetary changes indicates that a full seven years      is    required for prices to

adjust to actual changes in money.
                                                                            14


           Column (3) represents an estimate of equation (13) above, the NRH—

GAP hypothesis that inflation depends on the history of past price changes,

as well as on current demand and supply factors. The coefficient on the

current output gap indicates that the short—run Phillips curve has a slope

of .27 when inflation is expressed at an annual rate; for instance,

holding constant the history of inflation and the values of the other

variables, a 5 percentage point positive output gap implies an inflation

rate that is 1.4 percentage points faster at an annual rate than when the

output gap is zero. The Nixon control effect is significant in the expected

direction in columns (2) and (3), with a cumulative impact of either —3.0 or

—2.1 percent in 1971—72 followed by an offsetting rebound in 1974.

           The pattern of coefficients on the Nixon control dummy and the foreign

price proxy can be explained as follows. Comparing Columns (1) and (3), we

note that the coefficient on the foreign price term in the former is twice the

value in column (3); given the positive correlation between p and pr', the
                                                             t      t
large coefficient on p' in column (1) represents an attempt by the computer
                             t
to find a variable that can provide the required explanatory power of the

missing lagged            On the other hand, the F' variable grows much more

rapidly than p in 1974, setting a natural limit on the size of the

coefficient onp. Further, the rapid growth period of p is partly collinear

in 1974 with the "rebound" portion of the Nixon control dummy, forcing down

the coefficient on NIXCON in equations like that in column (1) where lagged

p         is missing and F       .   is   required to have a large coefficient. Notice
    t—i                  t—].

that in column (2), where the sum of coefficients on p. is smaller than in

column (3), the coefficient inNIXCON is correspondingly larger.
                                                                        15


         Is there any role for current expectations of changes in nominal

GNP or money in explaining price behavior, given the past history of prices?

When the past history of prices is added to the equation of either columns

(1)    or (2), the coefficient on anticipated changes in either nominal GNP

or money is insignificantly different from zero. On the other hand, lagged

unanticipated changes in nominal GNP or money do contribute significantly

to the explanation of price change when added to the autoregressive equation

in column (3). This suggests that, while the results in Table 2 reject the

required unitary response of price change to anticipated nominal GNP or

money change, there is a remaining role for demand changes in explaining

price change that is not completely represented by the Ht variable in

column (3).


        3. Eplan-ing the Output Gap.          A final comparison of the LSW and NRH—

GAP approaches involves the estimation of output equations. This allows us

to test directly the conflicting predictions that only unexpected nominal

GNP or monetary changes influence real output (LSW), versus all         nominal GNP
or monetary changes—whether anticipated or not—influence real output during

the.   interval   required for price adjustment (NR1i-GA). None of the unemploy-

ment or output equations in the three Barro empirical papers provide any test

of this alterna.tive hypotheais

       The.   LSW output hypothesis   is   represented by equation (7) above:
                                                                                   16

                             =                               + v —
              (14)                Z
                                 i=O

                                                    —
                                                                      ve).   +

 Thus the output gap (He) responds to the current and lagged "surprise"

 in nominal GNP growth. The competing NRB—GAP hypothesis can be rewritten

 as an output equation when (13) is solved for the output gap:

                                      1                       *
              (15)           =                           —        +     —               —
                                 l+b+m            + Vt                       E
                                                                             1=1


where we use. the identity                —       and the definitions of
                             Pt '                                                  and

Thus the. competing hypothesis is      not that ttonly unexpected nominal               GNP

changes   matter't, but rather that 'real output depends on actual nominal                    GNP

changes a&juteZ for the pact history of prices." The longer prices take to
adjust to an acceleration of nominal GNP            growth,       the longer a real output
gap can persist, even if nominal GNP           behavior      is fully anticipated.
     A minor difference between Barrots papers and our empirical investiga-
tion of   output behavior Involves the treatment of ttnaturaltr output (Q*)

dependent variable, and attempts to capture the influence of Q on the right—
hand side of his equation by including a time trend and his peculiar MIL

variable (see. Small, 1978). A preferable procedure is to take advantage of

the research of Perloff and Wachter (1978) which takes explicit account of

the production function linking           to capital, energy,          and   "natural" labor

input. The growth of Q* has slowed in the l970s, due to the deceleration

in the growth of capital and energy input relative to labor input, and the use of

aQ* series taking account of this deceleration avoids the misspecification

involved in Barro's extraneous MIL variable. Thus the dependent variable in

all of the output equations in Tables 3 and 4 is the real output gap,
                                                                       17

       log(Q)       ].og(Q).
    Table 3 reports estimates of equations (14) and (15) and related equations

involving the growth of nominal GNP. Because of the need to use a long

distributed lag of past nominal GNP changes, and because quarterly nominal

GNP data are unavailable prior to 1947, all equations in Table 3 share a

coon sample period running from 1954 to 1978.

    Although both the LSW and NRH-GAP hypotheses suggest that nominal GNP

growth (i.e., money growth and velocity growth) should be relevant for

explaining the output gap, Barro's work has concentrated on the behavior

of money growth alone. To provide equations analogous to Barro's,

Table 4 repeats each equation from Table 3, with money growth replacing

nominal GNP growth. Because of the availability of money supply data

before 1947, the equations in Table 4 have been estimated over the longer

1949—78 sample period.


       If column (1) in Table 3 is viewed as a test of equation (1), a "pure"

version of the LSW hypothesis without any influence of lagged "surprise"

terms, then that view is rejected by the estimated equation. The co-

efficient on unexpected nominal GNP change is insignificant, and the

explanatory power of the equation is weak. Following a more general approach

in which lagged "surprises" are allowed to influence the level of real out-

put, as in equation (14), column (2) exhibits the effect of adding lagged

values of unexpected nominal GNP growth. While the fit of the equation is

improved somewhat, its standard error is still large and its Durbin—Watson

statistic is extremely low. Most important is the fact that a full 27 quarters

of lagged "surprise" data are significant (this was the longest lag distri-

bution examined). While persistence of the output gap is consistent with
                                                                         18



the NRH—GAP hypothesis, it strains credulity to imagine a mechanism by

which a nominal GNP "surprise" could still influence real output seven

years later as required for column (2) in Table 3 to be consistent with the

LSW hypothesis.

     In contrast to the weak explanation of the output gap exhibited in

columns (1) and (2), the estimate of the NRE—GAP approach in equation (15)

is presented in column (3). Not only is the estimated standard error only

one—tenth of the LSW error in equation (1), but all of the coefficients are

conisteit with the theoretical specification and with the corresponding

inflation equation in Table 2. Using column (3) of Table 2, we can compare

the estimated coefficients with column (3) of Table 3:


                             Table 2                 Table 3

Column (3) can be interpreted as saying that "given the inherited values

of inflation and the output gap, the elasticity of the output gap to a

fully anticipated acceleration in nominal income growth is 88 percent."

    While the contrast between the results in columns (1) and (2) on, the
                                                                        19


one hand, and in column (3) on the other hand, is sufficiently dramatic

to establish the main argument of the paper, some critics may claim that

the attractive characteristics of column (3) are due to the presence of
                                                                       16
the lagged dependent variable on the right—hand side of the equation.

    The NRH—GAP output equation (15) can be.solved recursively to eliminate

the lagged dependent variable; this transformation makes the output gap

a function of a distributed lag of the other independent variables. The

results of estimating the transformed equation are exhibited in columns

(4) and (5), without and with a correction for positive serial correlation.

We note that the NRB—GAP equation in column (4), in which both anticipated

and unanticipated nominal GNP changes matter, improves the fit of both LSW

equations in columns (1) and (2) by a factor of three. Although the equation

in column (4) exhibits significant positive serial correlation, the trans-

formed equation in column (5) appears to have roughly the same sums of

coefficients on lagged income and price change.

    In order to provide results that are comparable directly to the Barro—

Rush quarterly output equations, Table 4 duplicates the equations in

Table 3 with money change everywhere replacing nominal CNP change.

As in Table 3, column (1) in Table 4 indicates that there is no statistically

significant relation between the real output gap and the current money "surprise,"

thus rejecting the "pure" version of the LSW hypothesis. Only when a long

series of lagged "surprises" is included is the joint effect of the surprise

terms significant, and the shape of the lag distribution seems to be quite

sensitive to a correction for positive serial correlation (compare columns 2 and 3).

    Confirming Table 3, we note that the estimated version of the NRH—GkP
                                                                             20

equation (15) in column (4) of Table 4 explains the output gap data much

better than either of the unexpected money equations; the standard error

is lower by a factor of almost three (compare columns 2 and 4). Even without

the "help" of the lagged dependent variable, the versions of the 1SRIi—GAP

equations in columns (5) and (6) outperform the lagged "surprise" equations

in columns (2) and (3).

    An interesting feature of the output results is a consistent difference

in the explanatory power of the nominal GNP and money equations. Holding

constant the sample period, the LSW equations fit       better   for money "surprises"
than   for nominal GNP "surprises," whereas the NRH—GAP equations fit better
                                                  17
for nominal   GNP change than for money change.        'Why? Two related

conjectures appear to account for this pattern. First, anticipated changes

in velocity "matter", thus accounting for the better performance of the NRH—GAP

equations   using nominal GNP growth as an explanatory variable. Second, the

nominal GNP equation used to estimate y does a better job than Barro's

equation used to estimate m. Small's research (1978) has shown that

Barro treats as unanticipated important instances of money change that could

have been anticipated by economic agents at the time. If anticipated changes

in money influence real output, as implied by the three right—hand columns

of Table 4, then much of the explanatory power of Barro's "money surprise"

variable may actually represent the influence of anticipated monetary changes.

If we accept the implication that Table 3 is a preferable comparison of the

LSW and 1RE—GAP hypotheses, because Barro's money equation used to create

   in Table 4 is misspecified, then we can regard the poor performance of


the LSW equations in columns (1) and (2) of Table 3 as analogQus to the
                                                                            21



poor performance of Small's (1978) unemployment equation when an improved

specification of m is used.         The conclusion that the equations in Table

4 are tnisspecified would also explain the inconsistent pattern of coefficients

on   the Nixon control and foreign price variables in that table.


4. INTERPRETATIONS OF THE RESULTS


     Virtually none of the conclusions of Barro's three papers (1977) (1978) (1979)
emerge intact when viewed from the perspective of Tables 1 through 4.
           1.     According to Barro, "the hypothesis that forms the basis of
this   empirical study is that only unanticipated movements in money affect

real economic variables like the unemployment      rate or the level of output"
(1977,   p. 101, emphasis added). Yet Table 4 provides equations in which

the real output gap depends on both anticipated and unanticipated money

changes.        Further, not only does Table 4 deny that only unanticipated money

changes matter, but also it contains the finding that current money surprises

do not matter at all in explaining real output.

           2. Barro (1978, pp. 565—6) states as a "basic hypothesis" that

"perceived movements in the money stock . .      . imply   equiproportionate, con-

temporaneous movements in the price level." Yet Table 2 strongly rejects

this basic hypothesis and finds instead that the contemporaneous response

of price change to perceived movements in money, holding constant the

influence of past monetary surprises, has an elasticity of only 0.05, and

to perceived movements in nominal GNP an elasticity of only 0.14. Approxi-

mately seven years is required for the full equiproportionate adjustment

to take place.

Barro—Rush (1979, Table 1, column 2) quarterly results find a significant

impact on real output of government spending, whether anticipated or not.

Table 3 confirms a role for changes in velocity, whether caused by policy

or nonpolicy influences, in that the versions of the NRB—GAP equations

using nominal GNP fit considerably better than those using only monetary

changes (see footnote 17).

            4. Barro claims (1978, p. 573) that "there is no indication from

these calculations of a downward effect of controls on the price level."

Yet Tables 2 and 3 report the consistent result that the Nixon controls

held down the price level by a statistically significant 2.1 percent,

almost exactly the same as my most recent published estimate (1977, p. 263).

Barro makes no mention in his quarterly estimates of other supply shift

elements that might have affcted real output and the price level, but

Tables 2 and 3 report a significant and consistent impact of a proxy for

the influence of foreign prices on U. S. domestic prices.

            5. Barro—Rush (1979) admit "some lack of robustness in the

price equation" and the possibility of "some misspecification of this

relation." Several of their variables lose significance when a correction

for serial correlation is performed, and the lagged effects of money

"surprises" in the price equation are not consistent with those in the

output equation. In contrast the NRH—GAP inflation equation in Table 2, column (3),

yields parameter estimates that are almost identical with those estimated

in the NRH—GAP output equation (Table 3, column 3). The respective mean

lags in response to past price changes are almost identical——9.4 and 9.9

quarters.

5. CONCLUSIONS


      The finding in this paper that fully anticipated changes in nominal

GNP and money influence real output appears to reinstate the orthodox view

that "changes in money matter in the short run, whether anticipated or not."

The "pure" version of the LSW hypothesis that relates the output gap only to

current surprises in money or nominal GNP seems to be decisively rejected.

A modified LSW approach is developed in which constructed "surprise"

variables have a statistically significant impact on real output when entered

as a long distributed lag, a lagged effect that has been rationalized

recently in theoretical models developed by Lucas (1975) and Blinder and

Fischer (1978). Thus this paper does not purport to claim that lagged

surprises have no influence on real output.

      No such claim is made because no such claim is necessary. Once it has

been shown, as in this paper, that fully anticipated changes in nominal GNP

and money do influence real output, then the role of past unanticipated

changes ceases to be an interesting question. Lucas, Sargent, and Wallace

are, after all, the proponents of the dogmatic and radical position that the

set of factors X that influence real output can be subdivided into Xl

and X2, and that only Xl matters. All that is necessary to refute this

position is to show that X2 also matters, as in this paper. The finding of

statistically significant effects of lagged surprises is of no importance

because the orthodox view of stabilization policy is completely compatible

with a role for innovations in nominal income as a determinant of the real

output gap.
                                                                         24


       In this sense the present debate contains the same asymmetry as

the early 1960s debate over whether "only money matters." Nonmonetarists

in that episode felt that they could rest their case by showing that

fiscal policy also matters, since they viewed positive effects of monetary

policy as consistent with their position. In the same way, proponents of

the NRH—GAP approach can rest their case by showing that anticipated

nominal GNP changes also matter,, since they view a positive impact of

unanticipated changes as consistent with their position.

       An important theme running through recent discussions of the short—run

and long—run neutrality hypotheses is the difficulty of identifying the

structure of an economic model from aggregative time series data, because

several models may be compatible with a time—series dependence of, for

instance, nominal GNP growth on lagged monetary changes (Sargent, 1976).

More informally, "you can't get a structure out of a time series." For

this reason there can be no pretense in this paper that the apparent time—

series dependence of real output on current and lagged fully anticipated

changes in money can identify the particular structural model that introduces

inertia into the process of price adjustment. For instance, there is no

necessity to tie the NRH—GAP hypothesis to any particular model of implicit

contracts, layoffs, or customer markets, any more than Barro is required to

identify the particular theory that allows his lagged monetary surprises to

influence real output.

       Whether or not one is satisfied with the underlying theory of

Lucas supply functions or price inertia is quite irrelevant in the current

asymmetric debate. Instead an appeal to the facts is both necessary and
                                                                          25


sufficient to settle the issue. The Sargent (1976) "observational

equivalence" conundrum does not prevent a choice between the LSW and

NRH—GAP approaches, even though both hypotheses implicitly make real

output and price change a function of a distributed lag of past nominal

GNP or monetary change, because the LSW alternative requires for its

validity strong restrictions that can be statistically rejected (e.g.,

that the coefficient on anticipated nominal GNP change of price change is

unity and of real output is zero, holding constant past monetary surprises).

       In all of this the roles of price flexibility and rational

expectations have been frequently confused by economists writing on the

short—run neutrality issue. The rational expectations hypothesis can be

interpreted as stating that "people respond to processes in the economy."

If one of those processes with which people are familiar is the three—year

staggered wage contract, then a rational expectation of the inflation rate

will be based at least partly on the past history of prices to which the

present rate of price change is mechanically connected. Many economists

who have readily adopted the assumption that agents are completely rational

seem curiously reluctant to accept the parallel assumption that agents act

in their own self interest. Instead of dismisaing models of disequilibrium

price adjustment as involving "a failure of agents to realize perceived

gains from trade," economists should devote more serious attention to the

possibility that existing contractual arrangements may represent an efficient
                                                            18
response to uncertainty and the real costs of bargaining.

       It is hard to avoid the conclusion that the earlier Barro of

gradual price adjustment and quantity constraints as at last emerged
                                                                        26

                                                               19
triumphant over the more recent classical equilibrium Rarro.        It now

appears fruitless to continue to promote a set of dogmatic propositions that

"X2 does not matter" while hiding ostrich—like from the pervasive reality

of price inertia that invalidates those propositions. Instead, a much more

productive line of research would be to provide a convincing theoretical

explanation of price inertia itself, as well as variations in the inertia

parameter across markets, countries, and time. Precisely what factors

explain why some products are bought and sold in spot auction markets, while

other products have prices that are administered and changed infrequently?

Why was the post—1973 division of nominal GNP between price and output change

more favorable in Germany than in the U. S.? Why was the same division more

favorable between 1929 and 1933 in Europe than in the U. S.? What are the

sources of the U. S. institutions of staggered and decentralized
                                                                    long—term

wage contracts, with only partial cost—of—living escalation, and what factors

have caused changes in those institutions and thus in the U. S. price inertia

parameter?

         1. The first half of the present paper by Robert Barro and Mark

 Rush (1979) presents a suiary and extensions of a previous paper (1978)

 based on annual data; the second half contains estimates of some of the

 same equations for quarterly data. Since the present paper does not

 contain an explicit statement of the hypotheses being tested, nor of the

alternative hypotheses that are implicitly rejected, the discussant is

forced to refer back to the earlier Barro papers (1977) (1978). These

comments treat together the combined results of the three papers.

         2. Perfect price flexibility, necessary for the LSW hypothesis

to be valid, would insulate real output from any anticipated shock. For

instance, the 1974 quadrupling of the price of oil, while it would reduce

the "natural" level of output, could have not effect on the gap between

actual and "natural" output, once the price hike was announced.

         3. This would include a series of papers by the conference organizer,

e.g., Fischer and Cooper (1973).

         4. See Nordhaus (1975).

         5. Thus I was startled to read in Blinder's comment (1979), that

"...Key-nesians have been searching for an obvious flaw in [Barro's]

methodology. That one has not been found suggests that the basic flaw,

if indeed there is one, is far from obvious." The present comment argues

that the flaw is patently obvious——Barro's equations are simply irrelevant

in determining the role of anticipated changes in policy, because his

specification cannot distinguish the LSW hypothesis from the competing

price—inertia hypothesis on which the orthodox view of stabilization policy is

based.
                                                                                      30

         6.   Table 2 of the quarterly Barro—Rush (1979) results exhibit a

 six—year     adjustment lag in the price equation when no correction is made
 for serially correlated residuals, and a four—year          lag in the equations

 reestimated with an adjustment for second—order serial correlation.

         7. Barro's text explicitly denies any connection between the long

 price—adjustment lags and "explanations for price stickiness of the

 'disequilibrium' or contracting variety." This denial appears to rest

 entirely on the discrepancy between the adjustment lags in the output

 and price equations. Yet there is another explanation of the inconsistent

lags, namely his misspecificatjon of both the output and price equations

 (see   below).
         8. The Barro—Rush results thus provide the needed refutation        of the
erroneous     criticism of my (1975) conclusions that appears in Barro       (1978,   p. 571):
"The effect of anticipated money movements on
                                                        the price level can be
virtually     instantaneous at the same time that unanticipated movements .

affect   the price level only with a long lag." Far from being instantaneous,

the full response of prices to an anticipated monetary change in Barro—Rush

requires a time span of 23 quarters.

        9. In the following, upper—case letters represent levels of the

logs of variables, and lower—case letters represent their percentage rates

of change. Equation (1) can be compared to the supply function used in the

discussion of the LSW hypothesis in Barro—Fischer (1976, p. 157):


               (a)         =         —
                                                    +
                               a(P       Et(P+i))
In   (a) output decisions depend on a discrepancy between this period's price
level and the expected price level next period, with intertempora]. speculation
                                                                                31


as the motive for the supply response. Since Barro's present empirical work

revolves around an unanticipated discrepancy between this period's actual

money supply and the expectations for this period based on information

available last period, the underlying supply function must be:


             (b)           =       — E_i(P))   + ct


This is the version of the Lucas supply function considered by Blinder

and Fischer (1978, P. 3).      The use of (b) implies an assumption of

imperfect Information about the aggregate price level in the current period

by individual agents. Then (1) in the text follows from (b) when we

define:

             Pt =      —
                                   and
                                            p Ei(Pt) —
     10.   Notice that if the output gap depends only on current price

surprises, with no influence of the history of the output gap, so

that e1=o (i=l,...,03), then equation (6) reduces to: p =
                                                              m+ v —          + Ht_l.
Thus, if a positive monetary surprise in period t—1 had caused a positive

output gap, then a rational expectation of a perfectly flexible price level

in period t would make an allowance for the extra price "jump" needed to

eliminate the previous gap.

      11. The parameter b in (9) is not necessarily identical to         in (1'),

because    is an uncertain parameter that shifts in response to structural

changes and past policy actions, as suggested by Lucas (1976). Thus b

represents an estimate of the unknown .

     12.   The sample period ends in 1975:Q4, the final observation provided

by Carison (1977) for the dependent variable. The starting date of 1954:Ql
                                                                             32


in this and subsequent tables is motivated by the need to use up to 28

quarters of information on lagged values of nominal GNP, expected nominal

GNP, unexpected nominal GNP, and the GNP deflator.

      13.   In, this and subsequent tables, only two variables are included

to represent supply shifts.        The Nixon control dummy is defined so

that its coefficient indicates the cumulative effect on the level of

prices during the period 1971:Q3—1972:Q4, and it is constrained to force

the effect of the removal of controls in 1974 exact!Ly to balance the

initial restraining effect (see note c, Table 1). The foreign price

variable tests the hypothesis that U. S. prices of exports and import

substitutes respond to foreign prices. In my current research I have also

found that other supply shift variables, including changes in the effective

minimum wage rate and in various tax rates, have significant effects on the

rate of change of U. S. prices. The limited scope of this paper prevents

an exploration of the full set of supply shift variables.

            In Table 1 the dependent variable for quarter t is the Livingston

forecast made in the last month of the quarter for the price level six months

later. Thus the equations in columns (1) and (2) assume that the forecasters

know the actual values of nominal GNP   and   the money supply through quarter

t—1, and that they are able to make an accurate estimate of the output gap

in quarter t. Given the persistence of the output gap demonstrated in

Table 3 below, an ability to guess H correctly in the middle of the current

quarter seems reasonable.

      14. A 28—quarter lag distribution (the current quarter and 27 lagged

quarters) was the maximum length used in this study.

      15. Just as the Bar.ro-Rush unemployment equations in their Table 1
                                                                            33




ignore 1947 and 1948 because of the peculiar relation between output and

unemployment during that interval, the present paper omits 1947 and 1948

from the output gap equations.

      16. Note that the equation has other desirable features, despite

the presence of the lagged dependent variable, particularly the consistency

of the estimated coefficients between Tables 2 and 3.

      17. The respective standard errors for the shorter 1954—78

sample period for the five equations in Table 3 when money is inserted

in placeof nominal GNP are, respectively:

                     (1)     (2)      (3)       (4)         (5)

                 .0264      .0187    .0080     .0117       .0075

and Lilien (1978).

Notes to Table 1


       a. The dependent variable is the six—month expected change in the CPI,
from   Carison (1977, Table 1), with alternate quarters interpolated from the
reported data.

       b. Each equation also contains a constant term.

       c. The independent variables are as follows:

            ;e           Fitted value of the quarterly rate of change of nominal
                         GNP, see equation (   in the text.

                         Fitted value of the quarterly rate of change of Ml,
                         using the Barro—Rush quarterly money supply equation.

                        Price Index.

                        The percentage GNP gap (log      — log Q), where   is
                        real GNP, and Q is taken from Cordon (1978, Table B—2)
                         for the period 1947—70 and from Perloff—Wachter (1978) for
                         the period 1971—78.

           NIXCON       A dummy variable set equal to 1/6 during the six quarters
                        1971:Q3 through 1972:Q4 and to —1/4 during the four
