                                         ABSTRACT

From decompositions of U.S. federal fiscal accounts from 1790 to 1988, we describe differences
and patterns in how expenditure surges were financed during 8 wars between 1812 and 1975.
We also study two insurrections. We use two benchmark theories of optimal taxation and
borrowing to frame a narrative of how government decision makers reasoned and learned about
how to manage a common set of forces that bedeviled them during all of the wars, forces that
included interest rate risks, unknown durations of expenditure surges, government creditors' debt
dilution fears, and temptations to use changes in units of account and inflation to restructure
debts. Ex post real rates of return on government securities are a big part of our story.

1        Introduction
This paper describes an extended exercise in pattern recognition; or is it pattern imposition?
We construct and interpret accounts that measure fiscal choices and some of their consequences
during and after 10 surges of government spending that were associated with eight major U.S. wars
and two insurrections, seeking to spot similarities and differences across these surges. We don't
pretend to "let the data speak for themselves"1 and admit that our interpretations are shaped by
the economic theories described in section 2 and an accounting scheme that we describe in section
3. The section 3 decompositions of government budgets are designed to make contact with the
section 2 theories.
        Wartime surges in government expenditures have always provoked debates about how to pay
for them. Those debates inspired classic theoretical contributions about the optimal mix of
debt and taxes and whether the mix matters at all. The origin of theories of optimal tax-
borrowing policies in those debates is an element of our defense against a Butterfieldian charge
of inappropriate presentism (interpreting the past from a perspective and with information not
available to those who acted in history). Statesmen who made the tax and borrowing decisions
studied here had purposes and theories in mind, intellectual forces that will be important parts of
our story. Therefore, we are naturally ambivalent about whether our section 2 theories are to be
viewed as normative (how things should be) or positive (how things are). We use the theories both
ways because key historical actors sometimes used them as rationalizations of their proposals. A
poster child for this point of view is the coincidence of recommendations of the Barro (1979)
model with Secretary of Treasury Albert Gallatin's 1807 Report as well as subsequent actions of
Gallatin and his successors.

       We appreciate Gary Becker's 1962 view that constraints alone go a long way in explaining
patterns in outcomes, regardless of decision makers' purposes or their rationality. When we
spot differences across our 8 + 2 wartime expenditures, our theories naturally direct us to ask
how much of these are to be explained by decision makers' purposes or their constraints or
their understandings, i.e., their theories. We describe the expenditure surges sequentially and
note decision maker's evolving understandings. Memories of how the Continental currency that
had financed the War of Independence from Great Britain had eventually depreciated to one
penny on the dollar prompted War of 1812 decision makers to take steps to avoid that outcome.
Noncallable Federal bonds issued to pay for the Mexican War appreciated in value after the war
when interest rates fell, creating ex post regrets that the bonds had not been bundled with call
options, something that the Union would do early in the Civil War. Rising nominal interest
rates after World War I delivered nominal capital losses to owners of the Liberty Bonds that had
been used to finance the war, teaching Captain Harry Truman a lesson that he would remember
when as President he insisted that the Treasury and Federal Reserve manage interest rates after
World War II to prevent that from happening again. We recount many other instances of later
statesmen learning from what came to be recognized as mistakes during past wars. Prevailing
understandings evolved about how government securities should be designed and marketed; about
types of taxes to be imposed; and about the roles of the legal restrictions such as price controls
and portfolio restrictions recommended by Keynes (1940) and formalized by a theory of Bryant
and Wallace (1984). Statisticians tell us that the only things we can learn about are parameters
of a necessarily restricted model, so perhaps it is excusable that we see successive government
authorities processing information about past government expenditure surges in order to modify
and refine their theories. (See the words written by Secretary McAdoo in the first paragraph of
section 6.5.)
       This brings us to a difficulty that we want to acknowledge. As we watch policy makers over
two centuries confronting their predicaments by combining their recollections of histories with
their theories, we'll see them struggle over and over again with the same forces. These include
roll-over risks associated with unanticipated changes in market conditions and interest rates that
bedevil decisions about the maturity structure of debt to sell; issues about units of account in
which to denominate coupon and principal payments; interactions between banking and fiscal
policies; temptations to default; and issues forced on them by prospective government creditors
incentives to delay supplying credit in anticipation of better terms in the foreseeable future.2 We
admit that the section 2 benchmark models that frame this paper omit or oversimplify almost all
   2
    But notice how our Lucas-Stokey (1983) benchmark model refines our Barro (1979) model by allowing returns
on government debt to be state-contingent, a feature that we'll use to interpret evidence on postwar returns to
government creditors. There have been many subsequent refinements of this type of model. For example, Pouzo and
Presno (2016) studies defaults to government creditors as a way to provide some state-contingency with interesting
incentive effects.

of these forces, something that we'll try to keep in mind as we describe and interpret our 8 + 2
wartime expenditure surges in sections 4, 5, 6, and 7.

1.1    Reader's guide
Section 2 describes the two classic models of wartime finance that frame our analysis, one that
we attribute to Gallatin (1837) and Barro (1979), the other to Lucas and Stokey (1983). We
compare the composition of financing across wars extending from the American Revolution to
Vietnam. Our analysis differs from previous studies in some important ways. Consistent with our
benchmark theories, we measure government debt at its market value rather than its par value
and we measure returns to bondholders in terms of ex post holding period returns instead of with
the government's accounting measure of interest payments on its debt. In addition, we use GDP
growth and inflation to help account the real debt burden relative to GDP.
    In most wars, we see evidence of Gallatin-Barro tax smoothing (i.e., tax responding much less
than one-for-one with spending), but only during the Civil War do we see a close approximation to
the split between taxes and debt that the model recommends for a purely temporary expenditure
surge. We also see negative wartime bond returns followed by positive postwar returns in the
War of 1812, the Civil War, World War I and the Korean War as prescribed by the Lucas-Stokey
model. But we note this model directs that bondholders should receive an immediate capital loss
at the outbreak of a war. We observe that only in the Korean War. To implement that Lucas-
Stokey recommendation there had to be a sufficiently large outstanding stock of debt at the time
of the wartime surge in government spending. At the starts of several wars (e.g., the Mexican
War, Civil War, World War I), the U.S. had little debt. So for these wars, the Lucas-Stokey
action would not help the government's financial situation.3 In section 6 we discuss how Congress
and Treasury secretaries experimented and innovated with various debt designs and management
policies to induce potential investors to purchase bonds early in wars despite fears of wartime
capital losses.
    We detect some notable patterns. Over time, from the War of 1812 to the Vietnam War, the
U.S. has financed a larger share of wartime spending with taxes and a smaller share with debt.
Seignorage contributed a significant share of revenue in the Civil War, World War I, World War
II and the Korean War. Over time, post-war real returns paid to bondholders have declined.
After four majors wars, the War of 1812, the Civil War, World War I and World War II, average
annual returns to bondholders were 12.0%, 8.5%, 5.5% and -1.4%, respectively. We decompose
changes in the debt/GDP ratio. We find that the U.S. didn't simply grow out of its World War
   3
     It is ironic that we only see these Lucas-Stokey start-of-war losses during the Korean War. President Harry
Truman, was determined to ensure that returns on government debt was risk free ­ not state-contingent. For
example, during the war he tried to make sure the Fed and Treasury kept the nominal yield curve fixed. However,
he had limited control over the price level. Prices rose at the start of the Korean War generating the negative real
returns.

II debt. While GDP growth certainly played an important role, other forces also contributed.
Inflation eroded between one-third and one-half of the debt, and primary budget surpluses also
contributed. From the War of 1812 to World War II, there was a democratization of U.S. Treasury
debt. We emphasize two forces that drove this extension of the Treasury market from the nation's
elite to broad range of investors: (i) as wars became more expensive, the Treasury wanted to raise
more funds than banks and investment houses, particularly in the northeast, seemed eager to
supply at prices acceptable to the Congress and Treasury; and (ii) Treasury secretaries and others
viewed broad-based purchases of debt as an indicator of patriotic support for a war.4 While this
expansion of Treasury ownership might have resulted in increased political support to service the
debt, we find that as federal debt became more widely held, postwar returns fell.
        After studying eight wars, we compare the funding of two insurrections: the American colonists'
war of secession from the British Empire from 1775 to 1873 and the Confederate States of Amer-
ica's (CSA) failed attempt to secede from the United States in the early 1860s. Both rebel
governments had limited access to taxation and thus funded their armed forces largely through
debt and seignorage, but the timing of their issues of debt and money differed. The Continental
Congress funded the first half of the American Revolution, from 1775 to 1780, almost exclusively
through seignorage while it financed the second half by borrowing in the form of commissary and
quartermaster certificates and other ad hoc I.O.U.s. Initially, the CSA financed their efforts with
a greater mix of debt; as the war progressed the CSA relied more heavily on seignorage.
        In section 8, we conclude this paper by offering qualifications involving the draft and other
issues of fairness. We also note that while Treasury secretaries have viewed widespread purchases
of debt as a sign of patriotic support for a war effort, contemporary op-ed writers and political
scientists viewed higher taxes as a better way to signal broad-based support. Appendix A describes
our accounting system while appendix B tells data sources.


2        Two Theories of War Finance
As benchmarks, we use two classic models of about how a government optimally finances wartime
surges of government expenditures, one due to Barro (1979), the other to Lucas and Stokey
(1983). Both models are about how a government ought to adjust tax collections and government
borrowing in response to random government expenditure shocks. The models differ in how much
fiscal shock absorbing is done by adjusting tax collections and how much is done by adjusting ex
post returns to government creditors and quantities of government debt. In our Barro model, fiscal
shocks permanently affect both tax collections and government debt but leave ex post returns on
government debt unaffected. Whether tax collections or government debt adjusts more depends
    4
   There were bumps along this road. For example, falling bond prices immediately after World War I soured
many new investors on U.S. Treasuries. In response, in World War II the Treasury created non-marketable savings
bonds and fixed the yield curve.


                                                      5
on how permanent are the shocks to government expenditures, with tax collections adjusting
relatively more the more permanent are the shocks. So in the Barro model, a war that is expected
to be short should be financed more by borrowing while a war expected to be long should be
financed more by raising taxes. In our Lucas-Stokey model, regardless of how persistent they are,
fiscal shocks leave government tax collections completely unaffected but affect ex post returns to
government creditors.
       Our Barro (1979) model assumes that a government can trade only risk-free one-period bonds
each period, while our stripped down Lucas and Stokey (1983) model allows a government to
trade a complete set of one-period Arrow securities. Interest rates are exogenous in both models.5
We make the models be as close as possible to each other by setting state-contingent prices in
our Lucas-Stokey model so that the return on risk-free one-period debt is the same as it is in the
Barro model.
       In both models, a government seeks to minimize the intertemporal loss functional
                                                                 
                                       L({Tt }t=0 }) = E [           t (Tt )]|z0                                 (1)
                                                              t=0


where Tt is total tax collections at time t, (Tt ) = Tt2 ,   (0, 1) is a discount factor, and E [·|z0 ],
is a mathematical expectation conditional on a vector z0 of information about future government
expenditures that is available at time 0. Government expenditures {Gt }t=0 are a scalar stochastic
process that is a function of a Markov state zt so that

                                                 Gt = G(zt )                                                     (2)
                                               zt+1  (zt+1 |zt )                                                 (3)

where (zt+1 |zt ) is a Markov transition probability distribution defined on the time invariant
state-space Z . In both models, an important role is played by the conditional expectation of the
present value of future government expenditures P V Gt defined as
                                                                        
                                                          
                                         P V Gt = E               t Gt+j  |zt                                    (4)
                                                          j =0

                                                 = H (zt )                                                       (5)

    Barro assumed an exogenous interest rate just as we do, but Lucas and Stokey did not. They analyzed a
closed economy in which government tax and debt management policies influenced equilibrium state-contingent
prices. An important part of their theorizing was how a benevolent government optimally uses its knowledge of
equilibrium private sector decision rules to manipulate state-contingent prices and associated ex post returns on its
state-contingent debt. Our simplified Lucas-Stokey model completely shuts down that interest-rate manipulation
motive and instead focuses on how the government takes advantage of the opportunity to trade securities whose
payoffs are contingent on realizations of the government expenditure process.



                                                          6
where the function H (zt ) satisfies the functional equation

                           H (zt ) = G(zt ) +     H (zt+1 )(zt+1 |zt )dzt+1

                                 = G(zt ) + E [H (zt+1 )|zt ].                                   (6)

   Our two models share the loss function (1) and are distinguished only by the budget constraints
that confront the government at times t  0. In our version of the Barro (1979) model, the
government faces
                                      Tt + at = R-1 at+1 + Gt                                    (7)

where R is a gross rate of interest on one-period risk-free loans that following Barro we assume
is constant over time and equal to  -1 . Here at is a risk free claim on time t goods that the
government purchased at time t - 1 for t  1 or was endowed with at time t = 0. At time t, the
government purchases risk-free claims at+1 of time t + 1 goods. Thus, government risk-free debt
coming into period t is -at .
   In our simplified Lucas and Stokey (1983) model, at time t  1 the government faces the
budget constraint
                         Tt + at-1 (zt ) = Gt +    qt (zt+1 |zt )at (zt+1 )dzt+1                 (8)

where the density at-1 (zt ) represents a claim on time t goods contingent on the time t Markov
state zt that the government purchased at t - 1 and qt (zt+1 |zt ) is a pricing kernel that encodes a
complete list of time t prices of one-period ahead Arrow securities. We assume that the pricing
kernel is time-invariant and given by

                                     qt (zt+1 |zt ) = (zt+1 |zt )                                (9)

so that for t  1 budget constraint (8) becomes

                                 Tt + at-1 (zt ) = Gt + E [at+1 |zt ]                           (10)

and at time 0 is
                                    T0 + a0 = G0 + E [a1 |z0 ].                                 (11)

where a0 is an exogenous endowment of claims on time 0 goods owned by the government. Ex-
pression (9) for the pricing kernel tells how state-contingent prices discount the future through 
and discount unlikely events through the conditional probability density (zt+1 |zt ).
   The ex post gross return on the government's asset portfolio at (zt+1 ), zt+1  Z as a function




                                                  7
of the realized time t + 1 Markov state zt+1 is

                                                           at (zt+1 )
                                     Rt (zt+1 |zt ) =                      .                             (12)
                                                        E (at (zt+1 )|zt )

The conditional expectation of the return on the government portfolio is then

                                          ERt (zt+1 |zt )|zt =  -1 ,                                     (13)

which equals the one-period return on a risk-free claim on time t + 1 output in the Barro model.

2.1    Optimal Tax-Borrowing Plan: Barro's model
For Barro's model, a decision rule for collecting taxes that minimizes loss criterion (1) subject to
the sequence of government budget constraints (7) is the following function of zt and at

                                         Tt = (1 -  )[P V Gt + at ]
                                            = (1 -  )[H (zt ) + at ]                                     (14)

that has the implication that tax collections follow a random walk

                                               ETt+1 |zt = Tt                                            (15)

and that government assets at are a unit root process that is cointegrated with government assets.6

2.2    Optimal Tax-Borrowing Plan: Lucas and Stokey's model
For our version of the Lucas-Stokey model, a decision rule for tax collections that minimizes
criterion (1) subject to the sequence of budget constraints (8) completely smooths tax collections
across time and states so that
                                                  Tt = T0                                                (16)

where a state-contingent asset-purchasing strategy supports this tax collection policy, namely,

                                                                        1
                                at-1 (zt ) = a(zt , T0 )  H (zt ) -       T0 .                           (17)
                                                                       1-

2.2.1   Two state Markov example

Let's do an example in which z follows a two-state Markov chain in which state 1 denotes peace
                                                         .9 .1
and state 2 denotes war. Let G(1) = .5, G(2) = 1.2, P =         , and  = .96. Ex post returns
                                                         .6 .4
                                                                                                                            1.052 .949

the return when st+1        = j and st = i. Figure 1 shows outcomes for a realization of Markov states
of two peace times followed by a three year war that commences in period 2 and ends after period
5 and is not followed by a subsequent war during the following periods in the sample. The orange
line in the middle panel depicts at-1 (zt ) realized along the sample path, while the red line depicts
E [at (zt+1 )|zt ], today's value of the government's portfolio of Arrow securities that will pay off
tomorrow. The panel on the right shows cumulative ex post gross returns on the government's
portfolio of debts in our Lucas-Stokey model along a sample path. It displays negative gross
returns during the war and positive gross returns during peace time.

2.2.2   Continuous state Markov example

Here we let the Markov state zt be continuous and consist of zt = g1t g2t                                                                                      where g1t follows a
random walk and g2t is white noise:
                                                                     Gt = g1t + g2t                                                                                                                       (18)

where

                                                            g1,t+1 = g1t + 1 w1,t+1
                                                            g2,t+1 = 2 w2,t+1                                                                                                                             (19)




                                                                                9
where wt+1 = w1,t+1 w2,t+1  N (0, I ). Thus, the shock 1 w1,t+1 has permanent effects on
government expenditures while the shock 2 w2,t+1 has purely transitory effects. What do these
government expenditure shocks do to tax collections and government debt according to our two
benchmark models? For our Barro model, the optimal decision rules imply

                                   Tt+1 - Tt = 1 w1,t+1 + (1 -  )2 w2,t+1
                                    at+1 - at = -2 w2,t+1                                       (20)

so that a permanent expenditure shock 1 w1,t+1 leads to a permanent increase in tax collections
by the amount of the shock and no increase in government debt, while a purely temporary shock
2 wt+1 leads to a permanent increase in government debt in the amount of the shock and a
permanent increase in tax collections of (1 -  ) times the amount of the shock, an increase that is
just sufficient permanently to service the increase in interest payments on the government debt.
      These outcome indicate how the Barro model confirms Treasury Secretary Albert Gallatin's
1807 prescription that in the event of a war, tax rates should be set to ...

        provide a revenue at least equal to the annual expenses on a peace establishment, the
        interest on the existing debt, and the interest on the loans which may be raised ...
        losses and privations caused by war should not be aggravated by taxes beyond what
        is strictly necessary.7

      In the "pure Gallatin" case that the surge in government expenditures is thought to be tem-
porary (a war is forecast to be short), the increase in government spending is nearly all financed
by borrowing with taxes increasing by just enough to cover the interest expenses on new debt. In
figure 2, we plot paths of taxes and debt in response to one-time purely transitory 50% increase in
government spending. Most of the increase in government spending is absorbed through a perma-
nent increase in debt, while the remaining part of the increase is absorbed through a permanent
increase in taxes.
      For our Lucas-Stokey model, tax collections are completely smoothed across time and Markov
states, so Tt = T0 for all t  0. Calculating the fixed point of functional equation (6) yields the
linear function
                                         H (zt ) = (1 -  )-1 g1t + g2t

so that the government's optimal portfolio of state-contingent assets is

                                                                      1
                                at-1 (zt ) = (1 -  )-1 g1t + g2t -      T0
                                                                     1-
                                         = (1 -  )-1 (g1,t-1 + w1,t ) + 2 w2t                   (21)

Figure 2: The Response of Taxes and Debt to a Temporary Increase in Government Spending in
the Gallatin-Barro Model


The right side of the second line is a compact description of the shock-contingent date t +1 payoffs
that at time t the government purchases to insure itself against the two fiscal shocks.

2.3    U.S. government debt: risk-free or state-contingent?
In sections 4 and 5 below, we will use patterns presented in our benchmark models as guides
for organizing and interpreting observed spending, taxes, debt, and ex post returns during and
after eight wars. Most debt issued by the U.S. Treasury was not explicitly state-contingent debt.8
But by accepting or engineering changes in price levels, capital tax rates, and interest rates,
a government can deliver ex post state-contingent returns on its debt. Until World War II, the
U.S. government encouraged money- and bond-holding in the face of wartime inflations by promis-
ing postwar deflations. Bordo and Kydland (1995) argued that, as administered between 1880
and 1914, the gold standard facilitated making returns on a government's debt state-contingent.
During calm periods, governments on the gold standard pegged their currencies to gold. But
during a wartime fiscal emergency, gold convertibility could be suspended with the understanding
that after the war convertibility at the original par would be resumed. During a war, a govern-
ment could issue paper money and sell bonds to meet temporary spending demands, generating
wartime inflation. But to do that, a government had to sustain prospects that it would preside
over a postwar deflation that would allow it eventually to redeem those wartime debts in gold.

    Call and exchange options are notable explicit state-contingencies. Sections 6.3 and 6.5 describe call options in
Civil War era 5-20 bonds and exchange options in the early Liberty Loans issued during World War I.

3    Government Budget Constraint
In the section 2 benchmark models, a government issues only one-period interest bearing debt.
To connect those models with the full range of maturities of U.S. Treasury securities and the
                                  n     j
monetary base, let Bt-1 =         j =1 Bt-1    be the total nominal value of interest bearing government
                        j
debt at t - 1, where   Bt -1   is the nominal value of zero coupon bonds of maturity j at t - 1. The

where Gt is the dollar value of government purchases, Tt is the dollar value of taxes net of transfers,
                                                                                    j
and Mt is the stock of non-interest bearing government debt called base money. Let rt -1,t be the
net nominal return between t - 1 and t on nominal zero-coupon bonds of maturity j , so the

implicitly defines the value-weighted net nominal return rt-1,t on interest-bearing nominal gov-
ernment bonds from t - 1 to t. As we explain in Appendix A, the U.S. Treasury's series Interest
Expense on the Debt Outstanding is an accounting measure, not a value-weighted holding period
return on the debt. Consistent with our theory, in our calculations we use the value-weighted
holding period return on the portfolio of the Treasury debt to record the returns to bondholders.
    To align our measurement of debt to theory, we make two adjustments to the U.S. Treasury's
record of total public debt outstanding. First, we net out holdings by the Federal Reserve and
Government Agencies and Trust Funds. Thus, we include only government debt held by private
investors. In figure 3, we decompose the par value of the total public debt outstanding as a share
of GDP from 1776 to 2018 into these three ownership classes. Prior to World War I, nearly all
debt was held by private investors. At the end of 2018, of the nearly $22 trillion (measured at
its par value) in total debt outstanding, 26% was held in government accounts and trust funds
and 10% was held by the Federal Reserve. Second, we measure Treasury debt by its market value
rather than its par value. In Appendix A we explain how the market value of the government debt
is related to its par value. The market value takes into account differences between interest rates
and coupon rates at the time the debt is issued as well as changes in interest rates and repayment
probabilities since the debt was issued; it answers the question: how much would the government
pay if it were to repurchase the entire portfolio of privately-held debt at current market prices?
In figure 4, we plot the par value of the debt in red and market value of the debt in blue from
1776 to 2018. While the two series track each other closely over time, each series has exceeded
the other at various times.

where gt-1,t denotes the growth rate of real GDP, and t-1,t denotes the inflation rate. The two
terms on the left side are government purchases and transfers as a share of GDP and interest
payments on government debt as a share of GDP, respectively. The first three terms on the right
side record sources of government revenue as shares of GDP: taxes, new borrowing and money
creation. The next two terms record the diminution of the debt/GDP ratio due to real GDP
growth and inflation. The final term is a cross-term.

and debt relative to the prewar baseline. In columns (6)-(8), we report wartime changes in money
growth, real GDP growth, and inflation.9 The final two columns report changes in the cross term
and a sum of residuals. For each war, entries in the first row are percents of GDP, and values
in columns (4)-(10) sum to column (3). The units are percents of GDP and we sum over years;
so, for example, the total cost of the Civil War over four years was 33% of a single year's GDP.
The numbers in the second row are percentages of the sum of war-related government spending
and returns to bondholders (column (3)) accounted for by each term on the right hand side of
equation (27).
       Consider columns (4) and (5). If the net real interest rate r is 6% (so  = 1/1.06 in the section
   9
    During the War of 1812 and the Mexican War we assume that the federal government issued no fiat currency.
For the War of 1812, we treat U.S. Treasury Notes as interest bearing debt rather than currency. Though these
notes were never declared legal tender, they had several money-like attributes such as small denominations and a
small-rectangular shape. In January 1812, Albert Gallatin wrote to Congress, "Treasury notes, bearing interest,
might to a certain extent be issued, and to that extent diminish the amount to be directly borrowed. The advantage
they would have would result from their becoming a part of the circulating medium, and taking, to a certain degree,
the place of bank-notes."

2 benchmark models), and wartime spending shocks are purely temporary, then the policies in
equations (20) imply that a government that engages in Gallatin-Barro tax smoothing will finance
94% of its war costs with debt and the remaining 6% with taxes. The Barro model also implies that
the share of a government spending shock that is absorbed by taxes increases with the persistence
of the shock. For each war, in the second row of columns (4), (5) and (6) we report percentages
of total war costs (column (3)) funded by taxes, debt, and money creation. These percentages
are shaded light blue. Only the decomposition for the Civil War is in line with Gallatin-Barro
tax smoothing of a purely temporary expenditure shock: 6.8% from increased taxation, and 91%
altogether from increased debt, money growth, and inflation.
    The table reveals the striking pattern that the share of the war costs financed with taxes
increased from -32.9% in the War of 1812 to 40.8% in the Vietnam War.10 Accordingly, the share
financed with debt decreased from 148.5% in the War of 1812 to 12.9% in the Vietnam War.
The exception to these patterns was the Spanish-American War, the shortest (fighting lasted only
three months) and least costly of the eight wars.
    If a government uses Lucas and Stokey tax smoothing, then all unexpected increases in gov-
ernment spending should be absorbed by wartime decreases in returns to government creditors.
Column (2) reports the increase in nominal payments to bondholders. Column (8) reports the
increase in inflation. With the exception of the Mexican War and the Korean War, the contri-
bution of inflation is greater than the contribution of the nominal return on the debt, consistent
with bond holders earning negative wartime real returns.
    During World War II, the Treasury and the Federal Reserve pegged the yield curve. While
government creditors received positive nominal returns during the war, those returns were set
so that wartime real returns were below those that government creditors received during the five
years prior to the war.
    Clark (1931), Goldin (1980), Edelstein (2000), Rockoff (2012) and Zielinski (2016) present
alternative decompositions of U.S. war finances. Our accounts differ from theirs in two ways. First,
these previous authors attributed increases in specific items in the federal government's budget
to the war; we instead attribute to the war all deviations from a prior trend of components of the
government budget constraint. During wars, expenditures on non-military items also increased.
Second, we take into account GDP growth and inflation. For some wars, our results align with
the calculations in those previous studies. For example, for World War I, Goldin (1980, Table 1,
p. 938) finds that the total cost of the war was 41% of one year of GNP, and that taxes financed
24% of the cost while debt and money creation financed the remaining 76%; we estimate that
the cost was 37% of one year of GDP, and that taxes financed 21% and debt and money growth
financed 82% of the cost.
  10
     During the 19th century, the main source of tax revenue was tariffs. See figure 7. During both of these wars,
tariff revenue as a share of GDP fell. During the War of 1812, the U.S. went to war against its primary trading
partner. During the Mexican War, the "Walker tariff" of 1846 lowered import duties across a wide range of goods.


                                                       16
For four other wars, the differences highlight the distinction between the two methodologies.

· For the War of 1812, Goldin (1980) finds that 21% of the war was financed by taxes while
  we find that since tax revenue fell relative the peacetime baseline, making our estimate of
  the contribution from taxes negative.

· For World War II, we find that 11.5% of the war was "paid for" through real GDP growth
  and devaluation of the debt through inflation.

· For the Korean War, Goldin (1980), Ohanian (1997), Edelstein (2000), and Rockoff (2012)
  estimate that, consistent with President Truman's stated policy, the war was 100% tax fi-
  nanced. Indeed, the quantity of debt outstanding did remain virtually unchanged during
  that war. Further President Truman ran a balanced budget during the Korean War, with
  taxes rising sufficiently to cover the increase in spending. But prior to the war, the gov-
  ernment ran a primary surplus and was paying down the debt incurred during World War
  II. The budget constraint decomposition reported in table 1 and the spending and revenue
  prewar averages in table 3 records that Truman's financing of the Korean War eliminated
  the primary surplus and deferred the post-World War II paydown of the debt. We compute
  that debt and money growth financed 45.5% of the costs because the Korean War halted
  this debt paydown. That is, although the debt/GDP ratio fell during the war, this ratio
  was higher in 1954 than it would have been had the war not occurred.

· Edelstein (2000) argues that the Vietnam War was paid in part by a decrease in non-defense
  spending. Our decomposition is not designed to capture this.

                                         Table 1: Decomposition of Wartime Revenue from Equation (27)

     For each war, the elements in first row are in percent of GDP. Columns (4)-(10) sum to column (3). The numbers in the second row are percentages of
     the sum of war-related spending and returns to bondholders (column (3)) accounted for by each term on the right hand side of equation (27).
3.2      Decomposing Postwar Changes in the Debt/GDP Ratio
By rearranging equation (24), we decompose the evolution of the interest-bearing debt/GDP ratio
into contributions made by nominal returns paid on Treasury securities, GDP growth, inflation,
a cross-term, the primary deficit and seignorage.

                 Bt Bt-1                  Bt-1           Bt-1           Bt-1

                                                               Bt-1 Gt - Tt Mt - Mt-1
                                     -rt-1,t (t-1,t + gt-1,t )      +        -                                   (28)
                                                               Yt-1      Yt     Yt

       In columns (1) - (3) of table 2 we report the change in the debt-GDP ratio over the fifteen year
period following the end of the each war.11 For each war, in columns (4) - (10) of the first row, we
report components attributable to (i) nominal interest payments, (ii) GDP growth, (iii) inflation,
(iv) the primary deficit, (v) the cross-term, (vi) money growth, and (vii) a residual. Hence the
elements in columns (4) - (10) sum to column (3). Entries in the second row are percentages
changes in the debt/GDP ratio accounted for by each component.
       Except for Vietnam, the federal government reduced the debt/GDP ratio during the 12-15
year postwar period after every war, contrary to recommendations of the Gallatin-Barro and
Lucas-Stokey models.
       For each war, we highlight in light blue the largest contribution, in absolute value. For the
first six wars, from the War for Independence to World War I, the value of the U.S. dollar was
set by a bimetallic or gold standard. We see that after each of these wars, the largest forces
reducing the debt/GDP ratio were primary surpluses followed by real GDP growth. Positive
nominal returns to bondholders dampened these reductions, while changes in the price level went
both ways. After the 1790 refunding of the War for Independence debt, the Mexican War and
the Spanish-American War, inflation helped diminish the value of the debt relative to GDP. But
after the War of 1812, the Civil War, and World War I ­ three wars that brought large inflations,
postwar deflations increased values of debt relative to GDP and delivered high real returns to
government creditors.12
       Relative contributions changed during the three most recent wars.13 In contrast to the pre-
World War II period, for World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War, primary surpluses
were not the largest force pushing down the debt/GDP ratio postbellum, inflation and real GDP
growth having been more important. In particular, in the 24 months after the lifting of the World
  11
     Because our data begin in 1790, in the first row of table 2 we include the 15-year period after Treasury Secretary
Hamilton's refunding of the Revolutionary War debt.
  12
     See figure 10 later in this paper for evidence of the sharp price level increases during these three wars and Hall
and Sargent (2019, pp. 34-38) for an analysis of the post-World War I debt paydown.
  13
     Hall and Sargent (2011) provides a more complete accounting of the contributions to the evolution of the
debt/GDP ratio made by inflation, growth, and nominal returns paid on debts of different maturities for the
post-World War II period.


                                                          19
War II price controls in June 1846, the price level rose 46%, effectively inflating way nearly half
the value of the debt.14
         In the years following the Korean and Vietnam Wars, the government ran primary deficits
that helped increase the debt/GDP ratio. After the Korean War, these modest deficits were more
than offset by inflation and GDP growth so that the debt/GDP declined. In the early 1980s
Fed Chairman Paul Volker's conquest of the persistent 1970s inflation generated high returns to
government bondholders that helped push propel the debt/GDP ratio higher in the post-Vietnam
period.


4         Expenditures and Tax Revenue
In the section 2 benchmark models, responses of tax collections and government debt to an
unanticipated increase in government spending depend on the persistence of the government
spending process. In the Barro model, a permanent shock is fully tax financed while a purely
temporary shock is largely debt financed. See equations (20). In our version of a Lucas and
Stokey model, permanent shocks to government spending generate much larger (i.e., by a factor
of (1 -  )-1 ) capital gains and losses to government bondholders than do purely transitory shocks.
See equations (21).
         In figure 5, we plot U.S. federal government receipts and expenditures from 1775 to 2018. For
the Civil War, World War I and World War II, we see that during the war, government spending
rose while taxes increased much less. After the wars, government spending fell while tax revenues
remained elevated, so that the government ran a primary surplus for many years. These patterns
are consistent with the optimal tax-smoothing response to a temporary government spending
shock illustrated in figure 2. However, large U.S. wars have been followed by enduring changes in
the size and composition of government spending and taxation. These three wars were followed
by permanent rises in federal expenditures as fractions of GDP.15
         To view the long-run impact of wars on spending in more detail, figures 6 and 8 plot expendi-
ture categories defined by the federal government. In figure 6, federal spending from 1791 to 1940
is the sum of the categories Civil, Pensions, and War+Navy.16 Figure 8 splits spending into four
categories: national defense, human resources, physical resources, and other.17 Figure 6 reveals
that spending stayed higher after the War of 1812, the Civil War, and World War I, but the cate-
    14
     See figure 10f below.
    15
     Rothbard (2017, chs. 12-13) describes what he thinks were forces contributing to this outcomes after
World War I.
  16
     The category Civil includes spending on the Treasury-defined category, Indians.
  17
     As defined by the OMB, Human Resources include Education, Training, Employment, and Social Services,
Health Medicare, Income Security, Social Security, and Veterans Benefits; Physical Resources include Energy, Nat-
ural Resources and Environment, Commerce and Housing Credit, Transportation and Community and Regional
Development; Other includes International Affairs General Science, Space, and Technology, Agriculture, Adminis-
tration of Justice, and General Government.

gories that increased differed. As a share of GDP, spending on the military remained permanently
higher after the War of 1812. After the Civil War, there was a persistent increase in pension pay-
ments to Union veterans and their families, while after World War I, it was the Civil category,
which included non-transfer domestic spending, that stayed permanently higher.18 Comparing
figures 6 and 8 illustrates the enormous and permanent increase in government spending that
occurred during World War II as government spending rose from under 10% of GDP before the
war to 20% of GDP after the war.
       In figures 7 and 9, we decompose federal tax revenue into various government defined cat-
egories. Prior to the Civil War, despite periodic attempts to diversify its revenue stream, the
Treasury's primary revenue source was customs (i.e., tariff) revenue. During the Civil War, the
federal government introduced a new set of internal taxes, including a personal income tax. Al-
though many internal taxes (including the income tax) were removed shortly after war, during
the 50 years between the Civil War and World War I, Treasury revenue was roughly evenly split
between customs and internal revenue. Principal sources of these internal revenue were taxes on
liquor and tobacco. Internal revenue, especially from the income tax, surged during the Civil
War, World War I and World War II. Since the re-introduction of the income tax in 1914 and
rises in income tax rates during World War I, internal revenues have been the primary sources of
revenue for the Treasury. The Revenue Act of 1942, enacted shortly after the U.S. entered World
War II, created today's system of personal and corporate income taxes.
       Debts incurred during the War for Independence, the War of 1812, and Mexican War were
serviced with customs revenue. Debts incurred during the Civil War and Spanish-American War
were serviced with a combination of customs revenue and taxes on liquor and tobacco. Debts
  18
    Between 1917 and 1922, the federal government advanced $9.5 billion to 11 Allied countries. Although at the
time the Treasury viewed these advances as loans, they were recorded as Civil expenditures. As Hall and Sargent
(2019) report, by the early 1930s most of these foreign loans became gifts.

incurred during World War I, World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War were serviced
largely with corporate and personal income tax revenue.
         To supplement these figures with numbers, in table 3 we report average spending and revenue
as shares of GDP for the prewar, war and postwar periods for each of the eight wars. With the
exception of the Civil War and World War II (both of which were proceeded by an aggregate
economic downturn), tax revenue exceeded government spending prior to the start of the war so
that the government was running primary surpluses. During the War of 1812 and the Mexican
War, T /Y fell relative to their prewar ratios as tariff revenues dropped. For the other six wars,
consistent with tax smoothing, T /Y rose by less than the increase in G/Y . During the Korean
War and the Vietnam War, wartime tax revenue exceeded government expenditures, but surpluses
fell relative to their prewar averages. Finally note that, except for the Spanish-American War,
government spending (net of interest payments) and tax revenue as shares of GDP were higher
on average for the ten years after the war than they were for the five years prior to the start of
the war.
         For the 11 major wars in U.S. history, Edwards (2014) estimates that for every $1 increase
in spending during the war, the U.S. federal government spent another $0.50 (in present value)
over the following 80 years on transfer payments and in-kind benefits given to veterans and their
spouses and other survivors. We can match Edward's ratio of wartime/postwar spending in the
Barro model by setting  = .95 and specifying that {Gt } is a first-order autogressive process
       ¯ = (Gt - G
Gt+1 - G            ¯ ) + wt+1 with  = 0.35; in this case, equation (14) prescribes that 93%
of wartime expenditures should be debt financed with the remaining 7% tax financed. Allowing
for a realistic degree of persistence in the government spending process qualifies Albert Gallatin's
rule only modestly.19


5         Returns to Bondholders
Changes in the price level and interest rates are ways a government can deliver state-contingent
returns. A black line in each panel of figure 10 reports the natural log of the price level for
the 20 years following the start of each war. For each war, we normalize the price level by
the transformation 100 × (logPt - logPstart of war ), so the series records cumulative percentage
changes in the price level after the war's outbreak. The figures present faded lines that facilitate
quick cross-war comparisons within a single panel. In each panel, faded lines are normalized price
level series for the War of 1812 (orange), the Civil War (purple), World War I (blue), and World
War II (red).
         A black line in each panel of figure 11 reports cumulative real values coming from continually

Figure 11: Real Value of a $100 Portfolio of Treasury Securities Invested at the Start of Each War

The black line in each panel reports the cumulative real values coming from continually reinvesting in a
value-weighted re-balanced portfolio of all outstanding U.S. Treasury securities of an initial investment of $100 at
the start of each war. The faded lines are the cumulative
                                                        28values of the portfolios for the War of 1812 (orange), the
Civil War (purple), World War I (blue), and World War II (red).
reinvesting in a value-weighted re-balanced portfolio of all outstanding U.S. Treasury securities,
starting with an initial investment of $100.20 These cumulative returns are data analogs of
simulated portfolio values from the Lucas-Stokey model plotted in the right panel of figure 1. In
each panel, the faded lines are cumulative values of the portfolios for the War of 1812 (orange),
the Civil War (purple), World War I (blue), and World War II (red).
       Notice three patterns. For the War of 1812, the Mexican War, the Civil War, and World War
I, the price level rises during the war and falls after the war. (You have to squint to detect this
for the Mexican War.) See panels 10a, 10b, 10c and 10e. This pattern is consistent with the
Bordo and Kydland (1995) view of the gold standard as helping to deliver Lucas and Stokey state-
contingent returns on debt. These price level paths transmitted into wartime real capital losses
for bondholders and postwar real capital gains for bondholders. Note that the cumulative real
return series displayed panels 11a, 11b, 11c and 11e bear the "ladle" shape observed in right-hand
side panel of figure 1. (Again, you have to squint at the Mexican War panel 11b.)
       Table 4 summarizes numbers behind the graphs. The price level rose 14.70, 14.65 and 11.05
percent at annual rates during the War of 1812, the Civil War and World War I respectively,
bringing wartime real returns on Treasury debt of -10.58, -5.69 and -8.60 percent at annual rates.
During the 15 years after the war, deflations brought postwar real returns of 12.01, 8.47 and 5.52
percent at annual rates. For the Korean War, there was no postwar deflation, but we see wartime
negative and postwar positive real returns.21 We find this pattern of returns broadly consistent
with the prescription of the Lucas-Stokey model.
       A second pattern revealed by figure 11 is that postwar returns to government bondholders have
declined steadily from the War of 1812 to the Vietnam War. After the three wars fought since
the U.S. left the gold standard in 1933, postwar real returns were essentially flat. As reported
in table 4, the postwar real holding period returns fall from 12.01 percent after the War of 1812
to 8.47 percent after the Civil War to 5.52 percent after the World War I to -1.42 percent after
World War II.
       Finally, we verify two important findings by earlier authors. Panels 10c, 10e, and 10f and
numbers in table 5 confirm the finding of Friedman (1952) that prices rose more slowly during
World War II than in World War I or the Civil War. Our calculation of the nominal holding
period returns during World War II, reported in table 4, are consistent with Samuelson's (1945)
characterization of World War II as a "2-per-cent war."

portfolio between month s and s + 1 and s,s+1 is the inflation rate between month s and s + 1. Thus, the units
are start-of-war dollars.

6         Debt Design, Marketing, and Management
Since Albert Gallatin's 1807 Report, successive Secretaries of the Treasury have sought to fi-
nance wars at minimum cost to taxpayers, a motive captured by the loss function (1) for the
section 2 benchmark models. However, during the four most expensive wars as measured by their
government spending/GDP ratios, namely, the War of 1812, Civil War, and both World Wars,
the Treasury faced an additional challenge ignored by our benchmark models. At the start of
those big wars, possible government creditors anticipated the rapid expansion of Treasury debt
required to finance prospective sharp increases in military and civilian expenditures. That made
them reluctant to purchase long-term Treasury securities early in a war because they anticipated
increased rises in the price level and nominal interest rates, so postponing bond purchases offered
higher real returns.22 To respond to such behavior by prospective government creditors, members
of Congress, Treasury officials, and (after 1914) Federal Reserve officials experimented with new
debt designs, methods for selling new issues to the public, and debt management policies that
could attract early investors.
         Article 1, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution grants Congress exclusive authority to manage
Federal debt. Between 1776 and 1920 Congress authorized and designed each individual Treasury
security. For each security, Congress set the coupon rate, the principal or par value, the redemption
and maturity dates, a unit of account, tax exemptions, and call and conversion features. Congress
gradually abandoned these ways of doing things during the two decades after World War I.
Acceding to requests from successive Secretaries of the Treasury, Congress delegated more and
more authority to design securities and manage the composition of the debt to the Treasury.23
By 1939, Congress had delegated nearly all decisions about security design and debt management
to the Treasury.
         Security design and debt management policies alter the allocation of interest rate risk between
the Treasury and its creditors. Over time, innovations along both lines helped the Treasury to
expand the market for Treasury securities from just the nation's elite to a broad spectrum of
investors.
    22
      In the Barro model, the interest rate is fixed. In the Lucas-Stokey model, at the outbreak of the war, the
Ramsey equilibrium outcome awards a capital loss to existing government bondholders. Bondholders understood
this possibility when they purchased the bonds and chose to bear this risk. In return, bondholders anticipate high
returns when war ends. However, such a state-contingent policy would have been difficult to implement in practice.
With the exception of the Korean War, at the start of each U.S. war the outstanding stock of Treasury debt was low,
so imposing a one-time capital loss would not have generated much revenue. If a long spell of peace had preceded
the war, a Ramsey plan for the Lucas model would have had the government acquiring claims on the public that
it would redeem at the outset of the war.

6.1      The War of 1812
Between 1801 and 1809, President Thomas Jefferson's administration dismantled the Federalist's
administrative machinery for collecting internal revenue. Ignoring Albert Gallatin's warnings,
the Jefferson administration's embargo of trade with Britain caused customs revenues to plunge
from $16.4 million in 1808 to $7.3 and $8.5 million in 1809 and 1810, respectively. Partly as a
consequence of these and other monetary, fiscal, and military preparedness policies of the two
Jefferson and first Madison administrations, when Congress declared war on Britain on June of
1812, the U.S. was poorly prepared.
       Between March 1812 and February 1815 the Congress authorized the Treasury to issue five
long-term loans with a total face value of $66 million. Those bonds received a cautious reception
from the relatively small group of wealthy men who comprised the main pool of prospective buyers.
Opposition to the war from merchants and financiers in the Northeast and Congress's inability
to put together a sustainable prospective revenue stream sufficient to service them limited what
prospective buyers were willing to pay for these bonds. To respond to this situation, beginning
in 1813 Albert Gallatin included in invitations for bond subscriptions a promise that if later
subscribers were offered better terms, earlier subscribers would be "placed on the same footing."24
Events in 1814 forced Gallatin to honor this promise.
       Although loans issued in the previous year had sold for only $88.25 per $100 of face value, on
March 24, 1814 Congress authorized the largest increase in new Treasury debt in the nation's short
history, a $25 million loan promising a 6% coupon. In an attempt to obtain the most favorable
terms for the government, the Treasury divided the sale of this loan into three installments. In
the first installment of $10 million, a portion of the bonds were sold at $88 per $100 of face value;
but the Treasury was soon forced to sell the remainder of the installment at $80 per $100 of
face value, prompting the Treasury to issue additional shares to compensate earlier buyers. The
Treasury canceled the second and third installments. The "Ten Million Loan of 1814" raised only
$7,935,581 at the cost of increasing the face value of Federal debt by $9,919,476.25.25 Further,
this official $7.9 million figure overstates the true revenue raised because the Treasury accepted
at face as payment private bank notes whose market values were much less than par.
       Despite having issuing debt at sharp discounts during the war, after the war Congress and the
Treasury honored their financial commitments. This full repayment in conjunction with a falling
price level resulted in high postwar real returns. As we report in table 4, in the 15 years after the
war, bondholders earned on average 12% annual real returns. Also see figures 10a and 11a.

6.2      The Mexican War
When the Mexican War broke out in 1846, the U.S. government stood on much stronger financial
footing than it had three and a half decades earlier. Three decades of strong economic growth
and the credibility the U.S. Treasury earned from repaying its debts refinanced and assumed in
1790 and incurred during the War of 1812 meant that the federal government could borrow from
domestic investors on better terms than it ever had.26 To finance the war, along with two sales
of short-term notes, the Treasury issued three long-term bonds. In contrast to the War of 1812,
when the Treasury accepted depreciated private bank notes at face value, subscribers of these
Treasury bonds and notes were required to pay in specie. Even so, there was ample demand for
these bonds.
       Interest rates fell during the late 1840s. As Dewey (1912, p.256) notes

         An error in judgement was made in compelling so high a rate of interest as 6 per cent
         with long terms of ten and twenty year before maturity, for on account of business
         prosperity the bonds quickly went to a premium, and their redemption when the
         government wished to pay its debt from the surpluses enjoyed in 1850-1856 was a
         costly operation.

Memories of this "error in judgement" motivated the Treasury to sell callable bonds during the
Civil War.

6.3      The Civil War: 7-30s and 5-20s
During the U.S. Civil War, Treasury Secretary Salmon Chase made two significant innovations
in wartime finance. First, in response to the Treasury's inability after the Mexican War to
repurchase at par the non-callable debt it had issued to finance the war, Chase introduced long-
term bonds with embedded calls. Second, he extended Treasury subscriptions beyond the financial
institutions in Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York, and Boston, so that for the first time, the
federal government actively marketed government securities to middle class households throughout
the country.27 When war came in Spring 1861, the federal government was under considerable
financial stress. Tax revenues had not recovered from the drop in 1857 that coincided with a
  26
     The federal government did not possess the same credibility with international investors. Eight states and one
U.S. territory defaulted on their debts in the early 1840s. Many European investors felt that the precedent set by
the federal assumption of state debts in 1790 implied federal backing of state debts. Thus, despite the fact that the
federal government had a 50 year record of full repayment on its own debts, Joshua Bates of Barings Bank wrote
in October 1841, "At a distance people do not see the local differences and argue that as Mississippi may repudiate
her debt, so may Massachusetts, and so the credit of all the States and that of the United States is involved in one
common ruin."
  27
     McPherson (1988, pp. 428-453) and Thomson (2019) provide more complete descriptions of Union financing
during the Civil War era. See Brands (2006, ch. 3) for a fascinating account of Jay Cooke and "The Bonds of
Union".

banking panic. Further reducing revenue, fears of secession had led to a failed loan offering in
1860 and by early 1861 southern ports diverted federal customs receipts to the CSA Treasury.
    To meet war expenses, Congress authorized the Treasury to sell $250 million short-term, long-
term, and non-interest bearing securities under the "Loan of July and August, 1861." Much of
the short-term debt was in the form of three-year "7-30s" ­ Treasury notes paying an interest
rate of 7.3% with a minimum denomination of $500.28 To sell 20-year bonds, Chase continued
the long-standing practice of soliciting subscriptions from banks in northeastern financial centers
that would then resell these notes and bonds to a small circle of wealthy investors in a limited
secondary market.
    Union military defeats at Ball's Bluff and the failure of General George B. McClellan's penin-
sular campaign in the fall of 1861 followed by Treasury Secretary Chase's December request for
an additional $200 million in borrowing led to a collapse in confidence in the Union military and
Treasury. Northern banks were reluctant to purchase more Treasury securities at par, while the
Treasury was unwilling to repeat its War of 1812 policy of selling bonds below their par values.
By December 30, banks in New York, Boston and Philadelphia suspended specie payments and
the federal government quickly followed.
    There followed a strange episode involving what Simon Newcomb (1865) and other observers
regarded as a serious case of "money illusion" on the part of Federal decision makers. To enable
the Treasury to sell long term bonds at par, the Union issued a paper dollar not linked to the
gold dollar but in terms of which Treasury bonds would sell at par.29 In February 1862, Congress
passed the Legal Tender Act. The Act authorized the Treasury to $150 million in United States
notes ("greenbacks") that were to be legal tender for all public and private debts, except customs
receipts and coupon payments on federal bonds.30 Official concerns about selling Union bonds
below par were quickly assuaged when the market soon discounted a greenback relative to a
gold dollar enough that federal bonds could be sold at par for greenback dollars, as the Act had
authorized.31 The Act also authorized the Treasury to sell $500 million of "5-20s," a bond bearing
a 6 percent coupon, maturing in twenty years, and callable at par at the U.S. Treasury's discretion
after five years. Over the next six years, the Congress authorized 7 tranches of these loans. The
5-20's were the first U.S. Treasury bonds to include a call option. Over the following two decades,
the Treasury issued a sequence of partial calls. Calls were for bonds bearing particular serial
  28
     The 7.3 percent interest rate was chosen since it made it easy to compute the nominal return: 2 cents per day
for every $100 in face value.
  29
     Newcomb (1865) roundly criticized the reasoning that led to this and other aspects of how the Union financed
the war.
  30
     In 1870, the Chief Justice Chase wrote the 5-3 majority Supreme Court decision in Hepburn v. Griswold
declaring the legal tender clause unconstitutional for violating the due process clause of the 5th amendment.
Subsequent Courts soon reversed that decision in Knox v. Lee and Parker v. Davis. The great hard money Jacksonian
Democratic historian George Bancroft (1886) passionately argued that it was Hepburn v. Griswold that had been
decided correctly.
  31
     Treasury notes issued during the War of 1812 could also be used to buy Federal bonds at par.

numbers.
       To sell bonds, Chase innovated by contracting with his friend Jay Cooke to purchase bonds
as a monopolist wholesaler to distribute bonds retail.32 Cooke owned a Philadelphia investment
banking firm and was well-connected with Ohio Republican leaders. Cooke administered the first
large-scale war-bond drive by hiring a network of sales agents and placing informative and patri-
otic advertisements in newspapers to sell bonds denominations as small as ten dollars to ordinary
middle- and working-class northerners. Payments in greenbacks could be made in monthly in-
stallments. He dispatched sales agents throughout the states. Cooke's advertisements highlighted
the high returns promised by the 5-20 bonds. For example, the poster in panel 12a proclaims "At
the present premium on gold these bonds yield about eight per cent per annum."
       Congress bedeviled the 5-20s with an ambiguity that it passed on to subsequent Congresses.
The authorizing legislation provided that coupons would be paid in coin (i.e., gold), but it was
silent about whether principal would be paid in coin or "lawful money" (i.e., greenbacks). Am-
biguity about 5-20 principal payments would be resolved only with the election of U.S. Grant
as President in 1868 and the March 1869 passage of `An Act to Strengthen the Public Credit'
that promised repayment in gold or its equivalent.33 From 1866 to 1881, real returns to federal
government creditors averaged 8.5% per year. See table 4 and figure 11c.
       The U.S. Treasury designed and sold other new securities, so that by the war's end, it had
issued 19 unique interest-bearing securities and five different forms of currency. Panel 16c plots
the Treasury's debt service profile at the end of 1865. The figure shows repayment of $676 million
in principal for the 7-30s owed in 1868 and of $515 million in principal for the 5-20s of 1862 owed
in 1882. Total federal tax revenues averaged a little over $350 million per year during the two
decades after the war, so repaying all debt as it came due was out of the question. Instead, it was
rescheduled, other securities being issued to raise funds to repay wartime loans.

6.4      The Spanish-American War: 10-20s of 1908-1918
The Spanish-American War lasted for only three months in 1898. One bond was sold to finance
the war: a 3 percent, 20 year bond, redeemable after 10 years. Congress designed the "10-20s of
1908-1918" to be sold widely to small investors rather than banks. It was sold by subscription
at par in denominations between $20 to $300 with individual investors being given first priority.
Two considerations motivated this design and marketing policy. First, there remained popular
resentment over the government's relying on a J.P. Morgan and August Belmont syndicate to
  32
     Chase's actions were first steps on a process extending over succeeding wars in which Treasury Secretaries and
Congresses struggled to strike a balance between "client private placement" vs "retail" vs "wholesale" vs "auction"
vs "forced loan" financing. See the proposal of Friedman (1959, pp. 64-65) to reform the way the Treasury sold its
bonds.
  33
     Bondholders were also voters, and, evidently, Grant's electoral success benefitted from Jay Cooke's campaign
to create widespread ownership of the 5-20s.



                                                        35
underwrite 4% bonds issued three years earlier as part of the Cleveland administration's efforts to
defend the gold standard. Second, Congress intended that subscriptions should express popular
support for the war. The bond issue was oversubscribed. Garbade (2012, pp. 41-44) tells how
contemporary commentators argued that, had the 10-20s been auctioned, they would have sold
above par. Hence, the government sacrificed revenue from those bond sales to gain what it
interpreted as a popular expression of support for the war.

6.5       World War I: Options and Federal Reserve "Borrow and Buy"
To finance World War I, Secretary of the Treasury William Gibbs McAdoo studied how the Union
had during the Civil War. McAdoo (1931, p. 373) said that he "did not get much in the way
of inspiration or suggestion from a study of the Civil War, except a pretty clear idea of what
not to do." Rather than issuing 19 separate securities that had been improvised as the Civil War
had unfolded, McAdoo convinced Congress to authorize the Treasury to issue and market five
securities sequentially.
       McAdoo personally took an active role in marketing the new debt. He named the bonds "Lib-
erty Loans" rather than giving them hyphenated natural number nicknames indicating coupon
rates, maturities, and call dates. He sought to bypass middlemen, like Jay Cooke. Instead he es-
tablished national fund drives that held mass rallies to sell Liberty bonds directly and widely. He
enlisted celebrities such as Charlie Chaplin to act in short films and employed commercially suc-
cessful artists, such as Howard Chandler Christy, to illustrate posters advertising Liberty Loans.
Some of these posters now strike us as pretty heavy-handed, for example the posters in panels
12b and 12c. McAdoo (1931, pp. 378-9) described how

         We went direct to the people; and that means to everybody ­ to business men, work-
         men, farmers, bankers, millionaires, school-teachers, laborers. We capitalized on the
         profound impulse called patriotism.

       The Federal Reserve actively helped market Liberty Loans. In particular, the Fed's "bor-
row and buy" program encouraged individual investors to finance purchases of Liberty Loans by
borrowing from their local banks. The banks could discount those loans at the Fed's discount win-
dow.34 Thus, the Fed lent to member banks at a preferred discount rate so long as proceeds were
used to purchase Liberty and Victory bonds that the Fed then accepted as collateral. To finance
this program, the Fed dramatically increased the monetary base, contributing what amounted to
seignorage revenue.35 See panels 13a and 13b.
       Partially to protect its creditors from later rises in interest rates, the First and Second Liberty
Loans granted the investor the right to convert their bonds into new ones bearing higher coupon
  34
   See the various advertisements and articles in the New York Times on October 24, 1917.

Schwartz (1963), Meltzer (2010), and Hall and Sargent (2019).

rates if subsequent issues paid higher coupon rates; these new bonds had the same maturity dates
and call provisions as the original loans but bore the coupon rates and tax provisions of subsequent
issues. Interest rates and coupon rates on the Liberty Loans indeed increased as the war went
on, inducing many owners of First and Second Liberty Loan bonds to exercise their conversion
options. Of the nearly $2 billion First Liberty Bonds sold, about $560 million were converted into
higher coupon-paying bonds. Of the nearly $4 billion Second Liberty Bonds sold, nearly all were
ultimately converted.36
       Despite these conversion provisions, interest rates and consumer prices rose enough that by
June 30, 1920 prices of the Liberty Loans had fallen to between $84.64 to $90.80 per $100 of
face value. Furthermore, to take advantage of the Fed' "borrow and buy" program, many small
investors bought Liberty Loans on credit, using the bonds themselves as collateral. Thus, the
Federal Reserve had encouraged individual investors to borrow short from their bank and lend
long to the government. This leveraged position meant that when bond prices fell after the War,
many investors realized capital losses. For these losses, some blamed " . . . the wicked devices of
bond sharps and swindlers who took advantage of the inexperience of many small investors in
Liberty bonds whom the Treasury was ... powerless to protect."37 But Secretary McAdoo was less
sympathetic to these new investors; before the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of
Representatives in connection with the third Liberty bond bill, on March 27, 1918, he argued:38

         There is a curious feeling in the breast of the average man that if he buys a Government
         bond, even though he contracts to lend his money to the Government, nevertheless if
         he gets tired of his investment and wants to get his money back, that he ought to be
         able to sell the bond at par regardless of the fact that the Government is not under
         any obligation to redeem that bond before maturity. It is extraordinary the extent
         to which that feeling exists. . . . It is a perfectly unreasonable feeling, but one of the
         things we have got to reckon with.

Ultimately, real returns to owners of Liberty Loans during the fifteen years after the war were
far below those paid out during fifteen periods after the War of 1812 or the Civil War.39 See
panel 11e. This pattern opens up comparisons and interpretations taken up in detail in Hall and
Sargent (2019).
  36
     The conversion rate was lower for the First Liberty Bonds because conversion to a higher coupon bond also
meant a less favorable tax treatment.

     Again, bondholders were also voters, and these low returns came back to haunt the Democrats in the 1920 and
1924 elections. Hilt and Rahn (2018) document that relative to voting patterns prior to World War I, counties in
which citizens purchased Liberty Loans at higher rates turned away from the Democratic Party after war.

6.6       World War II: Nonmarketable Debt, Fixed Yield Curve, Fed Support
Secretary of Treasury Henry Morgenthau Jr. sought to avoid a recurrence of the deep post-World
War I losses incurred by savers who had participated in Secretary McAdoo's "borrow and buy"
program. This inspired three key innovations in markets for Treasury securities:

   1. Establishment of a non-marketable savings bond program,

   2. A Federal Reserve and Treasury joint operation to peg and flatten the term structure of
         nominal yields on federal bonds, and

   3. The Federal Reserve's policy of purchasing marketable securities rather than lending money
         to banks to finance loans to individuals who had purchased Treasury securities.

       By the late 1930s, Congress had delegated the design and management of the debt almost
completely to the Treasury. In contrast to earlier wars, federal securities that financed World War
II were designed by the Treasury and not by a Congressional committee. Secretary Morgenthau
wanted "the securities offered should be those best suited to the needs of the investors to whom
they are sold." To do that, the Treasury issued a wide range of marketable and nonmarketable
securities.
       Relative to previous wars, the Treasury issued many more types of securities. Spacings of
maturity dates were designed partly to smooth out prospective refinancings and rollovers. While
there were only four different classes of marketable securities, the Treasury's designed securities
with to meet "needs of the investors" by varying maturities, call features, and tax exemptions.
That might have promoted initial sales, but it did so by limiting liquidity in secondary markets.
       Like earlier Treasury secretaries, Morgenthau viewed successful bond sales as meaningful ex-
pressions of public support for the war. In his radio address of May 6, 1943 he said40

         When the people really become aflame with the war spirit, all other problems seem to
         solve themselves. Labor and management get together; production rises to an all time
         high; and bond sales go up automatically . . .. The sales of war bonds . . . is actually a
         barometer of the spirit and enthusiasm of the Home Front.

Consequently, Secretary Morgenthau wanted to sell federal securities to small investors. To make
that happen, he thought that he had to protect these investors against prospective declines in
prices of their bonds. In his history of Treasury financing of World War II, Morse (1971, p. 22)

         sell their bonds before maturity, that the market price had sharply declined. Bonds
         purchased for $100 often sold for as little as $82. Thousands of frugal and patriotic
         people felt that they had somehow been "swindled," and were likely to be "gun-shy"
         when again asked to buy Government bonds.

In response to those attitudes, the Treasury created a non-negotiable pure discount security, the
U.S. Savings Bond. While the investor could not transfer ownership of the bond to someone else,
he or she could redeem it on demand according to a fixed price schedule, assuring liquidity and
eliminating prospects of negative nominal returns. The Treasury promoted savings bonds through
payroll savings plans and sold them at Post Offices in denominations starting at $25. Between
May 1941 and January 1946, the Treasury sold $54.7 billion of such savings bonds to over 85
million individuals.41 In December 1945, savings bonds accounted for over 17% of the par value
of total Treasury debt.42
       Investors of marketable securities also wanted protection from rising interest rates and declin-
ing bond prices. To satisfy that preference, in 1942 the Treasury and the Federal Reserve agreed
                                                      1
to cap interest rates on long term Treasury debt at 2 2 percent and 3-month Treasury bills at 3/8
percent.43 Other rate caps were interpolated to give a smooth upward sloping yield curve; for
                                                  7
example, the rate on 1 year bills was set at      8   percent and the rate on 7 to 9 year bonds was set at
2 percent. In an attempt to limit inflation, from early 1942 until late 1946 the federal government
instituted price controls on most consumer goods. These controls worked imperfectly, but they
did slow the rate of price increases, at least according to official price indices.44
       An unintended consequence of sharply reducing interest rate risk through the interest rate and
price controls in combination with the Treasury's decision to issue a wide range of securities was
that private buyers favored long-term bonds and shunned Treasury bills. This left the Federal
Reserve to become the primary buyer of short-term Treasury securities. As in World War I, the Fed
expanded its balance sheet to support the Treasury market, but unlike the World War I "borrow
and buy" program, in World War II the Federal Reserve directly purchased these securities rather
than holding them books as collateral. See panels 13c and 13d. As figure 15a illustrates, from
1944 to 1948, the Federal Reserve held between 40 and 89 percent of outstanding Treasury bills.
Other government agencies held roughly 30 percent of the Treasury bills issued from 1944 to 1947.

     Marketable securities are negotiable and transferable and thus may be sold on the secondary market. Today,
marketable securities consist of bills, notes, bonds, and TIPS. During World War II, the Treasury did not issue
TIPS but did issue marketable certificates of indebtedness, a short-term coupon-bearing security. Non-marketable
securities such as U.S. savings bonds, special issues, debt series issued to government trust funds (e.g., OASDI,
unemployment insurance, and civil service retirement funds), are not sold on a secondary market. Total gross
debt is the sum of all marketable and nonmarketable securities, matured debt and non-interest bearing securities,
regardless of ownership. By the end of 1945, nonmarketable debt comprised 28 percent of the total gross debt
outstanding. See figure 14.

      Because the Treasury fixed the rate of return below a market clearing level, the Treasury again
resorted to bond drives. The Treasury again induced celebrities to sell bonds. Posters and films
were created. See the poster in figure 12d. Unlike Jay Cooke's Civil War advertisements, these
posters did not promise high rates of return. The sales campaign was more positive and subtle
than the ones that marketed World War I Liberty Loans.
      Inflation surged when the government removed price controls after the war. Because private
investors holdings were concentrated in long-term bonds, they were hit particularly hard by the
real capital losses brought by inflation. Five years later, President Harry Truman would argue45

        During World War II, taxes were not high enough, and the Government was forced
        to borrow too much. As a result, when controls were taken off after the war, prices
        skyrocketed and we paid in inflation for our failure to tax enough. The value of people's
        savings was cut down by the higher prices they had to pay.


6.7      Korean War and Treasury-Federal Reserve Accord
At the start of the Korean War, federal debt held by the private investors stood at 66.5% of
GDP. President Harry Truman opposed delivering a state-contingent capital loss to government
creditors as prescribed by a Lucas-Stokey model. Historian Robert Donovan (1996, p. 329) noted
that

        Truman was dead set against the thought of tampering with government bonds, es-
        pecially because some that he had bought while in the army plunged in value in the

        depression of 1920-21. It became an article of faith with him that if a person bought
        a government bond for $100, that person should be able to redeem it for $100.

Evidently, Truman was one of the inexperienced small investors who had felt "swindled" by the
post-Armistice drop in Liberty bond prices. Nevertheless, as can be seen in panels 10g and 11g,
when the war broke out, with fresh memories of World War II rationing, consumers rushed to
purchase consumer goods, driving up the price level and delivering a small real capital loss to
bondholders. Thus, under President Truman, real returns to bondholders fell at the news of war
for the first time in American history.
      In a continuation of its World War II policy, the Fed supported the Treasury market in the
early months of the Korean by purchasing Treasury debt in order to fix the nominal yield curve
and place a floor on bond prices. But the Treasury's goal of low interest rates conflicted with Fed's
goal of using monetary policy to control inflation. That created pressure to revise coordination
arrangements between Treasury and the Federal Reserve, a tension resolved when on March 4,
1951, the Treasury and Federal Reserve issued a joint statement ending the Fed's commitment to
purchasing Treasury securities in order to maintain a floor on bond prices.46
      While little new federal debt was issued during the Korean War, postwar real returns were
low relative to earlier postwar experiences. As witnessed in table 4 and panel 11g, in the 15 years
after the war, the average annual real return on the Treasury's portfolio was a mere 1.13% ­ a
sharp contrast to the more generous returns to bondholders after the War of 1812, the Civil War,
and World War I.

6.8      Vietnam
After 1950, the Treasury standardized securities, shortened maturities on average, and space bonds
in more orderly ways. As an example of increased standardization, the share of long term bonds
with embedded call options declined sharply.47 By the end of the Vietnam War in December
1974, there were 120 unique securities outstanding across three classes of marketable securities:
bills, notes and bonds. As can be seen in panel 16h, sales of securities were managed to avoid a
lumpy debt service schedule.

Each panel reports the number of dollars the Treasury has promised to pay its creditors in each year for the
subsequent 30 years. The promised payments are decomposed into promised coupon payments (stacked blue bars)
and principal payments (stacked red bars).
 For 1865, the time horizon is 40 years.

7    Revolutions
In addition to the eight wars studied above, residents of the present-day United States participated
in two revolutions: from 1775 to 1783, the War for Independence from England, which succeeded,
and from 1861 to 1865 the attempt to secede from the United States and establish a Confederate
States of America (CSA), which failed. We study the funding of these two conflicts in a manner
that is not fully integrated with our treatment of the other eight conflicts for three reasons. First,
at the start of a revolution, no tax and debt policies exist. A new government must create laws
and administration to gather the funds to fight. Second, unlike the other eight conflicts, these
two revolutions were existential fights; failure to prevail meant that a government would cease to
exist. Third, data shortcomings make it infeasible to construct our full accounting prior to 1790
or for the CSA.48
    The Continental (1774-1781) and Confederation (1781-1789) governments and the Confederate
States of America were organized under a strong state, weak federal government model. Power to
tax stayed exclusively with state governments. In both insurrections, states' reluctance to remit
revenue to the central government compelled the Continental and Confederation governments
and the CSA government, respectively, to run large wartime deficits. In figure 17a and 17b, we
plot expenditures (net of interest payments) and receipts for the Continental government during
the American Revolution and the CSA during the U.S. Civil War. Both governments acquired
substantial flows of resources during the first three years of their conflicts despite collecting little
tax revenue.
    The Continental and Confederate governments implemented different strategies for financing
these large deficits. Ultimately, both governments issued large quantities of interest-bearing and
non-interest bearing certificates, but with different intertemporal patterns. From 1775 to 1780,
the Continental government relied almost entirely on seignorage from non-interest bearing notes;
only after the value of these notes collapsed did the government begin issuing interest-bearing
securities in substantial quantities. In contrast, the Confederate States of America issued a variety
of interest and non-interest bearing securities from the start of the war. As the war progressed,
the CSA gradually increased the relative issuance of non-interest bearing securities even as the
value of Confederate money fell. Both funding strategies generated hyperinflations, with wartime
price level increasing five times more than in the U.S. during the Civil War and World War I. In
the end, both governments defaulted on their non-interest bearing notes. Holders of Continental
interest-bearing securities collected partial payment eventually; holders of Confederate securities
received nothing.
    In June 1775, the Continental Congress issued the first bills of credit that came to be known
as Continental dollars, small denomination, non interest bearing promises to pay Spanish dollars.

     In particular, we have no consistent price data on Continental securities prior to mid-1786, and between 1787
and 1790 price quotes are spotty. We have no GDP data prior to 1790 and no GDP data for the CSA.

For the Continental government, in Spanish silver dollars. For the CSA, in gold dollars.



As figure 18 illustrates, between 1775 and 1780 the Continental Congress issued many of these
bills. At their peak in 1780 nearly $200 million in face value were outstanding. Over the following
decade, roughly $120 million were accepted by the states for tax payments and currency swaps,
remitted to the national government and burned.49 Spanish dollars and British pounds, not
Continental dollars served as units of account for both government and private transactions during
and after the war.
       By late 1776, markets valued Continental dollars far less than they did the Spanish dollars for
which the Continental Congress had promised to redeem them. On June 28, 1780, the Continental
Congress rescinded its earlier promise to repay one Continental dollar with one Spanish dollar and
made a new promise to repay 40 Continental dollars with one Spanish dollar, never mind what
was still written on faces of outstanding Continental dollars. That revised promise continued
between 1780 and 1790, when the U.S. Congress reset the ratio to the 100 Continental dollars for
1 Spanish dollar that Alexander Hamilton (1790) had recommended in his First Report on Public
Credit.
       Only after the 1780 "revaluation of" (i.e., reputation of most of) the Continental dollar did the
Continental government issue large quantities of interest-bearing securities.50 The two primary
interest-bearing securities issued to finance the war were loan office certificates and certificates of
indebtedness. Loan office certificates were bonds (most promised a 6 percent coupon) sold chiefly

    Baack (2001) argues that, given the small outstanding quantity of interest-bearing debt issued by the Conti-
nental government in the fall of 1777, had the war ended after the Battle of Saratoga with a negotiated settlement,
the U.S. would have avoided the debt crisis of the 1780s that led to the new constitution in 1787. In that case, the
U.S. would have emerged as a loose confederation of 13 independent states.

to domestic investors, but sometimes issued to pay suppliers. We plot the issuance of the loan
office certificates in figure 18. As can be seen in this figure, the Continental government issued 4
times the number of bills of credit than it issued of loan office certificates. Issuance of the loan
office certificates increased as the emission of bills of credit began to diminish.51
       Certificates of indebtedness were interest-bearing, most promising a 6 percent coupon. They
were issued by quartermasters, commissaries, and other officers to civilians in exchange for supplies
impressed for the army. Ferguson (1961, ch. 4) asserts that after the collapse in value of the
Continental dollar in 1778 and 1779, certificates issued by the Quartermaster and Commissary
departments were the primary means of payments for supplies. Poor recording keeping and the
destruction of many records prevent us from knowing how many of these certificates were actually
issued.
       In contrast, from the start of the war, the CSA financed its deficits with a more balanced mix of
non-interest bearing and interest bearing debt than did the Continental government. In figure 19,
we plot issues of non-interest bearing Confederate dollars and interest bearing Confederate bonds
along with tax and miscellaneous revenue, from 1861 to 1864.52 Note that in the second year of
the war, from February 1862 to December 1862, the Confederate government issued over twice
as much interest-bearing debt as non-interest bearing debt. Near the end of the war, issuance of
Confederate dollars exceeded issuance of Confederate bonds.
       Unlike the Continental period, during which a foreign coin was the domestic unit of ac-
count, the CSA Treasury succeeded in promoting the Confederate dollar as the unit of account
throughout the Confederacy early in the Civil War.53 When Confederate banks suspended specie
payments in 1861, CSA Treasury Secretary Christopher Memminger convinced bankers at their
July 24, 1861 Bankers' Convention to accept CSA dollars as the "standard value." In his March
14, 1862 Report, Memminger stated that

         Throughout the Confederacy the banks and people promptly responded to these mea-
         sures of the Government, and everywhere the Treasury Notes were accepted as cur-
         rency. These notes thus became part of the regular circulating medium and furnished
         the Government with a large and available loan, free of interest.

inflations with price levels increasing nearly 500 percent. In figure 20, we plot natural logs of
price levels during the two wars, a counterpart to figure 10. In both conflicts, inflation was
markedly higher than in the eight wars studied earlier in this paper.
       Differences in returns to bondholders across the two wars were direct consequences of the
wars' military outcomes. Creditors of the victorious Continental government were repaid some-
thing. Creditors of the lost cause CSA government received nothing. Data limitations render us
unable to compute a time series of returns for the portfolio of debt for the Continental and CSA
governments; so in figure 21, we plot the price in Spanish silver dollars of the Continental Loan
Office Certificates, the main domestic bonds issued during the Revolution, and the price in gold
of the CSA 100 Million Dollar Loan.
       During the American War for Independence, the price of Continental Loan Office certificates
fell steadily. During the Confederation period that followed peace but preceded the U.S. Consti-
tution, prices of these certificates stabilized in a range between 20 and 40 percent of their face
values. Via a sequence of refunding transactions that discriminated across different classes of
Continental and state creditors, in 1790, the U.S. Treasury, led by Secretary Alexander Hamilton,
issued new securities to holders of Revolutionary-era certificates. Continental creditors exchanged
their claims for new securities that had market values of about 75% of the original promises.54 The
new federal government did not pay as much as the Continental-era creditors had been promised,
but it still paid substantial amounts to creditors other than holders of Continental dollars.
       Confederate bondholders were less fortunate. As was the case with Continental-era certificates,
  54

the price of CSA securities fell steadily during the war. See figure 21. The U.S. Congress made
sure that the Confederate government had no say in the postwar resolution of debts. In 1868, the
14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was adopted. Section 4 states that "neither the United
States nor any state shall assume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or
rebellion against the United States, ...; but all such debts, obligations and claims shall be held
illegal and void."

In the government budget constraint, equation (22), we consider three explicit sources of revenue:
taxes, debt and money creation. However governments can also raise resources implicitly though
the nationalization of private assets, the confiscation of goods from its enemy as well as its own
people, and the drafting of its citizens into the military. The U.S. government has used all of these
measures at various times, but perhaps the most important of these indirect revenue measures is
the draft.55
         In order to raise large fighting forces without paying market wages, during the Civil War,
World War I, World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War, the federal government
drafted men into the military.56 By requiring young men to join the military at below market
wages, a reluctant soldier or sailor paid in kind a tax equal to the difference between what he could

     As noted by Marmion (1969), during the American Revolution, Massachusetts and Virginia conscripted men
into their militias. In February 1778, George Washington recommended to the Continental Congress that all colonies
begin conscription, but no universal conscription was implemented.

have earned elsewhere and his actual military pay. Previous authors have estimated revenues from
this tax for various wars, but due to an absence of consistent data across wars on market wages
and numbers of men drafted, we ignore this implicit tax in the revenue decomposition reported
in table 1.57
       In both the Barro (1979) and Lucas and Stokey (1983) models, wars are well-understood,
purely exogenous shocks to government spending, and taxpayers and bondholders are the same
people. In both models, the government wishes to minimize dead-weight losses from distorting
taxes. These models provide sharp statements about optimal time paths of taxes, borrowing,
and returns on debt for financing a large temporary government expenditure. In their elegance
and simplicity, these models necessarily ignore three concerns that frequently arise in political
discussions of war finance.

   1. While some wars are thrust upon a government, in many cases, the government's decision
         to go to war is a choice.

   2. Soldiers and sailors risk their lives, while those who stay home risk less, bringing issues of
         fairness to the fore.

   3. Taxpayers and bondholders are distinct groups whose interests often conflict.

In sections 4 and 6 we described how these three concerns influenced Congress' choices of debts
and taxes and Congress' and Treasury's decisions on how to design and market the debt. We'll
say a little more about this now.
       While the U.S. arguably had no choice but to enter World War II after the bombing of Pearl
Harbor, arguably the U.S. government chose to enter the other wars we are studying in this
paper.58 In the U.S. and elsewhere, contemporary observers have argued that by minimizing the
deadweight losses of raising enough funds, tax smoothing policies make it politically feasible for
democratic governments to join discretionary wars and prolong the duration of these wars. Adam
Smith (1776, ch. 11) wrote:

         The ordinary expense of the greater part of modern governments in time of peace
         being equal or nearly equal to their ordinary revenue, when war comes they are both
         unwilling and unable to increase their revenue in proportion to the increase of their
         expense. They are unwilling for fear of offending the people, who, by so great and
         so sudden an increase of taxes, would soon be disgusted with the war; and they are

     For World War I, Clark (1931, p. 110) estimates that average annual pay for soldiers and sailors for the three
years 1917-19 was $1,015. Average rate of civilian pay for those three years was $1,055 per year ­ thus a $40 gap
between civilian and military pay. He put the "national dividend" from underpaying the soldiers and sailors at
$230 million. For an analysis of the Vietnam War era draft, see Oi (1967) and Gates (1970).

(2019). For a statement of doubts about whether the U.S. should have entered World War II so controversial that

         unable from not well knowing what taxes would be sufficient to produce the revenue
         wanted. The facility of borrowing delivers them from the embarrassment which this
         fear and inability would otherwise occasion. By means of borrowing they are enabled,
         with a very moderate increase of taxes, to raise, from year to year, money sufficient
         for carrying on the war, and by the practice of perpetually funding they are enabled,
         with the smallest possible increase of taxes, to raise annually the largest possible sum
         of money.

More recently, Zielinski (2016) and Kreps (2018) argued that the use of debt-financing is inversely
related to the public's support for the war. Kreps (2018, p. 8) stated

         leaders, seeking to minimize constraints in war, pursue strategies that both anticipate
         and deflect opposition that would arise from the public's sensitivity [to war costs].
         That means they turn to less visible or onerous approaches such as borrowing rather
         than imposing war taxes when individuals express little appetite for fiscal sacrifice in
         wartime.

       If taxes are a more visible means of finance relative to borrowing, then it is noteworthy that
over the last 200 years the U.S. government has chosen to finance an increasing share of war
costs with taxes.59 Maybe it is that the public wants to demonstrate their support for a war by
agreeing to incur the deadweight loss of taxation.60 Newspaper op-ed writers often make this
argument.61 Rumbaugh (2013) recommended state-contingent wartime taxes so that all calls for
military action must explicitly include a call for increased taxes, forcing the question of whether
the stakes in the military situation are worth the cost. He stated "If the American people agree
[that higher taxes] are worth it, the president will get both the political support and financing he
needs. By tying military action to additional revenue, the president would actually have a freer
hand in deciding when to use force." That policy involves tax-bunching ­ not tax smoothing.
       Wars inspire calls for "shared sacrifices".62 Some argued that tax-financing wartime expendi-
tures would be fairer than debt-financing, particularly to those being drafted or volunteering to
serve in the military. Before World War I Sprague (1917) argued that taxation placed the burden
of paying for the war on those who could best afford it. With loans, a draftee or volunteer pays
twice: first while serving in the army, and then again with higher taxes to service the bonds when
he returned. During the Korean War, this argument was echoed by House Speaker Sam Rayburn
who stated, "I think the boys in Korea would appreciate it more if we in this country were to
  59
      See table 1. The fact the Treasury advertised the bonds sold to finance various wars (e.g., the posters in
figure 12) challenges the view that debt financing is necessarily less visible than tax financing.
   60
      This argument contrasts with the view discussed in section 6 that popular support for a war can be expressed
through robust bond sales.

pay our own way instead of leaving it for them to pay when they get back." President Truman's
Treasury Secretary James Synder agreed when he testified before the Senate Finance Committee,
"You passed a bill up here to draft boys of 18, to send them to war. I think it is just as important
we draft some of the profits to help pay for the expenditures."
      Not all have agreed that tax financing a war is fairer than debt financing. As Treasury
Secretary Andrew Mellon (1924, pp. 26-27) wrote regarding the financing of World War I:

        The view sometimes advanced that the present generation can avoid in part the burden
        of the cost of the war by passing the war debt on to future generations is fallacious
        when the debt is entirely domestic, as in the case of the present debt of the United
        States. A domestic debt is simply a liability of the people to pay themselves, or
        rather to pay the group holding Government securities; and while this liability may
        be handed down to the next generation, equivalent assets in the form of Government
        securities would also be handed down, and that generation, viewed as a whole, would
        be neither richer nor poorer. From the viewpoint of the country as a whole, the war
        was paid for when it was fought. ... If the war had been financed entirely through
        taxation, as some suggested at the time, or if the supplies needed by the Government
        had simply been commandeered and not paid for, it can readily be seen that the whole
        burden of the war would have been borne at that time. The financing of the conflict
        in part by loans was simply an arrangement under Government supervision whereby
        those who were in position could pay more than their proper proportion of the cost
        and be reimbursed later with interest by those who were not in position at the time
        to meet their proper proportion under the tax system without too great sacrifices and
        hardships.

Barro (1974) described conditions under which debt financing and tax financing are equivalent.
      Finally, in both benchmark models, taxpayers, bondholders and the government commit to a
stream of payments and returns conditional on a realization of a fully-understood shock process;
promises are kept. Implementation of these policies depends on future governments' choosing
to confirm promises made today. In democratic republics, commitments are sustainable only
when future majorities want to honor promises made by previous governments and only to make
new promises that even later majorities want. To purchase bonds when immediate returns are
low during a war selfish creditors must believe that future governments will deliver high rates of
return. Experiences of USA and CSA creditors after the Civil War provides contrasting instances
of how anticipations were actually realized. After the Civil War, the Union government confirmed
creditors wartime anticipations of high postwar real returns. Section 4 of the 14th Amendment
forbade payments to Confederate creditors.63

      Nevertheless, states in the former Confederacy paid pensions to CSA veterans.

A       Accounting
To understand how the par value of the government debt is related to the market value of debt,
we bring in information about bonds' coupons and prices of (presumably risk-free) promises to
                                      t
future dollars. Let the market price qt +j be the number of dollars at time t that it takes to buy a
risk-free claim to a dollar at time t + j . Thus, the superscript t denotes the date at which the price
is quoted, while the subscript t + j refers to which the date at which a promise is to be fulfilled.

These are sums of the corresponding components associated with each bond.
      The market value of government debt at time t is

for two reasons:

   · It neglects the government's outstanding promises to pay coupons that are economically
     indistinguishable from promises to pay principal
                                                           nt

                                                           j =1


     and

   · The par value given by equation (31) fails to discount future payments of principal bt
                                                                                          t+j by

     multiplying them by the market prices, or "discount factors," qt +j

The first omission causes the par value to understate the market value of debt, while the second
                                                                                                         nt    t
omission tends to make it overstate it. This means that it is possible for the par value,                j =1 bt+j ,
                                                                                    nt    t    t

we plot the par value of the debt in red and market value of the debt in blue from 1776 to 2018.
   In the analysis in this paper we report the value-weighted holding period return on the portfolio
of U.S. Treasury debt as defined in expression (23). This measure differs from the U.S. Treasury's
series of Interest Expense on the Debt Outstanding. The Treasury's series is an accounting measure
of the interest on the government debt, namely:

  1. Before 1929:
                                                                -1

       1,t is the par value of pure discount one-period treasury bills issued at t - 1, and rt-1,t
is the net nominal rate of return on one-period debt. This official measure reports the sum of

coupon payments on longer maturity bonds and the net yield on one-period zero-coupon Treasury
bills (these have existed only since 1929).


B       Data Sources
We use the prices and quantities of individual U.S. Treasury securities from Hall, Payne, and Sar-
gent (2018) and the CRSP Treasury bond files and the zero-coupon yield curves from Gurkaynak
et al. (2007) to compute the par and market values, holding period returns, and decompositions
of the U.S. Treasury's debt portfolio.
      Nominal GDP and the GDP deflator come from www.measuringworth.com. We linearly ex-
trapolate pre-1790 GDP in figures 3, 4, and 5. In tables 1 and 2 we use the annual GDP deflator
as our measure of the price index. For all other calculations we use the monthly price level index
from Craighead (2010).
      Federal expenditures and revenues from 1790 to 1940 are from the Annual Report of the
Secretary of the Treasury on the State of the Finances.65 The numbers we use are summarized
on pages 642 - 650 of the 1940 Annual Report.66 Federal expenditures and revenues from 1934
to 2018 are from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).67 The U.S. Treasury and OMB
reports federal receipts and expenditure data annually by fiscal year. The first fiscal year after
the establishment of the U.S. Treasury started January 1, 1789. In 1842, Congress changed the
beginning of the fiscal year from January 1 to July 1. In 1977, it was changed again from July 1
to October 1 where it remains today. We interpolated the calendar-year GDP data to conform it
with the fiscal data,
      The money supply is the sum of the non-interest bearing Treasury debt and Federal Reserve
credit outstanding. Federal Reserve credit outstanding represents the loans and investments of
the twelve Federal Reserve Banks. It is the sum of bills discounted, bills bought, United States
Government securities bought outright and discounted, deposits in foreign banks, industrial and
commercial loans, municipal warrants, and Federal Reserve bank float.

B.1      Pre-1790
Continental expenditures from 1776 to 1781 were recorded by Joseph Nourse (1791) in Section
E of his Statements of Receipts and Expenditures of Public Monies. This section is a report
submitted by Henry Knox, the first Secretary of War. Most of the expenditures listed are clearly
military in nature, but there are entries for expenditures on Indian Affairs, the Post Office, the
Secret Committee and Advances to the States.

       The expenditures from 1781 to 1789 are reported by Robert Morris (1790) Statement of the
Financial Affairs of the United States.68 Total expenditures from 1775 through November 1, 1784
are also reported in General Hamilton's estimate of revolutionary war expenditures, cut down to
specie. See Elliot (1845, p. 10).
       The pre-1790 receipts data are from Robert Morris (1790).
       In figure 18, we compute the emission of the loan office certificates using records from Record
Group 53 of the National Archives and Records Administration. The sources for the net emissions
of the bills of credit are Grubb (2008) and Grubb (2012). We deflate these emissions using the
depreciation schedule of Bullock (1895, p. 135).

B.2       Confederate States of America
Revenue and expenditures for the Confederate States of America (CSA) are from eight Reports
of the Secretary of the Treasury issued by Christopher Memminger. The unit of account is Con-
federate dollars. To convert these numbers into gold dollars we use the gold-grayback exchange
rates reported on page 375 of Schwab (1901). Since the eight Treasury reports cover periods of
varying length, we annualize the revenue and expenditure flows.
       These data are not complete. While the war ended in April 1865, the final Report was issued
in October 1864. These Reports combine coupon and principal payments into "payments on the
debt." Burdekin and Langdana (1993) provide an excellent discussion and analysis of the CSA
Reports.
       The source for CSA revenue and debt issuance debt in figure 19 is the CSA Treasury Reports.
We convert nominal CSA dollars into gold dollars using the schedule from Todd (1954, Appendix
C, p. 198).
       In figure 21, the gold price of the 100 million dollar loan is from Burdekin and Weidenmier
(2003).

B.3       Federal Reserve Balance Sheets
The source of the weekly data displayed in figure 13 are the tables of assets and liabilities of the
twelve Federal Reserve Banks reported in each issue of the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (1915-2018).
       The sharp increase in gold reserves on the assets side and Federal Reserve Notes in circulation
on the liabilities side of the balance sheet that occurred on June 22, 1917 is due to an amendment
of the Federal Reserve Act which permitted Federal Reserve Banks to count gold held by its
Federal Reserve Agent as part of its required note reserve. Prior to this amendment, the liability
  68
    There is one year of overlap between the two reports: 1781. The title of the table in Nourse's report states
that the expenditures listed are exclusive of the money paid by the Superintendent of Finance and listed in Morris
(1790) report.

of Federal Reserve Banks on outstanding Federal Reserve notes was reduced by the amount of
gold held by the Federal Reserve Agent instead of the gold being considered as a collateral reserve.
   For the Federal Reserve's assets, before the passage of the June 1917 amendment, Gold reserves
are the sum of Gold coin and certificates in vault, Gold Settlement fund, and Gold redemption
fund. After this amendment, Gold with Federal Agents and Gold with foreign agencies are in-
cluded in the Gold Reserves. Gold reserves include Gold held against Federal Reserve Notes
starting in November 1919, and Gold and Certificates held by banks starting in December 1923.
Reserves Other than Gold are Legal tender notes, silver, etc. Discounted U.S. Government Se-
curities are Bills discounted: Secured by U.S. Government obligations, and Discounted Private
Securities are Bills discounted: All other. U.S. Government Securities Bought Outright include
Bills bought in open market, U.S. government bonds, U.S. victory notes, Treasury notes, and U.S.
certificates of indebtedness. All Other Assets are the sum of Non-Reserve Cash, All other earning
assets/other securities, Bank Premises, Gold in transit or in custody in foreign countries, Due
from other Fed Banks (in transit), Due from Foreign banks, Uncollected items, Federal Reserve
Notes, net assets, Five per cent redemption fund against Federal Reserve Bank notes, All other
assets, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation stock.
   For the Federal Reserve's liabilities, Reserve Deposits are the sum of Government Deposits/U.S
Treasurer general account, Due to Members - reserve account/Member bank reserve account, Due
to non-member banks clearing account, Deferred availability items, Reserved for Government
franchise tax, Foreign bank, and Other deposits. Prior to the June 1917 amendment, Federal Re-
serve Notes are all notes and banknotes in circulation, net gold held by Federal Reserve Agents.
After June 1917, Federal Reserve Notes records all Federal Reserve notes and banknotes in cir-
culation. All Other Liabilities are the sum of Capital paid in/Capital accounts, Surplus Funds,
Special deposits, Reserve for contingencies, and All other liabilities.
   We entered the balance sheet data by hand. We later learned that these data are available
from Bao, Chen, Fries, Gibson, Paine, and Schuler (2018).
