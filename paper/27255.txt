Retaliatory Use of Public Standards in Trade
Kjersti Nes and K Aleks Schaefer
NBER Working Paper No. 27255

JEL No. F13,F5,Q18

                                         ABSTRACT

This research investigates the extent to which countries use public standards as a means of
political retaliation in the international policy arena. We construct a dataset that matches the
adoption of sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) standards between 1996-2015 with SPS committee
data on specific trade concerns and annual, bilateral trade flows. We evaluate the presence and
frequency of retaliation by assessing the extent to which measures imposed by one country
against another increase the probability that the country targeted by the original measure will
respond with a measure of their own. We observe that this type of tit-for-tat behavior commonly
occurred outside the product group of the original measure and for politically strategic goods. At
the two-digit level, we find that about 3,000 bilateral trade flows globally--or just over $110
billion in trade--were subject to retaliatory standards in 2015.

     1       Introduction

 1   In the recent months have seen a resurgence in politicians' willingness to engage in overt trade
 2   wars (Fajgelbaum et al., 2019). Tariff wars, in which one country raises tariffs in response
 3   to tariff hikes in another country, are a well-documented and classic example of this type of
 4   retaliatory behavior (Kennan and Riezman, 1988). Public backlash made tariff wars rare in
 5   the era of free-trade politics (The Economist, 2018). Yet, incentives for protectionism and
 6   retaliation persisted. In this paper, we ask whether--between 1996­2015--politicians satisfied
 7   the proclivities for retaliation through more subtle, non-tariff mechanisms. Specifically, we
 8   investigate the manner and extent to which countries used public standards as a means of
 9   political retaliation.1
10       Public standards are requirements that goods must satisfy in order to enter a country's
11   stream of commerce. As such, they represent non-tariff barriers to trade (NTBs). As tariffs
12   have fallen in light of WTO restrictions, the use of public standards affecting trade has grown
13   (Ehrich and Mangelsdorf, 2018; Yu, 2000). When used legitimately, public standards serve to
14   correct market failures (Fischer and Serra, 2000; Marette and Beghin, 2010; Swinnen and
15   Vandemoortele, 2011). However, although there is evidence to the contrary (Bao and Qiu,
16   2012), the body of evidence suggests the imposition of a standard is trade-reducing from
17   the perspective of the targeted country (Achterbosch et al., 2009; Beghin and Melatos, 2012;
18   Crivelli and Gröschl, 2016; Disdier, Fontagné and Mimouni, 2008; Fontagné et al., 2015;
19   Vigani, Raimondi and Olper, 2009; Wei, Huang and Yang, 2012; Wieck, Schlüter and Britz,
20   2012). Such negative trade effects may incentivize politicians to use standards for illegitimate
21   purposes, such as domestic protectionism (Aisbett and Pearson, 2012; Baylis, Martens and
22   Nogueira, 2009; Baylis, Nogueira and Pace, 2012; Besedina and Coupe, 2015).
         1
          An example of potential retaliation can been seen in the 2014 Russian de facto import ban on agricultural
     goods from several Western countries--including the EU--as a response to Western sanctions of the annexation
     of Crimea. The import ban affected 5.2 billion euros of total extra-EU exports, with the dairy and food and
     vegetables industries hit particularly hard (Kutlina-Dimitrova, 2017). Russia supported this import ban via
     numerous public food safety standards (USDA Foreign Agricultural Service, 2018).

23      In this paper, we study the use of Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) measures as an
24   instrument for political retaliation. We construct a dataset that matches the adoption of SPS
25   standards between 1996­2015 with WTO committee notes and annual, bilateral trade flows.
26   We develop a multi-tiered empirical strategy designed to test whether (i) countries targeted
27   with an SPS measure respond with an SPS standard of their own and (ii) if such response
28   exists, whether it follows a pattern consistent with retaliation. We first ask whether countries
29   that have explicitly raised concerns of unjust implementation or administration of an SPS
30   measure by another country increases the probability that the former country will implement
31   its own standard. Next, we assess the extent to which measures imposed by one country
32   against another increase the probability that the country targeted by the original measure will
33   respond with a measure of their own--i.e., whether countries exhibit "tit-for-tat" behavior in
34   the adoption of public standards. Within this analysis, we ask whether "tit-for-tat" behavior
35   depends on the politically strategic nature of subject trade partners and goods.
36      This paper contributes to various strands of literature on the political economy of
37   retaliation in international trade policy. Disagreement persists among academics as to
38   whether retaliation constitutes a thinly veiled mechanism by which to pursue protectionism
39   or a crucial strategy to enforce commitments under international rules. Recent theoretical
40   evidence tends to support the latter over the former. Martin and Vergote (2008) develop a
41   game-theoretic model to show that retaliation via import tariffs creates efficient equilibrium
42   in the enforcement of trade agreements. Dluhosch (2016) show further that this is true even
43   in the presence of powerful domestic interest groups in the retaliating country. To date,
44   empirical investigation of retaliation is limited to the administration of anti-dumping duties,
45   which operate as import tariffs. Feinberg and Reynolds (2006) show that countries exhibit
46   tit-for-tat behavior in the initiation and administration of antidumping laws. Blonigen and
47   Bown (2003) find that even the threat of retaliation can pre-empt countries from levying
48   antidumping duties.
49      To the authors' knowledge, our paper is the first to empirically examine global retaliation

50   in the use of NTBs. Public standards represent particularly interesting instruments for
51   which to assess the extent to aims of political retaliation. Several papers have shown that
52   implementation and application of public standards often exhibit patterns consistent with
53   protectionism. Baylis, Martens and Nogueira (2009) show that the application of public
54   standards in the U.S. is subject to lobbying expenditure. Baylis, Nogueira and Pace (2012)
55   present evidence that tariff reductions are associated with an increase in the application of
56   SPS standards in the EU. Grundke and Moser (2019) compare U.S. import refusals with
57   national unemployment data and find that import refusals are consistent with protectionistic
58   reactions to fluctuations in the business cycle.
59      Our findings are consistent with the theoretical findings in Martin and Vergote (2008). Our
60   results indicate that retaliatory behavior commonly occurred in the use of SPS standards--at
61   the two digit level, about 3,000 bilateral trade flows globally ($110 billion in trade) were
62   subject to tit-for-tat standards in 2015. Further, holding constant regulatory behavior of
63   trade partners, strong trade networks reduce the use of SPS standards. However, such
64   networks equally increase the probability of regulatory response when a partner country
65   threatens the relationship through implementation of an SPS measure. Moreover, there are
66   two dimensions along which the strategic nature of a product can affect retaliatory behavior.
67   The first dimension of this strategic nature relates to the importance of the product hit with
68   the original measure from the perspective of the target country. The second dimension of the
69   "strategic nature" of goods relates to the political sensitivity of the product against which
70   retaliation occurs--from the perspective of the country that instigated the original measure.
71      The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews international rules
72   related to SPS administration and documents the use of such standards over time. In Section
73   3, we provide a description of our data and explain our empirical methodology. Section 4
74   presents results, and Section 5 concludes.

75   2       The SPS agreement

76   Under the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (referred to
77   hereinafter as the SPS Agreement), the WTO provides exceptions to rules barring non-tariff
78   barriers (NTBs) for regulatory measures implemented on the basis of animal, plant, and
79   human health protection.2 Countries are required to notify the WTO whenever they adopt
80   a new (or change or withdraw an existing) SPS requirement affecting trade. The WTO
81   maintains a repository, known as the SPS Information Management System containing all
82   past SPS notifications.
83       According to the SPS Agreement, WTO-member countries may implement non-tariff
84   barriers on the basis of animal, plant, and human health protection, so long as such restrictions
85   are not "arbitrary and unjustified". The SPS Agreement also provides exemptions from
86   most-favoured nation and national treatment requirements to allow discrimination against
87   one or more countries. Discrimination is allowed because member-countries differ with respect
88   to pest and disease profiles and food safety conditions. Accordingly, SPS measures vary in
89   obligations for compliance and product- and country-scope. Measures sometimes target only
90   a specific country or set of countries, but may be heavily restrictive, such as mandating long
91   quarantine periods or outright bans on products from disease-endemic areas.3
92       There is a critical distinction between what constitutes an "arbitrary and unjustified"
93   SPS measure as a matter of law and the underlying economic purpose (or set of purposes)
94   for implementing a given measure. If a country implements a standard that fails to meet
95   the legal criteria of not being "arbitrary and unjustified", affected countries can bring legal
96   action against the instigating country through the WTO Dispute Settlement Body (DSB).

     citrus industry against citrus greening disease is an example of an SPS measure. .
         3
           SPS measures are broadly defined to include "all relevant laws, decrees, regulations, requirements and
     procedures including, inter alia, end-product criteria; processes and production methods; testing, inspection,
     certification and approval procedures; quarantine treatments including relevant requirements associated
     with the transport of animals or plants, or with the materials necessary for their survival during transport;
     provisions on relevant statistical methods, sampling procedures and methods of risk assessment; and packaging
     and labeling requirements directly related to food safety" (Ahn, 2002).

97    However, the criteria of "arbitrary and unjustified" is a relatively low legal barrier. If an
98    implementing country is able to provide evidence demonstrating that a standard is not
99    completely arbitrary and that there is some justification for the standard, it is legitimate as
100   a matter of international law, even if the true purpose of the measure is domestic protection.
101   In reality, countries often implement and administer SPS standards in a way that meets
102   the legal criteria, but are nevertheless rooted in protectionistic (Aisbett and Pearson, 2012;
103   Baylis, Martens and Nogueira, 2009; Baylis, Nogueira and Pace, 2012; Besedina and Coupe,
104   2015). In these instances, targeted countries have no recourse in the DSB.
105      The WTO has established an informal forum, known as the SPS committee, in which
106   countries negatively affected by specific SPS measures can discuss such standards, request
107   clarifications from the implementing country, and signal that they do not believe the true
108   purpose of the standard is protection of human, plant, or animal health (Horn, Mavroidis
109   and Wijkström, 2013). These complaints are referred to in the SPS committee as Specific
110   Trade Concerns (STCs), and, in the first decade of the WTO, more than 400 STCs were
111   raised at the SPS Committee.


112   2.1    Conceptual Framework for Retaliation

113   Martin and Vergote (2008) develop a two-good, two-country model of trade in which countries
114   interact repeatedly to study retaliation via import tariffs. The authors assume that preferences
115   of governments are subject to random shocks that affect their relative valuation of the import-
116   competing sector. In this setup, governments would benefit from having the flexibility to
117   raise their import tariffs when their valuation of the import-competing sector is high, and
118   to decrease them otherwise. However, governments cannot observe the preferences of their
119   trading partner. This information asymmetry gives rise to a problem of incentive compatibility:
120   because governments are always incentivized to set relatively high tariffs in order to affect the
121   terms of trade in their favor, they have a tendency to overstate their preference for protection
122   at any point in time. To prevent them from doing so, there must be some cost associated with


                                                     5
      Nes and Schaefer (2020)                                                          May 19, 2020


123   the use of high tariffs. In a world of restricted trade instruments, governments can impose
124   such costs on one another by using their remaining policy instruments in a flexible way.
125      In this setting, retaliation is desirable as a mechanism to maximize joint welfare. Within
126   the context of the WTO, there are two main channels to control potential deviations: (a)
127   retaliate directly through the use of import tariffs, or (b) to challenge them in the context
128   of the DSB. Martin and Vergote (2008) argue that countries are often dis-incentivized to
129   incur the costs and uncertainty associated with the DSB when they can pursue retaliation
130   directly--they can avoid WTO litigation in favor of pursuing reciprocal justice. In this way,
131   governments find it jointly optimal to allow import tariffs to vary with their desired levels of
132   protection. Incentive compatibility stems from the fact that each country's tariffs are directly
133   related to the contemporaneous tariffs of its trading partner. Hence, tariffs are never set
134   at their optimal levels because, in each period, they are jointly used to accommodate the
135   governments' shifting preferences for protection. "Vigilante" retaliation occurring outside
136   the WTO DSU does not undermine the international trading system. Instead, it serves as a
137   necessary way to accommodate shocks.
138      While Martin and Vergote (2008) limit their analysis to retaliation through the use of
139   duties, we argue that retaliation in the use of NTBs is--at the very least--equally plausible.
140   Like import duties, imposition of public standards alters terms of trade. Indeed, it is common
141   practice to measure the ad valorem equivalent impacts of such instruments. Similarly,
142   SPS standards can be used to target specific products and countries. Moreover, when
143   one WTO member implements a legally valid SPS measure against another, the negatively
144   affected country has no recourse under the WTO dispute settlement mechanism. "Tit-for-tat"
145   retaliation would be the only effectively enforcement mechanism available to this violation of
146   the commitment towards free trade expressed through WTO commitments.

147   2.2     Use of SPS Measures in Practice

148   We use two decades of data from the SPS-IMS database, running from 1996­2015, on the
149   adoption of public standards in WTO member-countries. SPS measures are disaggregated by
150   reporter, target country, and product.4
151       During the time period considered in this paper, 22,294 SPS measures were issued,
152   affecting 380,941 importer-exporter-product (IEP) trade flows). Adoption of standards is
153   further disaggregated by year in Figure 1.

154       Table 1 disaggregates SPS use by sector. SPS standards are present in all sectors,
155   but--in practice--SPS measures tend to be used more frequently for agricultural products.
156   Approximately 90% of all IEP groups affected by SPS fall within food and animal sectors
157   (i.e., HS codes 01­24). This is not surprising. Food and animal products have a high-risk
158   profile relative to other products, both with respect to human health, through food safety
159   threats like pesticide residues and mycotoxins, and plant and animal health, through pest
         4
           For purposes of the analysis, we treat the European Union (EU) as a single country. So, for example, a
      measure taken against Belgium counts as a notification against the EU. Sub-national restrictions are treated
      in the same way. A measure directed at Uttar Pradesh or Odisha is treated as a notification against India as
      a whole.

163   (b) of the Figure show the number of IEP groups that are subject to SPS measures that have

165   partially--by protection of domestic industry, large importers are the primary users of SPS
166   measures. The U.S., EU, and China, for example, are the top three importers across almost

179   STCs were most frequently brought to the committee were the EU (130), the USA (61),

181       In the following section, we use the SPS and STC data described here to develop an
182   empirical strategy that tests whether--in light of the retreat from tariff wars in the modern
183   era of free trade politics--"tit-for-tat" retaliation occur in the adoption and use of non-tariff
184   measures.



185   3     Methodology

186   Our empirical methodology is designed to test whether (i) countries targeted with an NTB
187   (i.e., an SPS measure for our purposes) respond with an NTB of their own and (ii) if such a
188   response exists, does the response follow a pattern consistent with retaliation. We address
189   these questions through four separate, but complementary, analyses:

190       1. We first examine whether a country that has explicitly raised concerns of unjust
191         implementation or administration of an SPS measure by another country increases the
192         probability that the former country will implement its own SPS measure targeting the
193         latter.

194       2. We then determine whether trade flows "treated" with an SPS measure are more likely
195         to induce regulatory response from the targeted country than those that are "untreated"
196         with a measure.

197       3. Next, we model an importing country's decision to adopt an SPS standard against
198         another country to determine whether the decision of the importing country to initiate
199         an SPS regulation depends on whether the exporter has previously initiated a trade
200         barrier affecting the importer.

201       4. Finally, we ask whether `tit-for-tat' behavior in the adoption of SPS measures occurs

202          more frequently for strategic trade partners and politically sensitive goods.

203   Estimation details for these four analyses are as follows.
204       Specific Trade Concerns: To investigate the existence and extent of retaliation against
205   standards that a country explicitly considers unjust, we match information from WTO
206   committee notes on Specific Trade Concerns (STCs) with data from the SPS-IMS. We
207   empirically assess whether a country voicing STCs increases the probability that the country
208   will implement its own SPS measure targeting the country that is the subject of the STC
209   complaint. To do so, we estimate the following equation:


                                               S
                                  SPSeit = S + S          S
                                                 STCeit + m X + S Z +               S
                                                                                    eit
                                                                                                               (1)


210   where i denotes the importer, e denotes the exporter, and t denotes the year of observation.
211   The dependent variable, SPSiet , is a dummy indicating whether the exporter e issued an SPS
212   notification against the importer i in year t. Vector X contains a set of control variables,
213   which include GDP of the exporter and importer, and an indicator for whether countries i
214   and e are members of a mutual free trade agreement (FTA). Vector Z includes importer,
215   exporter, and year fixed effects. The model is estimated via linear probability model (LPM).5
216       The variable of interest for this analysis is ST Ceit , which takes value one if the exporter
217   has raised an STC against the importer in the given period, and zero otherwise. We consider
218   two alternative constructions of this variable. First, variable ST C takes value one only in
219   the first year the exporter raises the STC. Second, we define variable ST C to take value one
220   in the first year the STC is raised and for all years in which the concern is ongoing.6
221       Note that the specification in equation (1) is not at conducted the product level because
222   the WTO Committee notes do not tie STCs to specific product categories. In contrast to
223   the STC analysis, all subsequent analyses are at the two-digit product level. Importantly,

         6
           Appendix A.1 presents results for specifications in which variable STC is defined as the number of
      complaints lodged by one country against another, rather than an indicator for whether at least one complaint
      exists.

224   we distinguish between SPS measures that are issued seemingly in response to the original
225   measure that are issued within the same two-digit HS code from responsive SPS measures
226   that are issued outside the original HS code. The rationale for this distinction is that there are
227   non-protectionistic reasons why countries would issue responsive standards within the same
228   HS code, whereas there are fewer justifications for responses outside the original measure. In
229   the context of STCs, there are no concerns regarding non-protectionistic justifications for
230   responsive SPS measures because the responding country has already stated that the original
231   measure is administered in violation of WTO rules.
232      Difference-in-Differences Analysis: Next, as a preliminary analysis of the use of an
233   SPS measure as a tool for retaliation, we perform a difference-in-difference analysis comparing
234   the regulatory response between trade partners that have seen SPS adoption and those that
235   have note. Using SPS-IMS data at the two-digit product level, we use a difference-in-difference
236   experimental design to determine whether HS codes "treated" with an SPS measure are
237   more likely than those that are "untreated" to induce regulatory response from the targeted
238   country. To this end, we estimate the following model:

                                      2015
                        SP Siept =            (t (1 - SP Seit,p ) + t SP Seit,p ) t +   iept            (2)
                                     t=1996



239   where t is an indicator variable that takes value one in period t. The treatment variable,
240   SP Seit,p , takes value one if in year t, the exporter has instituted an SPS measure in the
241   same year affecting the importer in any product category outside p. Note that SP S variables
242   are constructed as described in "Standards Adoption" analysis below. Because usage of SPS
243   regulations has changed dramatically over time (Figure 1), we allow the treatment effect to
244   differ by year. Thus, the coefficients of interest are parameters t on the interaction between
245   the treatment variable and the time indicator. In each year, "untreated" HS codes receive
246   a placebo effect measured by parameters t . As this is a preliminary analysis, we consider
247   two alternative data samples on which to conduct this analysis. First, we estimate equation

248   (2) using only observations for which the exporter is the United States. This is done to
249   mirror the ongoing (and overt) tariff war in which the United States--by issuing the original
250   steel and aluminum tariffs--was the instigating country against which other countries have
251   responded with retaliatory tariffs (i.e., the exporter for the purposes of our sample). Thus,
252   we believe that--if retaliation does occur in the use of public standards--the United States is
253   a good benchmark case with which to begin the analysis. After estimating equation (2) for
254   the United States, we then generalize the sample to include the complete set of exporters and
255   importers. Of course, findings from this analysis are by no means conclusive. There exist
256   many reasons why some sets of countries or products elicit a higher regulatory response than
257   others. We attempt to incorporate these differences among countries and products in the
258   analysis that follows.
259       Standards Adoption Analysis: We next turn to our main specification. We construct
260   a LPM of a country's decision to adopt a public standard against another country, which
261   allows for (but does not impose) use of public standards for retaliatory purposes.7 For this
262   analysis, we construct a dataset with annual observations on importer- and exporter-use of
263   SPS standards, bilateral importer-exporter-product (IEP) trade flows, use of other trade
264   barriers, and country characteristics to empirically model the adoption decision. We are
265   primarily interested to determine whether the decision of an importing country i to initiate
266   an SPS regulation on product p from exporting country e depends on whether country e
267   has previously initiated a trade barrier affecting country i. Note that we here define the
268   exporting country as the instigating country and the importing country as the targeted or
269   responding country. We estimate the following equations at the IEP level via ordinary least
         7
           In both Equations (1) and (3), we employ LPM estimation as opposed to a Probit or Logit estimator
      due to the large number of fixed effects. Non-linear estimators--such as probit or logit--are inconsistent in
      the presence of a large number of fixed effects due to the incidental parameter problem. In addition, in a
      probit estimation, IEP groups with no variation in the dependent variable are dropped from the analysis.
      In our analysis, this means that groups in which the responding country never retaliates get dropped from
      the analysis, possibly generating upward bias in the probit estimates. Nevertheless, Appendix A.2 presents
      Probit results for robustness purposes.

271   where vector X contains control variables, including log of GDP for both the importer and
272   the exporter and the log of value of trade for product p between the importer and exporter.
273   Vector Z contains various fixed effects, including year dummies, and importer-product and
274   exporter-product fixed effects. These variables account for any exporter- or importer-specific
275   differences across in the use of international regulations and control for the fact that some
276   products and regions are more susceptible to SPS issues than others. The final term, , is the
277   residual, which we have clustered at the importer-exporter level and assumed to satisfy the
278   usual i.i.d. properties.
279       We include two variables to assess whether public standards imposed by one country
280   against another increase the probability that the country targeted by the original measure
281   will respond with a measure of their own. The first variable, SPSeip , measures an importers'
282   response within the same product code to a standard implemented by the exporting country.
283   The second variable, SPSei,p , measures an importers' response outside the product code of
284   the original standard implemented by the exporting country.8 These variables are indicators
285   taking value one if, for importing country i and product p, the exporting country e instituted
286   a standard affecting the importing country i. They are constructed as follow: If the importer
287   issued a standard in year t, SPSeipt and SPSeit,p take the value 1 if the exporter has issued
288   a standard against the importer 365 days prior to the response. If the importer issued no
289   standard in the IEP group in year t, the lags of SPSeipt and SPSeit,p are used.9
          8
            Note that we are unable to apply this identification strategy in the STC analysis in equation (1). We are
      unable to match STC complaints to specific SPS measure. Thus, we are unable to perform the analysis on
      product level, which is the basis for the identification strategy utilized for the tit-for-tat retaliation. However,
      as the STC are brought to the SPS committee by exporters that consider the underlying SPS measure unjustly
      implemented, the issue identifying retaliation is less likely to occur in responses to STCs.
          9
            An alternative specifications could be defining the SPS variables as the number of notifications between
      countries i and e for product p in year t. There are pros and cons to both specifications. On one hand, in the
      alternative specification, in which standards variables are continuous, makes use of all available information.
      On the other hand, this information creates the potential for noise in the estimation process. To see this,


                                                              14

290       Variable SPSei,p , measuring outside-product response is our primary variable of interest
291   for measuring retaliation. Although retaliation could conceivably occur within the original
292   product group of the original measure,10 there are alternative, non-retaliatory explanations
293   for observing `tit-for-tat' behavior regarding SPS standard imposition within the same
294   product code. Issues such as spatial spread (or risk of spread) of trans-boundary disease
295   or harmonization of food safety standards could justify a targeted country to institute a
296   standard of its own. Within the same product code of the original measure (variable SPSeip ),
297   we cannot separate responses by targeted countries motivated by retaliation from responses
298   motivated by more legitimate reasons.
299       However, in the context of, say, citrus greening, a legitimate response would likely be
300   confined to HS codes related to citrus imports. We argue that implementation by Brazil of
301   an SPS measure against the U.S. for another product (e.g., live animals) would be strong
302   evidence of retaliation. That is, if an importer responds with an SPS measure directed
303   at a product category other than citrus, the motivation is likely retaliation rather than a
304   legitimate concern. Retaliation outside the product code is consistent with current tariff trade
305   wars. The United States' original tariffs applied to steel and aluminum products. Retaliating
306   countries, with the exception of Russia, have responded with tariffs primarily on agricultural
307   of food products (Hopkinson, 2018).
308       To further minimize potential identification problems due to justified within-product
309   responses, the observations are aggregated at the two-digit level of the harmonized tariff
310   classification system (HS code).11 This high-level of aggregation is unlikely to lead to incorrect
      consider two scenarios regarding the use of SPS measures. First, consider a scenario in which a country
      issues an SPS measure against all live animals from a given country. This measure would be counted as a
      single notification in the first specification. Alternatively, consider a scenario in which a country issues two
      SPS measures: one against imports of zoo elephants and one against imports of hamsters. When standards
      variables are treated continuously, as in the first specification, this scenario counts as two SPS standards.
      Clearly, the scope and effect of the measure in the first scenario is larger than the measure in the second
      scenario; yet, the second scenario is treated as a higher barrier to trade.
         10
            For instance, if, say, Norway issued an SPS measure against Chilean salmon and Chile responded with a
      standard against Norwegian salmon
         11
            UN Comtrade is divided into different levels based on the aggregation of product codes. For instance,
      the two-digit code 08 is trade in fruit, the 4-digit level 0805 is trade in citrus, and the 6-digit level 080550 is
      trade of lemons or limes.

311   inference in the current context: we are interested merely in understanding whether retaliation
312   occurs, and, if so, how frequently it is motivated by domestic protectionism (demonstrated by
313   retaliation within the same sector) and/or by geopolitical suasion (evidenced by retaliation
314   outside the sector of the original trade barrier). Aggregation allows us to avoid or reduce
315   many compounding intra-sector issues, like cross-product trade diversion or the presence
316   of standards that are motivated by domestic protectionism, but that fall under a slightly
317   different tariff line from the original trade barrier at, say, the 4- or 6-digit HS level.
318      Strategic Trade Partners & Goods: Lastly, we ask whether `tit-for-tat' behavior
319   in the adoption of SPS measures occurs more frequently for strategic trade partners and
320   politically sensitive goods. First, we focus on regulatory response among members of a
321   mutual regional trade agreement. If our conceptual framework for retaliation is valid, mutual
322   membership to a regional trade agreement may increase the probability of retaliatory response
323   to standards deemed unjustified by the targeted country. Mutual members of a regional trade
324   agreement have made a commitment towards trade liberalization, spanning beyond WTO
325   concessions. If one country were to violate this commitment through the use of an illegitimate
326   standard, the incentives to punish this violation is elevated in light of the higher commitment
327   towards free trade expressed through the regional trade agreement. To investigate whether
328   mutual membership in a regional trade agreement increases the frequency of `tit-for-tat'
329   behavior in the use of SPS measures, we re-estimate equation (3) including interaction terms
330   F T Aeit × SPSeipt and F T Aeit × SPSeit,p . Positive coefficients on these interaction terms
331   suggest affected countries are more likely to respond to SPS measures when the instigating
332   and targeted countries are members of a mutual trade agreement.
333      Next, we ask whether `tit-for-tat' behavior is more likely to occur for "strategic goods".
334   Importantly, there are two dimensions along which the strategic nature of a product can affect
335   retaliatory behavior. The first dimension of this strategic nature relates to the importance of
336   the product hit with the original measure from the perspective of the target country.12 To
        12
          To see this, suppose an instigating country instituted an SPS measure banning all imports of cotton
      from all global trade partners. From the perspective of a country that produces little cotton and seldom

337   account for this dimension of the "strategic nature" of goods, we restrict the sample only to
338   product codes for which we observe non-zero bilateral trade flows in at least 10 of the years
339   within our sample.13 The second dimension of the "strategic nature" of goods relates to the
340   political sensitivity of the product against which retaliation occurs--from the perspective
341   of the country that instigated the original measure. For example, because agricultural and
342   food products are politically sensitive from the U.S. perspective, these products were the
343   primary targets of retaliation in the current trade war. To account for this dimension of the
344   "strategic nature" of goods, we construct an indicator variable Strategic taking value 1 for
345   bilateral trade flows with a positive trade flow in at least 10 of the years within our data
346   sample--from the perspective of the instigating country. We interact this variable with our
347   measures of regulatory response SPSeip and SPSei,p . We re-estimate equation (3) for the
348   restricted sample only and including the strategic goods interaction terms.


349   3.1     Final Dataset

350   We merge the SPS data with annual observations on the value of trade (in US$) for the
351   corresponding IEP trade flow, obtained from UN comtrade. We also include controls for
352   GDP for both importer and importer, obtained from the World Bank. In the analysis that
353   follows, these control variables are specified in natural logarithmic form. Because the sample
354   includes zero trade flows, the log of trade value is transformed as log(value + 1).14
      exported to the instigating country, such a measure would be binding in a legal sense, but the country would
      be relatively unaffected in an economic sense. Accordingly, one would not anticipate a high probability of
      retaliatory response from this country towards the instigating country.
         13
            We do not consider positive trade flows in all years because of the inherent endongeneity between trade
      flows and SPS measures. If, for example, the SPS measure is a ban, trade flows would be zero even if the
      affected bilateral trade flow is "strategic".
         14
            We note that the United Nations Conference on Trade and Developments Trade Analysis and Information
      Systems (TRAINS) database and the WTO Integrated Database (IDB) and Consolidated Tariff Schedules
      (CTS) database contain limited information on bound and applied tariff rates at the IEP level. We elect not
      to use this data for three reasons. First, the data are not updated on an annual basis and updates are not
      done systematically across IEP groups. Second, tariff information is available only for a small portion of IEP
      groups in our sample, primarily in high- and middle-income countries. Thus, inclusion of tariff information
      creates a significant risk with respect to selection bias. Finally, we do not believe exclusion of tariff data
      is problematic for the validity of the analysis. Because results in Section 4 include fixed effects at the IEP
      level, variation in tariff rates is likely to be minimal within the unit of observation and is absorbed in the

355       The final dataset contains data on all IEP groups for which at least one non-zero trade

361   4      Results

362   Results from estimating the models described in the previous section provide empirical
363   evidence that SPS standards are used for retaliatory purposes. First, our analysis of specific
364   trade concerns (STCs) shows that countries who have explicitly raised specific trade concerns
365   (STCs) of unjust SPS measures in another country are more likely to implement an SPS
366   measure affecting that other country. Second, our difference-in-difference analysis shows that
      individual year effects.

367   trade flows treated with an SPS measure are more likely to induce regulatory response than
368   those that are untreated. Third, our model of standards adoption shows that the imposition
369   of an SPS measure by one country increases the probability that the targeted country will
370   impose an SPS measure of its own against the instigating country. Finally, we show that this
371   tit-for-tat behavior occurs predominantly among politically strategic trade partners and for
372   strategic products.


373   4.1    Specific Trade Concerns

374   Table 3 reports results for the STC analysis, obtained by estimating equation (1). Column (1)
375   of the Table reports results for the specification in which the STC indicator variable is defined
376   to take value one only in the year when the complainant first raises the STC. Column (2) of
377   the Table reports results for the specification in which the STC indicator takes value one
378   for all years in which the STC is ongoing. Recall that in both specifications, the exporting
379   country is defined as the country voicing the STC against the importer. The dependent
380   variable is a binary indicator for whether the exporter has instituted an SPS against the
381   importer.
382      We refer first to coefficient estimates on the control variables in Table 3. In both Columns
383   (1) and (2) importer GDP is positive and statistically significant (at 99%), whereas exporter
384   GDP is negative and statistically insignificant at conventional levels. In other words, marginal
385   changes in the income status of a given exporter are not associated with strong changes in its
386   propensity to institute SPS measures. On the other hand, marginal changes in the income
387   status of the importer are associated with changes in its propensity to be the subject of
388   SPS measures. In some sense, these results are unsurprising and do not indicate that SPS
389   regulations are more likely to target rich countries. Increases in GDP in an importing country
390   (for the purposes of the observed trade flow) are likely associated with higher volumes of
391   its own out-bound trade, making it more likely the country will be hit with SPS regulation
392   abroad. On the other hand, from the perspective of the observed exporter, we explicitly and

393   separately control for changes in trade volumes. Moreover, exporter-specific fixed effects
394   likely control for the exporting country's general predilection for regulation. Referring to
395   coefficient estimates on variables FTA and Ln(Trade) in Columns (1) and (2), we see that
396   membership to a mutual trade agreement and increases in the value of bilateral trade also
397   increase the probability (both significant at 99%) that the trade will be subjected to SPS
398   regulation. The fact that increases in the size of trade flow increases the probability that it
399   will be regulated is consistent with previous research on protectionism and trade (Aisbett
400   and Pearson, 2012; Baldwin, 1989; Baylis, Nogueira and Pace, 2012).
401      We now turn to coefficient estimates for the variable of interest STCei . In both Columns
402   (1) and (2), we see that STCs initiated by the exporter towards the importer are associated
403   with a positive response in the probability that the exporter will implement an SPS measure
404   affecting the importer. Interpreted in words, this suggests that exporters who have explicitly

405   raised STCs of unjust SPS measures in an importing country are approximately 3.1% (Column
406   1) more likely to implement an SPS measure of their own affecting the importing country.
407   This response appears to endure--at only slightly smaller magnitude of 2.95% (Column
408   2)--in subsequent years if the STC is not resolved. These estimated responses are statistically
409   significant at 95% in Column (1) and 99% in Column (2). Appendix A.1 provides robustness
410   checks for these results with respect to the construction of STC variables and use of linear

413   Figure 3 reports the results of our preliminary difference-in-difference analyses. These analyses
414   measure whether trade flows treated with an SPS measure are more likely to induce regulatory
415   response (in a tariff code falling outside the original measure) than those that are untreated.
416   As noted in Section 3, we first present results for trade flows treated with SPS measures
417   instituted by the U.S. for the purposes of comparability with the ongoing tariff wars. These
418   results are presented in panel (a) of Figure 3. We then present results for trade flows treated

421      As shown in panel (a) of Figure 3, when the U.S. institutes a standard against a given
422   product, countries affected by the standard are substantially more likely to implement a
423   standard against the U.S. than U.S. trade partner who were not affected by the original
424   standard. This correlation is statistically significant at 99% for all years within the sample.
425   These findings hold in panel (b) of Figure 3 when we generalize to standards instituted by
426   any trade partner.
427      Note that--while these findings are consistent with the pattern of behavior observed in
428   the ongoing tariff war--the observed relationship in Figure 3 is not specifically causal. A
429   country's decision whether to adopt SPS regulation is a complex function involving many
430   considerations. As mentioned in Section 2, some products are more amenable to regulation
431   than others and imports from some countries are inherently more "risky" than others. The
432   following results attempt to control for these factors.


433   4.3    Tit-for-tat retaliation

434   Table 4 presents results for the analysis to determine whether there is an observed "tit-for-tat"
435   nature to the adoption of SPS standards. Column (1) reports the results for the full sample
436   of importing and exporting countries. In Column (2), we restrict the sample to include
437   only high-income exporters and importers as defined by the World Bank. This is to omit
438   any potential biases from the fact that developing countries had difficulty registering their
439   notifications in the early years of the WTO Bacchetta and Beverelli (2012). Comparing across
440   Columns (1) and (2) of Table 4, we see that results are robust to this sample restriction.
441      In both columns of Table 4, coefficient estimates for control variables are similar in
442   direction and magnitude to those from the STC analysis in Table 3. Marginal changes in
443   GDP for the importing country correspond to an increase in the propensity to implement a
444   standard (statistically significant at 99%). The same is not true for exporting country GDP.
445   The probability that an importer adopts an SPS standard is also increasing in the value of
446   (lagged) bilateral trade for the corresponding exporter-product.

447      Turning to the regulatory response variables SP Seip and SP Sei,p , we find that when one
448   country implements an SPS standard affecting another country, such a measure increases
449   the probability that the targeted country will respond with a standard of its own directed at
450   the instigating country. We observe this response within the product group of the original
451   measure (SP Seip ) and outside the product group of the original measure (SP Sei,p ). An SPS
452   notification within a product group increases the probability of an SPS measure with 2.72% in
453   Column (1) and 2.57% in Column (2). As noted above, we cannot identify a response within
454   a product code as retaliation due to potential legitimate spatial spread of disease. Because it
455   is reasonable to assume that these legitimate responses only occur within the product groups
456   affected by the original measure, we interpret a response to an SPS notification in another
457   product group as strong evidence of retaliation.

458      The outside-product-group regulatory response is measured as 1.08% in Column (1)
459   and 1.15% in Column (2). Note that--because we have included both the within- and
460   outside-product response, variable SP Sei,p is interpreted ceteris paribus relative to the
461   within-product response. Thus, this behavior cannot be explained by standards--such as
462   changes to food safety laws--which affect many product codes at once. Note also that the
463   coefficient estimate on SP Sei,p , measured as approximately 1% in both Columns (1) and
464   (2), is the average probability of response for a single product code, whereas the probability
465   of outside-product retaliation across all products is this probability multiplied by the total
466   number of product codes with non-zero trade value, which are not affected by the original
467   measure. At the two digit level, the coefficient estimate on SP Sei,p suggests that about
468   3,000 bilateral trade flows--or just over $110 billion in trade--were subject to retaliatory
469   standards in 2015.


470   4.4    Strategic goods and trade partners

471   Having found evidence of "tit-for-tat" behavior in the adoption of SPS measures, we next ask
472   whether the types of products and trade partners against which we observe such behavior
473   exhibit patterns consistent with retaliation. Table 5 reports results for the frequency of "tit-for-
474   tat" standards adoption for strategic trade partners and politically sensitive goods. Column
475   (1) focuses on regulatory response among members of mutual regional trade agreements.
476   Column (2) focuses on regulatory response for strategic goods (as defined in Section 3).
477      Most interestingly, coefficient estimates for control variables F T A and Ln(Trade) across
478   Columns (1) and (2) of Table 5 suggest that--holding constant SPS regulatory behavior
479   of trade partners--strong trade networks reduce the use of SPS standards. Refer first to
480   the coefficient estimates on F T A. Recall that this variable was statistically insignificant
481   in the baseline estimates in Table 4. In contrast, in both Columns of Table 5, coefficient
482   estimates on F T A are negative and statistically significant at 95%. Coefficient estimates
483   for Ln(Trade) suggest a similar conclusion. In Table 4, the variable elicited a positive and

484   statistically significant regulator response. In contrast, while the value of trade remains
485   positively correlated with standards adoption in Column (1) of Table 5, the correlation is
486   effectively zero in magnitude. The variable is associated with a negative and statistically
487   insignificant response in Column (2). Coefficient estimates for importer and exporter GDP
488   are consistent with those for the STC and Standards Adoption analyses above. As in Tables
489   3 and 4, we observe a positive, and statistically significant, relationship between importer
490   GDP and adoption of standards. The same does not hold for exporter GDP.
491      Whereas coefficient estimates for control variables suggest that--holding constant SPS
492   regulatory behavior of trade partners--strong trade networks reduce the use of SPS standards,
493   the variables of primary interest in Column (1) of Table 5 suggest that such networks
494   equally increase the probability of regulatory response when a partner country threatens the
495   relationship. Consistent with results in Table 4, coefficient estimates for SP Seip and SP Sei,p
496   are positive and statistically significant in Column (1). When these variables are interacted
497   with our indicator for the existence of a mutual trade agreement, this regulatory response
498   increases. The coefficient estimate for variable SP Sei,p in Column (1) of Table 5 suggests
499   that imposition of an SPS measure by one country affecting another country increases the
500   probability that the second country will institute an SPS measure of its own directed at
501   the first country (in a product group outside that of the original measure). For a trade
502   partner with whom the affected country is not in a mutual trade agreement, this increase
503   in probability is 1.06% for a given product category. This is almost identical to response
504   measured under the baseline results in Table 4 (1.08%). Referring to the interaction term
505   SP Sei,p *FTA, the regulatory response increases to 1.30% when the instigating country and
506   targeted country are members of a mutual trade agreement.
507      Referring to Column (2) of Table 5, we examine the observed regulatory response for the
508   subset of observations for which the original standard is implemented against a strategic
509   trade flow from the perspective of the exporter. For this subsample of observations, we
510   contrast regulatory response against products that are strategic (as defined in Section 3) from

511   the perspective of the importing country versus products that are not considered strategic.
512   Results are highly suggestive of retaliation.
513       For "non-strategic" product categories from the perspective of the importing country,
514   indicator SP Seip suggests a within-product regulatory response similar to that from the
515   baseline specification in Table 4, though smaller in magnitude. As discussed throughout
516   this manuscript, non-retaliatory and legitimate justifications likely comprise a substantial
517   component of indicator SP Seip . For outside-product regulatory response, for which there is
518   no legitimate justification, we do not observe a regulatory response targeting non-strategic
519   products from the perspective of the instigating country. The coefficient estimate for variable
520   SP Sei,p is small in magnitude and statistically insignificant.
521       In contrast, for "strategic" products from the perspective of the importing country, we
522   see an extremely large regulatory response, for which there is no reasonable justification for
523   such "tit-for-tat" behavior. The coefficient estimate for the interaction SP Sei,p *Strategic
524   suggests this response is 18.70% (0.1859 + 0.0011) for a given strategic product, compared to
525   1.08% in the baseline results. We observe exactly the opposite for within-product "tit-for-tat"
526   behavior in strategic product categories. Referring to interaction SP Seip *Strategic, we see
527   that the strategic nature of the product category reduces the probability of within-product
528   regulatory response by 10.12% (-0.1153 + 0.0141).



529   5     Conclusion

530   The disconnect between what constitutes a legitimate standard as a matter of law and the
531   underlying economic purposes for implementing such a standard creates situations in which
532   countries have been negatively affected by public standards are nevertheless left without
533   recourse under the WTO dispute settlement mechanism when such measures satisfy the low
534   hurdle for legal legitimacy under international rules. In this research, we construct a dataset
535   that matches adoption of sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) standards between 1995­2015

536   with SPS committee data on specific trade concerns and annual, bilateral trade flows to test
537   whether (i) countries targeted with a public standard respond with a standard of their own,
538   and (ii) if such a regulatory response exists, whether it follows a pattern consistent with
539   retaliation.
540      We find that SPS measures imposed by one country against another increase the probability
541   that the country targeted by the original measure will respond with an SPS measure of its
542   own. We observe that this type of tit-for-tat behavior commonly occurred outside the product
543   group of the original measure and for politically strategic goods. At the two digit level, our
544   results suggest that about 3,000 bilateral trade flows globally--or just over $110 billion in
545   trade--were subject to retaliatory standards in 2015.
546      These findings are of significance to current policy debates. In many countries, recent
547   months have seen an increased willingness among politicians to engage in public tariff wars.
548   Such practices result in economic inefficiencies that generate deadweight losses to affected
549   industries (Gros, 1987). This paper documents the use of "under-the-radar" retaliation in
550   the use of public standards between 1996­2015. Though these "standards wars" generate less
551   public outcry than overt tariff wars, they are likely a less economically efficient mechanism--in
552   ad valorem equivalent terms--to achieve retaliation. Levied duties increase taxpayer revenues
553   to offset a portion of the deadweight losses to industry caused by a tariff war. Such is not
554   the case in the context of retaliation via NTBs.
555      Of course, as with any research, our findings are not without qualifications. Perhaps most
556   importantly, our analysis focuses on a very narrow mechanism of retaliation--use of SPS
557   measures in response to SPS measures. We believe sanitary and phytosanitary measures
558   are a particularly desirable mechanism through which to search for retaliation because such
559   measures primarily target agricultural and food products, an important aspect of trade
560   (either imports or exports or both) for virtually every country in the world. However, a much
561   broader set of political actions may induce retaliation via public standards and, likewise,
562   use of public standards may induce retaliation through a broader set of political actions.

563   We leave for future research analysis of these broader political actions both as catalysts or
564   vehicles for economic retaliation.
565      Additionally, current research suggests that--in limited situations--some public standards
566   may be trade enhancing for the targeted countries and products. Implementation of trade-
567   enhancing standards is unlikely to induce retaliation. For the purposes of our analysis, we
568   are unable to distinguish between standards that negatively affect trade with the targeted
569   countries and those that act as a catalyst to trade. One can imagine as an avenue for future
570   research some sort of two-step model which first determines whether a particular standard
571   was trade-enhancing or trade-reducing and then analyzes whether regulatory response in
572   affected countries varies depending on the outcome of the first stage.

Appendix A

This appendix explores the robustness of our STC and "tit-for-tat" results to alternate
variable construction and the use of the Probit estimator. As shown in Sections A.1 and
A.2, our findings are generally robust to these analysis. As noted in Section 3, non-linear
estimators, including Probit, are inconsistent here due to the incidental parameters problem.
Nevertheless, we present Probit results for robustness purposes.


A.1     Robustness for STC estimation

Columns (1) and (2) of Table A1 report results for continuous, rather than indicator,
constructions of the SPS and STC variables. As in Table 3, we report results both for
initial and ongoing STCs. As seen in Table A1, STC results are robust to this alternative
construction of SPS and STC variables. As shown in Columns (1) and (2), the coefficient
estimate on STCei is positive and statistically significant at 99%. Because both the dependent
and explanatory variable are defined continuously, the interpretation of this coefficient has
changed. The coefficient estimate in Column (1) suggests that--at the margin--an additional
STC raised by the exporter against the importer corresponds to an additional 3 SPS measures
instituted by the exporter against the importer. The interpretation is similar for the ongoing
STC construction in Column (2).
   Columns (3) and (4) of Table A1 present results of conducting the STC estimation via
Probit rather than LMP. Coefficient estimates reported in Columns (3) and (4) are the
average marginal effect from the Probit estimator. Note that for the purposes of the Probit
estimation, we have returned to the indicator specifications of the STC and SPS variables
used in the body of the manuscript. Consistent with results for the primary specifications in
Section 4, we see that initiation of an STC by an exporter against an importer is associated
with an increase in the probability that the exporter will institute an SPS standard against
the importer outside the products included in the original measure. We note that this effect

include only initial--rather than on-going--STC complaints.


A.2     Robustness for `tit-for-tat' estimation

Table A2 provides the results of Probit robustness checks for the standards adoption analysis.
Column (1) reports Probit results for the baseline specification and sample. Columns (2)
and (3), respectively, report results for strategic trade partners and strategic goods. As with
Appendix A.1, "tit-for-tat" results are generally robust to the Probit analysis.
   Referring to Column (1) of Table A2, coefficient estimates for variables SP Seip and
SP Sei,p are positive and statistically significant as in Table 4. The magnitude of the
within-product coefficient is comparable in magnitude to LPM results: 2.66% in Table A2
versus 2.72% in Table 4. The outside-product coefficient (SP Sei,p ) is substantially larger in

magnitude in the Probit specification (5.95% in Table A2 versus 1.08% in Table 4) because
product categories for which we observe only zero trade flows are dropped from the analysis.
   Similarly, in Column (2) of Table A2 coefficient estimates for variables SP Seip and
SP Sei,p are also positive and statistically significant. Results are of comparable magnitude
to those in Column (1) of the Table. Referring to interaction term SP Sei,p *FTA, the point
estimate is positive as with our LPM estimates. However, results are statistically insignificant
in Table A2.
   Results of the strategic goods analysis in Column (3) of Table A2 are also qualitatively
unchanged compared to the LPM results reported in Section 4.4 of the manuscript. Compare

interaction terms for "tit-for-tat" behavior in product categories that are strategic from
the perspective of the importing country (SP Seip *Strategic and SP Sei,p *Strategic) versus
regulatory response for product categories that are not strategic (SP Seip and SP Sei,p ).
For non-strategic goods, we observe a positive and statistically significant within-product
regulatory response. However, this within-product regulatory response turns substantially
negative for strategic trade flows. The opposite is true for the outside-product regulatory
response in which retaliation would most likely occur. For non-strategic products, we observe
a negative response of 7.57%. For strategic product categories, we observe a very large,
positive and statistically significant response to standards implemented against trade flows
that are strategic from the perspective of the exporter.
