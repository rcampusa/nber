                                            ABSTRACT

Using non-linear methods, we argue that existing estimates of government spending multipliers in
expansion and recession may yield biased results by ignoring whether government spending is increasing
or decreasing. In the case of OECD countries, the problem originates in the fact that, contrary to
one’s priors, it is not always the case that government spending is going up in recessions (i.e., acting
countercyclically). In almost as many cases, government spending is actually going down (i.e., acting
procyclically). Since the economy does not respond symmetrically to government spending increases
or decreases, the “true” long-run multiplier for bad times (and government spending going up) turns
out to be 2.3 compared to 1.3 if we just distinguish between recession and expansion. In extreme
recessions, the long-run multiplier reaches 3.1.

1        Introduction

The recent global nancial crisis and ensuing recession triggered major scal stimulus packages

throughout the industrial world as well as in several emerging markets. The e¤ectiveness of

these scal packages remains, however, an open question. In fact, the size of the government

spending multipliers in the academic literature has varied widely, from negative values to

positive values as high as 4.

        Why do estimates vary so widely? An obvious explanation is the use of di¤erent method-

ologies.       Indeed, there has been an intense debate in the literature regarding the proper

identi cation of scal shocks. The widely-used identi cation method of Blanchard and Per-

otti in the context of structural vector-autoregression models (SVAR), which relies on the

existence of a one-quarter lag between output and a scal response, has been called into ques-

tion by Ramey (2011) on the basis that what is an orthogonal shock for an SVAR may not be

so for private forecasters. In other words, there seems to be, at least for the United States, a

non-trivial correlation between orthogonal innovations in a SVAR and private forecasts. To

remedy this, Barro and Redlick (2011) and Romer and Romer (2010) have suggested, respec-

tively, the use of a natural experiment approach (military buildups in the United States)

or a narrative approach for the case of taxes.

        Another reason for di¤erent estimates could be that the size of             scal multipliers may

depend on various characteristics of the economy in question, including degree of openness,

exchange rate regime, and the state of the business cycle.1                The latter factor appears as

particularly relevant for policymakers since scal stimulus in industrial countries is typically

undertaken in bad times and hence, one could argue, the relevant multiplier is not an average

multiplier over the business cycle but the one that applies in bad times. There is thus reason

to believe that the size of scal multipliers could well depend on the business cycle.

   From a technical standpoint, dividing the classical SVAR regression samples into expan-

sions and recessions could severely compromise the number of observations used in the analysis

as well as miss inherent non-linearities in the economys response to scal stimulus. A poten-

tial solution is the use of non-linear, regime-switching type regressions, which have been used

in some studies for the United States and other industrial countries. Speci cally, Fazzari et

al. (2012) extend Chan and Tongs (1986) early work on Threshold Autorregresive Models

(TAR) to a multivariate setting in order to create a Threshold SVAR (TSVAR) model. In

a TSVAR, the parameters are allowed to switch according to whether a threshold variable

crosses an estimated threshold (capacity utilization in this case). A possible drawback of this

methodology lies in the potential arbitrariness of the threshold selection.    In Fazzari et al.

(2012), the threshold is estimated from the data but it could still be argued that the selection

of the threshold variable itself is arbitrary.

   In a related, but di¤erent, approach, Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (AG) (2010) solve

the issue of threshold selection by extending early work by Granger and Teravistra (1993)

on Smooth Transition Autoregressive models (STAR) in order to accommodate simultaneous

equation analysis in a Smooth Transition Vector Autoregressive model (STVAR). In this

model the transition across states is controlled by an underlying smooth logistic distribution

with a weight (or probability) given by a moving average of real GDP growth. For the United

States, Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (2010) conclude that the spending multiplier is around

zero in expansions and 1.5-2.0 in recessions. Using a linear model, the estimate would be

around one, thus underestimating it for recessions and overestimating it for expansions. In

Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (2012), they resort to an alternative methodology  advocated

by Jorda (2005) and Stock and Watson (2007)  that relies on running a separate regression

for each horizon and then constructing the impulse response function. This direct projection

method does not impose the dynamic restrictions implicitly embedded in VARs and can easily

accommodate non-linearities in the response function. They conclude, for a panel of OECD

                                                 3
countries, that the multiplier reaches a maximum of 3.5 during recessions and essentially zero

during expansions.

    This paper tackles the same question (do scal multipliers depend on the state of the

business cycle?) but brings into the picture a new dimension, which we believe is critical for

evaluating the size of scal multipliers in good and bad times. The new dimension is whether

government spending is going up or down.                To understand intuitively why this may be a

critical dimension, notice that when we talk about scal multipliers in good and bad times,

the implicit world that we have in mind is one in which scal policy is countercyclical (i.e..,

government spending increases in bad times and falls in good times), as has traditionally

been the case for industrial countries.2 As illustrated in Table 1, however, this is not true in

about 44 percent of the time!3 Speci cally, by combining good/bad times with government

spending going up or down, Table 1 tells us how much time the economy spends, on average,

in each of the possible four states of the world (top gures in every cell, which add up to 100

percent).4    For example, cell (1,1) indicates that industrial countries spend, on average, 29

percent of the time in good times with government spending going down.                        The table thus

tells us that industrial countries spend, on average, 56 percent of the time in countercyclical

states of the world; that is, the sum of cells (1,1) and (2,2). The rest of the time (44 percent),

government spending is either going down in bad times (cell (2,1)) or going up in good times

(cell (1,2)), which would constitute procyclical scal policy.

    Furthermore, conditional on being in bad times, government spending is going down in 46

percent of the time (bottom gure in cell (2,1)). Hence, when we compute a multiplier for bad
   2
     Of course, the current austerity programs in the Eurozone constitute procyclical scal policy, which had
traditionally been observed only in developing countries (see, for instance, Kaminsky, Reinhart, and Vegh
(2004), and Frankel, Vegh, and Vuletin (2013)).
   3
     To tell our story, we are, of course, implicitly assuming that causation goes from the cycle to scal policy.
Our estimates below will control for this.
   4
     In Table 1, we compute the cyclical component of output and government spending using annual data and
the Hodrick-Prescott lter. For the purposes of Table 1, a recession (expansion) is de ned as a situation in
which the cyclical component of output  the di¤erence between the current level of output and its trend  is
negative (positive). The same criterion was used for government spending.




                                                       4
times, we are putting in the same bag very di¤erent situations: the case of government spending

going up in bad times (which we will refer to as countercyclical scal multiplier) and the

case of government spending going down in bad times (or procyclical scal multiplier).5 If

government spending going up or down did not matter for the size of the multiplier, then

this would not be a problem. If it does matter (as we will show), then we would be biasing

our estimate.6     Instead of estimating the multiplier for cell (2,2), so to speak, we would be

estimating an average of the multiplier for cells (2,1) or (2,2).7

       Our results con rm our intuition. When we compute multipliers for OECD countries for

each of the four states of the world captured in Table 1, we nd that the largest multiplier

(after 2 and 4 semesters) corresponds to cell (2,2), reaching 2.3 after four semesters. In other

words, the countercyclical         scal multiplier in bad times is the largest of the four possible

multipliers.     If we ignore the distinction of government spending going up or down, the

resulting multiplier is just 1.3.       The bias comes from the fact that the long-run multiplier

for cell (2,1) is not signi cantly di¤erent from zero.             Hence, ignoring whether government

spending is going up or down implicitly gives us an average of cells (2,1) and (2,2); that is,

an average of the countercyclical and procyclical scal multipliers in bad times.

       All the results reported so far refer to scal multipliers computed for the median ex-

pansion and recession. We also looked, however, at what happens in extreme booms and

recessions. We nd that the multiplier in extreme recessions is much larger than in typical

recessions (almost 70 percent higher). But perhaps the most striking result when considering

extreme recessions is that lower government spending reduces output by more than one. In
   5
     We will use an analogous terminology for good times: government spending going down (up) yields a
countercyclical (procylical) scal multiplier.
   6
     A simple theoretical example where it would matter is a situation of full employment (i.e., good times)
in a sticky-prices model. In such a case, we would expect an increase in government spending to have no e¤ect
on output (i.e., a zero multiplier) while a reduction in government spending would lead to a positive multiplier.
In AGs (2010, 2012) view of the world, these two multipliers are implicitly assumed to be the same.
   7
     A similar message emerges when we compute a version of Table 1 using government spending forecast
errors, as shown in Table 2.      In this case, expansionary (contractionary) government spending refers to a
positive (negative) forecast error, and expansion (recession) is computed as explained in Section 2.




                                                       5
particular, the impact multiplier is 1.2. In terms of the current debate on austerity in the

Eurozone, our results would indicate that the remedy could be worse than the disease in

the sense that debt to GDP ratios would actually increase on impact, as a result of a scal

contraction.

        The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 discusses the data and the methodology that

follows the direct projection method mentioned above.                Section 3 presents our estimates

in the following order: (i) single (or non-linear) multipliers; (ii) multipliers in expansions

and recessions; (iii) multipliers when government spending is going up and down; and (iv)

multipliers taking into account both recession/expansion and government spending going up

or down.       Section 4 presents our estimates for extreme recessions or booms and compare

them with our previous estimates (which apply to the median recession or boom). Section 6

concludes.

2.1       Data

Our sample comprises 29 OECD countries.8 We use semiannual data for seasonally-adjusted

real government spending (G), seasonally-adjusted real GDP (Y ), both in logarithmic terms,

and government spending forecast errors (F E G ) computed as the di¤erence between actual,

 rst-release series of the government spending growth rate and the forecast series prepared by

professional forecasters.9 As discussed in detail in AG (2010, 2012), F E G provides a conve-

nient way to identify unanticipated government purchases, which enables us to appropriately

estimate scal multipliers. This surprise government spending shock captures unanticipated

2.2      Methodology

We follow the single-equation approach advocated by Jorda (2005) and Stock and Watson

(2007), which does not impose the dynamic restrictions implicitly embedded in the SVAR

methodology and can conveniently accommodate non-linearities in the response function. For

this purpose, linear local projections (LP) of output growth on lags and current change of

government expenditure and other controls are used for the construction of impulse response

functions (IRF). As discussed in Jorda (2005), there are multiple advantages in the use of LP.

In particular, LP (i) can be estimated by single-regression techniques (least-squares dummy

variables or LSDV in our case), (ii) are more robust to potential misspeci cations, and (iii)

can easily accommodate highly non-linear and exible speci cations that may be impractical

in a multivariate SVAR context. In all of our regression analysis, we use robust Driscoll and

Kraay (1998) standard errors to correct for potential heteroskedasticity, autocorrelation in

the lags, and error correlation across panels.

   In our basic linear speci cation (Section 3.1), the accumulated response of output growth

at the horizon h is estimated from the following regression:


                                G                                                        2
   Yi;t+h =     i;h   +   h F Ei;t   + h (L)Yi;t1 +   h (L)Gi;t1   + '1 Tt;h + '2 Tt;h + i;t;h ;   (1)



where i and t index countries and time, respectively,           i   is the country xed e¤ect, Yi;t+h 

Yi;t+h    Yi;t1 , and T controls  as in Owyang, Ramey, and Zubairy (2013)  for potential

time trends.     It is important to note that, in this approach, each step in the accumulated

IRF is obtained from a di¤erent individual equation. We thus obtain the IRF values directly

from the    h   estimated coe¢cients.          Unlike a VAR speci cation, the estimated coe¢cients

contained in the polynomial lags (L) and            (L) are not used directly to build the IRF values


                                                      7
but only serve as controls, cleaning the               h   from the dynamic e¤ects of output and the e¤ects

of past government expenditure changes. Following standard practice, spending multipliers

are then constructed by multiplying the IRF values by the mean value of Y =G.

      We then follow AG (2012) and compute non-linear scal multipliers in economic expansions

and recessions for OECD countries (Sections 3.2 and 4). For this purpose, we modify our linear

speci cation (1) as follows:


                                                                    G                            G
          Yi;t+h =        i;h   + (1     I (xi;t1 ))       E;h F Ei;t   + I (xi;t1 )   R;h F Ei;t   +         (2)

                          + (1     I (xi;t1 )) E;h (L)Yi;t1 + I (xi;t1 ) R;h (L)Yi;t1 +

                          + (1     I (xi;t1 ))    E;h (L)Gi;t1           + I (xi;t1 )   R;h (L)Gi;t1   +

                                         2

with
                                                         e xi;t
                                         I (xi;t ) =               ;          > 0:
                                                       1 + e xi;t

      Following AG (2012), I(:) is a transition function for each country that ranges between 0

(largest expansion) and 1 (deepest recession). xi;t is a normalized variable measuring the state

of the business cycle which, using the 7-quarter moving average of the growth rate of output,

is then normalized such that E(xi;t ) = 0 and V ar(xi;t ) = 1 for each i.10 The common practice

in this emerging literature (e.g., Owyang, Ramey, and Zubairy (2013)) has been to evaluate

the size of the spending multipliers under what we call extreme business cycle conditions.

That is to say, the impact of scal policy is evaluated for the largest expansion (i.e., I(:) = 0)

or the deepest recession (i.e., I(:) = 1).                   While relevant under some particular historical

circumstances (like the deep recessions currently underway in several Eurozone countries),

these extreme conditions are, by de nition, rather infrequent and do not capture normal

expansions or recessions.          For this reason, in Section 3.2 we rst compute the multipliers

for what we call typical (or, more precisely, median) expansions and recessions.                            De ning

a typical recession or expansion is, by no means a trivial matter, as we would need to use

weighted averages of         E;h   and    R;h   in the construction of the IRF and the corresponding

multiplier.     Based on the median value of x during expansions and recessions, we capture

the median recession using I(:) = 0:7 (and, thus, 1                   I(:) = 0:3).      By the same token, we

capture the median expansion using 1                 I(:) = 0:7 (and, thus, I(:) = 0:3).11            In Section 4,

we will then compare the multipliers obtained under typical expansions and recessions with

those obtained under extreme expansions and recessions.

    To x ideas, we now report some numbers regarding the typical and extreme business cycle

conditions in our sample of OECD countries. In all cases, these gures refer to median values.

The 7-quarter moving average of the growth rate of output in a typical recession is 0.3 percent,

compared to -1.0 percent in an extreme recession.                   The corresponding gures for a typical

and extreme expansion are 0.9 and 3.2 percent, respectively.                      As will become clear below,

important policy implications will arise from comparing typical and extreme business cycle

conditions, particularly regarding (i) the expansionary e¤ect of government spending under

alternative recessionary environments, and (ii) how the e¤ectiveness of austerity packages may

crucially depend upon the severity of the recessionary environment.

    One of the main novelties of this paper is to assess potential asymmetric e¤ects on output of

government spending depending on whether government spending is increasing or decreasing.

Before interacting this new dimension with the state of the business cycle, we rst evaluate

in Section 3.3 whether the size of the scal multiplier may depend on whether government

spending is going up or down (without considering the state of the business cycle). For this
  11
     Although the point estimates of the IRF and multipliers are straightforward to calculate (we use the
weighted average of E;h and R;h ), standard errors also need to account for the covariance between E;h
and R;h . We use the following formulation for the weighted average of the standard errors:  a E +b R =
q

3     Estimates of spending multipliers

We rst present estimates for the linear (single) multiplier, then for multipliers in recession

and expansion, then for multipliers that di¤erentiate between increases and decreases in gov-

ernment spending, and nally for multipliers that take into account both expansion/recession

and government spending going up or down.


3.1   Linear multiplier

As a natural rst step  and following speci cation (1)  we compute the cumulative scal

multiplier, which is illustrated in Figure 1. The multiplier is 0.31 on impact (and signi cantly

di¤erent from zero) and hovers around 0.40 for the remaining three semesters. This linear (or

single) multiplier provides us with a benchmark to rst revisit the AG exercise of computing

multipliers in expansions and recessions and later examining whether it matters if government

spending is going up or down.


3.2   Multipliers in recession and expansion

Based on speci cation (2), we now compute the scal multipliers in economic expansions and

recessions.   Tables 1 and 2 show that OECD countries have spent about 50 percent of the

time in recession and 50 percent of the time in expansion. The multipliers associated with

expansion and recession are illustrated in Figure 2, panels A and B.

    As in AG (2012) we nd that the scal multiplier in recessions is larger than in expansions.

In the case of recessions, the multiplier is 0.73 on impact (and signi cantly di¤erent from zero)

and reaches a peak of 1.25 after four semesters. In contrast, in expansions the multiplier is

0.09 (and not signi cantly di¤erent from zero) on impact and remains insigni cant for any

horizon.

    The critical point to emerge out of this exercise of is that one can think of the single



                                               11
multiplier illustrated in Figure 1 as an average of panels A and B in Figure 2 that masks the

estimate that we are presumably most interested in (i.e., the multiplier during recessions when

policymakers are trying to stimulate the economy in order to raise output and employment).

   Taken at face value, the policy implication of this nding is clear: increasing government

spending in periods of recessions (as Keynesian considerations would call for) would stimulate

output whereas increasing it in times of expansion would have essentially no e¤ects. Further,

since we have made no distinction between increases and decreases in government spending,

it would also follow that reducing government spending in recessions (as many developing

countries have historically done and many industrial countries are currently doing) would be

quite contractionary whereas reducing spending in good times would have little, if any, e¤ect.


3.3   Multipliers when government spending is increasing/decreasing

Following the empirical speci cation (3), we will rst evaluate whether government going up

or down matters for the size of the     scal multiplier (i.e., even before taking into account

the state of the business cycle).   Table 1 indicates that government spending is above the

long-term trend 48 percent of the time and below such trend 52 percent of the time. In a

similar vein, Table 2 indicates that forecast errors are positive (F E G > 0) 57 percent of the

time and negative (F E G < 0) 43 percent of the time.

   Figure 3 shows the scal multipliers associated with government spending decreases (panel

A) and increases (panel B). Interestingly enough, we nd that the scal multiplier associated

with increases in government spending is larger than the one associated with decreases in gov-

ernment spending. In fact, the multiplier for government spending increases is 0.49 on impact

(and signi cantly di¤erent from zero) and reaches a maximum of 1.36 after four semesters. In

sharp contrast, the multiplier when government spending falls is never signi cantly di¤erent

from zero.

   When comparing these multipliers to the ones obtained in Section 3.2, interesting similar-

                                              12
ities emerge. The pro le obtained for the scal multiplier in periods of expansion (Figure 2,

panel A) is similar to the scal multiplier associated with decreases in government spending

(Figure 3, panel A). Both multipliers are not signi cantly di¤erent from zero. By the same

token, the pro le obtained for the scal multiplier in recessions (Figure 2, panel B) is similar

to the scal multipliers associated with increases in government spending (Figure 3, panel B).

Both scal multipliers have initial values that are less than 1 (but signi cantly di¤erent from

zero) and long-run values that are larger than 1.


3.4   Fiscal multipliers in recessions and expansions: Does it matter whether

      government spending is increasing or decreasing?

Motivated by the ndings from Sections 3.2 and 3.3, we now follow speci cation (4) and look

into the possible interaction between recession/expansion and government spending increasing

or decreasing.

   Since we know from Figure 3 that, all else equal, the multiplier is higher when government

spending is going up than down, one would conjecture that we are underestimating the mul-

tiplier in recessions because, on many occasions, government spending is going down instead

of up (which is the implicit expectation).   To correct for this bias, one should compute

the multiplier only in situations of recessions and government spending going up (i.e., the

countercyclical scal multiplier in bad times).

   To this e¤ect, Figure 4 depicts the multiplier for each of the four possible categories: (i)

expansion and decrease in government spending (panel A); (ii) expansion and increase in

government spending (panel B); (iii) recession and decrease in government spending (panel

C); and (iv) recession and increase in government spending (panel D).

   Perhaps not surprisingly, the largest multiplier (in the medium and long-run) corresponds

to category (iv); that is, recession and increase in government spending (Figure 4, panel D).

In this case, the impact multiplier is 0.68 (and signi cantly di¤erent from zero) and reaches

                                              13
2.28 after four semesters. The long-run (i.e., after 4 semesters) scal multiplier in this scenario

is almost twice as large (2.28 versus 1.25) than the one found in Figure 2, panel B when we just

focused on recessions without distinguishing between government spending going up or down.

In sum, we see that, by not di¤erentiating between increases or reductions in government

spending, we are underestimating the value of the multiplier when government spending

increases in bad times, which is presumably the case that we care the most. Conceptually,

the multiplier shown in Figure 2, panel B is an average of panels C and D in Figure 4.

   In contrast, the long-run output e¤ect of reducing government spending in a recession

(Figure 4, panel C) is not signi cantly di¤erent from zero (and point estimates are always

smaller than 1 at any time horizon). In other words, the long term e¤ects of scal austerity

packages that emphasize government spending cuts seem to be relatively small (particularly

when executed under typical recessionary environments).        The impact multiplier, however,

is 0.76 (and signi cantly di¤erent from zero) and reaches a peak of 0.79 (and signi cantly

di¤erent from zero) after 1 semester. But after around 2 semesters, the multiplier becomes

insigni cant. This implies that the short term e¤ects of scal austerity packages that empha-

size government spending cuts are not trivial (this result emerges only when distinguishing

government increases from decreases). In other words, and all else equal, this implies that the

debt to GDP ratio will, in principle, barely improve in the short-term as a one dollar spend-

ing cut will reduce GDP by around 80 cents within a one year framework. These results are

consistent with the short-run pain, long-run gain arguments often made when considering

the implications of austerity packages. As we will see in Section 4, this is not the case when

evaluating the implications of scal austerity packages in the context of extreme recessionary

environments, where the remedy could actually be worse than the disease, and debt to GDP

ratios could worsen on impact as a consequence of scal tightening.

   A similar (yet less dramatic) situation arises when considering expansions, as illustrated

in Figure 4, panel A and B. Recall that when we do not di¤erentiate between government

                                               14
spending going up or down, the multiplier is zero (Figure 2, panel A). Once we make this

distinction, the multiplier when government spending is going up becomes signi cantly dif-

ferent from zero after about 1 semester, eventually reaching 1.13, as follows from Figure 4,

panel B. In contrast, 4, panel A indicates that the scal multiplier is essentially zero at all

horizons in the case that government spending is falling during an expansion.

    In sum, the picture that emerges appears to be that countercyclical scal policy is rather

e¤ective in smoothing out output uctuations (due to the e¤ect of expansionary scal policy

in recessions) whereas procyclical scal policy worsens output volatility (particularly due to

the e¤ect of expansionary scal policy in expansions). Our ndings call for a reduction in

government spending during expansions (to avoid further increases in output and improve

the so-called  scal space). During a recession, the rst best (in terms of reducing output

uctuations) calls for an increase in government spending. Having said that, while having

a negative e¤ect on output, a reduction in spending may help improve the debt to GDP

ratio and the so-called  scal space since the reduction in output on impact associated with

a dollar cut is smaller than one.    As we will see in Section 4, this is not the case when

evaluating the implications of scal austerity packages in the context of extreme recessionary

environments.



4    Typical versus extreme business cycles

This section evaluates the size of scal multipliers in more severe/extreme recessions (like

the ones recently experienced in some OECD countries) or, alternatively, during extreme

booms. First, what happens when we do not di¤erentiate between increases and decreases in

government spending? Like in typical expansions, the multiplier in extreme expansions is not

signi cantly di¤erent from zero on impact and remains insigni cant for any horizon (Figure 5,

panel A). In contrast, however, the scal multiplier in extreme recessions (panel B) is much



                                             15
larger than in typical recessions; almost 70 percent higher. On impact, the scal multiplier

in a typical recession is smaller than one (0.73) but greater than one (1.21) in an extreme

recession. In the long run, while the scal multiplier is 1.25 in a typical recession, it reaches

2.08 in an extreme recession. In other words, the size of the scal multiplier signi cantly

increases with the severity of the recession but remains zero during booms.

       What happens if we also di¤erentiate between increases and decreases in government

spending?      Figure 6 shows the results. Two results are worth noting.                 First, the size of

the scal multiplier associated with spending increases in extreme recessions (Figure 6, panel

D) is almost 40 percent larger than in typical recessions (Figure 4, panel D): the impact

e¤ect increases from 0.68 to 0.92 and the long-run e¤ect increases from 2.28 to 3.14. This

result highlights the importance of pursuing stimulus packages, particularly as the state of the

economy worsens. The bang (in terms of output gains) for the buck increases as the recession

becomes worse.13

       Second, the implications of spending cuts change signi cantly.              While, as discussed in

section 3.4, our ndings for typical recessions were consistent with the short-run pain and

long-run gain arguments often heard when considering the implications of austerity packages,

this is not the case when focusing on extreme recessions.               In extreme scenarios, the e¤ect

on both output and, hence, on the debt to GDP ratio is still driven by the short-run pain,

long-run gain kind of argument, but the short-run pain may actually be associated with a

worsening in the debt to GDP ratio. As Figure 6, panel C shows, the e¤ect on output of a one

dollar spending cut in an extreme recession is always larger than one. While, on impact, the

size of the scal multiplier associated with a spending decrease is 0.76 for a typical recession,

it reaches 1.23 in an extreme recession.          Moreover, the long run e¤ect reaches about 1.60

(borderline not signi cant).        In other words, a half-full glass view (which emphasizes the
  13
    This evidence is consistent with that of Vegh and Vuletin (2014) who nd that pursuing countercyclical
 scal policies during GDP crises reduces the duration and intensity (measured as the fall in output from start
to trough) of GDP crises.



                                                     16
statistically non-signi cance observed after a year in Figure 6, panel C) would still worry

about the market and social implications posed by the short-run debt to GDP dynamics.

A half-empty glass view (which emphasizes the larger than one impact e¤ect) would argue

that the remedy could be worse than the disease, and debt to GDP ratios could worsen as

a consequence of      scal tightening as the denominator decreases at a faster rate than the

numerator. This pessimistic interpretation is consistent with the recent evidence observed

in Greece where, in spite of large scal cuts, the debt to GDP ratio has increased rather than

decreased.



5    Explaining the di¤erences in observed scal multipliers

Given the di¤erences observed across          scal multipliers in Section 4, this section provides

some insights on the transmission mechanisms involved that could explain such di¤erences.14

While the objective of this section is not to develop a theoretical model that could explain our

empirical ndings, we aim at showing some key underlying forces that might help rationalize

our previous ndings and identify factors that could serve as the basis for future theoretical

research in this area. For this purpose, we replicate the exercise of Section 4 and speci cation
  14
     While this section focuses on extreme recessions and booms, similar results follow when analyzing the
e¤ects during typical recessions and booms. Results are not shown for the sake of brevity.

    Following standard practice, spending multipliers are then constructed by multiplying the IRF values by

where IN F represents the change in CPI-based ination rate (measured in percentage points

terms). In other words, an increase of the ination rate from 3 percent to 4 percent, represents

a 1 percentage point increase in IN F .

   Figures 7, 8, 9, and 10 show (like Figure 6 for output) the e¤ect of government spending

on consumption, investment, net exports, and ination.       Panels B in these gures (which

captures the procyclical scal multiplier in good times) help us in understanding the fact that

an increase in government spending has no e¤ect on output during a boom (see Figure 6, panel

B). Consumption and investment multipliers are not statistically signi cantly di¤erent from

zero and net exports are borderline signi cant but the size is extremely small. On the other

hand, ination (see Figure 10, panel B) responds positively to such a procyclical scal behavior

during a boom.    These results are consistent with simple Keynesian frameworks, where an

increase in aggregate demand (in this case as a consequence of an expansionary scal shock)

in situations of full employment has no impact on economic activity but increases ination.

   What happens in the other case of scal procyclicality; that is to say, when government

spending is reduced during a recession?     The sizeable and statistically signi cantly fall in

economic activity (see Figure 6, panel C) reects the fall in investment, net exports, and,

particularly, consumption (see panels C in Figures 7, 8, and 9). Interestingly, ination does

not change (see panel C in Figure 10). These results are also consistent with simple Keynesian

models where we expect output to respond to reductions in aggregate demand (consumption,

investment, and net exports).

   What happens when we analyze the countercyclical scal multipliers? Panels A in Figures

7, 8, 9, and 10 show that the lack of e¤ect on output of a reduction in government spending

during a boom (see panel A in Figure 6) is explained by the fact that a reduction in government

spending is o¤set by increases in consumption and net exports.       Moreover, unlike the case

of an increase in government spending during a boom (see panel B in Figure 10), reducing

government spending during a boom does not create inationary pressures (see panel A in

                                              19
Figure 10).   In Section 4 we also found that pursuing a countercyclical policy during a

recession (i.e., increasing government spending) has a positive and statistically signi cantly

e¤ect on output. Panels D in Figures 7 and 8 show that this mostly occur due to an increase

in consumption and investment since net exports and ination tend to decrease (see panels D

in Figures 9, and 10).

    In sum, our analysis for the di¤erent components of aggregate demand is fully consistent

with our conventional wisdom from Keynesian models when it comes to the procyclical mul-

tipliers (i.e., no e¤ect on output of increases in government spending during good times and a

negative e¤ect of output from reductions in government during recessions) but points to some

puzzles when it comes to countercyclical multipliers. In particular, the behavior of aggregate

demand components when government spending is reduced in good times is more reminiscent

of neo-classical models (where reductions in government spending crowd in private spending)

than Keynesian ones.



6    Conclusions

This paper has shown that when computing scal multipliers in expansion and recession, it

is critical to distinguish between increases and decreases in government spending. Failure to

do so introduces a downward bias in the estimation of the multiplier in recession because it

includes cases in which government spending has gone down in bad times, which in and of itself

results in a much lower multiplier in the long run. Speci cally, the long-run multiplier for

recession and government spending going up is 2.3 compared to 1.3 when we just distinguish

between recession and expansion.

    Maybe more subtle  yet very important both for expansionary and contractionary scal

policy  is the distinction between typical and extreme recessions. In particular, the long-

run multiplier for a typical recession and government spending going up is 2.3 compared to



                                             20
3.2 when focusing on an extreme recession. Moreover, while cutting spending during typical

recessions reduces output by less than one, doing so in extreme recessions reduces output by

more than one (at the very least in the short and medium run). Applied to the current debate

on austerity in the Eurozone, this would imply that debt to GDP ratios would increase in

response to cuts in scal spending.

   In general, our ndings raise some intriguing analytical questions.     The main question

would be why changes in government spending may have an asymmetric e¤ect during a reces-

sion. Understanding why the e¤ect may be asymmetric in good times is, in principle, much

easier because in a situation of full-employment increases in government spending should have

no e¤ect whereas reductions should. In fact, our analysis based on individual components of

aggregate demand is fully consistent with simple Keynesian models for the case of procyclical

multipliers but not for the case of a reduction in government spending during good times,

which leaves the door open for future theoretical research in the area.

   In terms of policy prescriptions, our ndings stress the importance of computing the scal

multiplier in recession and when government spending is going up (which is presumably the

most relevant scenario for policymakers).    Failure to do so may greatly bias the relevant

estimate downwards and hence mislead policymakers in their decision process.
