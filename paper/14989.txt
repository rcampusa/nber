                                              ABSTRACT

We utilize clinical records of successive visits by children to pediatric clinics in Indianapolis to estimate
the effects on their body mass of environmental changes near their homes. We compare results for
fixed-residence children with those for cross-sectional data. Our environmental factors are fast food
restaurants, supermarkets, parks, trails, and violent crimes, and 13 types of recreational amenities derived
from the interpretation of annual aerial photographs. We looked for responses to these factors changing
within buffers of 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mile. We found that cross-sectional estimates are quite different
from the Fixed Effects estimates of the impacts of amenities locating near a child. In cross section
nearby fast food restaurants were associated with higher BMI and supermarkets with lower BMI. These
results were reversed in the FE estimates. The recreational amenities that appear to lower children’s
BMI were fitness areas, kickball diamonds, and volleyball courts. We estimated that locating these
amenities near their homes could reduce the weight of an overweight eight-year old boy by 3 to 6 pounds.

Introduction:

Child obesity in the United States has been markedly increasing since the early 1980s.
This trend is troubling because there are well-established connections between child
obesity, other childhood diseases, and subsequent adult diseases. While reducing child
obesity is a high priority in public policy, its precise causes and, consequently, effective
public policies for its reduction, are far from clear. Although the physiology of weight
gain or loss is attributable to calorie consumption and expenditure, the determinants of a
child’s calories or energy expenditure have yet to be explained. Simple addition of the
impacts of all of the variables that have statistically-significant effects on child weight
leaves more than two thirds of the change in child body mass index (BMI) unexplained.

Increasingly, environmental factors are being examined as candidates for obesity
interventions. The built environment is potentially a good target for public policy
interventions to increase physical activity or reduce calories consumption because
environmental interventions have the potential to impact energy balance behaviors of
entire communities. Moreover, the built environment may more susceptible to public
policy interventions than either the home or the school. At home time constraints from
work and commuting hours among two-earner and single-parent families can cause them
to rely heavily on pre-packaged calorie-dense meals. Public policies are unlikely to
change time saving behavior. Social marketing campaigns about the importance of
incorporating fruits and vegetables have had no discernable effect. Shifting to schools,
several experimental interventions in sets of primary schools that combined nutrition
education, healthier school meals, removal of soft drink and snack food vending
machines, and more physical education had no effect on children’s weights (Kolata,
2006).1 So far no one has proposed spending enough money on physical education from
kindergarten through high school to use schools as the primary venue for reversing the
child obesity epidemic. Low test scores and low graduation rates have kept the idea of a
national “No Obese Child Left Behind” program for schools off the table for public
policy.

This paper describes a study using eleven years of clinical data to identify natural
experiments wherein changes in nearby physical or social environmental factors may be
examined as causes of change in child weight. Electronic medical records for patients
who received care at a large academic health care system in Indianapolis between 1996
through 2006 were processed to extract anthropometric, demographic, and geographic
data for over 60,000 children between the ages of 3 and 18 years of age. A basic
assumption in the study is that any changes in the physical environment were exogenous
to children that stayed at the same address before and after the change. This approach
addresses a major limitation of many other studies examining associations between
environment and child obesity. The weakness common to many studies of built
environment and obesity is that they utilize cross-sectional designs, which cannot identify

1
 There is a some preliminary evidence of an effective in-school intervention. An
experiment with school menus, nutrition education, and physical education programs,
sponsored by the Agatston Foundation, appear to reduce BMI (HOPS, 2008).

causal effects attributable to nearby environmental amenities. Cross-sectional studies of
the built environment are confounded by families self-selecting their locations. For
example, families that highly value exercise may be more likely to live near a park.
Consequently, cross-sectional results on the relationship between children’s weight and
distance from their residence to the nearest park would provide inconclusive information
for describing causal effects of a park on weight. An example of this endogeneity issue in
the body-weight context is a recent finding that the cross-sectional relationship of urban
sprawl on weight was not maintained in a sample of adults who changed cities, i.e.
migrants from high- to low-sprawl cities maintained their weights and vice versa.
(Plantinga and Bernell, 2007).

The changes we studied are fast food restaurants, convenience stores, supermarkets,
violent crimes, recreation trails, and thirteen specific publicly-accessible recreational
amenities, such as basketball courts and pools. We test the exogeneity assumption by
comparing the trend in BMI for children who will gain an amenity in the future to the
trend for children who never gain an amenity. We found that, except for supermarkets, all
of the amenities had largely the same trends for children who would in the future gain an
amenity and those who would not.

The remaining sections of the paper are a literature review, a description of the data, the
estimation strategy, results, and conclusions.

Literature Review:

Burden of disease
National surveys with measured heights and weights have documented the increases in
child weights since the early 1980s. (Ogden et al. 2002, Hedley et al. 2004). Childhood
obesity leads to numerous physical and mental health problems including, but not limited
to: metabolic disorders such as type-2 diabetes (American Diabetes Society, 2000);
hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and heart disease (Freedman et al., 1999); sleep
apnea (Wittels, 1990); social marginalization (Strauss, 2003); and orthopedic disorders
(Kortt and Baldry, 2002, DiPietro, 1994).

Environmental influences on the prevalence of obesity
How does genetic endowment interact with environmental factors in causing obesity?
“One analogy is that genes load the gun and a permissive or toxic environment pulls the
trigger.” (Bray, 2005, p. S21) Genetic factors are thought to account for 25-40% of the
point-in-time variance in BMI by determining differences in resting metabolic rate and
weight gain in response to overfeeding. (Bouchard, 1994, Price, 2002) However, it is
highly improbable that changes in genetic factors explain the rapid increases in obesity
prevalence over the past two decades. The obesity epidemic appears to be rooted in
environmental factors that promote excessive caloric intake and sedentary lifestyle
(Gortmaker et al., 1993, Hill and Peters, 1998, Epstein et al., 2000). These environmental
factors are worsening, so that the already-high rate of obesity is expected to climb (Foreyt
and Goodrick, 1995). The recent U.S. environment is characterized by convenient,
inexpensive, palatable, energy-dense foods, coupled with a lifestyle requiring negligible
amounts of physical activity for subsistence (Hill and Peters, 1998).

Availability of food
Although American diets have been shifting toward processed foods for more than a
century, it is not clear why obesity rate accelearted in the 1980s. Gerrior and Bente
(2002) have estimated that since the early 1900s, Americans have increased consumption
of fats and sugars by 67% and 64%, respectively. Moreover, consumption of vegetables
has decreased by 26% since 1909 and dietary fiber intake has decreased by 18%. Heiland
and Frank (2007) have examined recent food-pricing trends and found that prices stopped
declining in the midst of the epidemic rise in child obesity, suggesting that decreased
food costs were not a significant cause of the epidemic. Kaushal (2007) used a natural
experiment in the availability of food stamps to show that they had no effect on mothers’
weights

Movement toward a more sedentary lifestyle
Numerous environmental factors promote decreased energy expenditure. Despite the
clearly-documented health benefits of routine physical activity, approximately one-
quarter of Americans remain largely inactive, and leisure-time inactivity is up to three
times more common in lower-income populations (Mokdad et al., 2000). Suburban
communities may lack sidewalks, and neighborhood layout can impede walking even
short distances to stores and recreation; instead, urban design has been more focused on
facilitating automobile traffic (Ewing and Cervero, 2001). Individuals in urban settings
                                                                                         4

report reluctance to exercise outdoors because their neighborhoods are perceived as
unsafe.

Studies have documented that children watch an average of 28 hours of television per
week and that the amount of television viewing is directly related to the likelihood of
obesity (Gortmaker et al., 1996). Changes in television time since the early 1980s cannot
account for any of the trend in weight gain (Anderson and Butcher, 2006b), even though
longitudinal studies of television hours show that young children who watch more
television become heavier teens and young adults (Boone et al., 2007). The difficulty in
accounting for the effect of changes in sedentary time on trends in BMI is that there are
no consistent long-term series that measure children’s time in sedentary activities. The
time now used for video games or text messaging may or may not have been at the
expense of other sedentary activities among pre-epidemic children or it may have

School environments
While schools decreased the availability of daily physical education (Hill and Peters,
1998) during the epidemic, Cawley et al. (2007) found that changes in hours of required
physical education had no effect on children’s weights. Anderson and Butcher (2006b)
found that changes in access to candy and soft drinks by students via school vending
machines could account for about one-fifth of the weight gains among 12- to 19-year-
olds between 1988 and 2000. Access to vending machines in schools is much less
common for children under 12. Tchernis et al. (2007) found that changes in calories per
school lunch or breakfast served or changes in the proportion of children receiving free or
subsidized school meals have had little effect in reducing child obesity.


Family characteristics, poverty, and other social environment factors
In addition to physical environmental factors, changes in social environment also has a
bearing on obesity. Studies have also examined variables that pertain mostly to parents
rather than their children. Courtemanche (2007) estimates that changes in mothers’ labor
force participation and hours of work account for 7.7% of the increases in children’s
weight from 1968 to 2001. Obesity is currently more prevalent among persons of lower
socioeconomic status. However, this association has only recently been observed with
consistency in the pediatric age groups. Garn et al. (1975) found that obesity was
associated with higher socioeconomic status in early childhood, and lower socioeconomic
status in adolescent females. A review of the literature through the late 1980s by Sobal
and Stunkard (1989) regarding socioeconomic status and childhood obesity found that
published studies were widely disparate in the reporting of the direction of a relationship
between socioeconomic status and obesity, or even the existence of any relationship.
Sorenson et al. (1997) reported a 2.2-fold increased incidence of childhood obesity in
children living in dilapidated living conditions. Strauss and Knight (1999) reported the
results of a prospective study in which children from low-income families had an almost
threefold increased risk of developing obesity. Typically, those with socioeconomic
disadvantage have worse health status; however in the case of childhood obesity, the role
that socioeconomic factors play in determining levels of health and influencing
behavioral and psychosocial risk factors remains unclear.

Disparities in obesity rates by race/ethnicity
There are significant disparities in rates of overweight and obesity between people of
different race and ethnicity. Haas et al. (2003) found that in childhood, Latinos and
Blacks are more likely to be overweight than Whites, whereas in adolescence Latinos and
Asians/Pacific Islanders demonstrated higher rates of overweight. Numerous reasons for
ethnic variation in rates of overweight have been proposed; again, complex interactions
between genetic lineage and environmental factors certainly underlie racial/ethnic
disparities. Differences in acculturation, cultural beliefs and practices, geographic
segregation, community resources, and social capital are just a few of the correlates that
have been identified as important considerations for obesity risk. (Day, 2006, Popkin and
Udry, 1998, Parnell, 1966, Neff et al., 1997)

Environmental factors and child weight status:
Numerous reports have repeatedly echoed a call for obesity interventions that focus on
environmental changes (King, 1995, Sallis et al., 1998, Margetts, 2004). Most of the
attempts to prevent obesity have adopted educational approaches aimed at improving
knowledge and motivation that in turn would presumably alter individual lifestyle
choices (Kumanyika, 2001). Such approaches have been largely ineffective (Jeffery,
2001). Redirecting approaches to target environmental factors that modify behavior may
enable prevention to succeed because an environmental approach does not exclusively
rely on individual will (Kumanyika, 2001, Glanz et al., 1995). Efforts to modify
environmental factors may have the additional benefit of diminishing health disparities
among disadvantaged or minority populations.

Fewer studies have examined the effect of either physical or social environment
specifically on childhood overweight and obesity. Burdette and Whitaker (2004) did not
find significant relationships between distances to playgrounds or fast food
establishments and prevalence of overweight among low-income preschool children in
cross-sectional data. In that study and in a subsequent study (Burdette and Whitaker
2005), they found no relationship between overweight and levels of crime in the
children’s neighborhoods. Cross-sectional studies focusing on the built environment’s
role as a determinant of childhood overweight remain inconclusive. For example, a study
of childhood obesity and neighborhoods that used straight-line distances between
children’s residences and opportunities for exercise concluded that there was no
difference between obese and non-obese children (Hanratty, McLaughlan, and Pettit,
2003). The study by Burdette and Whitaker (2004) used a more sophisticated approach of
modeling street network distances, but was cross-sectional, included only children ages 3
to 5 years, and was limited to Black and White racial groups.

Approaches incorporating broader samples of children and techniques to control for
endogenous location choices are needed to understand how the urban form impacts child
health. Despite the lack of an evidence base, policy makers are implementing regulations
on urban development to try to reduce child obesity. For example, the City of Los
Angeles has banned new fast food restaurant construction in South Los Angeles for the
next year (L.A. Times). The area affected by the ban has half a million residents. South
                                                                                             6

Los Angeles is well known as a high-crime area. An important question regarding the
bans on new fast food restaurants or other restrictive policies applied to urban areas is
whether high crime rates attenuate the effect of fast food restaurants by forcing children
to stay away from these restaurants.

The endogeneity question for fast-food effects on adults living in rural areas was
addressed in a recent working paper (Anderson and Matsa, 2008), which used location
near an interstate highway exit as an instrument for fast food location. Highway exits
have fast food restaurants to serve travelers; they provide more fast food outlets than
would otherwise be supported by small communities. The paper relies on self-reported
weights and is limited to adults. The conclusion is that fast food has no causal effect on
adult BMI.

In contrast to Anderson and Matsa, Currie et al (2008) have very large sample, 3.06
million student-year observations for ninth graders in California for 1999 and for 2001
through 2007, with precise locations of their schools and the fast food restaurants. They
do not have data on individual children. Obesity rates are reported for all 9th graders in a
school. The measurements on the children are taken during the Spring semester and
represent approximately 30 weeks of exposure to a near-to-school fast food restaurant for
a child entering high school. They find a 5.2 percent increase in the incidence of obesity,
relative to the mean of 32.9 percent, for schools that have a fast food restaurant within 0.1
miles. They found no effect to fast food within buffers of 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 mile from the
school. They attribute this statistically significant and economically important effect
within 0.1 miles as being due to the 9th graders having to walk to the fast food restaurants
and having little time either before the school day, during the school day, or after school
to visit a restaurant. Consistent with this limited-time explanation, other types of
restaurants had no effect on 9th grade school obesity rates.

Since Currie et al have no individual data on children, they cannot know if the children
who gained a nearby fast food restaurant by enrolling in high had also recently gained a
fast food restaurant near their homes or if a higher proportion of the children whose
schools have fast food restaurants within 0.1 mile entered the 9th grade were already
obese. Going across years, they find no trend in obesity rates at schools that will gain a
fast food restaurant in the future. However, they have very little temporal variation at the
level of the school in the number of fast food restaurants within 0.1 miles. Specifically,
they have 13 schools that ever gain a fast food restaurant, 8 that lose, and one that gains
and loses.


Data:

The main sources of our data are: (1) clinical records from pediatric ambulatory visits to
the Indiana University Medical Group between 1996 and 2006; (2) annual inspections by
the Marion County Health Department of all food establishments; (3) aerial photographs,
used to identify and verify recreational amenities; (4) reports of violent crimes from the
Indianapolis Police Department and the Marion County Sheriff’s Department; (5) birth
                                                                                             7

certificates; and (6) the U.S. Census. These six data sources are described in more detail
below.

(1) Clinical records from well-child visits
The Regenstrief Medical Records System (RMRS), in existence since 1974, is an
electronic version of the paper medical chart. It has now captured and stored 200 million
temporal observations for over 1.5 million patients. Because RMRS data are both
archived and retrievable, investigators may use these data to perform retrospective and
prospective research. The RMRS is distributed across 3 medical centers, 30 ambulatory
clinics, and all of the emergency departments throughout the greater Indianapolis region.
RMRS supports physician order entry, decision support, and clinical noting, and is one of
the most sophisticated and most evaluated electronic medical record systems in the
world.

Using the RMRS, we identified medical records in which there are simultaneous
assessments of height and weight in outpatient clinics for children ages 3-18 years
inclusive. For these clinic visits, we extracted the visit date, date of birth, gender, race,
insurance status, and visit type (e.g. periodic health maintenance versus acute care). We
found that too few patients had private insurance for this variable to have any predictive
power. Because height and weight measurements are routinely performed as part of
pediatric health maintenance, these measures should be present for virtually all children
receiving preventive care at each of the study sites. The data generated by pediatric visits
in the RMRS include higher representation of low-income and minority households
compared to the demographics of the study area because the associated clinics serve a
population that is mostly publicly insured or has no insurance. The over-representation of
minorities and low-income households in the RMRS, we contend, is a decided advantage.
Poorer households are more sensitive to their immediate neighborhood because they face
financial constraints against motorized transit (e.g. reduced car ownership, less money for
gasoline, and less money for bus fares). Indianapolis has a vestigial public transportation
system. It has been described as the worst city system in the Midwest (Quigley, 2003). If
the built environment has any effect on child weights it should be most readily observed
in poorer households in a city with minimal public transportation. Moreover, obesity is
more prevalent in poorer households and among poorer children. Knowing what
interventions reduce and exacerbate child overweight in this population would be
valuable.

The initial age range of subjects in this study is three to eighteen years. National
guidelines for well-child visits advocate annual visits between ages 3-6 years and at least
biannual visits thereafter. We observed much more frequent well-child visits for girls age
16 or above than for boys, presumably because the former often use these visits to obtain
gynecologic care such as a prescription for contraception. We extracted ICD-9 codes or
other diagnoses list data for identifying children who may have systematic bias in growth
or weight status (i.e. pregnancy, endocrine disorders, cancer, congenital heart disease,
chromosomal disorders, and metabolic disorders), and excluded observations for such
children. We also excluded patient encounters prior to 1996 because the RMRS did not
archive address data before this date.
                                                                                                8



(2) Food establishment data
We received annual inspection data on 8,641food service establishments in Indianapolis
that received permits from the Marion County Board of Health between 1993 and 2007,
inclusive. Of these, 5,550 are restaurants and 1,507 are in the grocery category. Fast-food
establishments have been a particular focus of research on adult obesity and child
overweight. Defining and identifying fast-food restaurants is problematic. Fast-food
establishments in our study have been defined in two ways. Chou, Rashad, and Grossman
(2005) identified a set of 41 national fast-food chains when they studied the effect of
local advertising on child overweight. We will refer to that as the “national chains” list.
The national chains are of special interest because they advertise more than local
restaurants and local chains, and their restaurants are generally larger, in higher-traffic
locations, and more likely to have a drive-up window. The second method of identifying
fast food relied on the Census Bureau’s counts of restaurants by Standard Industrial
Classification (SIC) codes. Chou, Grossman, and Saffer (2002) used the Census Bureau
data for state-level counts of establishments in the SIC 5812/40. These are establishments
with a limited menu of items such as pizza, barbecue, hotdogs, and hamburgers. We refer
to these restaurants as limited-service restaurants. Full-service restaurants (SIC 5812/10),
in contrast, have at least 15 seats, table service, and serve prepared food from a full menu.

We have 735 establishments in Indianapolis in the national chains list and 1138
establishments in the broader limited-service list. Data-cleaning challenges included
repeated counting due to slight changes in names of restaurants at the same address. Of
the 735 fast food restaurants on the national chains list, 393 were opened between 1994
and 2004,whichallows a natural experiment investigating change in food environment as
a possible cause of change in child body mass index.

There were 1,507 retail food establishments in the data. Again, we had to do some data
cleaning. From the perspective of a Marion County food inspector a sushi retailer that
rents space in a supermarket is a separate inspection entity, but from the consumer’s
perspective it is part of the supermarket. After a first cut at data cleaning, there were 114
supermarkets. The Indianapolis market, not atypically, has been roiled by the entry of
supermarket chains, as well as discount stores with embedded supermarkets such as
Meijer, Walmart, and Target. The city’s largest chain, Kroger, has had a substantial
expansion. Some of the entrants failed, such as Cub Foods, and have left behind stores
that are still empty. Among supermarkets there is even more variation, proportionally,
than among the national chains fast-food establishments. Fifty of the 114 supermarkets
would satisfy the temporal requirement for a natural experiment because they opened
after the first year, closed before 2004, or both.

(3) Recreational amenities
The study began with a geographic database of recreational amenities and associated
features (such as parking lots), in vector form, developed from 2001 data provided by the
Indianapolis Parks and Recreation Department. Each individual amenity, such as a
basketball court or soccer field, was included as a feature in the database. We
                                                                                             9

incorporated three other similar databases for later periods, also provided by the
Indianapolis Parks and Recreation Department.

Additional recreational amenities were identified for the years 1995 through 2006
through the interpretation of aerial photographs. We chose thirteen specific recreational
amenities for identification. These were thought to be the most likely to be used by
children in the study population and to be amenable to identification from aerial
photographs, as well as sufficiently numerous to measure an effect. The chosen
categories and their quantifications within 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mile buffers centered on
the child’s home are:

1. baseball and softball field, count of fields in buffer
2. outdoorbasketball court, count of hoops in buffer
3. family center (indoor recreation center), area of facilities in buffer
4. fitness course, area in buffer
5. football field, count of fields in buffer
6. kickballfield, count of fields in buffer
7. playground without permanent equipment, area in buffer
8. playground with permanent equipment, area in buffer
9. swimming pool, area of water in buffer
10. soccer field, total area available for playing in buffer
11. tennis court, count of courts in buffer
12. track and field facility, area of facilities in buffer
13. volleyball court, count of courts in buffer

Nine photo interpreters participated in the process; they were assigned specific areas of
the county, generally strips half a mile wide running north-to-south. To control for
quality of interpretation, amenities lying on the borders of assigned interpretation areas
were to be analyzed by both relevant interpreters. The resulting border features were then
compared, to each other and to the photographs. Where the features differed, the more
accurate interpretation was selected for the final dataset, and corrected if necessary.
Additionally, errors that appeared in this process were treated as potential systematic
errors; the other features interpreted by the responsible interpreter were examined for
evidence of the same error repeated. If present, such errors were corrected, and if errors
were found while the process was ongoing, the interpreter was retrained to avoid the
error. An appendix contains the full details of the photo interpretation process.


(4) Crime data
During the study period, the primary law enforcement responsibility for Marion County
was divided between the Indianapolis Police Department (IPD), which had responsibility
for the area within the original Indianapolis boundary, the Marion County Sheriff’s
Department (MCSD), which had responsibility for most of the outlying areas of the
county, and the police departments of the four small excluded municipalities of
Speedway, Lawrence, Southport, and Beech Grove. When the city limits of Indianapolis
were expanded to the border of Marion County in 1970, the original police jurisdictions
                                                                                        10

were not affected. In 2007 the Indianapolis Police Department and the Marion County
Sheriff’s Department were merged into the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department.

From the Indianapolis Police Department, for the IPD service area in which they had
primary responsibility, we have a dataset of the geo-coded locations of all crimes
reported for the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Uniform Crime Reports (UCR), from
1992 through 2005. From the Marion County Sheriff’s Department, for the area in which
they had primary responsibility, we have a dataset on the point locations of a wide range
of crimes and other incidents, including the UCR crimes, from 2000 through 2005. We
are using information on the crimes from both datasets that are included in the UCR
violent crime categories: criminal homicides, rapes, robberies, and aggravated assaults.
The dataset includes the date and time of the crime, and more detailed information on the
specific type of crime within each of those four categories. Because of the manner in
which these data have been assembled, we have reason to believe that these are accurate
locations and that the classification of the type of crime is accurate.


To summarize, we have the following coverage for violent crimes:
   1) Up through 1999, for the IPD service area only.
   2) From 2000 through 2005, for both the IPD service area and the MCSD jurisdiction.
No crime data are available for any time period for the jurisdictions of the four small
excluded municipalities that are within Marion County.

(5) Birth certificate data from the Marion County Health and Hospital Corporation.
We matched children’s clinical data with Marion County Health and Hospital
Corporation data on birth certificates by date of birth, gender, mother’s surname, and
child’s given name. We were able to match 34.3% of the children in the clinical data. For
a match to be possible the child must have been born in Marion County. The birth
certificate data include birth weight, sex, race, mother’s age and intention to breastfeed,
parents’ marital status, and one or both parents’ education, race, and eligibility for
Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) aid (all, of course, at time of birth). In the few cases
where reported race changed between the birth certificate and the clinical record, we used
the race identified in the clinical record.


(6) Neighborhood characteristics
Neighborhood characteristics were estimated for 0.5-mile and 1.0 mile buffers
surrounding each residence. These include five variables derived from Census 2000 data:
population density, proportion African-American, proportions graduated from high
school and from college, and median family income. The first two are estimated from the
block data, the remainder from the block group data. Two variables are measures of the
density and interconnectedness of the road network. The types of land use diversity in the
area are measured using the proportion of land in commercial and residential use.
Detailed information on the data sources and procedures used to create these variables are
provided in an appendix.
                                                                                            11



Data cleaning
In examining the height and weight data from the clinical records we found highly
improbable patterns, such as a child shrinking five inches in height from one well-child
visit to the next. We calculated z scores for height and weight measures based on year
2000 US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) growth charts. We used
CDC statistical programs to identify biologically implausible values for heights and
weights (CDC, 2000). Figure 1 shows the histograms of heights and weights, excluding
biologically implausible values with z-scores greater than +3.0.

                                       Figure 1
    Histograms of Standardized Height (haz) and Weight (waz) Scores after Dropping
                       Observations with z-scores at or Above 3




Visually, there is a small amount of truncation for the heights in the right tail of its
distribution. As can be seen in the second graph, the truncation in the right tail of the
body weight distribution is substantial. The CDC Growth Chart reference population
spans the period 1963 to 1994, and thus does not fully cover the epidemic in child obesity
of the past two decades. Another visual indicator of the extent of the epidemic is how
much the distribution has shifted to the right relative to the mean of the reference
population. We treated observations with weight-for-height and weight-for-age z-scores
equal to or exceeding +5.0 as outliers likely resulting from data entry error or
measurement errors.

Descriptive Statistics:

The histogram of the ages of all children at the time of their well-child visits is shown in
Figure 2. Since well-child visits for preschool-age children are more frequent, the higher
bars around ages 3, 4, and 5 were expected, as well as the steady decline thereafter. Prior
to age 16 the genders at the well-child visits are split nearly 50-50. For age 17 the ratio is
more than 80-20 females-to-males.
                                                                                          12

                         Histogram of Age at Time of Clinic Visit




To simplify our analysis we restricted our sample to children under the age of sixteen.
The 16- and 17-year-olds are clearly a different population. There is not an obvious age at
which children in the range of 3 through 15 gain significantly more control over their
food and exercise choices. Although obtaining a driver’s license does give a child much
more independence, our exclusion of children age 16 or greater eliminates this factor.
Lacking any a priori basis for splitting the sample by age, our split was dictated by the
data. Almost exactly 50% of our observations are below age 8. For each amenity we
tested whether the coefficients for children younger than 8 were the same as for children
8 or older. Some of our amenities are clearly suited for younger children, such as
playground equipment, and others for older children, such as volleyball courts, tennis
courts, and football fields.

Most studies of child weight determinants use the body mass index percentile compared
to the pre-epidemic population sampled in the National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES) I from 1971 to 1974. Absolute thresholds for overweight or obesity
are not applied to children because the amount of body fat changes with age and differs
between girls and boys. The mean body mass index percentile in our data is 65.5. A
disadvantage to using the percentiles of the reference population is truncation. For the
205 well-child visits in our sample that were at the 100th percentile, we cannot observe
any responses to amenities that increase their weight. We use the term “amenities” to
mean any environment factor, desirable or undesirable. For the 5,049 well-child visits at
or above the 99th percentile, there is limited ability to observe weight increase responses.
To avoid the truncation problem inherent in the percentiles we used the BMI z score as
the dependent variable.

Table 1 has the descriptive statistics for the data used in the cross-sectional analysis. The
definitions and procedures used to create the neighborhood characteristics variables are in
an appendix. All of the data were restricted to children whose age was under 16, and who
had an absolute value of the z score of height relative to the reference population less than
                                                                                         13

The definitions of the recreational amenities are in an appendix.

One striking number from the descriptive statistics is the amount of crime. The violent
crimes included are criminal homicides, rapes, robberies, and aggravated assaults. The
maximum value for the tenth-mile buffer was 49.
                                                                                        18



Estimation Strategy:

Our initial dataset consists of fixed information on the child (race, sex, family
composition at birth), changing information on the child (height, weight, and age at each
clinic visit), fixed information on the parents (race, mother’s and possibly father’s
education at the child’s birth), changing information on the family (residence), the built
environment near the residence in each year, crime counts by year within buffers around
the child’s home, and some information on neighborhood characteristics for buffers
around each residence, including information on the road network, and land use, and the
population density from the census,.

As was mentioned above, to control for the normal variations in BMI as the child ages we
use age-sex adjusted base-period BMI z scores as the dependent variable. We estimate
two main types of models, Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Fixed Effects (FE) for a
child at a stable address across serial clinic visits.

The key identifying assumption in the FE estimation is that households that stay at the
same location after an amenity is placed near their residence retain the same preferences
they had before the amenity was added. Under this assumption the household fixed effect
would remove constant-over-time preferences for location amenities and any other
unobserved variables that did not change for each household. For example, the parents’
discount rate over future consumption by either themselves or their children and their
altruism toward their children would wash out in the fixed effects specification.

What are the potential criticisms of this estimation strategy? People might move, or more
generally they might change preferences, in response to changes in their child’s
overweight status, in which case the FE design would not remove the bias. However, we
doubt that preferences change rapidly.

Another potential criticism is that there are unobserved variables common to households
that are located near the new amenity. If the households in a neighborhood lobbied the
parks department to obtain the playground or pool built near them, then there would be
some common-to-the-neighborhood but unobserved-to-the-econometrician interest in
exercise that would bias the estimates. A pool placed near a neighborhood where the
parents had lobbied (presumably because they were anxious to have their children use the
new pool) would have a smaller effect on child overweight. This is the endogeneity
problem in another guise.

More problematic is the location of privately-owned amenities such as fast food
restaurants or supermarkets. These types of firms often employ market researchers to
identify areas where households will be the most receptive to a fast food outlet or the
most likely to buy fresh produce. We can use robust estimators that yield consistent
estimates of the standard errors when there are common-but-unobserved differences at a
neighborhood level, but without the original information that was in the hands of the
market researchers, we cannot fully control for differences among households in
                                                                                         19

receptiveness to fast food or fresh produce. At least the direction of any potential bias is
clear. We will have upper bound estimates on child overweight effect of these privately-
owned amenities. Thus, if any of them turn out to have a negligible estimated effect, we
can be confident that public policy aimed at increasing or reducing these amenities would
have no impact. Further, by looking at the trends in BMI z score (bmiz) before amenities
such as fast food arrived, we can test whether the children who will gain an amenity in
the future differ from those who will not.

Another issue that we plan to address in future studies is continuing effects of a given
change. Our FE model shows the impact for children of a given age of an increase or
decrease in an amenity on bmiz from one visit to the next, provided the visits are in
different calendar years. The exact duration of the exposure to the changed amenity is not
known, even though the dates of the well-child visits are exact, because the food
inspections and aerial photographs are only updated annually. Our FE estimates reflect
the average duration of exposure to a change in an amenity from one calendar year to the
next. We estimate the impacts on bmiz of amenity change in year t in t + 1. We have not
estimated the bmiz effects for years t + 2 or higher.

Suppose that unobservable household variation could be reduced to a single relevant
characteristic, such as a fondness for calorie-dense food and being sedentary. Call this
unobserved variation in preferences τ. A further issue we intend to address in future
studies is exploiting the differences between households that stay at the same location
after an amenity is introduced or removed near them, versus households who move to a
new location that is either near an amenity they did not have or far from an amenity they
used to have close by, versus households that have a mix of periods with fixed locations
and changing amenities and movements toward or away from amenities. Children in
high-τ households would have a greater bmiz response to the advent of nearby sources of
calorie-dense food, such as fast food restaurants or convenience stores. They would also
show a smaller bmiz response to the advent of recreational amenities. Households that
move near to an amenity must, on average, have a higher preference for that amenity, i.e.
movers to nearby fast food locations would tend to have higher values of τ while movers
to nearby recreational amenities would tend to have a lower value of τ. The differences in
bmiz response to a given amenity among the movers, stayers, and households that mix
periods of moving and staying can bound the value of the bmiz response for children in
households that have average levels of τ.

Results:

To see how much of the variation in bmiz can be accounted for by the fixed mother and
child characteristics, bmiz was regressed on all of the variables in Table 1, using robust
standard errors clustered on the child’s ID. Three of the year-indicator variables were
significant at the 10% level but these are omitted. The results are also reported separately
for children under age 8 and over age 8. Age is measured at the time of the clinic visit
and is a continuous variable.

About 7.4% of the overall variation in bmiz can be accounted for by fixed child
characteristics, mother’s characteristics, and neighborhood characteristics. The
explanatory power is 8% for the younger children and 5% for the older children. The
increased explanatory power of the model for younger children may be attributable to the
birth certificate data more accurately representing the current socioeconomic
environment of the study subject. The well-child visit indicator is significant overall and
for the older children; the sign is negative. The negative association between child weight
and well-child care is counter-intuitive. The well-child variable, in theory, represents the
                                                                                         21

health status of the child, with poorer-health-status children having systematically lower
body mass index. Recall that visits with diagnostic codes known to affect body weight
were dropped from the dataset (pregnancy, endocrine disorders, cancer, congenital heart
disease, chromosomal disorders, and metabolic disorders).

The well-child variable may reflect behavior practices of the child’s caregivers.
Caregivers who less frequently access routine health maintenance for their children, or
primarily bring their children in for sick-child visits, may be less supportive of child
health behaviors associated with optimal child weight (e.g. promoting routine physical
activity or a nutritious diet). This behavioral interpretation is supported by an HMO study
that found that overweight children were less likely to have well-child visits (Estabrooks
and Shetterly, 2007).

       “Interestingly, over a 3-year period, overweight children show
       significantly fewer well-child visits. This could indicate that overweight
       children receive well-child visit care during sick visits that occur at a time
       that is proximal to a future well-child visit. It could also indicate that
       parents of overweight children feel that well-care visits are not necessary
       as a result of a higher frequency of sick visits. Finally, it could also
       indicate that overweight children avoid well-care visits as a method to
       avoid receiving advice about their weight." (p. 226)

Relative to the reference population, bmiz is increasing rapidly with age. As children age
from the sample minimum of 3 to the maximum of 16 years their predicted bmiz
increases by 0.6. The mean bmiz scores for children in the age range 3 to 4 is 0.43, while
for children in the age range 15 to 16 it is 0.85. The age and age squared specification is
parsimonious, but a histogram suggests a rapid increase up to age 13, and level bmiz
thereafter.

                                    Mean BMIZ by Age




The bmiz gain appears to be largely a permanent cumulative process. Children (Wilfley
et al., 2007) and adults (Jeffery et al., 2000) are often able to lose weight in the short-term
but find it much more difficult to sustain any loss from their peak weight over a long
period. Large recorded z-score gains are rarely reversed at later visits.

To assess how often large gains in weight were reversed we looked at the subset of
children with large bmiz gains, defined as +0.5 in bmiz from the first visit to the second
visit. At the mean of the reference population a z-score gain of 0.5 would be 27 percentile
points. The count of big gainers that have at least three visits was 338. Among these big
gainers, the count of those who were above their initial z score by the third visit was
2743. The big gainers who were at or below their first-visit z score by the third visit was
638. Only 19% of the big gainers recovered.

There is some noise in the weight and the height data that are likely due to data entry or
measurement errors at the clinics. If observations of big gainers between the first and
second visits were primarily due to such errors, we would expect them to largely
disappear by the next visit. Because only a small proportion of the big gains were
reversed, we can be confident that they are not primarily due to recording errors. Further,
the irreversibility of most of the big gains supports our conclusion that the weight gains
are largely cumulative.

The age effect, due to tendency of children to accumulate weight relative to the reference
population and rarely lose any of it, is quite strong. Consequently, we will include age
and age squared in subsequent regressions, which always have a maximum age of 16.
What these regressions can tell us is the extent to which the addition or removal of an
amenity can alter the pronounced bmiz-age pattern.

The birth certificate variables are available for only one third of the dataset. This is too
small a sample size to detect many amenity effects. In Table 4 we drop the birth
certificate variables and add the amenity variables.

The amenities that are significant show up at various distances. There is no reason to
expect the real effects of different amenities to operate over the same distance. Also, in
the smaller circles there may be real effects but too few observations to yield statistically
significant results. In discussing the results in Table 4, we concentrate on the signs and
significance levels rather than the values of the coefficients. We do this because we are
primarily interested in how the OLS results contrast with the FE results. We think the
OLS results are telling us more about who chooses to live near an amenity, such as a
school with open recreational facilities or a fast food restaurant that is near a major road.

Age and age squared are highly significant in every OLS regression. In cross section the
well-child visit indicator is always negative. It is significant in six of the nine regressions.
Thus, across different children a sick-child visit is associated with higher bmiz. The
Female indicator variable should not be significant because the bmiz variable adjusts for
gender in the reference population. The consistent negative and significant coefficients
for the younger children and the positive and significant coefficients for the older
children indicate that relative to boys in the same age range the younger girls are not
gaining bmiz as fast while the older girls are gaining bmiz faster than older boys. The
differential may be due to a trend toward an earlier age of puberty for girls.

In terms of racial differences, the striking result is the high bmiz values for Hispanics
relative to the omitted category—Asian and other. There are two variables related to
African Americans. One refers to the race of the child. Older black children are
significantly heavier than the omitted category and than whites. The second variable
refers to the neighborhood. Other things equal, living in a neighborhood with a higher
proportion of blacks is associated with a lower bmiz. Since proportions run from 0 to 1
the interpretation of the coefficient is straightforward. For children under the age of 8
hypothetical neighborhoods with no African Americans have higher bmiz, by about 0.22,
than neighborhoods that are entirely African American. The proportion of residents in the
neighborhood with a college education is almost never significant (one of nine at the 0.10
level). The median family income in the neighborhood and proportion of dwellings that
are residential are similar (both have two of nine at the 0.10 level). In the neighborhoods
our children live in, college education is rare and incomes are generally low.

The fast food variable is significant in four of the nine OLS regressions. The significant
coefficients are always positive. This positive effect on BMI is the conventional result for
fast food in cross-sectional regressions. The significant coefficients are for the closer
buffers, within 0.1 and 0.25 miles. The supermarket variable (OLS) also has the
conventional result that supermarkets are associated with lower bmiz when they are
close. The signs on the first five coefficients are negative. Of those, just two are
significant. Supermarkets also tend to be located on major roads that are on commuting
routes. Households that live near a supermarket are likely to differ from households that
live far from the nearest supermarket. The convenience store variable has little
explanatory power in the OLS regression. Only one of the nine coefficients is significant.
Crime is never significant in the OLS regressions.
                                                                                            26

Very few of the recreational amenities have a significant negative sign. These include
trails (<8 at 0.1 miles, all ages at 0.25 miles, and <8 at 0.25 miles), baseball/softball (<8
for 1.0 mile), pools (>8 at 0.25 miles), and tennis (<8 at 0.1 miles, all ages at 1.0 miles).
Even some of the results that do have a negative and significant sign are counter-
intuitive, e.g. how many children under 8 play tennis?

The problems with the OLS results are that they have little explanatory power, most of
the demographic variables have limited policy implications, and most importantly, it is
impossible to know if the associations are causal. For example, track and field facilities
and football fields are almost all located at middle schools and high schools. Even if they
had been statistically significant, would the bmiz differences associated with these
variables be due to children using these amenities or simply to unobserved differences in
the families that chose to live near these schools? The fast food restaurants, supermarkets
and even convenience stores tend to be located on major roads that are commuting routes
from the city center to the suburbs. Below we have provided some clear maps showing
these amenities lined up on the commuting routes. Are the bmiz associations of these
amenities due to proximity to these food sources or to unobservable differences in
households living near major roads?



FE regressions:

Before reporting the FE regressions we report in Table 5 below how many children had

The large number of children having changes in the amounts of crime is due to the
underlying variable counting individual crimes. At the smallest buffer, within 0.1 miles,
many of the amenities have so few children facing changes that it is unlikely we would
observe any effect. These include supermarkets, family centers, fitness trails, football
fields, soccer fields, track and field, and volleyball courts. Except for the family centers,
by the 0.25-mile buffer there are enough children with observed changes that if changes
in the amenity indeed had an effect on BMI at that distance we have a good chance of
observing the effect. We added the 0.1-mile buffer for all amenities because the Currie et
al paper found a fast food effect within 0.1 miles of child’s school. The vast majority of
the changes in amenities that are in counts were a gain or loss of one unit, e.g. one fast
food restaurant. Of these the modal change was from 0 to 1 unit with the next most
frequent being from 1 unit to 0.

Data on individual children have more variation than data on high schools. Our sample of
children is 3.2% of the Currie et al sample. Their sample is based on observations of 3.06
million student years and our data on 98,541 clinic visits among children with two or
more visits while residing at the same address. We have 29 changes in the number of fast
food restaurants within the 0.1-mile buffer compared to 22 in the Currie et al sample.
                                                                                           28

In the FE regressions below, we dropped all variables that are constant at the level of the
child. Again, this sample is restricted to observations in which a child remains at the
same address between clinic visits. The same restrictions on age and biologically
implausible values of bmiz, height, and weight are also applied. The covariates to the
environmental/amenity variables are age and age squared, year of clinic visit indicator
variables, an indicator for a well-child visit, and crime.

Again, the coefficients on the year dummy variables are not reported. In the FE
regressions, the children under 8 years of age are gaining bmiz faster relative to the
reference population than the children over age 8, roughly by 0.13 bmiz units a year. This
younger versus older child differential did not appear in the OLS regressions. The well-
child variable is now positive and significant at the 10% level for all children. This FE
result sharply contrasts with the OLS result for the well-child visit variable, which was
always negative, and significant in six of the nine OLS regressions.

There are very few overlaps from the OLS to the FE results of the same amenity being
significant at the same distance. Adding a fast food restaurant within a quarter mile of the
same child appears to significantly reduce the child’s bmiz. Recall that in the cross-
sectional results at the tenth-mile buffer, the association between bmiz and fast food was
positive.

From a public policy perspective, the FE results for the recreational amenities are
somewhat discouraging. The variables with negative and significant coefficients are
fitness areas for all children and younger children at 0.25 miles; kickball for all children
and younger children at 0.1 mile, all children at 0.25 miles, and older children at the 0.5
and 1.0 mile buffers; playgrounds without equipment for younger children at 0.5 miles;
tennis for older children at 0.25 miles; and volleyball for older children at the 0.1 mile
buffer and older children at the mile buffer. The division across amenities that might be
associated with reducing bmiz in younger versus older children appears plausible, e.g.
younger children use playgrounds and kickball fields while the older ones use volleyball
courts.

As a check on whether their estimated fast food effects on percentages of boys in a high
school who were overweight (defined as the 85th percentile) could plausibly be due to the
calories from an extra fast food meal per day, Currie et al. calculated the weight gain
required for a median height 14 year old boy to move from the 80th to the 85th percentile
of the bmi distribution. This weight gain was 3.6 pounds. To get a sense of what our
estimated coefficients imply for weight gains we will use boys, to match Currie et al. but
change the age to 8, which is the median for our data. We will start at the 85th percentile,
their end point, and calculate the implied weight loss for some amenities that were
estimated to statistically significant effect in reducing weight. Adding a kickball diamond
within a tenth mile is associated (based on the equation for all ages) with a reduction of
2.8 pounds. The weight reduction for adding a playground within a half mile (based on
the under age 8 regression) is 4.1 pounds. The weight reduction for adding a volleyball
court within a tenth mile (based on the age 8 or over regression) is 6.9 pounds.
Recreational amenities that could reduce the weights of overweight 8 year-old boys
                                                                                          29

within a year of being located near their homes by anything in the range of 2.8 to 6.9
pounds would be economically significant.

Switching to the statistically significant effects for food venders, at a mile distance the
addition of a fast food restaurant was associated (in the all ages regression) with a weight
tiny gain, 0.14 pounds. The addition of a supermarket within a mile (all ages regression)
is associated with a gain of 0.42 pounds. The addition of a convenience store within a
mile (under age 8 regression) was associated with a gain of 0.36 pounds. The weight
changes associated adding a food vendor, even when statistically significant, are smaller
than the weight losses associated with the few recreational amenities that have negative
and significant coefficients.

Some of our results are counter-intuitive. Fast food is associated with weight reduction in
at a quarter mile. Trails are only significant for the older children. This trails result is
partly intuitive because younger children walking on the trails could wander into the
paths of runners, bicyclists and in-line skaters. We see more young children riding in
strollers or in bicycle carriers or tandem bicycles than those traveling entirely on their
own power. However, what the counter-intuitive part is that all of the coefficients that are
significant have a positive sign.

If the reported results were causal effects, then bmiz-reducing policy would be to build
fast food restaurants within a quarter mile of the child’s home and surround the child’s
home with a fitness area, a kickball diamond, and a playground, all at their respective
optimal distances. Before much credence can be given to these estimates, the issue of the
endogeneity of the placement of these amenities must be addressed.

The FE framework allows for separate consideration of gains and losses in amenities. We
tested whether the coefficient on a gain was the same as for a loss for every amenity and
could not reject the null hypothesis of equality in a single case. Also, we looked at
assumption of linearity of effects, e.g. that a gain from 0 to 1 is the same as a gain from 1
to 2. A very high fraction of all of the changes we observed in counts of amenities were
in the range of 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0. We could not reject the null hypothesis of linearity
largely because we observed too few higher-order changes.

The sharp differences in significance levels and signs between the OLS and FE
regressions raise questions about the endogeneity of the location of fast food restaurants.

                    Fast Food Locations and Changes in Indianapolis




Recall that we defined the fast food establishments as belonging to chains with national
advertising. These high-volume restaurants are clearly concentrated on the major surface
roads leading in and out of the city center. For example, the two roads at the bottom
center of the map with many fast food locations are the main commuting routes to and
from downtown for residents living in south side suburbs. Traffic flow data would be
useful as an instrument to predict fast food location. Unfortunately, public traffic flow
data are outdated and have limited and highly-uneven coverage.

The supermarkets, shown in the map in Figure 5, are also located primarily along major
streets. The difference between the supermarkets and the fast food restaurants is a relative
dearth in the inner city (the poorest area). The fast food restaurants are well represented
in the inner city.

               Convenience Store Locations and Changes in Indianapolis




Figure 6 and 7 depict locations and changes of limited-service restaurants and
convenience stores. The southwest and southeast corners of the county are still largely
rural. Other than in those undeveloped areas, there are limited-service restaurants and
conveniences stores widely distributed across the county.

One means of addressing the endogeneity of amenity locations is to check whether the
children living near future locations differed in terms of bmiz trends from the children
who will not have the same type of amenity move near them. To test whether the location
of new amenities is related to trends in children’s weight, we regressed children’s weight
prior to the arrival of new amenities on the indicator of whether the new amenity locates
next to the child in the future. We looked at differences between average z score of
children’s BMI as well as differences in time trends of z scores of children’s BMI. Table
7 shows these results. The positive or negative symbol represents the sign of the
coefficient on the future amenity indicator and of the interaction term of that indicator
with the time trend variable, provided they are significant at the 5% level. The results
show that only the location of supermarkets is preceded by differences in children’s
weight, as well as differences in trajectories of children’s weight gain.

The positive trends observed at all four buffers for supermarkets undercut the claim that
their new locations were selected independently of the prior changes in children’s bmiz.
                                                                                          35

Thus, the FE results that supermarkets increase children’s weights at the half-mile buffer
are suspect. Fast food restaurants appear to be entering areas with higher child bmiz
values and higher rates of child obesity, at least for the quarter- and half-mile buffers.
However, these initial differences in levels may not predict the change that will occur
after the arrival of a new fast food restaurant. Our assumption is that gains in bmiz will be
the same for a given stimulus over a broad range of initial bmiz. We believe having the
same trend in bmiz for children with and without future fast food gives us an unbiased
estimate of the response to the arrival of an amenity. Our negative coefficient quarter-
mile fast food result along with no difference in bmiz trends prior to arrival of the fast
food align with the Anderson and Matsa result cited above. While fast food meals are
notoriously calorie-dense, they can have no bmiz effect if children or adults offset the
additional calories by eating less food at other meals or by eating fewer meals.
Alternatively, there may be so much fast food in Indianapolis that any child so inclined
could readily access a fast food restaurant whether one was within a tenth mile or a
quarter mile or not. Either way, as a means of attacking the child obesity epidemic, the
Los Angeles freeze on new fast food restaurants mentioned in the introduction may be
misplaced.

Fast food and supermarkets are the highest-profile amenities. Of the remaining 60 trend
terms (15 amenities times 4 buffers), 11 are significant. These are scattered such that
none of the other amenities has a significant trend term for more than one buffer. Either
the locations of these remaining amenities are not being selected on the basis of
differences in bmiz trends, or we do not have enough data to detect differences in bmiz
trends.

Conclusion:

Our first conclusion is that cross-sectional results differ dramatically from the FE results.
We believe that the cross sectional results tell us more about who chooses to live near an
amenity than what adding that amenity might do. In cross section, nearby (tenth-mile)
fast food increases children’s bmiz. Our cross section regression has controls for child’s
age, race, gender, mother’s age at child’s birth, mother’s education, WIC eligibility,
intention to breastfeed, and many neighborhood characteristics. These are as
comprehensive a set of covariates as we have seen for child BMI regressions. Other study
strengths include directly measured height and weight data for a large sample size that
includes high proportions of African American and Hispanic children. Still, in the fixed
effects framework, nearby (quarter-mile) fast food appears to reduce children’s weights,
with no difference in the trend of bmiz gain prior to the arrival of the fast food. While we
doubt that fast food really reduces children’s bmiz, the results of the fixed effects models
cast doubt on the highly publicized policies to reduce fast food exposure as interventions
for preventing obesity.

A second conclusion is that if the arrival of amenities (other than supermarkets) is
unrelated to prior trends in bmiz, then there appears to be little in the way of surefire
interventions for reducing children’s bmiz, through either recreational amenities or food
vendors. The best candidates appear to be fitness areas, kickball fields, and volleyball
courts. Weight reductions for overweight children (defined as at the 85th percentile of the
pre-epidemic distribution) in the range of 3 to 6 pounds, as estimated for 8 year-old boys
for these amenities, would be valuable interventions.

Our results look at the short term. They look for bmiz responses within the year the
amenity arrives. It may be that a recreational amenity does have a bmiz-reducing effect
on nearby children if it is measured years after its arrival. However, we have few
observations with long runs of time after the arrival of an amenity.

Our study examined associations between bmiz and proximity to amenities within four
buffer distances. We used relatively-simple methods to measure spatial proximity –
straight line (Euclidean) buffers. In future work we will explore more complex measures
of proximity, including network buffers and travel time models that consider movement
along street networks. This will allow us to test other specifications for built
environment variables, including specific distances or travel times to individual
amenities, average distance or time to the closest three amenities of a given type, and
more general measures of accessibility to amenities.

A general assumption of our methods used in this paper is that proximity is a proxy for
exposure to amenities. We don’t have direct observational data on whether or not
children and their families use (or are even aware of) the amenities we measured. In
future prospective work, we hope to collect detailed observational data on spatial and
temporal interaction with amenities through survey and GPS tracking. This may allow us
to better infer causal effects of the built environment on children’s weight.
                                                                                           38

NIH-funded R21 studies are meant to test the feasibility of a new research design. Our
study demonstrates that it is feasible to collect detailed longitudinal data on selected
components of the built environment surrounding the homes of a large sample of children
in a metropolitan area. In total, it took our team about 20 months to assemble and clean
the built-environment data used in the analytical portion of this study. As spatial
information technologies continue to become more widespread and agencies (such as
police, parks, and food safety departments) increasingly collect and organize data on
amenities in forms that are easily extended to spatial analysis, it should be easier to
extend the methods used in this study both spatially (to include larger populations in
multiple cities) and temporally (to include longer-term longitudinal experiments). We
plan to seek funding for a six-city extension of the present study. A six-fold increase in
the sample size over different regions of the country would provide much more reliable
results.

Further, our study demonstrates the benefits of an interdisciplinary team of economists, a
physician, an urban planner, and geographers. It would have been impossible to assemble
these data without the interdisciplinary collaboration.

Lastly, the present paper is our first effort in using these data. We mentioned earlier that
our estimated effects were short term, specifically within a year, and that we intend to
look for persistent effects from changing amenities. We also mentioned earlier that by
looking solely at children at a fixed address who had changes in nearby amenities, we
missed potentially useful information from children who moved toward or away from
specific amenities. We concentrated on the stayers who gained or lost amenities because
we thought that group was least subject to bias due to the endogeneity of amenity
locations. We believe these data are rich enough to yield many more insights.

Appendix on Photo Interpretation

Orthorectified aerial photograph mosaics were available for most study years. The
primary exception was 1996, for which no photographs of Marion County were available.
Small, scattered areas were missing from the 1995 photographs. Photographs were
available for 1998 for most of the county. Owing to a problem with the initial flight for
1998, no photography was available for a narrow band of the county running north to
south through the center. This area was reflown in early 1999 using the same techniques;
the resulting photographs were treated differently in this study from the 1998
photographs, as well as from a complete set of photographs taken later in 1999 using
different techniques.

The photographs varied greatly in quality; only the last four years were in color, and later
years were generally of higher spatial resolution than earlier years, though the 1998 (and
matching early 1999) photographs were significantly coarser than other years. Contrast
was also starker and thus of lower quality in earlier years, particularly in 1995.

All photographs were provided to a team of photo interpreters in digital format. In one
case, 2005, images were available from Indiana University’s spatial data portal,
representing the same original photography as the 2005 file photographs, but reproduced
at higher resolution. Photographs were examined on computer display in ArcMap 9.2,
generally at scales of 1:1000 to 1:2500. Accompanying this was a copy of the amenities
database (described above in the section on data), in which interpreters were to save any
changes.

The county was divided into interpretation areas, usually consisting of a linear strip half a
mile wide, running north to south; each area was assigned to a particular interpreter,
though much of the county was eventually analyzed by more than one interpreter. The
tasks of the interpreter were two: first, to locate recreational amenities of the selected
types and add them to the database (through heads-up digitizing), and second, to
determine during which years each amenity was present. This information was recorded
as attributes of the feature in the database, along with information on the type of amenity,
and the source of the feature, whether a particular interpreter or one of the original files.
If a previously-digitized feature was modified in shape, size, or location by an interpreter,
that information was noted as well. If interpreters were unable to determine the presence
of an amenity (owing to the absence of photographs), a no-data value of -9 was recorded
as that year’s attribute. Finally, features which lay on the border between one
interpretation area and another were flagged with a special attribute, so that duplication
could be avoided. As a quality check on individual interpreters, border features were to
be digitized by both interpreters, and the results compared.

The study team decided to quantify each amenity type in a way judged most likely to
capture the relative recreational opportunities that each provided, with a few practical
constraints. In the case of standardized playing areas, such as tennis courts and football
fields, a count of amenities was deemed appropriate. In the case of scalable amenities,
such as swimming pools and playgrounds, the area of the amenity was deemed the best
                                                                                             46

measure. The opportunity available to each child would be taken as the sum of these
measurements, as they fell within a given distance of the child’s home address. For
example, if 23 m2 of a swimming pool fell within a half-mile radius around the child’s
address, this 23 m2 was added to the value of the child’s swimming pool opportunity.

Guidelines for digitizing were as follows:

•For baseball/softball, basketball, football, kickball, tennis, track and field, and
volleyball, the playing area was to be digitized, as marked where possible.

• Specific guidelines were: For baseball and softball, the boundaries of infield and
outfield were to be digitized; where the outfield was unclear, an arc of radius about twice
the size of the infield was to be digitized. For football, the field was to be digitized goal
line to goal line. For kickball, the infield only was to be digitized. For volleyball, where
markings are seldom present, an approximation of the playing area was sufficient.

• In the case of basketball, if no court were marked, a simple polygon around the hoop
was to be digitized.

• Backyard amenities, specifically swimming pools and playground equipment, were to
be ignored; the inclusion of all such amenities was deemed impractical. Beyond that, no
distinction was made between public and private amenities, since the photography would
not have informed us whether children could access the amenities or not. Private
ownership, as might be determined from a plat overlay, would also not settle the
question, as amenities owned by apartment complexes, homeowner groups, and private
schools might well be accessible to the public.

• Tennis courts were to be digitized wherever found, to maintain consistency with the
practice in creating the original file, and because these were relatively few and
unambiguous.

• Equipment playgrounds with a mulched or sandy area surrounding the equipment were
to be digitized to that area. In the absence of such an area, a convenient shape, a circle or
rectangle, was to be placed around the equipment.

• Swimming pools were to be digitized to the water’s area only; any previously-added
pools in which the deck area was also included were to be modified.

• Family centers were to be digitized to the building’s footprint; though these facilities
were few and none additional identified during the process.

• As soccer fields are not always permanently marked and goals moved frequently as
needed, interpreters were instructed to digitize the entire area which, in their judgement,
was set aside for playing soccer.
                                                                                              47


• In the case of fitness, the entire area in which fitness activities takes place was to be
digitized.

•Any areas where track or field events take place, including tracks, infields, or obviously-
designated external areas, were to be digitized.

•In cases where a particular area is clearly used for more than one of the chosen activities,
overlapping polygons were to be created, according to the previous guidelines.

Limitations on the final product:

• For amenity types that were to be quantified by count, interpreters were instructed not
to correct minor inconsistencies in the original file, so long as general location and
number were accurate. For instance, if a tennis court were digitized to its surrounding
fence, rather than its playing surface, this was deemed sufficient. Thus, the inclusion or
non-inclusion of marginal features within a buffer will be inconsistent by a few meters in
the final data.

•While the quantification of playground equipment might be refined conceptually, none
of these methods was practical for aerial-photograph interpretation. The footprint area of
a jungle gym, for instance, might best capture the opportunity represented by it, but trials
showed this to be impractical, given the presence of shadows and inadequate resolution.

• Playgrounds were to be quantified by area; but the area of playgrounds is difficult to
interpret consistently. Hard-surface playgrounds are often not demarcated clearly, as
they co-exist not only with basketball courts and kickball fields, but with parking lots.
The presence of cars on a surface may be a temporary condition at the time the
photograph was taken, which does not significantly alter the recreational opportunity in a
longer timeframe. Playground equipment is often located in a mulched area, but this
mulched area is not always consistent from one year to the next. Such changes in area,
therefore, were to be disregarded, so long as the playground equipment remained.

• Even in the presence of quality controls, the quality of interpretation must vary
substantially with the individual, and nine individuals contributed to the final
interpretation.

Each interpreter’s completed work was selected from within his or her file; the areas
covered by this work were assembled into a mosaic of recreational amenities. Border
features were examined and redundancies removed, and any systematic errors discovered
through the comparison were corrected; errors in naming were corrected, and any
features marked as unknown were examined by a second interpreter, and either classified
within one of the chosen types, or discarded. Finally, in those cases in 1996 and 1998
where no photographs were available, but where the preceding and following years
matched in value, either both showing present or both showing absent, that value was
substituted for the missing data. The four sets of Euclidean buffers used elsewhere in the
larger study were intersected with the features in the recreational-amenities file.
                                                                                          48



We next performed a merger of all intersected vector features by original amenity, so that
each resulting feature represented a single polygon resulting from the intersection of one
buffer with one amenity. At this point areas in square meters were calculated for all
features. For those features that were to be quantified by area, this area was substituted
as the value for each year in which the original amenity was present. Two copies of the
file were created; in one file, every missing value was substituted with 0, and in the other
file, every missing value was substituted with -9999999. A dissolve was then performed
on the intersected features in each file, preserving buffer identification but grouping by
amenity type, and summing the values for each year.

The resulting values in each feature were taken, in theory, as a measurement of
recreational opportunity, as available to the child living at the center of each buffer,
sorted by amenity type, with a value for each year. In the file in which 0 was substituted
for missing data, the final measurement would represent a minimum. In the file in which
-9999999 was substituted, every measurement in which any component value had been
missing would be negative (as a single value of -9999999 would be greater than any
possible value within the largest buffer used in the study), thereby allowing identification
of the uncertain quantities. The file with the minimum values was used for the
regressions in this study.

Appendix on Land Use Variables:

This appendix describes the data created for a set of social and physical environmental
variables for use in the child obesity research. Data are provided for quarter-mile and
half-mile buffers surrounding the children’s residences. The variables for the quarter-mile
buffers end in 25 and the variables for the half-mile buffers end in 5.

Census Variables

Population density and the proportion of the population African-American were created
from the 2000 census block data from Summary File 1. The education and income
variables were created from the census block group data from Summary File 3. Data from
the surrounding counties were included, so there are no boundary issues near the border
of Marion County.

Population density – popden25 and popden5

This is the gross population density in persons per acre. Block population density was
converted to a grid theme using 50-foot grid cells (used in all of the data creation). The
values are the means of the grid cell densities in the quarter-mile and half-mile buffers.

Proportion of the population African-American – prblk25 and prblk5

Block total population density and the population density African-American were
converted to the grid cells, the means for the buffers were calculated, and these were
divided to obtain the proportion African-American. Areas with zero population could not
have a proportion calculated. This affected the variable prblk25, which has one missing
value.

Proportion graduated from high school – prhs25 and prhs5

This is the proportion of the population aged 25 and over who have graduated from high
school. The densities of the population aged 25 and over and the numbers graduated from
high school were converted to the grid cells, the means for the buffers were calculated,
and these were divided to obtain the proportion graduated from high school. Areas with
zero population aged 25 and over could not have a proportion calculated. This affected
the variable prhs25, which has one missing value.

Proportion graduate from college – prcoll25 and prcoll5

This is the proportion of the population aged 25 and over who have graduated from
college. The densities of the population aged 25 and over and the numbers graduated
from college were converted to the grid cells, the means for the buffers were calculated,
and these were divided to obtain the proportion graduated from college. Areas with zero
population aged 25 and over could not have a proportion calculated. This affected the
variable prcoll25, which has one missing value.
                                                                                           50

Median family income – faminc25 and faminc5

This is an estimate of the median family income for the buffers. The block group median
family income was converted to the grid cells, and the means for the buffers were
calculated. Areas with no families and no median family income reported did not have
values. This affected the variable faminc25, which has one missing value.

Road Network Variables

The planning literature suggests that greater density and interconnectedness of the road
network (indicated by the density of intersections or nodes) should be associated with
greater pedestrian use and physical activity. Data creation begins used the Etak road
network for 2000. This was selected because it represented the network during the middle
of the period for the obesity data, which seemed more reasonable than using the current
road network. Limited-access highways and road segments associated with the
interchanges were deleted from the network as these would not contribute to pedestrian
activity. Data from the surrounding counties were included, so there are no boundary
issues near the border of Marion County.

Road network density – rdlen25 and rdlen5

This is the sum of the length in miles of the road segments with their centroids within the
buffers. The road segments were converted to a point layer with the line centroids, this
was converted to the grid cells, and the results were summed for the buffers.

Number of nodes – nodes25 and nodes5

The layer of road features was converted to a point layer of nodes. Dangling nodes and
pseudonodes were deleted from this layer, leaving those nodes that represent intersections
between roads. This layer was converted to the grid cells, and the count of the number of
nodes in the buffers was obtained by summing those results.

Land Use Variables

The planning literature suggests that mixed land use, especially the presence of
commercial land uses, should be associated with greater pedestrian use and physical
activity. A parcel-based layer of land use in Marion County in 2002 from the Indianapolis
Department of Metropolitan Development was used. Areas of streets and roads were not
included in the delineation of land use. This dataset covered only Marion County, so the
proportions of land use near the boundaries reflect only land use within Marion County.

Proportion land use commercial

This is the proportion of the classified areas of land use (not including areas of roads) that
were classified in one of the commercial (retail and office) land use categories. The land
use data were converted to the grid cells with values of 1 if commercial, 0 if other land
                                                                                           51

use, and no data if road area. The means of these values were determined for the buffers
to provide the proportion commercial.

Proportion land use residential

This is the proportion of the classified areas of land use (not including areas of roads) that
were classified in one of the residential categories. The land use data were converted to
the grid cells with values of 1 if residential, 0 if other land use, and no data if road area.
The means of these values were determined for the buffers to provide the proportion
residential.
