               An Intertemporal Model of Saving and Investment


                                  ABS TRACT

The standard model of optimal growth, interpreted as a model of a market

economy with infinitely long—lived agents, does not allow separation of the

savings decisions of agents from the investment decisions of firms.

Investment is essentially passive: the "one good assumption leads to a

perfectly elastic investment supply; the absence of installation costs for

investment leads to a perfectly elastic investment demand.

     On the other hand, the standard model of temporary equilibrium used in

macroeconomics characterizes both the savings-consumption decision and the

investment decision, or, equivalently, derives a well-behaved aggregate demand

which, in equilibrium, must be equal to aggregate supply.

     Often, however, we want to study the movement of   the   temporary equilibrium

over time in response to a particular shock or pciicy. The discrepancy between

the treatment of investment in the two models makes iiroedding the temporary

equilibrium model in the growth model difficult. This paper characterizes the

dynamic behavior of the optimal growth model with adjustment costs. It shows

the similarity between the temporary equilibrium of the corresponding market

economy and the short—run equilibrium of standard macroeconomic models:

consumption depends on wealth, investment on Tobin's q. Equilibrium is

maintained by the endogenous adjustment of the term structure of interest

rates. It then shows how the equivalence can be used to study the dynamic

effects of policies; it considers various fiscal policies and exploits their

equivalence to technological shifts in the optimal growth problem.

1.   Introduction

The standard model of optimal growth, interpreted as a model of a market

economy with infinitely long—lived agents does not allow separation of the

savings decisions of agents from the investment decisions of firms.

Investment is essentially passive: the "one good" assumption leads to a

perfectly elastic investment supply; the absence of installation costs for

investment leads to a perfectly elastic investment demand.

     On the other hand, the standard model of temporary equilibrium used

in macroeconomics, such as the Metzler [6] model for example, characterizes

both the savings—consumption decision and the investment decision, or,

equivalently, derives a well—behaved aggregate demand which, in equilibrium,

must be equal to aggregate supply.

     Often, however, we want to study the movement of the temporary

equilibrium over time in response to a particular shock or policy. The

discrepancy between the treatment of investment in the two models makes

imbedding the temporary equilibrium model in the growth model difficult.

This is a particularly serious problem if the assumption of rational

expectations is made, as in this case expected future events affect the

current equilibrium and it becomes impossible to characterize the current

equilibrium without using an intertemporal model.

     The obvious solution is to modify the optimal growth model by relaxing

one of the two assumptions which imply passive investment behavior. This

can be done either by introducing a two—sector technology which generates

a well—defined investment supply function (Srinivasan [7], Uzawa [91), or

it can be done by introducing installation or adjustment costs which

generate a well—defined investment demand function. The purpose of this

paper is to characterize the dynamic behavior of the optimal growth model
                                    2



with adjustment costs, to show the similarity between the temporary

equilibrium of the corresponding market economy and the temporary

equilibrium of standard short—run macroeconomic models, and finally to

show how easily this model can be used to study the dynamic effects of

shocks or policies. The paper is organized as follows:

     Section 2 sets up and solves the optimal growth problem of an

economy with adjustment costs.

     Section 3 characterizes the behavior of agents and firms in a market

economy which replicates the centralized economy described in Section 2.

Consumption decisions are made by intertemporally optimizing households;

at any point of time consumption is an increasing function of total wealth,

including human capital, evaluated at market interest rates. Investment

decisions are made by value—maximizing firms; at any point in time

investment is an increasing function of the shadow price of capital, in a

manner similar to Tobin's [81 q. The equality of saving and investment

is maintained at every point in time by the endogenous adjustment of

current and future market interest rates. The temporary equilibrium in

this model is similar to the standard IS relation of many short—run macro

models.

     Section 4 formally proves the equivalence of the centralized and

market economies.

     Sections 5 and 6 use this equivalence to study the effects of various

fiscal policies. To do this, we use the equivalence of these fiscal

policies in the market economy to technology shifts in the centralized

economy. We consider five different policies, lump—sum taxes, proportional

taxes on gross output, profit or consumption, and investment tax credits.

The proceeds of these taxes are either used for government spending or
                                   3


redistributed in lump—sum rebates. Section 5 shows equivalence and steady—

state effects. Section 6 studies the dynamic effects of lump—sum and

consumption taxes, depending on whether they are anticipated or

unanticipated, and whether the economy is in or out of steady state.

2. The Centralized Economy

The central planning problem is the following:



2.1       max J       U(ct)et      dt         subject to:




2.2        f(k) =            +      + h(i/k))



2.3           =        — Sk      ; k0 =


                      > 0, TJ() < 0, U'(O)        =


                      > 0,   f"(•) <    0, f'(O) =


           h(0)   =    0, h'() >       0, 2h'(•) + h"(•) > 0



      All variables are in per capita terms, with standard interpretations.

This problem differs from the standard optimal growth problem only because

of the presence of costs of installation h(s). In order to undertake gross

investment of i units of capital, i units of output must be set aside to

be installed as capital, together with jh(j/k) units which are used during

installation. Thus gross investment per capita at rate i has an opportunity

cost of i(1 + h(i/k)) units of output.2 The properties of h(•) make the

total installation cost ih(i/k) nonnegative, convex with a minimum value

of zero which is attained when gross investment is zero. An alternative

formulation, which is as plausible, would make installation costs a

function of net investment; the net investment formulation is sometimes

technically more attractive, as it simplifies the characterization of the

steady state and of local dynamics.
                                           5



        The Hamiltonian for this problem is



2.4         et[U(f(kt) -     i(1 +     h(i/k))) + y(f -



where      is the shadow price, measured in units of utility, of an additional

unit of installed capital at time t.

      The optimality conditions,3 defining x /k and H(x)
I + h(x) + xh'(x), are:



2.5         U' (c)H(x) =
                            y
2.6            =    ( + )y — U'(c)[f'(k)       + x h'(x)J


2.7         lim —t
                 e yk =         0
            t-o



      Consider     (2.5) first. H(x) is the marginal opportunity cost of

investment. Thus the condition states that this marginal cost measured

in units of utility must be equal to y.

      Consider (2.6). x h'(x) is the reduction in the opportunity cost

of installation ih(i/k) made possible by an additional unit of capital.

Therefore f'(k) + x h'(x) is the total marginal product of capital.

Solving (2.6) subject to the transversality condition (2.7) gives:



                                                      )(st) ds
2.8            =       U'(c)[x2     h'(x) + f(k )}e
                   J
                                                   6



This states that y in turn must be equal to the present discounted value

of marginal products, also measured in units of utility.



Steady state and dynamics

If y =    k   =    0, x          6 and the steady—state capital stock is given by a

modified "modified golden rule":                  f'(k) +
(j3 +             + h(6) + 6h'(6)). This implies f'(k) > (                + 6).      This comes

from installation costs which make the opportunity cost larger than in the

standard optimal growth model.

        The system (2.3,5,6) is a dynamic system in (k, y, x) where either y

or x can beeflminated. Although y plays an important conceptual role, it

is more useful to characterize the dynamics in terms of (k, x) as the

movement of k, x and c can be directly obtained from the phase diagram.

        Eliminating c in (2.5) using (2.2), differentiating (2.5) with

respect to time and eliminating y using (2.6) gives:




2.9               [H'(x) -            (H(x))2k]        [(6+6)H(x) -   x2h'(x)   -   f'(k)}

                             -
                                 U'()   H(x)[f'(k) -    X(i   + h(X))]k



This equation, together with k =             k(x   —   6),    characterizes the equations of

motion. The complete characterization is done in the appendix; the results

are displayed in Figures I and II.

        The steady state is a saddle point equilibrium. The transversality

condition requires the system to be on the unique stable path. Convergence

of x and k to their equilibrium values is monotonic. Figure II draws iso-

consumption loci. Iso-consumption loci satisfy:        f(l:) —   kx(1 + h(x)) =
constant and for a given x, reach their maximum at k such that f'(k) =

x(1 + h(x))   .   This   allows us to characterize the behavior of consumption

in Figure I, at least between points A and B. Consumption is monotonically

increasing when the steady state is approached from the northwest,

monotonically decreasing when the steady state is approached from the

southeast.

3. The Market Economy

We now consider an economy in which agents have the same utility function

and firms the same technology as in the previous section. We characterize

the maximization problem of firms and agents and show the role of the

sequence of interest rates in clearing the goods market.



Value maximization by firms

Production is carried out by many identical competitive firms. For

notational simplicity, the number of firms is equal to the number of agents

so that the same symbol denotes the ratio of a variable per capita or per

firm.

        Each firm faces a time path of interest rates {r }                         .   The
                                 _ft rdv                              t    [O,c)
                                      °
discount factor              e                 gives the rate at which output at time t can
be traded for output at time zero.

        For simplicity, we do not explicitly model the labor market. As labor

is in fixed supply, labor market equilibrium and the above normalization

imply that there will be one worker per firm, each firm facing a time path

of wage bills {w }          . Thus the decision problem of the representative
                  t = [O,c)
firm is to choose a time path of investment which maximizes the present

value of its cash flow:




                                  —
            V =
                  J[f(kt)              i(1 +    h(i/k)) —
                                                            w]pdt     subject to:



                =
                    i   —
                            Skt
                                             9



The Hamiltonian for this problem is:




             Pt[f(kt) — :1t(1   + h(i/k)) —
                                                 w   +   q(i   —




The optimality conditions,3 recalling the definitions of            and H(x), are



3.1
            H(xt)



3.2             =
                     (r +       —
                                    [ft(k)   + x h'(x)]


3.3          urn p          0
                     t




        Consider (3.1) first. It states that investment takes place until the
marginal cost of investing equals the shadow value of installed capital.

As H'() > 0 the equation can be inverted to give i/k as an increasing

function of q, in. a manner similar to Tobin's q theory of investment.

        Condition (3.2) can be solved subject to the transversality condition

(3.3) to give:




                =        [x h'(x)   + f'(k)]e                  ds




The shadow price q is the present value of marginal products. Note the

similarities and dissimilarities with equation (2.8) in the centralized

economy: returns are measured in units of output, not in units of

utility and the discount rate depends on the market—determined interest

rate.
                                             10



     After having paid wages to workers, the firm has to decide how to

distribute profit and finance investment. It may finance investment by

retaining earnings or by issuing shares or bonds. All financing schemes

are equivalent in the sense that they lead to the same path of consumption

and investment; they differ, however, in terms of institutional arrangements.

     A notationally and conceptually simple financing scheme is that firms

finance investment by retaining earnings and never issue new shares or

bonds. In this case, equilibrium personal savings would be zero at every

point in time. Note also that in the absence of a bond market, interest

rates would not be directly observable.

     We adopt a slightly different scheme, in which firms finance themselves

both by retaining earnings and by issuing new bonds. Specifically,

replacement investment is financed out of retained earnings and net

investment is financed by bonds. Let Bt be the number of bonds per capita

outstanding at time t, each paying r units of output at time t. The net—

of—interest cash flow of the firm is



                                                  -
          f(k) -       kx(1      + h(x)) -
                                             w        rB

The dividend         distributed by the firm is output less depreciation, wages

and interest:



                =
                    f(kt)   -
                                k(1 + h(6)) - w       -
                                                          rB

     The excess of dividends over net—of—interest cash flow must be financed

by issuing new bonds:
                                         11



               =                              + h()J]
3.6
                   k[x(1     + h(x)) -



      There is a simple relation between the value of the owners' equity,

the value of the firm's liabilities, the shadow value q and the capital

stock:




3.7
           qk Vt =          Bt   + pds

      The second equality simply reflects the fact that the value of the

firm is equal to the sum of its liabilities and owners1 equity and that

it is independent of the method of financing. The first equality is more

interesting; it says that "average q" and "marginal q" are equal, implying

therefore a simple relation between investment and the observable average

value. This equality depends on the production and investment installation

functions being linearly homogeneous in labor, capital and investment. The

proof is a special case of Hayashi [3].



Utility maximization by consumers

Each consumer supplies one unit of labor inelastically and receives a wage

w. His only decision problem is to choose a sequence of consumption which

maximizes the present value of utility:



           I   U(c t )e_t
          Jo
                                                12



The wealth constraint can be expressed as:



                     + w +
                 =
                                  rB — c         ;   urn PtBt
                                                     t±co
                                                                  0



Income is the sum of wages, interest on bond holdings and dividends.     It

must be allocated either to consumption or to savings in the form of bonds,

Bt. The Hamiltonian for this problem is:



            e_t[U(ct) +   X(           + w + rB —           c)j
                                            3
       The optimality conditions are



3.8        U'(c) =


3.9        A =
            t           tt
                     — r )X



3.10       lim et =           0
           t*3


Equations 3.8 and 3.9 determine the path of the rate of change of marginal

utility. The level of this path is determined by the wealth constraint,

which can be written as


            0
                                   *                    *     r
                        V + V              V =    qk, V
           i0 cpdt                     ;
                                                              j
                                                                  wpdt

This shows that consumption depends on both nonhuman and human wealth.

It also shows how q enters both the investment decision of firms and the

consumption decision of consumers.
                                     13



       The condition for equilibrium in the goods market is that output

equals spending:



3.11          k) = c + kx(1 + h(x)J


       This condition, together with the anticipation that this condition

will hold at all future times, determines at any instant the complete term

structure of interest rates. The temporary equilibrium of this economy is

similar to the IS relation of closed—economy macroeconomic models. Aggregate

demand is the sum of consumption and investment. Consumption is an increasing

function of total wealth in the spirit of Metzler. Investment is an

increasing function of the ratio of market value to capital in the spirit

of Tobin. Aggregate demand is brought into equality with aggregate supply,

in this full employment model, by the endogenous adjustment of the term

structure of interest rates.

4. Equivalence of the Two Economies

To show equivalence, we must first show that the equations of motion of the

market economy replicate those of the centralized one. Consider the two

shadow prices of the market economy, A1, associated with consumption and

      associated with investment. Define y E
                                                    qX.     From (3.1) and (3.8),



4.1             =
                    U'(c)H(x)

This is identical to (2.5). Differentiating with respect to time:



4.2        yt       tt tt

Substituting    (3.2) for q1, (3.9) for A, we obtain

This is identical to (2.6) in the centralized economy. The shadow price

   is therefore the product of the consumption and investment shadow prices.

economy imply the transversality condition of the centralized economy.

       The equivalence between the two economies is hardly surprising. It

is nevertheless very useful as it allows, when studying the effects of

various shocks or policies, to use the equations of motion of the centralized

economy with its unique shadow price rather than the equations of motion of

the market economy with the two shadow prices which themselves depend on

market—determined interest rates. This is what we do now, using this

equivalence to study the effects of various fiscal policies.

5. Fiscal Policies and Technological Shifts

Extending Halls [2] analysis from the standard optimal growth model, we

study the following fiscal policies: a head tax——or lump—sum tax——in

amount 0 per agent; a proportional tax on gross output f(k), at rate

a proportional tax on profit4 (f(k) — w)   ,   at   rate 02; a proportional tax

on net output (f(k) -   kx(1 + h(x))), at rate O3 which can also be
interpreted as a tax on consumption; finally an investment tax credit,

which we treat as a proportional subsidy to investment spending

kx(1 + h(x)), at rate 04• All these policies are balanced budget policies

and are either refunded as lump—sum taxes or used for government spending

in a way which does not affect private investment or consumption decisions.

     We now consider three types of technological shifts, a, b, and n which

affect the production and installation functions. These functions become

(1—a)f(k) — a and (1_b)kx(1 + h(x)) respectively.

     It is now straightforward to show the equivalence of each fiscal

policy to a combination of these technological shifts. These equivalences

are given in Table I.   If, as in the third column of the table, the

government uses tax revenue to purchase current output, then the output

available to the private sector declines by the amount of the tax revenue.

Alternatively, if the government redistributes tax revenue via lump—sum

rebates, as in column two, then output available to the private sector is

unchanged by the imposition of taxes. To study the effect of a policy in

the decentralized economy, we may instead study the effects of the

equivalent combination of technological shifts in the centralized economy.

Once the behavior of consumption, investment and output is characterized,

it is relatively easy to deduce the market clearing sequence of interest

rates in the market economy.

           The relevant equations, including the equations of motion, of the

 centralized economy are direct extensions of (2.2) to (2.9):



 5.1              (1-a)f(k) -                                    =    c

 5.3             y =    (+)y - U'(c)[(l-a)ft(k)              + (1—b)x2 h'(x)]

5.5              [H'(x) -
                                        (1-b)(H(x))2 k] =


                               -    2
                                        h'(x) -              f'(k)]

                 -         H(x) [(1-a)f'(k) - (1-b)x(1 + h(x))J



       Consider first the steady—state effects of these policies. Setting
x =    k   =   0 gives, from (5.4) and (5.5),



                           =            [(+)H(o)    -    2    h'()]


       Two of the policies, the head tax (a = b = 0) and the net output tax

(a = b =
               3),     have no effect on the steady—state capital stock; their full

effect is on consumption which decreases by the amount of tax. The

investment subsidy (a =            0, b = 04)      increases the capital stock while both

the gross output and profit taxes (a =                        or 02 b = 0) decrease it.

    The more interesting effects are the dynamic effects. Going through

all dynamic effects for all policies would exhaust the reader's patience.

In the next section we consider two simple policies——a head tax and a

consumption tax——both used to finance government spending.
                                   20


6. Dynamic Effects of Lump—sum and Consumption Taxes

Lump—sum taxes

As shown in the previous section, the steady—state capital stock is

independent of changes in lump-sum taxes. Thus, if the economy is in

steady state when there occurs a permanent unanticipated increase in

lump—sum taxes of ia, consumption immediately and permanently decreases

by      There is no effect on investment, or the capital stock at any

point of time.

     Now consider an economy which is outside of steady state, for example

at point A in Figure III, when there is an unanticipated permanent increase

in c. Whether the equations of motion (5.4) and (5.5) of (x, k) are

affected depends on whether —       , the   coefficient of absolute curvature

——or absolute risk aversion in a different context——which we denote by cL(c),

is affected by a change in c.

     Suppose c(c) is constant, i.e. c'(c)    0. The time path of marginal
                      U'(c)
rates of substitution U'(c Vs,t is unaffected by an equal absolute

decrease in consumption of tc at every point in time. Thus, if ct'(c)     0,

the effect of a permanent change in c is to crowd out private consumption

immediately and permanently by 100%, with no effect on capital accumulation

     Suppose now c(c) > 0 Yc, so that an equal absolute decline in

consumption increases the marginal utility of consumption by more

when consumption is high. Consider the case in which the steady state is

approached from the northwest, such as point A in Figure III and consumption

is increasing over time. An equal absolute decline in consumption would

therefore increase future marginal utility more than present marginal

utility; this in turn would lead consumers to increase future consumption.
                                     21



This suggests that in this case, the increase o will initially crowd out

consumption by more than 100% and therefore increase investment. A proof

is given in Appendix B.

       Let us refer to the path which would have been followed in the absence

of the fiscal change as the "original't path. As the steady—state capital

stock is unaffected, investment must decrease below its original path

during some time. At the time when investment has the same value as on the

original path, capital and output are higher and thus consumption plus taxes

must be higher than on the original path. Thus, consumption must before

that time have increased faster than on the original path, and must increase

more slowly after that time. In the decentralized economy, this is

accomplished by a twist in the term structure of interest rates, with an

increase in r in the short run and a decrease in r in the long run.

       The opposite argument holds if the steady state is approached from the

southeast, with decreasing consumption. The argument and conclusions are

reversed if a'(c) < 0, i.e. if the utility has decreasing absolute curvature

(risk aversion).

       We now consider the effects of an anticipated increase in lump—sum

taxes. For convenience, we assume that the economy is initially in steady

state, that a = b = 0 and that cL'(c)     0. Relaxing these restrictions

complicates the exposition but changes nothing of substance.

       It is easier to understand the effects by working backward in time.

Suppose that the increase is implemented at time t but known as of time

t0 <   t.    At time t*,y, the costate variable cannot have an anticipated

discontinuity5; therefore c and x have to satisfy the following two

relations:

          ct*+ kt'x t      + h(xt'))   = f(kt*)   —




These two loci are drawn in Figure IV. An increase in 0 causes a downward

jump in both c and x. The relative size of jumps in c and x depends on the

ratio of convexities Ht(x)/Utt(c). If there are no adjustment costs, the

adjustment will come entirely from investment. If utility is nearly

linear, most of the adjustment will be in consumption.

     Given the assumption that c2'(c)       0, the equations of motion in the

(k, x) plane are not affected by the change in policy. Two possible paths,

corresponding to two different jumps in x at time t, are characterized in

Figure III. They are EA0A1A2E and EAA1AE.

     Unless utility is linear, the anticipation of the tax increase will

reduce consumption and increase investment. When the tax increase takes

place, it does not fall entirely on consumption but falls also on

investment. Net investment is negative and capital is decumulated back

to its steady state level. Consumption keeps decreasing after the

increase in taxes until it reaches its lower steady state value.

     The temporary accumulation of capital smooths the effects of the tax

on consumption. Because of adjustment costs, the smoothing is not complete

and there is a discontinuous fall in consumption at the time of the tax

increase. In the absence of adjustment costs, there would be no such fall

and consumption would decrease continuously from the time of the announcement.

    What is the associated sequence of rates which will replicate this

path of consumption and investment? The interest rate at time t' must be

infinitely negative for an instant in order to generate the discontinuous
                                     23



decreases in consumption and investment. (This unappealing feature is due

 to the discontinuity in a and could be eliminated either by moving to

discrete time as in Hall [211 or by making a(t) continuous.) From Figure III

and equation (3.9), as consumption may be increasing or decreasing between

   and t, and is decreasing after t*, short rates may be either above or

below their initial value of     between t0 and t, and are lower than

after t.

     In summary, a permanent increase in lump—sum taxes has no steady—state

effect, except on consumption which it crowds out completely. If the

increase is unanticipated, it crowds out consumption instantaneously by

100% if the economy is initially in steady state; if the capital stock is

below steady state, the immediate effect is to decrease consumption by more

than, less than, or exactly 100%——and increase, decrease or leave unchanged

investment——depending on whether —         is   an increasing, decreasing or

constant function of c.    If the increase in taxes is anticipated, the

anticipation itself increases investment and decreases consumption; the

implementation decreases both investment and consumption. This reflects

the desire of consumers to smooth the path of anticipated consumption.



Consumption taxes

The effects of a permanent net output, or consumption, tax are very

similar to the effects of a lump—sum tax. They will be stated with

only a sketch of a proof given in the appendix. Some of the results

below assume that a = 0.

    An unanticipated permanent increase in the tax rate completely

crowds out consumption and has no effect on investment and the capital

stock if the economy is initially in steady state. If the economy is
                                     24


not initially in steady state, the dynamic behavior depends on the

coefficient of relative curvature (c)      —          If   the capital stock

is lower than its steady—state value, a permanent unanticipated increase

in the tax will crowd out private consumption initially by more than, less

than or exactly 100% depending on whether t(c) is positive, negative or

zero.

        The effects of an anticipated increase in the tax rate depend on the

value of (c). If (c) is identically equal to unity, i.e. the utility

function is logarithmic, there is no anticipation effect: consumption

does not change before the change in the tax and falls when the tax is

imposed. This paradoxical result was noted by Hall and we borrow his

explanation. If we view the tax as a consumption tax, the announcement

has two effects, a substitution effect in favor of consumption before the

tax increase and an income effect which tends to decrease current

consumption. If         1, the two effects cancel each other. In general,

consumption decreases, remains unchanged, or increases depending on whether

(c) is greater than, less than or equal to unity.

7. Conclusion

We   have   developed a dynamic model of saving and investment based on

competitive optimizing consumers and firms. In the short—run equilibrium

of this model, consumption is an increasing function of total wealth and

investment is an increasing function of the shadow price of installed

capital relative to the price of output. The determination of these two

components of aggregate demand is consistent with many short—run macro

models. Put differently, this paper provides a consistent intertemporal

framework in which to embed standard IS relations, and thus to characterize

more fully the dynamic effects of shocks or policies.

(A2

(A2
      0) and (k = 0) intersect at the steady state E. The three loci

divide the (k, x) plane into seven regions. Table II gives the signs

of the components of x, (A2, A3, 1c) for each region. It follows from

Table II that x = 0 lies in regions II, III and VI and passes through B.

Appendix B. Effects of an unanticipated permanent head tax outside of

steady state

We consider the case in which a' (c) > 0 and the steady state is reached

from the northwest so that consumption is increasing. This case

corresponds to region III in Figure V.

    We first show that for any (k, x) point in region III, including the

stable arm, x is now more negative than before the increase in i, de.

From (5.5) in the text:



                   [H'(x) + a(c)(1-b) (H(x))2k1          x
          dxtkX

                   {-   a' (c)H(x)   [(1—a)f' (k) -   (1-b)x(1   + h(x)) ]k(x-6)


                    + a'(c)(1-b)(H(x))2kx}d



From Table II, dxkx < 0 in region III.

     For any point in region III below the original stable arm, x falls

too rapidly to reach E under the original laws of motion. Since x falls

even more rapidly under the new laws of motion, the new stable path to E

cannot lie below the original stable path, Therefore the new stable path

lies above the original stable path.

     The case in which the steady state is approached from the southeast and

the cases associated with a' (c) < 0 can be analyzed in a similar way.

Appendix C. Dynamic effects of a permanent consumption tax

If a = 0 and a =          b, (5.5) can be rewritten as:



             [H'(x) +(f(k) - kx(1 + h(x)J)1(H(x))2k(c)]x =


                  [( +       )H(x) - x2ht(x)      -    f'(k)J   +


                      [f(k) -   kx(1   + h(x))] 1(f'(k) -       x(1 + h(x)))H(x)(c)


              (   C      —   cU"(c)
                              U'(c)

        Thus if '(c) = 0, the equations of motion of k and x are unaffected

by a change in the consumption tax. If '(c) + 0, an analysis similar to

the one used in Appendix B can be used to characterize the shift in the

stable arm.

     To characterize the effects of an anticipated increase in the tax at

time t say, consider the movements in c and x at time t. c arid x

satisfy (5.1) and (5.2), with a = 0, a = b.                     Differentiating with respect

to c, x and a gives:



            dx =             U' (c)H(x) [1 -


            dc =       _1[_     U'(c)H'(x)c -     (1-a)k(H(x))2U'(c)]


where                 U'(c)H'(x)(l-a) —        W'(c)(H(x)J2(1—a)2k.


     If (c)            1, then dx = 0.         If (c)       1, then '(c)    0 and the

equations of motion are unchanged; thus if x does not jump at time t,
                                   30



it remains constant for all t. If F(c) + 1, then dx + 0 and the results

given in the text follow from the phase diagram.
