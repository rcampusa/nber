This paper examines how supply-side policies may play a role in fighting a low aggregate demand
that traps an economy at the zero lower bound (ZLB) of nominal interest rates. Future increases in
productivity or reductions in mark-ups triggered by supply-side policies generate a wealth effect that
pulls current consumption and output up. Since the economy is at the ZLB, increases in the interest
rates do not undo this wealth effect, as we will have in the case outside the ZLB. We illustrate this
mechanism with a simple two-period New Keynesian model. We discuss possible objections to this
set of policies and the relation of supply-side policies with more conventional monetary and fiscal
policies.

1. Introduction

Although the point of this paper is utterly unoriginal and well understood by many, it is,
however, not fully appreciated by a wider audience: supply-side policies can play a role in
economies trapped at the zero lower bound (ZLB) of the nominal interest rates. The essence
of the argument is straightforward: any policy that raises future output (for instance, by
improving productivity or by reducing mark-ups) generates a wealth e¤ect that increases the
desire to consume today and decreases the desire to save. Thus, supply-side measures address
the core of the problem of the ZLB, the weakness of current aggregate demand. Supply-side
policies are helpful precisely because there is an aggregate demand shortfall.
       This point provides a formal support for proposals of structural reforms in countries that
have su¤ered from the dire consequences of debt crises and the ZLB.1 Far from being a call
for “more of the same,”supply-side policies, such as reforming labor market institutions, lib-
eralizing service sectors to strengthen competition, or improving professional and vocational
education, can be part of a coherent strategy to …ght stagnation.
       Our point is di¤erent from the more traditional “grow-out-of-debt” argument based on
the idea that, as a country grows, its debt burden becomes proportionally smaller. While
that argument is trivially true as an accounting proposition, its formulation usually fails at
specifying how to get that growth going. Our insistence in the wealth e¤ect illuminates, in
comparison, which type of mechanism will work to deliver the desired result.
       Obviously, the possibility of using supply-side policies to cure the maladies of the ZLB
should not be read as an argument for inaction along other fronts. Fiscal and monetary
policy can be used in a coordinated fashion. For instance, …scal policy can be directed
toward expenditures, such as investments on infrastructure or R&D, that, beyond pulling
aggregate demand today, may raise future productivity. Our position is, more modestly, that
supply-side policies should not be forgotten and that, in many economies, they may be one
of the most powerful tools left around.
       Think, for instance, about the cases of countries such as Portugal or Spain that are
members of the Euro zone. Without their own currency, these countries cannot rely much
on monetary policy. Similarly, policies such as exchange rate depreciation or tari¤s, which
may induce an increase in aggregate demand, are out of the question, at least while the
currency union is maintained. At the same time, perhaps in an unfair fashion, …scal policy is
severely limited by a growing level of sovereign debt and the ever-increasing cost of servicing

   1
     Technically, countries such as Portugal or Spain are not at the ZLB, since the nominal interest rates are
slightly positive. However, the ECB will not let the short-term nominal interest rate cannot fall further. The
rigidity of the nominal interest rate is all we need to deliver the results here. In fact, having a slightly positive
nominal interest rate when the natural interest rate should be negative makes the situation even worse.


                                                         2
it. Financial markets are forcing peripheral countries to undertake a contractionary …scal
consolidation.2 But even in the absence of debt crisis, the evidence in Ilzetzki, Mendoza, and
Végh (2010) that …scal multipliers in high-debt countries are zero hints at possible decreasing
returns of …scal policy as countries accumulate larger debts. With both monetary and …scal
policy o¤ the table, supply-side policies are among the last men standing.
       Fortunately, these countries also have a su¢ cient number of “low-hanging fruits”in terms
of supply-side reforms that can be easily snatched. Anyone even vaguely familiar with the
deep inadequacies of the Spanish labor market or with the surrealistic regulations in many
sectors of its economy cannot but forecast considerable gains out of structural reforms. One
interesting aspect of our argument is that it does not depend on a permanent change in the
growth trend of the economy, something that after 25 years of endogenous growth theory is
still a policy chimera, but only on the possibility of increases in the level of output. As long
as we can generate a wealth e¤ect that is signi…cant, supply-side policies will play a positive
role. Thus, we are much more sanguine about the role of supply-side policies in Eurozone
countries than in the U.S. or the United Kingdom where, arguably, there are less productivity
gains to be picked up.
       We illustrate all the previous paragraphs with a simple two-period New Keynesian model.
Prices are …xed in the …rst period but can be changed, at a cost, in the second period. This
nominal rigidity makes output partially demand-determined. The representative household
consumes, supplies labor, holds money, and saves. When the (gross) nominal interest rate is
above 1, the household holds money to diminish transaction costs and saves in terms of an
uncontingent nominal bond. When the nominal interest rate is 1 (the nominal rate of return
of money net of the marginal reduction of transaction costs), the household is indi¤erent
between holding money or bonds. Because of price rigidity, prices cannot adjust as fast
as they should and the real interest rate is not low enough to induce a su¢ cient level of
consumption in the current period.
       Then, if we suddenly increase productivity in the second period (or, alternatively, we lower
the market power of …rms), future output and consumption will rise. Because of the Euler
equation of consumption, higher future consumption is followed by either higher interest rates
and/or higher consumption today. Since, at the ZLB, the nominal rates are stuck at zero,
this wealth e¤ect of higher future output is translated into higher consumption and hours
worked today.

   2
    The reasons why this happens, justi…ed or not, are uninteresting here. While a better regulation of
…nancial markets or of rating agencies could ease the limitations to activist …scal policies in small open
economies, there is disappointingly little each of these countries can do on its own for this reform to come
about.



                                                     3
       This argument is not particularly novel even if it is perhaps cast in unfamiliar terms.
Already Krugman (1998), who started the modern literature on the ZLB, used a drop in
future productivity as the reason for the economy to be stuck at a low level of output.
Krugman conjectured that Japan’s problems could come from the lower growth potential
caused by demographic aging. In this paper, we are just reverting the direction of the change
in future output and thinking about it as a policy option.3 Our alternative mechanism of
increased competition is, as far as we are aware, original in the literature, although it follows
rather directly from the logic of the model.
       A possible reason why this point is not discussed more often is that increments in produc-
tivity in the current period actually make the problem of the ZLB worse. Higher productivity
today means that the current weak demand can be satis…ed with even less inputs, thus further
reducing the level of employment and, in many environments, aggravating the de‡ationary
spiral created by the ZLB. That is why we focus on the importance of future productivity
gains or reductions in mark-ups, which do not su¤er from this problem. In any case, in prac-
tice, nearly all policies that increase productivity will have a considerable implementation
lag. Hence, when we talk about supply-side policies, we are talking about future productiv-
ity increases (and more competition in the goods market has positive e¤ects in the short run
even if it was implemented in the …rst period).
       Our argument of a wealth e¤ect that, when the interest rate does not respond, increases
current consumption and labor resembles the mechanism in the “news”literature (Jaimovich
and Rebelo, 2009). Instead of using a more general class of preferences that control for the
wealth e¤ects, as in Jaimovich and Rebelo, we rely on the absence of changes in the interest
rate to deliver the result. More generally, there is a common point that any positive wealth
e¤ect, regardless of where it comes from, helps demand today. For instance, …scal policies
that decrease future government consumption achieve the same objective of raising future
(private) consumption.4
       Finally, we highlight that the model we present is of interest in itself. It is a simple
environment that allows us to easily …nd an exact solution and to characterize it. Also, it
embodies all the classical results about the ZLB highlighted in the literature. Our quest
for simplicity puts us close to the attractive model of Mankiw and Weinzierl (2011). Our
emphasis and goals are, however, di¤erent. We incorporate an explicit labor supply decision,

   3
     Rogo¤ (1998), in his discussion of Krugman’s paper, makes en passant the same point that future pro-
ductivity gains are a solution to the ZLB problem, but without explicitly linking it to a policy strategy.
   4
     Similarly, there is also a somewhat more indirect connection with the literature on uncertainty shocks
(see Bloom, 2009 or Fernández-Villaverde et al., 2011). Reductions in future uncertainty increase the desire
to consume today because they lower precautionary saving. In the absence of a response of the interest rate
caused by the ZLB, those e¤ects would be much bigger than in the standard case.

monopolistic competition, a role for money through transaction costs, and (partial) price
rigidity in the second period. These features are relevant for the economics of the mechanism
that we explore. For example, our speci…cation of the transaction costs makes it transparent
when the demand for money is satiated and the di¤erent forces that a¤ect it.5 Monopolistic
competition is required to talk about changes in the market power of …rms. On the other
hand, we eliminate government expenditure and have a simpler set of policy tools, since our
objective is not to assess …scal or monetary policy. However, it would be straightforward to
incorporate all these elements in the model at the cost of some extra notation.
       The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we present our model and in
section 3 we discuss its equilibrium conditions. Section 4 outlines a parametric speci…cation
that leads us, in section 5, to generate some numerical results. In section 6 we discuss
objections to our argument and we conclude in section 7. The appendix contains extra
algebra.


2. Model

We …x a simple monetary environment with two periods, t 2 f1; 2g. The presence of money
is motivated by three mechanisms. First, money reduces, up to some level, the transaction
costs required to reach a given level of consumption. This mechanism, introduced by Sims
(1994), generates a demand for money both when interest rates are positive and when they
are at the ZLB. Second, money can be a store of value between periods. When the ZLB binds,
the household is indi¤erent between using nominal bonds or money as a saving vehicle: both
assets yield the same return. Thus, when the ZLB binds, the household can hold more money
in equilibrium than it would otherwise need to minimize its transaction costs. Third, money
in period 2 appears in the utility function. This captures the idea that money is valuable in
the long run. Also, it sets up a terminal condition to induce the household to hold money at
the end of period 2 beyond the desire to reduce transaction costs.6
       Nominal rigidities appear in two forms. First, prices in the …rst period are given and
…xed. This rigidity is a form of in‡ation inertia where prices are predetermined (for instance,
because …rms set their prices before shocks in the economy are realized). Second, …rms have

   5
     Also, it introduces a new channel, which in the interest of space we do not explore, where changes in the
transaction technology have an e¤ect on when the economy is at the ZLB. We are unware of this point being
mentioned before in the literature.
   6
     This extra utility term makes the problem more symmetric between the two periods. When the household
holds money in the …rst period, it gets the reduction in transaction cost and an asset that pays o¤ in the
second period (even if its real rate of return is negative). In the absence of money-in-the-utility, in the second
period, money would yield only a reduction in transaction cost. The asymmetry between the two periods
would induce a large movement in the price level that would hide the channel that we are interested in.

to pay a cost to change their prices in the second period. Nominal rigidities make output
partially demand-determined and give the ZLB a real bite.
       Our model abstracts from two important aspects. First, we do not have uncertainty
to keep the model as analytically tractable as possible, and we generate a ZLB through a
discount factor bigger than 1. We could also imagine that this high discount factor is a
random variable and that the …xed price level p1 comes about because …rms must decide
their prices before observing the realization of the factor.7 Second, and for simplicity, …scal
policy is trivial.

2.1. Household

There is a representative household with preferences:
                                                                                     !

                                                +                       + log
                                 1                    1                         p2

                                                                         m2
where ct is consumption at time t, lt is labor supply, and               p2
                                                                              are real balances (nominal money
m2 divided by the price level p2 ). We will assume                 > 1, that is an elasticity of intertemporal
substitution lower than 1 (as most of the empirical literature estimates), but, since we have
…nite periods, we do not assume that                < 1. Also, we do not bound labor supply by 1. This
can be easily accomplished by the right choice of units.
       The budget constraints for the household are:

                                                             b
                             (1 + s (v1 )) p1 c1 + m1 +        = p1 w1 l1 + p1 F1 + p1 T
                                                             R

and
                              (1 + s (v2 )) p2 c2 + m2 = p2 w2 l2 + p2 F2 + m1 + b

where b is an uncontingent nominal bond, R is the gross nominal interest rate, wt is the wage
in period t, Ft denotes pro…ts from …rms, and T denotes transfers.
       The function s ( ) parametrizes the transaction costs (in resource terms) of consuming ct
                                                                                           mt
when the real balances of money used for transactions in the period are                    pt
                                                                                                as a function of
                 pt ct
velocity vt =    mt
                       .   The transaction cost function is nonnegative, twice continuously di¤eren-
tiable, and there exists a level of velocity v > 0, to which we refer as the satiation level, such
that s(v) = s0 (v) = 0, and s0 ( )         0.

   7
    The …rst draft of our model had that precise feature. We disregarded it as an unnecessary complication
that did not add much economic insight.

…ve conditions that, together with the two budget constraints, determine the seven choices
of household. The …rst two conditions are the static optimality conditions that equate the
ratio of marginal utilities of leisure and consumption with their relative prices (wages over
the marginal cost of consumption once we consider transaction costs). The third equation
tells us that the household will hold cash until its marginal return (in terms of reduction of
transaction costs) is equal to its opportunity cost given by R. The fourth equation is the
demand for money in the second period. The …nal equation is the Euler equation for bond
holdings (where we account for the marginal change in transaction costs induced by changing
consumption).
   When the ZLB binds, the third equation implies 0 = s (v1 )0 v12 , which indicates that the
                                                                        p1 c1
opportunity cost of holding money has been reduced to zero. Since        m1
                                                                                6= 0, we must have
           0
that s (v1 ) = 0, that is, the household is satiated in its need for money in period 1 for
transaction costs. Conversely, outside the ZLB, we have s (v1 )0 > 0.

2.3. Intermediate Good Producers

Each intermediate …rm produces di¤erentiated goods out of labor with a technology yit =
At lit , where lit is the labor input rented by the …rm and At is productivity. Therefore, the

   The monopolistic …rms face nominal rigidities. Prices in period 1; p1 ; are …xed. At time

without the need to keep track of distributions (as would happen in a Calvo environment) or
to solve a (discrete) menu cost problem.

2.4. Government

The government policy is extremely simple. It issues m units of currency in the …rst period,
which it rebates back to the representative household as transfers. Then, the budget con-
straint of the government is m = T . Also, by clearing in the money market, m = m2 = m1 :

2.5. Aggregation

Standard algebra and symmetry in the …rm’s behavior gives us

                                               (1 + s (v1 )) c1 = A1 l1

and                                                                                  !

Also, using the consumption-labor optimality condition of the household, we get:

that determines p2 and c2 .
      The recursive structure of the equilibrium is derived from the fact that, beyond p1 and
m, we do not have any state variable in the model. Thus, prices and quantities in the
second period can be derived without having to know any variable determined in period 1.
In particular, they are determined independently of whether the ZLB binds or not.

      Since money enters into the utility function, there will still be a demand for money in the second period.


                                                                    10
frictions will be small enough that the expressions above will (nearly) hold. These three
equations embody several simple messages:

   1. In t = 2, the economy presents a classical dichotomy: quantities are determined by
      preferences and technology, and the price level by money supply and consumption.

   2. The price level p2 is proportional to m conditional on c2 :
                                                                                p2 c2        1
   3. Increases in A2 raise consumption and lower labor supply and velocity:     m
                                                                                        =   c2   1   .

   The intuition is simple: both consumption and leisure are normal goods and, hence, when
A2 is high, we observe more consumption and less labor supply in the second period. Velocity
is lower because prices fall less than consumption rises. With nominal rigidities, this e¤ect
becomes stronger.
   With the variables in the second period, we can go back to the …rst period and solve:

                                     (1 + s (v1 )) c1 = A1 l1
                              1    1 p1 1 + s (v1 ) + s0 (v1 ) v1
                                 =   R
                              c1   c2 p2 1 + s (v2 ) + s0 (v2 ) v2
                                     R 1
                                          = s (v1 )0 v12
                                      R

for c1 , l1 , and R. If R > 1, we are done. Otherwise, we …x R = 1 and solve:

                                     (1 + s (v1 )) c1 = A1 l1
                               1    1 p1        1 + s (v1 )
                                  =
                               c1   c2 p2 1 + s (v2 ) + s0 (v2 ) v2

for c1 and l1 or:
                                                                     1
                                    1 p2 1 + s (v2 ) + s0 (v2 ) v2

                                      p1       1 + s (v1 )
           c1
and l1 =   A1
              :
   When will we be at the ZLB? Given a p1 , equation (5) reveals that when p2 c2 is too small.
In this situation, and from the Euler equation, the only way in which the household can satisfy
intertemporal optimality is by reducing c1 , which translates, directly, into less labor. When
prices are fully ‡exible, any problem caused by a too low p2 c2 can be easily undone with
reductions in p1 . Hence, our model nicely illustrates how the ZLB is a problem because
prices today are not fully ‡exible. As mentioned above, even at the ZLB, our equilibrium has
a recursive structure and, hence, p2 and c2 are given by (2)-(4). Furthermore, we also have
the paradox of thrift at work: a higher     lowers c1 and, with it, output.

                                                11
   We can see in equation (5) the main mechanism at work: as a response to p2 c2 that is
too small and with a …xed price level p1 , we can either lower c1 or we can increase p2 or c2 :
In this paper, we argue that increases in c2 are a possibility that has often been overlooked.


4. A Parametric Speci…cation

To make further progress, we specify the transaction cost function in terms of the velocity vt :
                                     8               q
                                     < 0 if 0 < vt <   1

                           s (vt ) =
                                                       0
                                                                                          q
                                     : 0 vt + 1 1 2p                     0    1   if vt       1
                                                  vt                                          0



This function, continuous and di¤erentiable, has two parts. For velocities su¢ ciently small,
                                                                                        q it
is zero, as the demand for money has been satiated. But, when we reach a threshold (                               1
                                                                                                                   0
                                                                                                                       ),
the transaction cost grows in a convex fashion.
   The interpretation is simple. A low velocity means that there is a large quantity of money
in relation to the nominal price of consumption. Hence, the transaction cost is zero and
cannot be reduced further (we could translate the whole function by a constant                              3    if we
want to keep some positive minimum level of transaction costs). After the threshold, there
is little money in relative terms, and the household is required to use resources in executing
transactions. Convexity is a natural assumption. The functional form is the same as in
Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2011), except for the ‡at part before the satiation point.
   Now we can go back to the equilibrium equation:

                                              R       1
                                                          = s (v1 )0 v12
                                                  R
                                1
and since s0 (vt ) =   0      1 v2   and s0 (vt ) vt2 =        2
                                                            0 vt             1,   we get the demand for money:
                                t


                                             m                  c1
                                                =q
                                             p1             1
                                                                +    1 R 1
                                                            0         0 R



that shows that money holdings increase with consumption and decrease q       with the nominal
interest rate (the opportunity cost). It is also the case that if R > 1, v1 >    1
                                                                                 0
                                                                                   .
   At the ZLB, any holding of money that satis…es:

                                                  m              c
                                                                q1
                                                  p1                 1
                                                                     0



is compatible with an equilibrium because, at the margin, the household is also holding money

                                                           12
just as a store of value. We assume that the actual holdings of money are determined by
clearing in the money market:
                                                  m    c1
                                                     =q :
                                                  p1      1
                                                                0

                                                                 q
Also, at the ZLB, s (v1 ) = s (v1 )0 = 0, that is v1 =                   1
                                                                         0
                                                                             .
   We can come back to equation (5), and with some algebra, rewrite it as:
                                                                                     1
                                           1 1m                      2
                                c1 =            1           0   (v2 ) +          1       :
                                             p1

This expression tells us that anything that reduces money velocity in period 2 will increase
consumption in period 1. As mentioned above, this means that anything that increases c2
will also increase c1 .


5. Some Numerical Results

In this section we o¤er some numerical results that illustrate the forces at work in our model.
We do not see this as a calibration exercise (we are not aiming to match any moment of the
data), but just as a quantitative exercise to better understand the economic mechanism.
   We will proceed as follows. First, we will calibrate our model. Second, we will introduce
three variations of the benchmark model that we just presented. These variations will be
helpful to interpret the results of our numerical investigation. Third, we will present a case
where technology and market power are constant over time, which will tell us how the economy
behaves in the absence of policy changes. Fourth, we will implement di¤erent exercises where
we show how increases in future consumption (either through increases in productivity or
reductions in market power) increase consumption today. Finally, we will close with some
extra experiments that demonstrate the usefulness of our model to revisit some of the classical
results in the literature.
   We start, then, by setting up a simple numerical version of our model with a calibrated
utility function:
                                           l12                      l22       m2
                                    c1 1       + 1:2    c2 1            + log
                                           2                        2         p2
that is, we …x      = 1,     = 2,      = 1:2, and      = 1. The values of                    and   are standard in the
business cycle literature,      is just a normalization of the units of currency, and                       is a large
number to induce the ZLB to bind.




                                                       13
       The transaction cost function of money is:
                                      (                       p
                                          0 if 0 < vt <            0:75
                          s (vt ) =                                 p             p
                                          0:4vt +   0:3 v1t        2 0:12 if vt       0:75

where we pick the parameters to generate a small transaction cost (for instance, in the second
period of our example, with less than 0.25 percent of output, in the …rst period the ZLB
binds and hence the costs are zero). The parameter controlling the elasticity of substitution
among goods is " = 10 (again, a conventional value), and the price adjustment cost                          =1
(which implies an adjustment cost of 0.44 percent of the second period output). Finally,
we set m = 1:1 (this generates a p2 slightly bigger than 1) and p1 = 1, around 7.6 percent
higher than in a ‡exible prices equilibrium.9 With these parameter choices, we …nd a unique
equilibrium in our numerical exercises.
       To facilitate the interpretation of the results, we compare the model presented in the
previous section with three alternative versions (that we derive in the appendix) that are
nested within it when we set some parameters to zero. First, we eliminate money (m = 0),
monopolistic competition (" = 1), and all forms of rigidities (                          = 0). This is a simple
neoclassical environment with analytical solution and that helps us to think in the right
order of magnitude for each variable. This model is also Pareto e¢ cient, so it can also be
read as the social planner’s problem. We call this version model I. Second, we reintroduce
monopolistic competition (" = 10), but without money (m = 0) or rigidities ( = 0). We
still have a simple solution and, in addition, the presence of a mark-up gets us much closer to
the quantitative results of the model presented in the previous section. We call this version
model II. Third, we reintroduce money (m = 1:1) and the ZLB, but prices are still ‡exible
( = 0). We call this version model III.10 For reference, we call the model presented in the
previous section model IV.
       Our …rst step is to compute case I, where A1 = A2 = 1 and "1 = "2 = 10. The results
are in table 1, where 1 + r is the real interest rate (de…ned as the rate of return of a real
bond). The second column shows the results for model I. There we see the convenience of
our parameterization: consumption and labor are equal to 1 in both periods and the real
interest is just the inverse of the discount factor (0:833 = 1=1:2). In the absence of money,

   9
      By setting p1 “too high,”we ensure that output is below what it would be given preferences, technology,
and ‡exible prices. In the old disequilibrium models of the 1970s, there was an alternative case when p1 was
too low, often called the “repressed in‡ation case.” This case will resurface later in this section.
   10
      Models II and III also consider monopolistic competitors in period 1. If nothing is said otherwise we will
assume that the elasticiy of substitution is constant across periods. When analyzing cases where the elasticity
of substitution changes across periods, we will call "1 the elasticity of period 1 and "2 the elasticiy of period
2.

price levels and the nominal interest rate are not de…ned. In the third row, we move to model
II. Market power works as a consumption tax that decreases consumption and labor in both
periods, here by 3.5 percent. The real interest rate is unchanged.

   The fourth row is model III, where we introduce money but prices are fully ‡exible. Here,
and with our parameters, the ZLB is binding (R = 1). However, the ZLB does not matter
for allocations because prices are fully ‡exible and p1 and p2 adjust to deliver the “right”real
interest rate. Since the transaction costs are zero in the …rst period, the allocation in that
period is the same as in model II (c1 = l1 = 0:965). In the second period, the transaction
costs are not zero, and they induce a reduction in consumption (by 2.0 percent) and labor
(by 1.8 percent). While the transaction costs actually paid (0.2 percent) are rather small,
they create a wedge that lowers consumption. The price levels, 0.929 and 1.095, do the job
of adjusting the real interest rate to (nearly) the level of the case without money, 0.848. The
slight di¤erence comes from the lower consumption in period 2, which increases the marginal
utility in that period, and the transaction costs, also in period 2, that appear in the Euler
equation.
   Finally, in the …fth row, we have the complete model (model IV). Consumption in period
1 is now more than 3 percent lower than in model III. With p1 …xed, the real interest rate
can go down only to 0.914 and households want to save more. The real interest rate is too
high when compared with model III. The only way in which the savings market can clear
is by a reduction in consumption in period 1, which is achieved by a fall in demand that,
given the nominal rigidity, lowers production. Consumption and labor in the second period
are higher than in model III. The reason is that the presence of a positive price adjustment
cost   makes p2 rise a bit less than in model III, to 1.094. A lower price level induces more
consumption and labor. Labor also rises to pay for the adjustment cost. As a …nal point,

note that even if we are at the ZLB, the economy still experiences in‡ation, just not enough
to lower the real interest rate su¢ ciently.

   We move now to the case II where supply-side policies have been able to increase A2 by
5 percent, to 1:05. In model I, c2 goes up and l2 goes down with respect to case I. As shown
in the appendix, in model I, labor is a decreasing function of technology. Hence, as A2 goes
up, l2 falls. The contrary is true for c2 . However, in the …rst period, the allocation is the
same since we are not more productive at time 1. The real interest rate increases to 0.889 to
induce the household to save enough to clear the asset market. The results for model II are
quite similar. There is an increase in c2 and a reduction in l2 with respect to case I. Model III
does not change much with respect to case I. The economy is at the ZLB, but allocations are
not a¤ected when compared with model II (except for the fact that in‡ation and, therefore,
transaction costs in period 2 are now di¤erent, which changes c2 and l2 ). Prices behave,
though, di¤erently: p1 is somewhat higher and p2 is slightly lower than in case I. A higher
productivity implies a lower marginal cost and, with it, a lower optimal price of monopolistic
producers in period 2. Since in‡ation adjusts the real interest rate to (nearly) the value it
takes in model II, p1 also changes.
   Finally, model IV shows us the main mechanism in this paper: the e¤ect of increases in
future productivity on consumption in period 1. Consumption increases in the second period
to 0.982 while labor falls to 0.944 with respect to case I. Similarly, p2 is now only 1.039
when in case I it was 1.094. Next, the most important implication: higher consumption in
the second period increases consumption in period 1 by 0.6 percent. The e¤ect is not large
because of the increase in the real interest rate induced by a lower p2 . However, this just a
simple numerical example to illustrate our argument. We would need a fully-‡eshed business


                                                   16
cycle model to evaluate the quantitative size of this mechanism and how big of an increase
in productivity we would require to get a sizable impact.

       In case III (table 3), we increase A2 to 1:30 to show that, with a su¢ ciently large increase
in future productivity, we actually get out of the ZLB (although barely so, in our numerical
example). Although this may seem like a large number, again, we are just dealing with a
numerical example (and there are cases where structural reforms took place, as in Spain in
1959, where increases in productivity of 30 percent did occur).
       In table 4, we report case IV where, instead of a¤ecting productivity per se, supply-side
policies increase the level of competition in the economy and reduce the mark-ups (perhaps,
with a more forceful enforcement of antitrust law). We model such policy as changing "1 (the
parameter controlling market power) from 10 in the …rst period to "2 = 100 in the second.
This rather reduced-form approach is justi…ed because, for our argument, we do not really
need to be particularly explicit about the mechanism that generates market power.11 Since
there was no monopolistic competition to begin with, model I is una¤ected with respect to
case I. In model II, the second period allocation gets much closer to the …rst best (the one in
model I). To induce the right level of consumption in the …rst period, the interest rate goes
up to 0.888. In model III we have a similar result: consumption and labor grow in the second
period and prices move to induce the real interest rate that ensures that markets clear in the
…rst period. Finally, in model IV, since we are at the ZLB and p1 is …xed, as c2 increases,
the Euler equation implies that c1 also increases by 0.5 percent. This expansionary e¤ect of
increased competition works even if "1 also increases to 100 (we omit the corresponding table

for concision). This result is interesting because in the case of improvements in productivity,
increases in A1 may actually reduce l1 . This “paradox of productivity”does not apply, then,
to reductions in the market power of …rms.12

       We close this section with two additional experiments that revisit two classical topics and
prove the usefulness of our model. First, we divide adjustment costs by 10:                   is now only
0.1. The results in table 5 con…rm the old argument by DeLong and Summers (1986), more
recently revisited by Werning (2011), that increasing price ‡exibility (but short of reaching
full price ‡exibility) may not help. Due to higher price ‡exibility, consumption and labor
are lower in the …rst period. The concrete mechanism in our paper, though, is di¤erent:
with more price ‡exibility, prices rise too fast, not fall too fast as in DeLong and Summers.
More pointedly, with           = 0:1, p2 can respond more to demand conditions in period 2. A
slightly higher p2 lowers c2 and with it, c1 (although in our calibration the e¤ect is minimal
as we already start with a low : labor in period 1 goes from 0.93089 to 0.93079, because
of rounding this small drop does not show up in table 5). Or, in other words, more ‡exible
prices in the second period lower demand and with it output, generating less consumption
and less output in the …rst period. Welfare implications are more nuanced because bigger
price ‡exibility also implies an allocation closer to …rst best and less wasted resources in
adjustment costs. In our example, welfare goes up when               = 0:1.

  12
    As we will see in our next experiment, reductions in market power may also be a better policy tool than
reductions in price stickiness (for example, by changing commercial and labor law to allow for more frequent
contract or collective bargaining agreement renegotiations), which can often deliver negative results.

   Second, we increase m by 9 percent from 1.1 to 1.2 (see table 6). In our model, this is a
permanent increase in the monetary base of the economy. Prices in model III also increase
around 9 percent in both periods, but, since we have price ‡exibility, the allocations remain
unchanged. More interesting is the response of model IV. Now p1 is below the level it would
be under price ‡exibility (model III). Hence, even if we stay at the ZLB, c1 goes all the way
up to 0.971. This experiment demonstrates both the importance of having prices …xed in
the …rst period at too high a level for the ZLB to be really damaging and how permanent
increases in money can ease the problems involved by the bound (Auberbach and Obstfeld,
2005).

   We could perform other experiments to show classical results in the ZLB literature such
as that an increase in A1 lowers l1 or that an increase in    lowers c1 . After all our previous
explanations, though, we can skip the details.

6. Possible Objections

There are four main objections to our argument: the …rst two that we do not think are
important and the second two that we think are.
      The …rst objection is to ask why we want to embark in supply-side reforms, whose out-
comes are uncertain and perhaps exceedingly small, when we have at hand monetary and …scal
policies. The ZLB comes about because future nominal output is too low. Monetary policy
can …x that problem by increasing p2 , either through a commitment to temporarily higher
in‡ation (Krugman, 1998, Eggertsson and Woodford, 2003) or through lump-sum transfers
of cash (Auberbach and Obstfeld, 2005). Similarly, as shown by Correia et al. (2010), …scal
policy can neutralize the e¤ects of the ZLB and achieve …rst best by using taxes to replicate
the optimal path for the price level.13
      However, monetary and …scal policies may not be at hand after all. Monetary policy
can be o- ine, either because of political pressures (for instance, a central bank reluctant to
engage in expansionary monetary policy for some motive beyond our model) or institutional
arrangements (a monetary union such as the Eurozone). Fiscal policy often has few degrees
of freedom (partisan divisions within a polity, high debt-to-output ratios that cause large
country spreads, constitutional limits, etc.). Therefore, supply-side policies become a second
line of defense that we should not overlook (or, in the case where monetary and …scal policy
still work, a complementary one). Furthermore, supply-side policies may help alleviate the
negative consequences of monetary or …scal policies designed to …ght the ZLB today. For
example, they may generate higher future tax revenues that help to pay down the debt
incurred by expansionary …scal policy.
      The second objection is to ask why we emphasize the importance of increases on future
output when we are at the ZLB. Should not a government want to increase future output in all
situations regardless of whether or not we are at the ZLB? Yes, it should if these increases are
free. However, these increases are usually costly, either in pure economic terms (we need to
build a new bridge or learn a new technology, more competition may reduce incentives to R&D
in a model of endogenous growth) or politically (the reforms that yield higher productivity
decrease the rents of some groups). But when we are at the ZLB, these structural reforms have
a higher than normal rate of return. Not only do we obtain more consumption tomorrow, we
also …ght the demand problems today. Outside the ZLB, increases in future productivity are
undone, in terms of consumption today, by an increase in the interest rate that ensures market
clearing in the current period. At the ZLB, that e¤ect disappears and hence consumption
today also rises. Thus, reforms that would be too expensive either economically or politically

 13
      See also Woodford (2011) for an analytic investigation of the e¤ects of …scal policy at the ZLB.


                                                      20
in normal times can become desirable at the ZLB.
       The third objection (and the …rst important one) is that increases in current productivity
may deteriorate the economic situation. As we saw before, we have an Euler equation that
pins down c1 as a function of future variables and l1 is whatever quantity we need to produce
c1 . Thus, a higher productivity today just lowers employment without any further bene…t.
We do not …nd this objection too compelling. First, most increases in productivity today are
permanent (or least they have high persistence) and hence the contractionary e¤ect today
has to be compensated against the wealth e¤ect on c1 .14 Second, and more important, most
structural reforms, such as reorganizing labor markets, take some time before having an im-
pact. Thus, any policy action today is unlikely to have much e¤ect on current productivity.15
Finally, as we saw in our experiment 4, increases in the level of competition in the economy
do not su¤er from this problem.
       The last, and most serious, objection is whether increases in future productivity are a
feasible policy instrument. After more than two decades of endogenous growth literature, we
do not hold a magic wand to miraculously beget higher output. It may well be the case that
increases in future productivity are just not part of the feasible set of actions for a government
or that the increases that a government can induce are too small to make much of a di¤erence
(more concretely, the wealth e¤ect generated is insigni…cant). We see two counter-arguments
to this objection. First, we are not after permanent increases in the growth trend of an
economy. This is probably well beyond the reach of most governments. A wealth e¤ect works
even if we just generate a one-shot increase in the level of productivity over its original path.
That goal is much more realistic. Second, the economies of countries such Spain have so
many areas of ine¢ ciency (the labor market being the paradigmatic case) that increases in
productivity after some reforms are much more likely than in the U.S. or the United Kingdom.
Similarly, increases in the level of competition of some European economies, which have many
service sectors shielded from market forces, are quite possible.
       Summarizing:

   1. Monetary and …scal policy can be used to …ght the ZLB. Supply-side policies are just
         an additional tool that can be handy in some circumstances.

   2. The ZLB is a situation where the rate of return of policies that increase productivity

  14
     Also, in our model, even if labor goes down, welfare is increasing. In a more realistic environment, for
example with heterogeneous agents and liquidity constraints where unemployment can be painful, welfare
changes can go in either direction depending on the details of the economy.
  15
     Given that we are dealing with a simple two-period model, we are vague about the length of a period and
about whether or not productivity reforms will come online su¢ ciently fast. A more ‡eshed out quantitative
model would be required for that task.


                                                     21
     or the competition level of the economy is high.

  3. Structural reforms are unlikely to increase productivity much today and hence aggra-
     vate the ZLB in comparison with the wealth e¤ect of future increases in productivity.
     Reductions in the market power of …rms in the economy do not su¤er from this problem.

  4. Supply-side policies can be hard to implement and too small in their e¤ects, but in
     some countries there might be su¢ cient scope for them to work.


7. Conclusions

In this paper we have argued that supply-side policies can play a role in …ghting situations
where an economy is stacked at a ZLB. While we do not want to overemphasize the power of
these policies, we should not forget about them either. Our results suggest the need for more
detailed middle-size business cycle models in the style of Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans
(2005), or Smets and Wouters (2003) modi…ed to incorporate an explicit ZLB to measure
how big the potential e¤ects from these policies are and how they can complement more
traditional monetary and …scal policies.

                                                                   29
     We move now to the problem of the …rms. Note that an equivalent problem for the
intermediate good producer is:
                                      1 "             "                            2                  "
                                pi2             pi2                pi2                         pi2
                        max                               mc2                  1
                         p2t    p2              p2               2 pi1                         p2

with FOC:
                 1 "                   "                                               "                      2         "
           pi2          1       pi2         1          1 pi2             pi2                    pi2               pi2        1
(1    ")                   +"                  mc2                1                        +"             1                     =0
           p2          pi2      p2         pi2        pi1 pi1            p2                   2 pi1               p2        pi2

Then, we can apply the symmetry of all …rms (pi2 = p2 ) to get:

                                                                                           2
                                                p2 p2                   p2
                          1     " + "mc2                       1 +"                1           = 0:
                                                p1 p1                 2 p1
