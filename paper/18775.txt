                                              ABSTRACT

This article reviews the state of the international trade literature on multinational firms. This literature
addresses three main questions. First, why do some firms operate in more than one country while others
do not? Second, what determines in which countries production facilities are located? Finally, why
do firms own foreign facilities rather than simply contract with local producers or distributors? We
organize our exposition of the trade literature on multinational firms around the workhorse monopolistic
competition model with constant-elasticity-of-substitution (CES) preferences. On the theoretical side,
we review alternative ways to introduce multinational activity into this unifying framework, illustrating
some key mechanisms emphasized in the literature. On the empirical side, we discuss the key studies
and provide updated empirical results and further robustness tests using new sources of data.

1        Introduction
Over the last two decades, international trade theory has undergone a steady transformation that has
placed …rms rather than countries or industries as the central unit of analysis. This transformation has
been fueled by micro-level empirical studies that have shown international activity to be concentrated
within a handful of very large …rms that produce in multiple countries and multiple industries. In
2000, for instance, the top 1% U.S. exporters accounted for 81% of U.S. exports (Bernard et al.,
2009). The involvement of these large …rms in the world economy goes well beyond the mere act of
selling domestically produced goods to foreign consumers. According to 2009 data from the Bureau
of Economic Analysis, the sales of domestically produced goods to foreign customers accounts for
only 25 percent of the sales of large American …rms. The remaining 75 percent (nearly $5 trillion) is
accounted for by the sales of foreign a¢ liates of American multinationals (Yeaple, 2012). Furthermore,
data from the U.S. Census Bureau indicates that roughly 90 percent of U.S. exports and imports ‡ow
through multinational …rms, with close to one-half of U.S. imports transacted within the boundaries
of multinational …rms rather than across una¢ liated parties (Bernard et al., 2009).
        This article reviews the state of the international trade literature on multinational …rms. Before
we begin, a few de…nitions are in order. In his encyclopedic monograph on the subject, Richard Caves
(2007, p. 1) de…nes a multinational …rm as “an enterprise that controls and manages production
establishments – plants – located in at least two countries.” While the corporate structure of multi-
national …rms can be complicated, it is useful to de…ne two types of entities within a multinational
…rm, the parent and the a¢ liate. Parents are entities located in one country (the source country) that
control productive facilities,while a¢ liates are located in other countries (host countries). The notion
of control is a judgmental one but it is often associated with ownership. Such ownership is the result
of foreign direct investments, which can alternatively involve the acquisition of a controlling interest
in an existing foreign …rm (cross border acquisitions) or the establishment of an entirely new facility
in a foreign country (green…eld investment).
        The positive theory of the multinational …rm revolves around three main questions. First, why do
some …rms …nd it optimal to operate in more than one country while others do not? Second, what
determines in which countries production facilities are located and in which they are not? Finally,
why do …rms own foreign facilities rather than simply contract with local producers or distributors?
        The modern literature’s focus on the …rm contrasts sharply with the traditional theory that made
little distinction between foreign direct investment and international portfolio investment ‡ows. Ac-
cording to the traditional theory, multinational …rms were simply arbitrageurs that moved capital
from countries where returns were low to countries where returns were high.1 The genesis of the
modern approach was Hymer’s (1960) seminal Ph.D. thesis. Hymer pointed out that the traditional
international-…nance approach was inconsistent with several features of foreign direct investment (FDI)
data. He proposed a new, industrial-organization approach based on the notion that some …rms own
special assets that confer a strategic advantage over indigenous …rms in foreign markets. In some
cases, market imperfections preclude the use of these assets by foreign una¢ liated entities, thereby
generating the need for a direct involvement of the asset owner. In sum, Hymer envisioned a world in
    1
        This interpretation is implicit, for instance, in Mundell (1957).


                                                                 1
which real (not …nancial) factors shape the location of multinational activity and …nancial ‡ows are a
mere consequence of the …nancial structure decisions of multinational …rms.
    Hymer’s approach was later re…ned by several authors, including Kindleberger (1969), Caves
(1971), Buckley and Casson (1976), and Rugman (1981), and culminated with Dunning’s (1981)
eclectic OLI framework, where OLI is an acronym for Ownership, Location, and Internalization. Put
succinctly, the emergence of the multinational …rm is explained by an Ownership advantage stemming
from …rm-speci…c assets that allow …rms to compete in unfamiliar environments, a Location advantage
that makes it e¢ cient to exploit the …rm assets in production facilities in multiple countries, and an
Internalization advantage that makes the within-…rm exploitation of assets dominate exploitation at
arm’s-length. The mainstream interpretation of the ownership advantage relates it to a proprietary
technology or reputation that provides its owner with some market power or cost advantage over in-
digenous producers. The location advantage is often associated with the idea that the development of
these assets (tangible or intangible) entails signi…cant …xed costs, but these assets can then be used
in di¤erent locations simultaneously in a non-rival manner. This allows economies of scale to be ex-
ploited e¢ ciently within multinational …rms, especially when trade frictions inhibit such exploitation
via exporting. Another branch of the literature has related location advantages to situations in which
production is amenable to geographical fragmentation, thus allowing di¤erent parts of the production
process to be undertaken in the location where it is most cost-e¤ective to do so. Finally, the internal-
ization advantage is attributed to market failures in the transfer of technology –related to the partial
nonexcludable, nonrival, and noncodi…able nature of technology –and also to ine¢ ciencies associated
with market exchanges of highly-customized intermediate inputs.
    As insightful as the OLI literature is, it took some time for it to before it was absorbed by inter-
national trade theory because a widely accepted general-equilibrium modeling of increasing returns
to scale, product di¤erentiation, and imperfect competition did not become available until the late
1970s and early 1980s, and because contract theory was still in its infancy in the 1970s. The modeling
of product di¤erentiation and market structure originally developed by Dixit and Stiglitz (1977) and
later adopted by Krugman (1979, 1980) served the important role of providing a common language for
researchers in the …eld to communicate among themselves, and opened the door to formally modeling
multinational …rms within general-equilibrium analysis.2
    Following this tradition, we will organize our exposition of the trade literature on multinational
…rms around the classical Krugman (1980) model with constant-elasticity-of-substitution (CES) pref-
erences, and the seminal variant of the model incorporating …rm heterogeneity developed by Melitz
(2003). On the theoretical side, we will review alternative ways to introduce multinational activity into
the framework, while trying to illustrate some of the key mechanisms emphasized in the literature, even
when these were developed under di¤erent modeling assumptions. Although some important papers in
the trade literature on multinational …rms adopt alternative modeling approaches to imperfect compe-
tition (most notably, Markusen, 1984, Horstmann and Markusen, 1987a, and Markusen and Venables,
   2
     Although the heavy use of speci…c functional forms for preferences and technology was viewed with some reservation
by the old guard in the …eld, the publication of the landmark manuscript by Helpman and Krugman (1985) established
the generality of most of the insights from Krugman’s work and showed how the new features of New Trade Theory could
be embedded into Neoclassical Trade Theory.

1998) or make less restrictive assumptions on technology and preferences (e.g., Helpman, 1984), we
think that the advantage of a common framework outweighs the bene…ts of comprehensiveness and
generality.
       Given the space constraint, we will impose several limits on the scope of our review. First, we
will not review in great detail certain branches of the literature that, although being associated with
aspects of multinational activity, do not model multinational …rms explicitly. Second, we will focus
almost exclusively on positive issues related to the rationale for multinational activity and will thus not
discuss the e¤ects of multinational …rms on goods and factor markets or the policy implications of these
e¤ects. The only exception to this rule is our brief discussion of the e¤ects of vertical fragmentation on
labor markets in section 5.2. Third, our emphasis will be on qualitative analysis, though we will brie‡y
review recent advances in quantitative analysis in section 6. Fourth, although we will sometimes refer
to the internalization decision of multinational …rms as an organizational decision, we will not review
the broader literature on the international organization of production, which is concerned not only with
multinational …rm boundaries, but also with incentive provision, delegation and hierarchical structure
within and across …rms in the global economy.3 Fourth, we will restrict ourselves to discussing the
operational decisions of multinational …rms (such as those related to employment, production levels,
location, and ownership), thus omitting a treatment of the …nancial aspects of these …rms, which are
important for understanding the relationship between multinational activity and FDI ‡ows.4 For more
encyclopedic treatments of multinational …rms we refer the reader to the monographs by Caves (2007),
Markusen (2002), and Barba-Navaretti and Venables (2004), while an overview of the literature on
the international organization of production can be found in Antràs and Rossi-Hansberg (2009).5
       By limiting our focus, we will be able to take our survey beyond a simple enumeration of the
various theoretical and empirical results in the literature. On the theoretical side, we will explicitly
derive a series of analytical results within a uni…ed framework. While most of these results are not
new, some had only been illustrated numerically and in somewhat disjointed frameworks. On the
empirical side, our review will provide updated empirical results and further robustness tests using
new sources of data.
       The remainder of this chapter is organized as follows. Section 2 brie‡y describes the data available
to analyze the global operations of multinational …rms and provides a list of “stylized”facts about the
multinational …rm. Section 3 introduces the benchmark model that we will use to guide our overview
of the theoretical literature. Sections 4 and 5 focus on the integration of the multinational …rms into
our benchmark models and cover the relevant empirical literature that both informs the design of
these models and tests these models’predictions. Section 6 outlines the approaches taken by a recent
literature that explores the global structure of trade in multinational production in multi-country
models. The internalization advantage of multinationals is taken as given in sections 4 through 6, but
is explicitly modeled and empirically assessed in section 7. Section 8 o¤ers concluding remarks.

2                                   Stylized Facts
In this section, we develop six stylized facts that describe broad features of the structure of multina-
tionals’global operations. We do so using three types of data. First, we use foreign direct investment
data from the balance of payments. Foreign direct investment (FDI) occurs when a …rm from one
country obtains an operating stake (usually 10 percent) in an enterprise in another country or when a
…nancial ‡ow occurs between parties that are resident in di¤erent locations but related by ownership.
Second, we use government survey data that distinguish between national …rms and the parents and
a¢ liates of multinationals …rms. We rely particularly on census data on U.S. parents and their for-
eign a¢ liates collected by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) of the United States. Finally, we
use U.S. Related Party Trade data collected by the U.S. Bureau of Customs and Border Protection.
This source provides data on related and non-related party U.S. imports and exports at the six-digit
Harmonized System (HS) classi…cation and at the origin/destination country level.6
    We …rst document regularities in the countries that are the source of FDI and countries that are
the destination of this FDI. FDI ‡ows measure changes in the holdings of controlling interests in equity
capital between countries. By aggregating ‡ows over time by country one can obtain crude measures
of how important countries are as hosts to parent …rm operations (outward stocks) and as hosts to
a¢ liate operations (inward stocks).
    Figure 1 presents outward and inward FDI stocks for a large number of countries. In the left-
hand panel, the logarithm of FDI stocks held by the sending country and normalized by the sending
country’s GDP are plotted against the logarithm of the sending country’s GDP per capita. In the
right-hand panel the stocks of inward FDI by destination country, normalized by destination country
GDP, are plotted against the logarithm of GDP per capita by destination country. In both panels
the best linear predictor is displayed as a line with the associated coe¢ cients shown in the bottom
right-hand corner.

‡ows. The outliers in both …gures illustrate some of the de…ciencies of FDI data as a measure of real
production activity. For instance, Hong Kong, Singapore, Luxembourg and Liberia have high levels
of both inward and outward FDI stocks which re‡ect in part …rms’e¤orts to park ownership of global
assets in low-tax and weak-regulation countries.
   Figure 1 suggests that there must be substantial two-way ‡ows between countries. The extent of
these two-way ‡ows can be measured by Grubel-Lloyd indices

                                                          Sij + Sji

where Sij is the stock of foreign direct investment owned by country i …rms in country j. This index
takes on a value of 100 when Sij = Sji and a value of 0 when the stock is one-way. High values of
GLij are associated with high levels of two-way ‡ows. When computed for OECD data, GL among
developed country partners ranges from 45 to 50, indicating a high level of two-way FDI, while the
average GL between developed and developing countries tends to be only one-half as large.
   The patterns of multinational production revealed by the FDI data can be corroborated by less
comprehensive data on real activity from the United States. Most of the sales of U.S. a¢ liates are made
in developed countries while most of the a¢ liates active in the United States are owned by parents
located in developed countries. Furthermore, U.S. related party trade data reveal that most of the
trade between a¢ liates and their parents into and out of the United States occurs between developed
rather than developing countries. We summarize these empirical regularities as the following fact:

Fact One: Multinational activity is primarily concentrated in developed countries where it is mostly
two-way. Developing countries are more likely to be the destination of multinational activity than the
source.

   We now turn from patterns in aggregate multinational activity to patterns across industries. There
is substantial variation across industries in the share of real activity contributed by multinational …rms.
For instance, data from the OECD reveal that foreign a¢ liates account for approximately a quarter
of French manufacturing employment; however, the employment share is well over a third in capital
intensive and R&D intensive industries like Chemicals and Machinery, while it is less than one-eight
in labor-intensive Food and Textile industries. This pattern repeats itself across developed countries.
   The tendency of multinational activity to be concentrated in certain industries is also evident in the
share of international trade that occurs between parties related by ownership. The left panel of Figure
2, is constructed using the U.S. related-party data and measures of physical capital intensity from
the NBER Manufacturing database. It shows that the share of U.S. imports that occurs within the
boundaries of multinational …rms is highly correlated with the logarithm of the capital-labor ratio in
that industry. Imports of labor intensive products, such as apparel (NAICS 3159) or footwear (NAICS
3162), are transacted mostly at arm’s-length, while imports of heavily capital-intensive products,
such as motor vehicles (NAICS 3361) and pharmaceuticals (NAICS 3254), are traded within …rm
boundaries. The right panel of Figure 2 depicts a similar strong positive correlation between the share

       Another indication of the concentration of FDI in certain industries is the intraindustry nature
of the two-way FDI ‡ows observed with aggregate data. When computing Grubel-Lloyd indices of
intraindustry FDI into and out of the United States for four-digit U.S. NAICS industries in 2010,
one …nds indices that generally exceed one-half and are of a similar order of magnitudes than those
computed with trade data. We summarize the evidence concerning the cross industry structure of the
magnitude of FDI as the following fact:

Fact Two: The relative importance of multinationals in economic activity is higher in capital intensive
and R&D intensive goods, and a signi…cant share of two-way FDI ‡ows is intraindustry in nature.

       A key issue in international economics is the role of geography in a¤ecting the structure of in-
ternational commerce. It is well known that a gravity equation …ts international trade volumes well.
The same is true for many aspects of multinational activity. In serving foreign markets, …rms may
choose to export their products from their source country s to a destination country d. Let Xds be
the aggregate value of exports from s to d. An alternative to exporting their product is to establish a
foreign a¢ liate in country d to serve the local market. Let ASds be the sales of the a¢ liates located in
country d that are owned by parents in country s. The left-hand panel of Figure 3 plots the logarithm
of ASds normalized by source and destination GDP against the logarithm of the distance between s
and d while the right-hand panel plots the logarithm of ASds =Xsd between the two countries against
the logarithm of distance.8
       The left-hand panel shows that a one percent increase in distance is associated with 0.57 fall in
a¢ liate sales. The right-hand panel shows that as distance increases a¢ liate sales are falling less
rapidly than trade volumes, so while gravity holds for a¢ liate sales, its e¤ect on trade volumes is
stronger.

     R&D intensity is the ratio of R&D expenditures to sales, constructed by Nunn and Tre‡er (2008) using Orbis data.
We limit the sample in the right panel to industries for which the ratio of R&D expenditures to sales exceeds one, but
the positive and statistically signi…cant correlation with intra…rm trade is robust to their inclusion.

    The stronger e¤ect of distance on trade relative to foreign a¢ liate activity also appears within
…rms. Parent …rms often produce components that are then shipped to foreign a¢ liates for further
processing. According to BEA data, in 2009 the aggregate value added of U.S. manufacturing a¢ liates
was $474.5 billion while the imports of intermediate inputs by these a¢ liates from their parents totaled
$104 billion.9 Figure 4 shows that the logarithm of the ratio of the value of imported intermediates
to the sum of local value-added plus imported intermediates is declining in the distance between the
a¢ liate and the U.S. parent. This suggests that vertical specialization is harder at long distances, but
it is interesting to note that the very open Asian economies of Hong Kong, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, and Taiwan import large amounts of intermediate inputs despite their distance from the
United States.

    The e¤ect of distance on the structure of international trade and foreign a¢ liate activity is sum-
marized as the following fact:
   9
     According to data highlighted by Ramondo, Rappoport and Ruhl (2012) at the a¢ liate level much of these imports
are highly concentrated in a small number of highly integrated …rms.


                                                                                                                                                                                    7
Fact Three: The production of the foreign a¢ liates of multinationals falls o¤ in distance, but at a
slower rate than either aggregate exports or parent exports of inputs to their a¢ liates.

   We now compare the performance of multinationals to that of …rms that do not own foreign
operations. As noted in the introduction there are two distinct entities within multinational …rms, the
parents and the a¢ liates. The BEA and the U.S. Census collect a large amount of information about
the structure of the operations of U.S. based …rms. From the data it is possible to compare the activities
of U.S. based parents with other …rms that are active in the United States. In manufacturing sectors,
U.S. parents account for less than one-half of one percent of enterprises but account for over 62 percent
of value-added and 58 percent of employment (Barefoot and Mataloni, 2011). These numbers imply
that labor productivity is higher in multinational parents relative to non-multinationals. In addition,
these parents account for almost three-quarters of private R&D conducted in U.S. manufacturing.
This latter observation is in part accounted for by the fact that many parent …rms are concentrated
in R&D intensive industries. Mayer and Ottaviano (2007) provide similar evidence on the superior
performance of parent …rms in Germany, France, Belgium and Norway.
   We now make a similar comparison of the activities of foreign a¢ liates with other …rms in their
host country. Table 1 shows the share of economic activity (rows) of foreign a¢ liates in their host
country (columns) in manufacturing industries for a number of OECD countries. The …rst row shows
that the share of foreign a¢ liates in the total number of manufacturing enterprises is typically very
small. The share of a¢ liates in manufacturing employment and output, shown in the next two rows,
is larger by an order of magnitude. The next two rows indicate a similar phenomenon for R&D
expenditure and gross …xed capital formation. The last line shows that the share of foreign a¢ liates
in total manufacturing exports is even larger than their share in total sales and employment.

               Source: OECD (2007).

   These observations lead to the following fact:

Fact Four: Both the parents and the a¢ liates of multinational …rms tend to be larger, more produc-
tive, more R&D intensive and more export oriented than non-multinational …rms.

   The large volumes of international trade between parents and a¢ liates is consistent with vertical
specialization across parents and their a¢ liates. To explore the nature of this specialization we compare
the share of U.S. parent …rms in the total activity of U.S. multinationals’global operations. In 2009,
BEA data reveal that U.S. parents accounted for 65 percent of total sales, 68 percent of value-added

                                                      8
and employment, and 84 percent of research and development expenditures. One decade earlier, U.S.
parents accounted for 74 percent of total sales, 78 percent of value-added, and 87 percent of R&D
expenditures. The high and persistent concentration of R&D services in the parent …rm suggests that
parents are in the business of creating “ownership advantages.”
   If parents disproportionately provide R&D services to the multinational …rm, what is the role
played by the a¢ liates? This question can be answered in part by observing the destination of a¢ liate
sales. The BEA collects data on how much the foreign a¢ liates of U.S. parents sell in their host
country, how much they export to other foreign countries, and how much they export to the United
States. The percentage breakdown of sales by these three categories aggregated across countries by
major industry group for 2009 are shown in Table 2. The …rst row shows that 55 percent of the value
of the output of U.S. a¢ liates stayed in the country of the a¢ liate, 34 percent was sold to foreign
customers outside the U.S., and 11 percent was exported back to the United States. Hence, the
primary purpose of multinational a¢ liates is to serve foreign markets rather than to provide inputs
or …nal goods to the source country. However, in industries such as Textiles and Apparel, Machinery,
Electronic and Transport Equipment, and especially computers, a¢ liates are more export oriented.

   We summarize this information in the next fact:

Fact Five: Within multinational enterprises, parents are relatively specialized in R&D while a¢ liates
are primarily engaged in selling goods in foreign markets, particularly in their host market.

   One last empirical regularity involves the manner in which multinationals obtain foreign production
facilities. A …rm can obtain production facilities abroad by either opening a new plant (green…eld
investment) or by acquiring an existing plant (cross border merger and acquisition). UNCTAD data
show that across all countries in 2007 the value of recorded mergers and acquisitions stood at over 50
percent of total FDI ‡ows. Furthermore, for developed countries cross border mergers and acquisitions
accounted for 68 percent of FDI ‡ows while for developing countries the number was only 18 percent.
We summarize this information as the following fact:


                                                    9
Fact Six: Cross-Border Mergers and Acquisitions make up a large fraction of FDI and are a particu-
larly important mode of entry into developed countries.


3    Benchmark Model: An Extended Krugman (1980) Model
In this section, we describe the framework that we will build on to navigate through the literature.
The framework is a strict generalization of the two-country Krugman (1980) model. We depart from
Krugman (1980) in allowing for the existence of multiple sectors (including a homogenous-good sector)
and multiple factors of production (for concreteness, capital and labor) available in …xed supply. Factor
of production are internationally immobile but freely mobile across sectors. Our framework is closely
related to the one developed by Melitz and Redding in Chapter 1 of this Handbook.
    The world consists of two countries, H and F , that produce goods in J + 1 sectors. One sector
produces a homogenous good z, while the remaining J sectors produce a continuum of di¤erentiated
products. Preferences are identical everywhere in the world and given by:

                                                       J
                                                       X                                          J
                                                                                                  X
                         U=         z log z +                  j log Qj ,      with         z +             j   = 1,                         (1)
                                                       j=1                                        j=1


and with                                                                           !
                                          Z                                            =(    1)
                                                                    (   1)=
                             Qj =                          qj (!)             d!                  ;     > 1:
                                              !2       j


Where desirable, it is straightforward to simplify the product space by setting                                         z    = 0 (i.e., dropping
the outside good), or by focusing on the case in which there is only one di¤erentiated-good sector (i.e.,
J = 1), as in Krugman (1980). Our interest is on the behavior of …rms in a given di¤erentiated goods
industry j. Maximizing (1) subject to the budget constraint yields the following demand for variety
! in industry j and country i:
                                                   i
                                              jE
                    qji (!) = Z                                     pij (!)    = Aij pij (!)            ;       i = H; F .                   (2)
                                                       1
                                        pij   (!)             d!
                                !2    i
                                      j


    Good z can be produced in any country under a constant-returns-to-scale technology which com-
bines capital and labor in country i and which we represent by the linearly homogeneous unit cost
function ciz = ciz wi ; ri , with i = H; F . The unit cost of production can vary across countries due to
factor price di¤erences or due to technological di¤erences. This homogenous good sector is perfectly
competitive and we shall assume throughout that z can be costlessly traded across countries and serves
as the numeraire, so that

                      ciz wi ; ri         1, z i > 0, complementary slack, for i = H; F .

Whenever both countries produce good z we thus have cH  H H = cF w F ; r F = 1.
                                                     z w ;r    z
    Technology in the di¤erentiated-good sectors features increasing returns to scale. As in Krugman


                                                                        10
(1980) and Helpman and Krugman (1985), the creation and production of di¤erentiated varieties
involve a …xed cost and a constant marginal cost in terms of a linearly homogenous function of capital
and labor, which we denote by cij wi ; ri . In particular, total costs associated with producing qji units
of sector j output in country i are given by
                                                                    !
                                                              qji
                                   Cji wi ; ri ; qji =   fj +           cij wi ; ri .                  (3)
                                                              '

The parameter fj in (3) captures the extent to which technology features economies of scale, and is
assumed common across varieties. As for the marginal cost parameter ', we will consider the case in
which it is also common across …rms within an industry, as in Krugman (1980), as well as the case in
which it varies across …rms within an industry, as in Melitz (2003). In the latter case, we will denote
by G (') the cumulative probability distribution from which …rms draw their particular marginal
cost parameter. The market structure in all di¤erentiated-good sectors is monopolistic competition.
International trade in di¤erentiated goods is costly and entails an iceberg (ad valorem) trade cost such
that   j   units of sector j’s varieties need to be shipped from one country for 1 unit to reach the other
country. Furthermore, in some cases, we also consider the existence of a …xed cost of exporting equal
to fX units of the composite factor represented by the above function cij wi ; ri .
    It is straightforward to show (see Chapter 1 by Melitz and Redding in this Handbook) that this
general framework encompasses, under alternative assumptions, the ones in Krugman (1980), Melitz
(2003), Chaney (2008) and Bernard et al. (2007).


4      The Proximity-Concentration Hypothesis
In the benchmark model above, …rms were allowed to serve foreign markets only via exports. The
evidence suggests instead that …rms frequently choose to service foreign markets through local produc-
tion by a subsidiary rather than through exporting, thus becoming multinational …rms. In this section
we focus on models that feature a proximity-concentration tradeo¤ to explain why multinational …rms
often replicate the same production activities in multiple countries. In terms of the OLI framework,
foreign countries are an attractive production locations for the local market when shipping costs and
tari¤s are high. Multi-plant operation comes at the cost of failing to fully exploit increasing returns
to scale in production. Because these models feature …rms that replicate the same activity across
countries, they are often referred to a horizontal FDI models.

4.1    Homogeneous Firms
We begin with the case in which …rms within an industry are homogeneous and countries are identical
to …x ideas with respect to the industry characteristics that a¤ect …rm choice of international organiza-
tion. We then extend the analysis to allow for substantial di¤erences across countries in terms of their
endowment. We conclude this subsection with a discussion of evidence concerning the implications of
this class of models.



                                                         11
4.1.A       A Symmetric Model

In order to understand the horizontal motive for multinational activity, it is simplest to start with the
one-sector (J = 1), one-factor model in Krugman (1980), with two symmetric countries each endowed
with L units of labor.10 We drop all subscripts j and set the wage rate to 1 in both countries without
loss of generality, so that (3) reduces to

                                                                      q
                                                     C (q) = f +        .
                                                                      '

For reasons that will become apparent below, we will distinguish two activities that jointly contribute
to the …xed cost f . First, the invention or process of di¤erentiation of a variety requires a …xed cost
of fE units of labor: fE is a measure of economies of scale at the …rm level and the level of this
expenditure is una¤ected by the number and location of plants that end up producing the variety (see
Markusen, 1984, Helpman, 1984).11 This …xed cost fE may include a variety of activities such as R&D
expenditures, brand development, accounting, and …nance operations. The second component of the
…xed cost is denoted by fD and captures overhead costs necessary for the manufacturing or assembly
of the product. Unlike in the case of fE , the …xed cost fD needs to be incurred every time a plant
is set up, and thus this parameter captures economies of scale at the plant level. Quite naturally, the
distinction between fE and fD only becomes relevant in multi-plant environments, such as the one we
are about to consider.
       The main innovation relative to Krugman’s (1980) model is that we do not force …rms entering one
country to service the other country via exporting. Instead, we allow …rms to incur the plant-level …xed
costs twice and service consumers abroad via local sales, thus avoiding the iceberg-type transportation
costs      > 1. Under which conditions will …rms …nd it optimal to deviate from the “pure-exporting”
equilibrium that was the focus of Krugman (1980)? In order to answer this question, we …rst need to
construct such an equilibrium and then explore the circumstances under which our suggested deviation
is pro…table.
       Consider then the problem faced by a …rm based in country i = H; F that produces variety !
and services both markets from a plant located in i. Given the isoelastic demand schedule in (2),
an exporter from i = H; F will choose a domestic and foreign price that is a constant markup over
marginal cost, thus yielding a total pro…t ‡ow equal to

    The model in this section is a simpli…ed version of the one in Brainard (1993, 1997).

    In the literature, one often encounters more general speci…cations for the technology representing the process of
creation of intangibles. For instance, Helpman (1984) allows for a variable choice of …rm intangibles with larger levels of
intangibles reducing the marginal cost of downstream activities.

In the industry equilibrium, free entry ensures that                 H   =     F   = 0 and thus we must have:

                                                                 '                     )

from which, using (5) and (2), one can back out the number of entrants in each country.
       Having described the equilibrium, we next check whether a …rm might have an incentive to deviate
from this equilibrium and set up a plant in the foreign country. A potentially deviating …rm engaged
in FDI would obtain a pro…t ‡ow equal to

                                                1
                                      I   ='        BH + '       1

regardless of where the …rm incurred its entry cost. Given the standard continuum assumption in
monopolistic competition models, this deviator would have no impact on the demand level in either
country and hence, plugging (6) into (7), we …nd that such deviation will be unpro…table (i.e.,                 i   < 0)
                                                                                                                I

                                                    2fD              1
                                                        >                 1.                                         (8)
                                                     fE
       As long as condition (8) holds, one can thus safely ignore the possibility of multinational activity
and focus on equilibria with exporting. It is clear that this is more likely to be the case, the higher
are plant-speci…c economies of scale relative to …rm-speci…c economies of scale (fD =fE ), the lower are
transport costs , and the lower is the elasticity of substitution . The intuition behind the e¤ects of
fD and       on the trade o¤ between exporting and a¢ liate sales is rather straightforward. The e¤ects of
fE and      in (8) are more subtle, and to understand them it is important to bear in mind that from the
point of view of a …rm, the choice of exporting versus a¢ liate sales boils down to the choice between
a selling strategy associated with low …xed costs but higher marginal costs (exporting) and another
one associated with high …xed costs and low marginal cost (a¢ liate sales). Quite naturally, the latter
option might look appealing when the …rm expects a large volume of sales abroad and when pro…ts
are more sensitive to marginal costs. With that in mind, the positive e¤ect of fE on the likelihood of
a deviation simply re‡ects the fact that in industries in which the process of innovation is more costly,
the industry will end up being populated by a relatively low number of …rms, and thus each …rm will
end up with a higher residual demand level (6). Finally, in industries in which varieties are relatively
substitutable with each other, pro…ts will tend to be particularly sensitive to marginal costs, and thus
a deviation from a pure exporting equilibrium will be attractive.12
       Up to now, we have focused on describing the circumstances under which a pure exporting equilib-
rium of the type studied by Krugman (1980) is robust to the possibility of servicing o¤shore markets
via a¢ liate sales. A natural question is then: what happens when condition (8) is violated? It is
straightforward to show that when the inequality in (8) is reversed then the unique equilibrium will
be one with “pure a¢ liate activity” in the sense that no …rm will have an incentive to sell abroad via
  12
     Note that the common market size L does not enter the key condition (8) because, with CES preferences and free
entry, the residual demand level faced by …rms is independent of market size. With the the linear demand system with
horizontal product di¤erentiation developed by Ottaviano, Tabuchi and Thisse (2002), a symmetric increase in market
size would tighten condition (8), thus making an equilibrium with pure exporting less likely. Below, we will illustrate
nonneutral e¤ects of asymmetric changes in size even in the CES case.

exporting. This equilibrium features two-way FDI ‡ows between countries that is a key feature of the
data as summarized by Stylized Facts One and Two in section 2. In the knife-edge case in which the
left- and right-hand sides of (8) are equal to each other, there might be a coexistence of exporters and
multinational …rms within an industry, but their relative shares remain indeterminate.13

4.1.B       Country Asymmetries

We now consider an extension of the model above that incorporates a role for factor endowment
di¤erences to shape trade and MNE activity ‡ows across countries. We build on the work of Markusen
and Venables (2000), whose framework also falls under the umbrella of our Benchmark model in
section 3. In particular, they consider a model in which there are two sectors, a homogenous good
sector (    z   > 0) and a di¤erentiated goods one (J = 1), and goods are produced using capital and
labor, and the endowments of these factors can vary across countries. Their framework abstracts from
intraindustry heterogeneity (' is common for all …rms) and trade costs are only variable in nature
(fX = 0).14 We will come back to their two-sector, two-factor model later in the section, but we will
…rst demonstrate that some of their key results continue to apply in a simpler one-sector, one-factor
model, with the bene…t that these results can be demonstrated analytically.
       With that in mind, let us revisit the model developed in the last section, but now let countries di¤er
in their endowment of labor, with LH > LF without loss of generality. It is worth emphasizing that
one can interpret labor as a composite factor of production and that, given the absence of technology
di¤erences across countries, it is advisable to treat L as an e¢ ciency-adjusted endowment of this
factor. Thus the larger “size” of Home might re‡ect both di¤erences in population and di¤erences in
the productivity of labor, the latter stemming from technology or from the availability of other factors
that are complementary to labor. The key implication of introducing di¤erences in country size is
that, with only one sector in the economy, wages across countries will no longer be equalized, and as
shown by Krugman (1980), in the absence of MNE activity, it is necessarily the case that the wage
rate is higher in the larger country (wH > wF ).
       How do these factor price di¤erences (and, indirectly, size di¤erences) a¤ect the likelihood of equi-
libria with MNE activity? To simplify matters, we follow Markusen and Venables (2000) in assuming
that …xed costs of innovation are a function of factor prices in all countries in which production takes
place. In the case of exporters, these …xed costs are simply given by wi fE , where i = H; F is the
country where the variety is produced. For multinational …rms (i.e., …rms with plants in both coun-
                                       1
tries), these costs are given by       2   wH + wF fE . The latter assumption implies that …xed costs in
terms of labor are evenly split across locations, and thus the model does not allow one to distinguish
between the ‘home’and ‘host’country of a multinational …rm (or between the location of the parent
company and that of the a¢ liate). This is a clear limitation of the analysis but it has the bene…t of
considerably simplifying the description of the parameter space in which MNE activity will arise in
  13
     When the number of …rms in an industry is …xed (entry is restricted), the share of …rms that engage in FDI relative
to exports can be determinant for a wide range of parameter values as the price index is in‡uenced only by …rms’mode
choices and not due to a free entry condition.
  14
     Strictly speaking, Markusen and Venables (2000) allow for general homothetic preferences over the homogeneous good
and the CES aggregator of di¤erentiated varieties, but their results are all numerical in nature and their simulations rely
on a Cobb-Douglas aggregator analogous to the one we have imposed in (1).


                                                            14
equilibrium. Notice that in the absence of factor price di¤erences and setting labor as the numeraire,
the …xed costs of entry for MNEs are equal to fE , as in the symmetric model above.15
     We will next describe an equilibrium of the Krugman-type, with single-plant …rms in both countries
servicing o¤shore consumers via export sales. After straightforward manipulations analogous to those
in the previous section, pro…ts for an exporter from country i = H; F can be expressed as:

                            i            1         1                                1
                            X   ='            wi       Bi + '          1
                                                                               wi       Bj    wi (fD + fE ) ,

where B i is de…ned in (5). If both types of exporters are to break even B H and B F must be such that
 H   =   F   = 0. Solving for these equilibrium values for B H and B F , and plugging them into the pro…t
 X       X
function of a potential MNE deviator yields

                            1            1                                 1                               1
                  I   ='        wH            BH + '      1
                                                              wF                BF      wH + wF        fD + fE .
                                                                                                           2

It thus follows that, for an equilibrium with no MNE activity to exist (i.e.,                           I   < 0), it needs to be the
case that
                       wH            1         wH                      1        wH
                       wF                      wF
                                                         +                      wF                          1
                                                                                         fD + fE                +1
                                                                                                   <                 .          (9)
                                         wH
                                              +1 (       1        1)                    fD + 12 fE              1
                                         wF

     This expression is more cumbersome than the one in (8), but unambiguous comparative statics can
still be obtained. First, holding constant the relative wage wH =wF , it can be veri…ed that condition
(9) is more likely to hold whenever fD =fE is high and whenever                              is low. Hence, one can still interpret
the choice between exporting and FDI sales as re‡ecting a proximity-concentration trade-o¤ even in
the presence of country asymmetries. The main novelty relative to the analogous condition (8) in the
symmetric case is the fact that the trade-o¤ now also depends on the ratio of the Home and Foreign
wages. Simple (though tedious) di¤erentiation demonstrates that the left-hand-side attains a unique
maximum at wH =wF = 1 (see the Appendix). In words, the incentive for …rms to deviate from a pure
exporting equilibrium is highest when factor price di¤erences across countries are small. Evaluating
(9) at wH =wF = 1, we …nd that multinational …rms can only arise in equilibrium whenever

                                                              1                2fD
                                                                       1>                                                      (10)
                                                                                fE

just as in the symmetric model. The introduction of size asymmetries implies, however, that even
when this inequality holds, as we shall assume for the remainder of this section, the equilibrium may
be one with no MNE activity when factor prices are su¢ ciently dissimilar across countries.
     Why do factor price di¤erences favor an equilibrium with pure exporting? Intuitively, whereas
exporting …rms only use labor from one country, multinational …rms use labor from both countries and
thus the higher are factor price di¤erences, the higher is the cost-disadvantage faced by multinational
…rms relative to exporters from the low-wage country.
  15
     Markusen and Venables (2000) consider alternative formulations of the …xed costs of entry that allow for substitution
between Home and Foreign labor. This does not appear to a¤ect the qualitative nature of the results, but it greatly
complicates the analytical derivation of the results below.


                                                                   15
       We have thus far treated wages as given, but they are naturally pinned down in equilibrium by
labor-market clearing. In a Krugman-type equilibrium with no MNEs, the relative wage is implicitly
given by                                                                                  !
                                              1                                       1
                               H      wF           F  wH        H      F    wH
                               L                  +L = F        L +L                          .                  (11)
                                      wH              w                     wF

As is well-known, (11) implies that wH > wF whenever LH > LF . Furthermore, the relative wage
wH =wF is increasing in the relative size LH =LF of the Home country, and converges to                 (   1)=   when
LH =LF     ! 1 (this is not proven in Krugman, 1980, but we do so in the Appendix).
       An implication of this result is that even when (10) holds, the equilibrium will still necessarily only
feature exporting when the relative size LH =LF of Home becomes su¢ ciently large.16 The threshold
relative size     > 0 above which the equilibrium is of the type described in Krugman (1980) is implicitly
de…ned by (11) and condition (9) holding with equality.
       What does the equilibrium look like for relative sizes LH =LF below the threshold                   and above
1? Our previous discussion implies that such equilibria will necessarily feature a positive mass of
multinational …rms as long as (10) holds. In the Appendix, we rule out the existence of “pure MNE”
equilibria without exporters. Furthermore, numerical simulations suggest that that only two other
types of equilibria can arise for LH =LF > 1. For an interval of relative sizes right below the threshold
 , that is LH =LF 2        ;       , the equilibrium is one with MNEs, Home exporters and Foreign exporters
all coexisting. In that interval, the relative wage is implicitly given by (9) holding with equality
independently of LH =LF , with changes in the relative supply of labor of each country being absorbed
via changes in the mix of …rms. If the ratio LH =LF is even closer to 1 and below a second threshold
 , then the equilibrium is one in which multinational …rms and Home exporters coexist, but Foreign
exporters cannot pro…tably operate. Equilibria without exporters from the relatively large country
(i.e., Home) do not appear to exist although we have not been able to prove this analytically.
       We have focused on the case in which asymmetries arise because Home is larger than Foreign.
The case LH =LF < 1 can be analyzed similarly and delivers analogous results. For a su¢ ciently
small LH =LF , we have a pure exporting equilibrium, and the remaining equilibria feature some MNE
activity and some exporting from the larger country, in this case Foreign.
       We argued above that one should not interpret variation in L across countries as merely re‡ecting
di¤erences in population, as it might also re‡ect variation in the availability of factors that are comple-
mentary to labor. This brings us precisely to the contribution of Markusen and Venables (2000), who
study a two-sector model in which production uses labor and a complementary factor (capital) which,
crucially, are combined under di¤erent factor intensities in the two sectors, so that L can no longer be
treated as a composite factor. In terms of our notation in the Benchmark model, the factor cost wi in
the unique di¤erentiated sector is now denoted by ci1 = ci1 wi ; ri , while the unit cost of production in
the homogeneous good sector is given by ciz = ciz wi ; ri . It should be clear that our derivations above
regarding the likelihood of an equilibrium with pure exporting remains unaltered, with ci1 replacing
wi everywhere. Hence, it continues to be the case that the likelihood of an equilibrium with MNE
                                                            1
  16
    To be precise, when transport costs are so large that      1 > 2fD =fE , the equilibrium features MNE activity for
all LH =LF > 0 (see the Appendix). We will abstract from this uninteresting case below.



                                                         16
activity is highest when cost di¤erences are lowest.
       Unfortunately, the general equilibrium of this two-sector, two-factor model becomes analytically
intractable, so Markusen and Venables (2000) have to resort to numerical analysis from the onset.
Their simulations suggest that, in the absence of multinationals, factor price di¤erences across coun-
tries appear to be large whenever relative and absolute factor endowment di¤erences across countries
are large. This resonates with the e¤ects of absolute di¤erences in L on equilibrium wages in the
Krugman (1980) model. When introducing the possibility of MNE activity, Markusen and Venables
(2000) graphically illustrate that as long as condition (10) holds, there is a two-dimensional region
in the endowment space (which includes the point LH = LF and K H = K F ) in which only multi-
national …rms will operate in the di¤erentiated good sector.17 Further away from the midpoint of
the endowment space, they …nd that there are two-dimensional regions of the endowment space in
which the equilibrium is mixed, with both MNEs and exporting …rms being active. Their results also
suggest that equilibria with di¤erentiated-good sector exporters from a given country are more likely
the larger the size of that country, and in particular the larger that country’s endowment of the factor
used intensively in the di¤erentiated good sector. The prediction of the model that FDI is more likely
to arise between similarly endowed countries is consistent with the broad facts reported in section 2.

4.1.C        Evidence

The proximity-concentration trade-o¤ is intuitive and has a variety of implications for the cross-
country and cross-industry structure of trade and FDI, but how well does it explain the data? The
most well-known paper assessing the proximity-concentration framework is Brainard (1997) who relates
the cross country and cross industry structure of trade and multinational production to proxies for
various features of the industry’s technology and various features of a country’s endowment and policy
environment. In this section, we provide estimates of the coe¢ cients of Brainard’s econometric model
and theory-inspired extensions to that model using more up-to-date data than was available when the
original paper was written.
       The basic structure of Brainard’s econometric model relate the propensity of U.S. …rms in industry
j to serve country i by exports relative to exports plus the local sales of the a¢ liates of U.S. …rms
located in country j in the following manner:

where Xji is the exports by the United States in industry j to country i, Sji is the sales by U.S. a¢ liates
in industry j located in country i. The explanatory variables F reightij and T arif fji are the logarithm
of an ad valorem measure of shipping costs in industry j from the U.S. to country i and the logarithm
of average tari¤s facing U.S. …rms in industry j and country i. The explanatory variables P lantSCj
and CorpSCj are logarithms of measures of plant scale economies (number of production workers
  17
    One way to rationalize the fact that their model is able to feature pure FDI equilibria (and the one-sector, one-factor
model above does not) is that the presence of the homogeneous good sector provides …rms with a channel to repatriate
pro…ts across asymmetric markets.



                                                                 17
per representative plant) and corporate scale economies (the number of non-production workers per
representative …rm). Finally, Ci is a vector of country controls that include a variable GDP=P OP i ,
which is the logarithm of the absolute di¤erence in GDP per worker in the United States and in
country i. This variable controls for factor endowment di¤erences across countries.18
    The dependent variable here captures the tendency of …rms to substitute local production for
exports while controlling for industry and country characteristics that jointly explain both the level of
trade and the level of a¢ liate sales. As noted in section 2, trade and FDI ‡ows are highly correlated
both in gross and net terms so these factors that determine both the levels of trade and FDI are in
fact important.
    Brainard estimates this equation using U.S. trade data and a¢ liate sales data from the 1989
Benchmark Survey of U.S. Direct Investment Abroad conducted by the Bureau of Economic Analysis
(BEA). She …nds that          1,   2,   and   4   are negative and statistically signi…cant while         3   is positive
and statistically signi…cant. This is the best known evidence in favor of the proximity-concentration
framework. She also …nds that the coe¢ cient on GDP=P OP is positive and statistically signi…cant,
which suggests that FDI is primarily directed toward developed countries. If one treats GDP=P OP
as a proxy for wage di¤erences across countries, the positive coe¢ cient is supportive of our theoretical
result above regarding the positive e¤ect of wage di¤erences on the likelihood of an equilibrium with
pure exporting.
    How well does Brainard’s result stand the test of time? To answer this question, we estimate the
same equation for both 1989, the year of Brainard’s data, and for 2009, the most recent Benchmark
Survey that is available from the BEA. Our sample is slightly di¤erent from that considered by
Brainard. Speci…cally, we consider only manufacturing industries (excluding several primary good
industries considered by Brainard) and a broader range of countries.19 Our explanatory variables are
also constructed from high quality data that became available only after Brainard (1997) was written
(see our Appendix for more information on these data sources).
    Our baseline results are shown in columns 1 and 2 of Table 3. Column 1 corresponds to the
year 1989 while column 2 corresponds to 2009. To conserve space we have suppressed the coe¢ cient
estimates for all country controls except for GDP=P OP . Comparing the estimates in the two columns,
there are not substantial di¤erences across years. As was the case in Brainard (1997), we …nd that
higher trade costs (F reight and T arif f ) are associated with a statistically signi…cant decrease in
exports in favor of a¢ liate sales while higher plant level …xed costs (P lantSC) and lower corporate
…xed costs (CorpSC) are also associated with more exports and less a¢ liate sales. These results
support the predictions of the model described in Section 4.1.A. Conversely, the coe¢ cient estimates
on GDP=P OP are both positive but are not statistically signi…cant in either year. These results
call into question the conclusion that income per capita di¤erences (a proxy for wage di¤erences) are

     Other country controls include T RADE i , an index of policy openness to trade, F DI i , an index of policy openness
to foreign direct investment, ADJ i , a dummy variable for Canada and Mexico, English, a dummy variable for English
Speaking countries, EC i , a dummy variable for membership in the European Community, and P olStabi , an index of
political stability. See the Appendix for more details on these variables.

associated with less a¢ liate sales and more exports.20
       A strong implication of the Markusen and Venables (2000) framework – and of our one-factor
version of it –is that relative country sizes play an important role in the structure of bilateral commerce
between them. To assess this implication, we added a variable GDP , which is the logarithm of the
absolute value of GDP between the United States and country i. Running this augmented regression
on 2009 data, we obtain the coe¢ cient estimates shown in column 3. The positive and (moderately)
statistically signi…cant coe¢ cient on GDP suggests that market size does matter: U.S. …rms are more
likely to export to smaller markets and to engage in foreign direct investment in larger countries.

       To further explore the role of relative factor endowment di¤erences, we next we replace GDP=P OP
(GDP per worker di¤erences) with absolute di¤erences in years of schooling (School) and capital-labor
ratios (KL) and estimate the coe¢ cients on the 2009 data. The results, shown in column 4, reveal
  20
     When the country controls are suppressed, the coe¢ cient on GDP=P OP is statistically signi…cant in both years.
However, if we limit our sample to the countries considered in Brainard (1997) the coe¢ cient is not statistically signi…cant
in either year. Note that although our sample is broader than considered by Brainard, it does not include all countries.
It is quite possible that if the least developed countries had been included, the coe¢ cient on GDP=P OP might well have
been positive.


                                                             19
that neither variable obtains a statistically signi…cant coe¢ cient, which again suggests that there is no
role of relative factor endowments in the substitution of a¢ liate production for exports that is uniform
across all industries. We will show in section 5.4 that to identify the role of comparative advantage
requires a model speci…cation that allows the factor abundances of countries to interact with factor
intensities of industries.
   Finally, we consider the robustness of the proximity-concentration variables to country …xed e¤ects,
and country and industry …xed e¤ects. The results are shown in columns (5) and (6). As the estimates
in column (5) indicate, the proximity-concentration variables are robust to the inclusion of country
…xed e¤ects. However, when both types of …xed e¤ects are included, we obtain the estimates for
F reight and T arif f shown in column (6) that are very close to and statistically indistinguishable
from zero. The limits to the robustness of trade cost as a predictor of the export share is not new to
our exercise: Brainard (1997) obtained a similar result.

4.2    Firm Heterogeneity
As noted by Fact Four in section 2, international economic activity is highly concentrated in a handful
of very large and productive …rms. We now show that explicitly addressing …rm heterogeneity in
productivity improves the proximity-concentration model by allowing it to be consistent with micro-
level facts and by expanding our understanding of the industry characteristics that explain aggregate
variables. We do so by considering the framework in Helpman, Melitz and Yeaple (2004), focusing
exclusively on the industry characteristics that drive the proximity-concentration tradeo¤.
   Consider the simple proximity-concentration model discussed in section 4.1.A. Again countries
are symmetric (LH = LF ) so that we may normalize wH = wF = 1. For convenience, we limit our
attention to a generic industry and suppress industry subscripts for notational simplicity. The key
new assumption is that productivity ' varies across producers of di¤erentiated goods. A …rm that
is contemplating entry does not initially know its productivity ' but knows that it will be drawn
from a distribution G(') that has support on the interval ['; ') where ' > '. After paying the
industry-speci…c …xed cost fE , the …rm learns its productivity.
   Upon observing its productivity an entrant may open a plant in its home country at an additional
…xed cost of fD or it may exit. If it chooses to produce, it may also choose to sell its variety in
the other country, but doing so requires that the …rm pay a marketing …xed cost fX . To serve the
foreign market, the …rm may export from the plant in its home location and pay an industry-speci…c ad
valorem shipping cost . Alternatively, the …rm may open a foreign a¢ liate by incurring the marketing
…xed cost fX and an additional plant-level …xed cost fD .
   We now analyze the decisions of a …rm that has entered one of the countries and has drawn a
productivity of '. The pro…t earned in the home country market for an active …rm of productivity '
(net of entry cost) is
                                                           1
                                          D (')   = B'         fD :                                  (12)

If the …rm were to export its variety to the foreign market, the additional pro…t earned would be

                                                         1 1
                                        X (')   = B'             fX ;                                (13)


                                                    20
and if it were instead to open an a¢ liate in the foreign country, its additional pro…t would instead be

                                                                    1
                                            I (')       = B'                 fX     fD :                        (14)

The pro…t functions in (12)-(14) for a given industry are plotted in Figure 5. This …gure shows that
…rms sort into their modes of serving global markets. As in Melitz (2003), …rms that receive poor draws
' < 'D exit. The least productive …rms serve only their domestic market ' 2 ('D ; 'X ) while more
productive …rms also sell their product abroad (' > 'X ). Of the …rms selling their variety abroad,
the most productive do so through a foreign a¢ liate (' > 'I ).21 This sorting result stems from the
supermodularity of the pro…t function in productivity and other marginal cost reducing measures: A
highly productive …rm that sells a lot of units bene…ts more from a reduction in marginal cost than a
…rm with lower productivity that sells fewer units.22


                                                                             ߨ஽ ߮    ߨூ ߮

    Unlike the case in models with symmetric …rms considered in section 4.1, …rms in a narrowly de-
…ned industry organize their international production through di¤erent modes and each …rm strictly
prefers its organization strategy to any alternative. The prediction that …rms sort on the basis of
their productivity has been con…rmed in a number of studies. For instance, Girma et al. (2004) and
Mayer and Ottaviano (2007) use kernel regression techniques to show that distributions of produc-
tivities across …rms are consistent with this prediction with the distribution of …rm productivities of
multinationals shifted to the right of the distribution of exporters and even further to the right from
the distribution of …rms that do not sell their product abroad. Figure 6 provides an illustration of
this result using 2007 data from the Spanish Encuesta sobre Estrategias Empresariales (ESEE), which
also permits reporting the productivity advantage of both multinational …rms based in Spain as well
as of foreign-owned a¢ liates in Spain relative to domestic producers and exporters. The di¤erences
are large and statistically signi…cant.
   21
      Figure 5 has been plotted under parameter restrictions that ensure a positive mass of …rms engaged in exporting
                                                                 1
and in FDI. More speci…cally, this requires fX + fD > ij           fX > f D .
   22
      See Mrázová and Neary (2012) for a discussion of the role of supermodularity. Other preference systems can give
rise to a pro…t function in which this feature is absent leading to di¤erent sorting implications.



                                                                   21

   We now turn to the implications of the model for the aggregate trade and multinational production
data that are most widely available. To highlight the substitutability between exports and local a¢ liate
sales (as in Brainard, 1997) we consider the share of sales by industry that are sold via exports relative
to those sold through foreign a¢ liates. First, to fully characterize the equilibrium, we apply the free
entry condition, which requires that the expected pro…t from entry is equal to zero. This condition is
given by

B V ('D ) +   1
                   V ('X )     V ('I ) + V ('I )       (1 G('D ))fD (1 G('I ))fD (1 G('X ))fX fE = 0;
                                                                                                       (15)
where                                                  Z   '
                                                                   1
                                         V (^
                                            ') =               '       dG('):                          (16)
                                                       '
                                                       ^

Next, integrating over …rms’export sales yields aggregate exports of S X = B      1    V ('X )     V ('I ) .
Repeating this procedure for a¢ liate sales, we obtain aggregate a¢ liate sales of S I = BV ('I ). The
ratio of aggregate exports to aggregate a¢ liate sales is then

                                        SX         1           V ('X )
                                           =                               1 :                         (17)
                                        SI                     V ('I )

   It can be established through di¤erentiation of the cuto¤ conditions, of the free entry condition (15)
and of the function (17) that many of the standard proximity-concentration predictions are maintained
in the model with heterogeneous …rms. In particular S X =S I tends to fall as trade costs        rise (as is
also true for the …xed cost of marketing fX that is new to this section) and tends to rise as plant-level
…xed costs fD rise. Unlike the case of homogeneous …rms as considered in section 4.1.A, the change
is smooth rather than an abrupt shift to a di¤erent corner. The e¤ect of a change in corporate …xed
costs, fE , on S X =S I is more subtle. An increase in fE tends to raise the mark-up adjusted demand
level B, which in turn causes all cuto¤s to rise. As long as 'I < ' the e¤ect on S X =S I depends on
the shape of the distribution function G (see equation 16). However, as 'I is monotonically increasing
in B, for su¢ ciently small fE the cuto¤ 'I will exceed any …nite upper bound ' and so multinational
…rms will disappear. In this sense, the e¤ect of fE on the likelihood of FDI is similar to that in the
case of homogeneous …rms.


                                                           22
       To get further results, Helpman et al. (2004) assume that the upper limit of the support ' of
the distribution G is in…nite and that the distribution is Pareto: G(') = 1                   ' '     . Note that this
assumption requires the parameter restriction              >        1, otherwise the integrals aggregating a¢ liate
sales and pro…ts will not converge. The Pareto assumption has become popular in the literature
because it requires few parameters, yields clean analytic solutions, and can be partially justi…ed
because it implies (along with the CES preference system) that the size distribution of …rm sales is
also Pareto, which is a reasonable approximation to the data for the far right tail.
       The Pareto assumption means that we can solve the integrals in (17) and then substitute for the
cuto¤s to obtain the clean expression that relates S X =S I to exclusively exogenous parameters:
                                                  "                                #
                                                                               1
                                    SX       1        fD        1          1
                                       =                                           1 :                               (18)
                                    SI                fX        1   1

       The parameters , fX , and fD shape the ratio as discussed in the general case above. Interestingly,
with the Pareto assumption and the in…nite bound on productivity, the corporate …xed cost fE has
no impact on the ratio of exports and FDI sales. Intuitively, an increase in fE causes both 'X and
'I to change by the same proportion and the Pareto distribution ensures that the sales of …rms that
switch modes as a result of these changes in the cuto¤ are also in the same proportion, leaving the
ratio unchanged.
       Note that the distributional parameter , working in concert with the elasticity of substitution ,
also have an impact on the composition of commerce. A decrease in this ratio is associated with a
decrease in S X =S I . It can be shown that if we hold …xed a particular market, the Pareto parameteri-
zation (combined with the CES demand system) imply that the standard deviation of the logarithm
of sales by all active …rms in this market is equal to (                1)= . Hence, an increase in the variance of
sales across …rms within an industry should be associated with a decrease in S X =S I . To understand
this result consider Figure 7, where we plot the Pareto density function for two values of . It is clear
from the …gure that a decrease in            raises the density of the function at any ' > 'I – where …rms
…nd FDI optimal –relative to the density at any ' 2 ('X ; 'I ) –where …rms choose exporting.23
       Helpman et al. (2004) estimate a logarithm linearized version of equation (18) using U.S. data for
1994. They include as regressors country …xed e¤ects, the standard proximity-concentration variables,
and a measure of the standard deviation of the logarithm of …rm sales by industry as a measure of
dispersion.24 They con…rm the Brainard’s results concerning trade costs and plant-level …xed costs
(measured as the average number of nonproduction workers per plant) and …nd that an increase in the
dispersion is associated with a large, statistically signi…cant decrease in S X =S I . The extent of …rm
heterogeneity seems to matter for the aggregates. Their result must be quali…ed, however, because
their estimates of       1   for many industries are not consistent with the restriction              >       1.25 This
  23
     Note that the mean of the Pareto distribution G(') = 1 ' '           is = ' = (        1), while the variance is "2 =
 2
  =( (     2)). A decrease in thus not only increases the variance of the distribution but also its mean. Nevertheless,
because S X =S I in (18) is independent of the lower bound ', one can always o¤set the e¤ect of a lower on the mean
with a reduction in '; and still raise "2 . Thus, a mean-preserving spread raises FDI relative to export.
  24
     They also include measures of dispersion estimated from the size distribution of …rms with similar results.
  25
     The …nding that the slope of a linear regression of log rank on log size is less than one is common. The commonly
used Pareto approximation only holds for the tail of the distribution.

means that their results do not have a structural interpretation.26
       In the working paper version of the paper, Helpman et al. also show that the model can be
extended to allow for modestly asymmetric geographies. When trade costs between regions are higher
than within regions two tiers of multinationals arise: the most productive …rms own a¢ liates in
all countries while the less productive multinationals open a single a¢ liate that they use to serve the
entire region. This yields an additional empirical implication: an increase in …rm productivity predicts
a¢ liate entry into a larger number of countries. Yeaple (2009) and Chen and Moore (2010) have shown
this prediction to be consistent with the data (for U.S. and European multinationals, respectively).

4.3      Green…eld FDI versus Mergers and Acquisitions
We have modeled the foreign entry decision as a …xed cost of setting up a variety-speci…c plant in
a foreign location. This has the ‡avor of what is called “green…eld” entry in which a …rm builds its
foreign production capacity from scratch. According to Fact Six in section 2 however, in practice
most …rms that acquire new plants in a foreign location do so by purchasing previously existing plants
through cross-border mergers and acquisitions. This fact has resulted in a some discussion in the
literature as to whether the models that we have described above are consistent with the actual entry
modes that …rms undertake.
       In this section, we …rst sketch an extension of Helpman et al. (2004) in such a way as to incorporate
both green…eld entry and cross-border acquisitions. In this extension, green…eld and cross-border
acquisitions coexist and are in fact perfect substitutes from the perspective of the …rm (although
banning cross-border acquisitions would have consequences in the model). We then discuss the model’s
implications in light of a small but growing empirical literature. We …nd that there is evidence that
in fact …rms do not behave as if cross-border acquisitions and green…eld investment were perfect
substitutes. We close this section by describing some theory in which the two entry modes are di¤erent.
       Going back to the model of Helpman et al. (2004) discussed above, suppose that prior to receiving
its productivity draw, an entering …rm must pay both fE and fD . Thus, the …xed cost of building a
  26
    There is an error in the paper that has been the source of some confusion. On page 307 it is stated that the estimators
of dispersion are measuring         + 1 rather than =(      1).



                                                            24
plant in the home country market is now sunk. The only other important deviation from the Helpman
et al. (2004) model is that a …rm may sell its plant to any other entrant on a perfectly competitive
merger market. Firms that acquire that plant may now install their own productivity draw ' (replacing
the purchased …rm’s technology) and so avoid paying a …xed cost fD . As all purchased …rms will be
homogeneous with respect to purchasers, they will receive the acquisition price in the market of PA .
      A …rm will sell itself on the merger market if PA exceeds the pro…t that it could generate inde-
pendently while an acquirer would strictly prefer green…eld if fD < PA and cross-border acquisitions
otherwise. Hence, in equilibrium it must be that PA             fD and that all …rms with productivity '       'D
would sell themselves on the merger market while all foreign …rms with '                   'I would either engage
exclusively in cross-border acquisitions if PA < fD or be indi¤erent between green…eld investment and
cross-border acquisition if PA = fD The equilibrium we have just constructed is as characterized in
the previous section in spirit but we now have a mechanism that gives rise to cross-border acquisitions.
Note, however, that cross-border acquisitions do matter in the extension, for if they were not allowed,
then weaker …rms would have no incentive to exit.
      This extension shows that it need not be the case that cross-border acquisitions are fundamentally
di¤erent from what was modeled in the previous section.27 It also can be used by as a benchmark in
interpreting the stylized facts. Let us consider the implication of the model that …rms are indi¤erent
between the two entry modes. Nocke and Yeaple (2008) have used data from the Bureau of Economic
Analysis to show that parent …rms of U.S. multinationals that enter foreign markets appear to sort
into their mode of entry: more productive parent …rms tend to acquire new plants via green…eld entry
rather than cross-border entry. This suggests that the …rms do not perceive these modes as perfect
substitutes.
      Now consider the implication of the extended model that the …rms acquired by foreign …rms are
the least productive in their industries. A number of studies suggest the exact opposite. For instance,
Arnold and Javorcik (2009), Guadalupe et al. (2012), and Blonigen et al. (2012) are examples of
recent papers that suggest that it is the most productive …rms within an industry that tend to be
the targets of foreign acquisitions. This again suggests that cross-border acquisitions and green…eld
investment are not perfect substitutes.
      A number of recent papers develop equilibrium models in which there is sorting of …rms into their
mode of entry into foreign markets. For instance, Nocke and Yeaple (2007, 2008) develop equilibrium
models in which …rms are heterogenous in multiple dimensions that interact in a complementary way
to generate pro…ts. The …rm heterogeneity is embodied in intangible assets that can be transferred
across …rms only through ownership and some of these assets are imperfectly mobile across countries
(such as relationships with customers and local suppliers, etc.). Equilibrium in a merger market
involves improving the assignment of intangible assets to …rms to exploit complementarities. Green…eld
investment occurs when a …rm’s relatively immobile asset is so useful that it pays to move it despite
high relocation costs. Similar mechanisms appear in models provided by Guadalupe et al. (2012), in
which foreign …rms possess innovative abilities and access to foreign markets that domestic …rms lack
and these abilities are best applied to local …rms that are already highly productive.
 27
      Note that …rm heterogeneity is important to generate …rms that want to sell and …rms that want to buy.



                                                          25
    Before leaving the topic of entry mode, it is important to mention that an alternative explanation
for cross-border acquisitions is that …rms acquire one another in order to reduce competition. The
literature exploring this phenomenon develops oligopolist environments and explores the types of
acquisitions that might arise whether between or within countries. Examples of such papers are Horn
and Persson (2001), Qiu and Zhou (2006), and Neary (2007). An important implication of some of
these models is that a reduction in trade costs can spur waves of cross-border acquisitions. Breinlich
(2008) provides some supportive evidence for this prediction.


5     Vertical Expansion
Some of the empirical shortcomings of horizontal FDI models are due to the fact that FDI is often
motivated by factors other than the mere replication of the production processes in di¤erent countries
to save on transportation costs or jump over tari¤s. In reality, multinational activity might also be
motivated by cost di¤erences across countries, which induce some producers to locate di¤erent parts
of the production process in di¤erent countries. Indeed, Fact One, that net FDI ‡ows from developed
to developing countries, and Fact Five that R&D expenditures within the multinational …rm are
concentrated in the parent …rm, suggest a need to address international specialization. Further, in
all industries there are exports from a¢ liates to their parent …rms that are not easily explained in a
purely horizontal setting, and in particular industries the volume of these exports is very large (see
Table 2).
    In the section, we discuss some works that formalize and empirically test these insights, starting
with the simplest case of the so-called pure vertical FDI model of Helpman (1984).

5.1   A Factor Proportions Model of Vertical FDI
Let us now return to the Benchmark Model in section 3. In order to shut down the horizontal incentive
for multinational activity, let us suppose for now that there are no transport costs so exporting is the
dominant strategy in the models in section 4. For simplicity, consider a two-sector (     z   > 0, J = 1),
two-factor model, in which production uses capital and labor, and capital intensity is higher in the
di¤erentiated good sector than in the traditional good sector. For the time being, assume also that
the distribution of …rm productivity is degenerate within sectors and that the cost functions in each
sector are identical in both countries, so there are no Ricardian di¤erences in technology. We will relax
the latter two assumptions later in this section. So far, the model is essentially a 2   2    2 Helpman-
Krugman (1985) model of international trade, with slightly stronger assumptions on preferences and
technology.
    The key new feature is that we will now make an explicit distinction between di¤erent production
stages in the di¤erentiated good sector and that we will allow for a geographic separation of these
stages. More speci…cally, the total cost function in the di¤erentiated good sector now follows from the
aggregation of the total cost of two distinct production processes: headquarter services provision and
manufacturing.
    Headquarter services provision entails activities that are typically provided by the production unit


                                                   26
from which the ownership advantage originated, i.e., the headquarters. It is useful to think of these
as being closely related to our interpretation of the …xed cost of entry in horizontal FDI models,
and thus entail R&D expenditures, brand or specialized machine development, …nancing, etc. This
is consistent with our Fact Five in section 2. These activities have important …xed cost components,
but we will also allow their level to a¤ect continuously the marginal product of manufacturing, as in
Helpman (1984). In analogy to horizontal FDI models, headquarter services are assumed specialized
and are valuable only to the …rm incurring them, but within the …rm, they are nonrival and can
serve many manufacturing plants simultaneously, regardless of where these manufacturing plants are
located. Headquarter services are produced with capital and labor according to the total cost function
CH wi ; ri ; hi , where hi is the number of units of services produced and CH ( ) is associated with a
increasing returns to scale production function.
       The manufacturing stage uses capital and labor to convert the available headquarter services into
…nal goods according to an increasing returns to scale technology in which h is essential and which is
represented by a cost function CM wi ; ri ; h; q i , where q i is the amount of output produced and h is
the aggregate amount of …rm-level headquarter services available for production. CM ( ) is naturally
decreasing in h and increasing in the other arguments. Following Helpman (1984), we assume that
the production of headquarter services is more capital intensive than manufacturing.
       Because trade is costless and there are increasing returns associated with each stage, …rms will
not produce headquarter services or carry out manufacturing in more than one location. When both
stages occur in the same country i, the total cost of production will be given by

                         C1 wi ; ri ; q i = min CM wi ; ri ; hi ; q i + CH wi ; ri ; hi        .                     (19)
                                              hi

The Benchmark model in section 3 is a particular case of this more general multi-stage model in
which we forced …rms to locate all production processes in the same country.28 The key question
that Helpman (1984) posed was then: under which conditions will …rms want to deviate from this
‘Krugman-style’equilibrium and locate headquarter services and manufacturing in di¤erent countries,
thus becoming multinational …rms? An advantage of having related our current model to the Bench-
mark model in section 3, which in turn is a variant of the canonical 2 2 2 model studied by Helpman
and Krugman (1985), is that we can readily appeal to their results to conclude that multinational ac-
tivity will be a (weakly) dominated strategy as long as relative factor endowment di¤erences across
countries are small. The reason is simple: for su¢ ciently similar relative factor endowments, factor
price equalization (FPE) will attain even in the absence of fragmentation and thus …rms based in one
country will have no incentive to open subsidiaries (production plants) in the other country.
  28
    Strictly speaking, in our Benchmark model, we had speci…ed a homothetic total cost function (see eq. (3)) involving
a …xed cost and a constant marginal cost in terms of a linearly homogeneous function of capital and labor, denoted
by c1 wi ; ri . Given our assumptions, nothing ensures that the solution to (19) will indeed give rise to a homothetic
cost function of the form in (3). A simple way to make these two formulations consistent with each other (while
having headquarter services be more capital intensive than manufacturing) is to assume that: (i) the …xed costs of
headquarter services provision and manufacturing are both linear in c1 wi ; ri ; (ii) the marginal cost of headquarter
services is a constant amount of capital; (iii) the marginal cost of manufacturing is a constant amount of labor; and (iv)
output is a linearly homogeneous function of the level of headquarter services and manufacturing, i.e., q i = q hi ; mi ,
where q hi ; mi is the primal production function associated with the cost function c1 wi ; ri . Naturally, it would be
straightforward to relax these conditions to accommodate non-extreme factor intensity in marginal costs.


                                                           27
   Outside the traditional FPE set, …rms with headquarters in the relatively capital-abundant country
would have an incentive to ‘deviate’from the equilibrium and o¤shore manufacturing to the relatively
labor abundant country simply because wages are lower there in the absence of multinational activ-
ity. Helpman (1984) further demonstrated that, outside the traditional FPE set, there exists a set
of ‘not-too-extreme’ relative factor endowment di¤erences for which a unique minimum measure of
multinational …rms is su¢ cient to bring about factor price equalization, thus eliminating the incentive
for more …rms to fragment production across borders. Importantly, within this set, Helpman (1984)
showed that for a constant relative size of the two countries, the minimum measure of multinational
…rms consistent with equilibrium would be increasing in relative factor endowment di¤erences. Al-
though the model above does not feature intra…rm trade in physical goods, it does feature invisible
exports of headquarter services from each headquarter to its subsidiary. Assuming that these services
are valued at average cost, Helpman (1984) showed that, for a given relative size of countries, the share
of intra…rm trade in the total volume of trade is increasing in relative factor endowment di¤erences.

5.2   Vertical FDI and Wage Inequality
A variant of the Helpman (1984) model in which the two factors of production are interpreted as
skilled and unskilled labor sheds light on the e¤ect of vertical FDI (and o¤shoring, more broadly)
on wage inequality in each country. Notice that in the model above, whenever fragmentation brings
about factor price equalization, it does so by increasing the relative demand for and remuneration of
the relatively abundant factor in each country, thereby increasing wage inequality in the relatively
skilled-labor abundant country, while reducing it in the relatively unskilled-labor abundant country.
This is essentially the Stolper-Samuelson theorem at work but with the movement in factor prices
being shaped by changes in relative input costs rather than in relative …nal-good prices.
   In recent years, there has been an active literature in international trade studying the robustness
of this result to alternative and much richer general equilibrium environments with o¤shoring. As
might have been expected from the well-known limited generality of the Stolper-Samuelson theorem,
the e¤ect of fragmentation on relative factor prices and thus wage inequality has been shown to be
sensitive to modelling assumptions. A large number of models have been proposed, but we will focus
below on outlining two of the most popular one developed in recent years, the ones in Feenstra and
Hanson (1996) and Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg (2008). While both of these models were originally
cast in neoclassical environments with homogeneous goods, perfect competition, and constant returns
to scale, it is straightforward to embed them in our Benchmark Model in section 3.
   The main result in Feenstra and Hanson (1996) can be illustrated by considering a variant of our
benchmark factor-proportions model of vertical FDI in which, instead of there being two production
stages in the di¤erentiated-good sector, there are now a continuum of stages x indexed by s 2 [0; 1],
and the marginal cost for each activity or input is given by

                                  cx wi ; ri ; s = aK (s) ri + aL (s) wi ;

where we now use the notation K and r to denote skilled workers (i.e., human capital) and their wages,
while L and w are now associated with unskilled workers. This continuum of stages is arranged in

                                                    28
increasing order of their skill intensity, so that aK (s) =aL (s) is increasing in s, and they are combined
into …nal output according to a Cobb-Douglas technology
                                                Z     1
                                     q1 = exp              (s) ln x (s) ds ,
                                                  0

where x (s) is the value of services at stage s. As in our Benchmark model, and di¤erently than in the
framework in Feenstra and Hanson (1996), we assume that there also exist …xed costs of production at
each stage, but we assume that all these are in terms of …nal-good output, so that the total cost function
in the di¤erentiated good, C1 ri ; wi ; q1i , remains homothetic. This is isomorphic to assuming that
activities or inputs are produced according to a constant-returns-to-scale technology but that there
exists a …xed cost (in terms of output) associated with the assembly of intermediate inputs. We …nally
assume, for simplicity, that the homogeneous …nal-good sector uses only unskilled labor.
   Despite the fact that one of the sectors features product di¤erentiation, increasing returns to scale
and monopolistic competition, the general equilibrium of the model is very similar to that in the
continuum version of the Heckscher-Ohlin model in Dornbusch et al. (1980). First, and as in Helpman
(1984), if relative factor endowment di¤erences between countries are su¢ ciently small, the equilibrium
features factor price equalization and there is no incentive to fragment production across countries. For
slightly higher relative factor endowment di¤erences, fragmentation will occur in equilibrium and will
bring about factor price equalization, but unlike in Helpman (1984), the actual pattern of o¤shoring
is indeterminate given the large dimensionality of the commodity space. The most interesting results
emerge when relative factor endowment di¤erences are large enough to ensure that factor prices are
not equalized even when fragmentation is costless. As in Dornbusch et al. (1980) or Feenstra and
Hanson (1996), in such a case, there exists a marginal stage s such that the relatively skill abundant
country (call it Home) specializes in the production of stages s > s , while the unskilled-labor abundant
country (call it Foreign), specializes in the stages s         s and the production of the homogeneous good
z. This pattern of production is supported by an unskilled-labor wage which is strictly higher at Home
(wH > wF ) and a skilled-labor wage which is strictly higher in Foreign (rH < rF ).
   As in Helpman (1984), relative to a world in which fragmentation is not feasible, the factor price
equalization set is larger and equilibrium factor price di¤erences are smaller with fragmentation. Nev-
ertheless, within a free trade equilibrium, it is easy to construct comparative static exercises such that
increases in o¤shoring are associated with increased wage inequality in both countries. For instance,
consider a situation in which relative factor endowment di¤erences are so large that FPE does not
attain even with frictionless fragmentation. Consider then a proportional increase in the supply of
both factors in Foreign. This will naturally increase the range of tasks produced in (or o¤shored to)
Foreign, and these marginal tasks will feature a higher skill intensity than the tasks previously pro-
duced in Foreign. As a result, the relative demand for skilled workers will increase and, in equilibrium,
so will the Foreign wage premium (see the Appendix for details). Similarly, the relative demand for
skills and the wage premium will also increase at Home because these o¤shored marginal tasks feature
a lower skill intensity than the activities that remain at Home. It should be emphasized, however, that
relative to a world in which fragmentation is not feasible at all, wage inequality in Foreign is always
lower with some o¤shoring, just as in Helpman (1984).

                                                          29
      The above example illustrates that the prediction linking increases in o¤shoring to reduced wage
inequality in less developed countries is not a robust one (see also Tre‡er and Zhu, 2005, Antràs et
al., 2006). We next brie‡y outline a variant of the framework in Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg (2008)
which demonstrates that increases in o¤shoring might not necessarily be associated with increased
wage inequality in skill-abundant countries. To do so, let us …rst return to our Benchmark vertical
FDI model with only two inputs, headquarter services and manufacturing, and consider situations
in which free trade in these inputs (or what we call above, fragmentation) brings about factor price
equalization in that model. To be more speci…c, we consider a situation in which the unskilled-labor
abundant Foreign is “large” and produces the homogeneous good as well as both inputs or stages in
the di¤erentiated good sector, while the skill-abundant Home produces only the two inputs in the
di¤erentiated-good sector. Di¤erently than in our benchmark model, we shall assume, however, that
the technologies available to …rms in both countries are now di¤erent and in particular they feature
higher productivity at Home than in Foreign. More speci…cally, productivity levels are              < 1 times
lower in Foreign than at Home in all sectors and because we are focusing on a situation with conditional
factor price equalization, factor prices will also be        times lower in Foreign than at Home.
      Suppose now that each of the two inputs is produced by combining a continuum of measure one of
“tasks”involving unskilled labor L and a continuum of measure one of tasks involving skilled workers
K. The two inputs continue to vary in terms of the intensity with which these continuum of tasks
generate value, with headquarters being more skill-intensive than manufacturing. The key innovation
relative to our previous model is that we will now allow unskilled labor tasks to be o¤shorable, by which
we mean that …rms at Home can carry them out using Foreign workers while still using the superior
Home production technologies. O¤shoring is however costly and tasks are ordered according to their
degree of o¤shorability. Producing task s in Foreign in‡ates unit labor requirements by a multiple
 t (s)     1, where t0 (s)    0. For simplicity, we assume that skilled-labor tasks are prohibitively costly
to   o¤shore.29
      Given these assumptions, there exist a threshold task s such that all unskilled-labor tasks with
index s < s are o¤shored to Foreign, while all those with s > s remain at Home, with the threshold
being implicitly de…ned by
                                                wH = t (s ) wF .

The marginal costs of producing headquarter services and of producing …nal goods are then

                                cH wH ; wF ; rH       = wH aLH (s ) + rH aKH                             (20)
                                cM wH ; wF ; rH       = wH aLM            (s ) + rH aKM                  (21)

where                                                        Z   s
                                                                     t (s) di
                                                             0

Equations (20) and (21) make it clear that o¤shoring in this framework is isomorphic to unskilled-labor
biased technological change. Because Foreign is large and produces both inputs, the marginal costs of

each input are pinned down by their Foreign levels.30 As a result, an increase in the o¤shorability of
tasks, captured by a fall in , will necessarily increase the unskilled labor wage wH commensurately
with the fall in    (s ), while leaving the skilled labor wage rH una¤ected. In sum, the o¤shorability of
certain types of tasks leads to a relative increase in the reward of the factor that is used intensively in
precisely those tasks. The ‡ip side of this surprising result is another counterintuitive result: increased
o¤shorability leads to an expansion in the share of Home employment devoted to the unskilled-intensive
manufacturing at the expense of employment in headquarter services.

5.3      Vertical FDI and Firm Heterogeneity
So far, we have developed vertical FDI models in which …rms are homogeneous in productivity. As
in the case of horizontal FDI, however, the evidence suggests that aggregate vertical MNE activity is
accounted for, to a large extent, by a few very large and productive …rms. For instance, Ramondo et
al. (2012) report that despite the quantitative signi…cance of the intra…rm component of U.S. trade,
the median a¢ liate reports no shipments to its U.S. parent. This fact motivates us to introduce
…rm heterogeneity into the vertical model developed so far. In order to keep the analysis tractable,
however, we will develop a one-factor (labor) variant of the Helpman (1984) model in which cross-
country di¤erences in factor prices arise due to Ricardian technological di¤erences rather than due to
di¤erences in relative factor endowments.31
       More speci…cally, assume that the cost function in the homogeneous good sector is ciz wi ; ri =
aiz wi with aH    F
             z < az . Assuming further that           z   is large enough to ensure that both Home and Foreign
produce the numeraire good z (i.e.,       zH ; zF   > 0), we necessarily have wH = 1=aH      F    F
                                                                                      z > 1=az = w , and
producers of di¤erentiated goods face a perfectly elastic supply of labor at those wage rates. In the
di¤erentiated good sector, headquarter services provision …rst requires an initial …xed cost of entry or
innovation, after which producers learn their productivity ' which is drawn from G ('). Firms then
decide to exit or stay in the market and produce. In the latter case, headquarters need to incur an
additional …xed cost associated after which they can choose a variable amount of headquarter services
h to combine with manufacturing in production. Home is assumed to be much more productive than
Foreign in innovation/entry and in the production of headquarter services, so these are always produced
at Home. Denote by fE the initial …xed cost of entry and by fD the …xed cost of headquarter services
provision, and assume that units of h can be produced one-to-one with labor. Our assumptions on
technology imply that in equilibrium all these costs are de…ned in terms of Home labor. Manufacturing
entails no overhead costs and units of m can be produced one-to-one with labor in both countries.
Foreign thus has comparative advantage in manufacturing. Final-good production combines h and m
according to the technology
                                                                             1

where 1 <      < 1 is a sectoral level of headquarter intensity, while ' measures …rm-level productivity.
       The lower wage in Foreign makes o¤shore manufacturing appealing from the point of view of the

di¢ cult to work with (see Bernard et al., 2007).

fragmentation of production. In particular, an additional …xed cost fI                                   fD > 0 is required from
the headquarters at Home when h and m are geographically separated, and such fragmentation also
entails an iceberg transportation cost            > 1 associated with shipping the manufactured input m back
to the Home country ( could also re‡ect communication or coordination costs). Trade in …nal goods
remains free.
       Given the assumptions above, it is straightforward to solve for the operating pro…ts (net of entry
costs) associated with domestic sourcing (or no fragmentation)

       As is clear from the …gure, the model predicts selection into vertical FDI, in that only the most
productive …rms within an industry will …nd it pro…table to engage in vertical FDI. This sorting
pattern is consistent with the evidence on selection into importing in Bernard et al. (2009) who show
that not only U.S. exporting …rms but also U.S. importing …rms appear to be more productive than
purely domestic producers. Figure 9 provides further con…rmation of this sorting pattern with 2007
data from the Spanish Encuesta sobre Estrategias Empresariales (ESEE). The dataset distinguishes
between …rms that purchase inputs only from other Spanish producers and …rms that purchase inputs
from abroad. As is clear from the picture, the distribution of productivity of …rms that engage in
foreign sourcing is a shift to the right of that of …rms that only source locally.32
  32
    Of course, foreign sourcing need not involve vertical FDI, as inputs can be purchased abroad from independent
subcontractors. A key feature of the Spanish ESEE data is that it allows one to distinguish between foreign outsourcing
and vertical FDI. As we will show later in Figure 11, the productivity advantage of …rms engaged in vertical FDI is even
larger than the one observed in Figure 9.

5.4   Vertical FDI: Empirical Evidence
The motives for vertical FDI are intuitive and there are thousands of examples of assembly and parts-
producing a¢ liates in developing countries that …t the description. It is less clear how important
vertical FDI is in the aggregates. Consider the facts discussed in section 2. First, according to Fact
One, most of FDI ‡ows not to developing countries but to other developed countries. Second, only a
relatively small fraction of a¢ liate output is exported back to the host country (see Fact Five). Third,
as pointed out by Ramondo et al. (2012) very few foreign a¢ liates are engaged in international trade,
selling all of their output in their host country.
   A few more facts are worth mentioning before we turn to the econometric evidence. First, exports
by U.S. owned a¢ liates back to the United States are concentrated in a few countries. The top …ve
a¢ liate export locations to the United States accounted for 60 percent of total U.S. a¢ liate exports to
the U.S. while the corresponding number for a¢ liate sales in their host country is only 43 percent. This
fact is perhaps unsurprising given that the point of vertical FDI is to concentrate production in low cost
locations while horizontal FDI is about serial repetition of the same process across countries. Second,
the list of countries that are highly engaged in hosting a¢ liates that export back to the United States
features high variation in the level of their development. The top …ve countries in order of the size
of U.S. a¢ liate exports back to the United States are Canada, Mexico, Ireland, the United Kingdom,
and Singapore. This suggests that the treatment of comparative advantage in a two-country, two-
factor model may be too simple to be consistent with the richness of the data. Evidently, some U.S.
multinationals …nd Canada, a developed country, to be a relatively low cost production location for
some production activities while Mexico is relatively low cost for others. The concept of comparative
advantage, of course, is that being a low cost location in some activities means being a high cost
location in others. Given this observation, it is perhaps not surprising that a regression of a measure
of the extent of FDI on country endowments, as was done in section 4.1.C, yields a coe¢ cient that is
not statistically di¤erent from zero as the speci…cation did not allow for the e¤ect of endowments to
vary across production activities.
   Yeaple (2003a) allows for a more ‡exible treatment of comparative advantage in an e¤ort to better
capture vertical FDI in the data. He starts by noting that most of the evidence against the vertical
FDI comes from econometric studies that use data aggregated across industries to the country level.


                                                     33
According to his interpretation, the Helpman (1984) model does not predict that FDI will be increasing
in relative factor endowment di¤erences. Instead, it predicts that in industries that are intensive in a
particular factor, FDI should be ‡owing to countries that are abundant in that particular factor. In
terms of our previous Brainard-style speci…cations, in which the relative prevalence of FDI is inversely
related to the ratio of exports to exports plus the local sales of the a¢ liates of U.S. …rms, Yeaple
(2003a) argues that the econometric model should be speci…ed as

where Xji is again export sales from the U.S. in industry j to country i and Sji are the corresponding
a¢ liate sales. The key changes to the econometric speci…cation relative to that in section 4.1.C is the
addition of variables SkillIntj , which is the skill intensity of industry j, and SkillEndi SkillIntensj ,
which is the interaction between skill intensity of an industry and SkillEndi , a measure of the skill
abundance of country i. The relevant coe¢ cient for assessing the vertical motive of FDI is then                                 6
rather than   4,   and the predicted sign is negative: skill intensive activities should be done in skill
abundant countries and unskilled-labor intensive industries in unskilled-labor abundant countries.
   We follow Yeaple (2003a) and estimate (24) using the most recently available data on U.S. exports
and a¢ liate sales for the year 2009. We include all of the same control variables as in Table 3
(coe¢ cients suppressed below for exposition) and measure SkillEndi (the logarithm of average human
capital per worker) and its interaction with an industry’s skill intensity SkillIntj (more details on the
variables and data sources can be found in the Appendix). The results are shown in Table 4.

                                                                 34
anticipated: U.S. …rms export more to a human capital scarce country in skill intensive industries and
substitute local production for exports to human capital scarce countries in industries with low skill
intensity. Note that the interaction term is robust to both country and industry …xed e¤ects while the
measures of F reight and T arif f (not shown but as in Table 3) are not.33
         Vertical production relationships may also be more involved than in the simple model provided
above. Many vertical relationships involve a parent …rm shipping intermediate inputs to its foreign
a¢ liates for further processing (see Figure 4). Rather than focus on factor endowment di¤erences
as the motive for this vertical specialization, Keller and Yeaple (2013) consider the input sourcing
decisions of foreign assembly plants that sell their output in the host country market. They model
the share of imported intermediates in the share of a¢ liates’ total costs as the result of a tradeo¤
between costly technology transfer on the one hand and costly trade on the other hand. Under the
maintained assumption that high R&D industries are the most burdened by technology transfer costs,
their mechanism gives rise to gravity in a¢ liate sales (see Figure 3), and the e¤ect of gravity is
strongest in high R&D industries. They show that the mechanism is consistent with the data for U.S.
multinationals and can explain approximately 30 percent of the gravity for aggregate a¢ liate sales
that was noted as part of Fact 3.34
         It is important to point out that the vertical model might be highly consistent with the o¤shoring
activities of large internationally engaged …rms, but that many of the …rms that are engaged in such
trade do not own the foreign production facility. As made clear by the OLI framework described in
this paper’s introduction, a …rm must not only see a bene…t of relocating a production process in order
for it to be a multinational, it must also …nd integration of that facility within the …rm as superior
to arm’s length contracting. If the activities that are best done in developing countries are best done
at arm’s length, then those production networks will not be observed within multinational …rms. We
will return to this idea in section 7 below.


6         Multi-Country Models
The two-country models discussed in sections 4 and 5 isolated trade costs and comparative advantage
across stages of production as determinants of multinational production. In this section we consider
multicountry models that incorporate both forces. These models address the large share of a¢ liate sales
that are exported to locations other than the source country. The third country sales of multinational
a¢ liates are quantitatively important, accounting for roughly a third of the sales of the a¢ liates of U.S.
multinationals (see Table 2). These models also highlight some of the shortcomings of two-country
models by showing how the characteristics of a country’s neighborhood can a¤ect the structure of its
trade and multinational activity.
    33
     There are alternative explanations for the interactions. For instance, it could be that skill intensive products are not
consumed much in skill scarce (i.e. poorer) countries.
  34
     See also Hanson, Mataloni, and Slaughter (2005) and Irrazabal et al. (2012) for additional evidence on the role of
gravity. Another approach to thinking about vertical specialization appears in Alfaro and Charlton (2009). They identify
vertically specialized a¢ liates as those that do not share an industry classi…cation with their parent …rms. According
to this measure, vertical FDI begins to look quite ubiquitous but not necessarily driven by factor endowment di¤erences
across countries.



                                                             35
       We consider two approaches. The …rst builds on the insights of the Eaton and Kortum (2002)
model that treats locations as substitutes. In this setting an American …rm might choose to serve
a country like Germany either by exporting from the United States, producing in Germany, or by
exporting from a plant located potentially anywhere. The …rm’s choice will depend on the cost of
production in each country, the size of trade costs between each country and Germany, and possibly
the desire to concentrate production for many markets in a single location to conserve on …xed costs of
production. The second approach, which is relatively less developed, treats some sets of countries as
substitutes for stages of production and other sets as complements along a vertical production chain.
In this setting, a …rm’s decision to engage in horizontal investment in one location takes into account
the proximity of that location to sources of low cost intermediates.

6.1      Locations as Substitutes
Historically, the analysis of multilateral trade treated the e¤ects of comparative advantage and trade
costs on trade patterns separately because multi-factor models quickly become intractable in the
absence of factor prices equalization. By modeling comparative advantage as arising from stochastic
Ricardian technology shocks rather than as due to relative factor abundances, Eaton and Kortum
(2002) made the study of comparative advantage and trade costs in a single multi-country setting
relatively tractable. Here we discuss how the insights of the Eaton and Kortum model have been
applied with increasing sophistication to the analysis of trade and multinational production in a multi-
country setting. As the models discussed in this section require substantial computational analysis,
we sketch only their basic features and implications.
       Consider a world with N countries, a continuum of industries indexed by j, and a single factor
labor. Perfect competition prevails in all markets. Each potential production location l has a labor
productivity associated with production in industry j given by 'l (j) and (endogenous) wage rate of
wl . If the iceberg trade cost between country l and country n is           ln ,   then the marginal cost of serving
country n from country l is wl       ln ='l   (j).35   Naturally, each country purchases good j from the lowest
cost location and its spending on that good depends on the marginal cost of provision. Because trade
costs di¤er between bilateral pairs, the same good may be produced by multiple countries for di¤erent
foreign markets.
       The key insight of the Eaton and Kortum model is that if productivities across goods and across
countries are random and drawn from a particular probability distribution, then aggregate bilateral
trade ‡ows between countries can be readily solved in general equilibrium. Moreover, the model relies
on a small number of parameters that can be identi…ed from data and equilibrium conditions. Eaton
and Kortum parameterize this productivity as Fréchet

                                                Gl (') = exp( Tl '     );

where Tl governs the average productivity of country l (absolute advantage) and                  governs the disper-
sion of productivity across goods (comparative advantage). In the aggregate, this dispersion parameter
  35
   In the interest of simplicity, we ignore the treatment of intermediate inputs that features prominently in Eaton and
Kortum (2002).

governs how “substitutable”labor from each country is on the margin. It can then be shown that the
probability that country l is the lowest cost supplier of any particular good to country n is

                                                                      Tl (wl ln )
                                                            ln    = PN                         ;                                   (25)
                                                                     k=1 Tk (wk kn )

which is also the share of country n expenditure that is spent on goods from country l. Note the sense
in which          governs the substitutability of labor from country l for labor from competing countries.
         Ramondo and Rodríguez-Clare (2012) incorporate multinational production into the Eaton and
Kortum model by assuming that each country receives a vector of productivity draws for each good
from a multivariate Fréchet distribution where an element of the vector corresponds to a production
location. A single parameter,                    , governs the correlation of productivity draws of country i for a
particular j across all possible locations. To be symmetric with the formulation of international trade
costs, the authors assume that technology transfer costs from country i to country l are also iceberg
and are denoted           il .   When a productivity draw 'il (j) from country i in industry j is used to produce
in a country l multinational production has occurred, and when that productivity draw is used to
create output consumed in a country n 6= i; l export platform FDI has taken place. In the paper,
the authors assume that intermediate inputs from the source country are also an input into …nal
production creating a degree of complementary between multinational production and trade between
the source and host country, while retaining the feature that production locations are substitutes for
one another. Multinational production raises global output and welfare by allowing technologies to
be used in their most appropriate location and by allowing technologies from productive countries to
displace technologies from less technologically capable countries.36
         Arkolakis, Ramondo, Rodríguez-Clare, and Yeaple (2013) take the insights of Ramondo and
Rodríguez-Clare (2012) to a parameterized version of the Melitz model. As this model …ts well into
the Benchmark framework of section 2, we elaborate a little more on its structure and implications.
As in the Melitz model, there is one di¤erentiated good industry featuring increasing returns to scale
(   z    = 0, and J = 1) and labor is the only factor. To sell its variety in a country n the …rm must
…rst incur a …xed marketing cost fX . As in Ramondo and Rodríguez-Clare, there is a full matrix of
bilateral trade and technology transfer costs                          and .
         To develop a new variety a …rm must pay a …xed entry cost fE . Upon paying this …xed cost a
…rm receives a vector of productivities from a multivariate Pareto distribution where each element
corresponds to a productivity in a particular market. This distribution is

                                                                                N

Rodríguez-Clare, this distribution has a parameter                               that governs the correlation across countries in
each …rm’s vector of draws. The parameter                            Tie   governs the average quality of draws to entrants in
country i, while the parameters              Tlp         govern the average quality of draws for country l.

         Global gains do not insure that all countries gain as technology transfer has terms of trade e¤ects.

Note the similarity to this expression to equation (25) that obtains in Eaton and Kortum (2002). The
numerator of this expression contains the cost components for all …rms serving country n from country
l (wl    ln )   adjusted for the bilateral pair-speci…c cost of technology transfer                        il   from country i to country
l. The denominator summarizes the common marginal cost components of all potential locations for
serving country n. In this sense, geography plays an important role in the manner in which …rms
choose their production locations. Notice also that the combination of parameters                                       1   captures the
substitutability of each location, and that as               ! 1 that locations become perfect substitutes. Finally,
the equation (27) summarizes not only the probability that an individual …rm uses country l as a
production location, but also the share of all spending of country n on goods produced by country i
…rms (wherever they are located) that is done by a¢ liates in country l. It is important to note that
this is not equal to the share of country n expenditure on goods from country i, which depend on the
mass of …rms that endogenously choose to enter in country i.
       By endogenizing the development of new varieties (and their technologies) through free entry,
Arkolakis et al. (2013) capture many of the features of the models discussed in earlier sections but
now in a multi-country setting. Countries in which entrants receive good productivity draws on
average (high Tie ) will have a comparative advantage in entry (an analog to capital or skill abundant
countries in section 5). High levels of entry drive up wages and induce …rms to produce abroad with the
extent of substitution between labor of di¤erent countries determined in part by . Higher trade costs
discourage trade in favor of multinational production as in section 4. The combination of …xed costs of
entry combined with trade ( ) and technology transfer ( ) costs give rise to home market e¤ects that
can work in a number of ways.37 For instance, when trade costs are large, production is attracted to
large countries, thereby driving up the cost of innovation and inducing smaller countries to specialize
in entry. When technology transfer costs are high, entry tends to occur in large countries as entrants
are attracted by the large labor force. Given the competing forces at work in the model, the relative
magnitude of the various e¤ects depends on the model parameters including the full set of bilateral
trade and technology transfer costs. The authors assess the model’s empirically relevant implications
by calibrating it to data on trade ‡ows and multinational production shares across countries.
       Arkolakis et al. (2013) achieve tractability by abstracting away from the …xed costs associated with
production. In this sense, their model captures a proximity versus comparative advantage tradeo¤
  37
    In this respect, the model has implications that are similar to those of the knowledge capital model of Markusen
(2002). In that two-country setting, comparative advantage is driven by relative factor abundances and interacts with
home-market e¤ects to determine the location of production. As is the case in the models discussed in this section, vertical
(comparative-advantage driven) and horizontal (trade-cost driven) investment arise in a single framework depending on
the relative size and factor abundances of countries. Finally, the knowledge capital model also delivers the possibility
that countries can lose from multinational production.




                                                                      38
but contains no …xed cost driven tendency toward concentration. Fixed costs of opening a foreign
a¢ liate substantially complicate the analysis by making the location decisions to serve each market
interdependent. For example, consider a …rm that wants to sell its product in Germany and France.
Minimizing marginal costs might mean selling to Germany from an Austrian a¢ liate and selling to
France from a Spanish a¢ liate but the desire to concentration production in one location that is
created by large …xed costs might mean that Belgium is the best location to serve the two markets.
       Tintelnot (2012) tackles these issues by further pushing the insights of Eaton and Kortum. In his
model, a …rm produces a continuum of products. Each time a …rm opens an a¢ liate in a di¤erent
country by incurring a …xed cost it receives a productivity draw for each of its products in that country.
Now, the …rm itself becomes a relevant unit of observation as the aggregation across products is at the
level of the …rm rather than at the level of the country. In this setting an equation of the sort of (27)
now applies to the share of a …rm from country i’s sales to country n that are made via an a¢ liate
in country l given the set of countries in which the …rm owns an a¢ liate. As the …rm adds more
production locations, it increases its …xed costs and the new production location reduces the share of
products produced at its existing a¢ liates. That is, new production locations are good substitutes for
some products in all existing production facilities. The …rm will add new production locations until
the reduction in the marginal cost of providing its portfolio of products to global markets is balanced
by the additional …xed costs that need to be incurred. By pushing the smoothness from the Eaton
and Kortum model into the …rm, Tintelnot can structurally estimate the distribution of …xed and
variable costs of multinational production using …rm-level data.38 He …nds that these …xed costs play
a large role in the geographic structure of multinational production and are necessary to explain the
magnitude of export platform sales in the data.

6.2      Locations as Complements
The previous section discussed multi-country models in which comparative advantage and trade costs
were analyzed in an environment in which …rms perceived alternative foreign locations as substitutes:
an improvement in the attractiveness of one location would tend to induce …rms to substitute away
from another. This section covers a small literature that demonstrates that in many instances, sets of
foreign countries may be complements in multinational production.
       Multinational production is motivated by some form of marginal cost reduction relative to purely
national …rms. By opening a foreign a¢ liate a …rm can avoid transport costs (horizontal or replicating
strategies) or reduce the cost of a stage of production by locating near key inputs (vertical or fragmen-
tation strategies). We show how the two types of cost reductions can be complementary: a …rm that
replicates production of some activities o¤shore has a strong incentive to fragment production and
vice versa. We refer to …rms whose global organization re‡ects both types of multinational production
as following complex strategies.
       The framework developed here builds on the ideas in Yeaple (2003b) which were developed further
in Grossman, Helpman, and Szeidl (2006).39 We begin with the setting used to illustrate the proximity
  38
    To make his model tractable, Tintelnot simpli…es relative to the Melitz-style models by abstracting from …xed
marketing costs in each country and free entry.
 39
    Similar issues arise Ekholm et al. (2007).


                                                       39
concentration hypothesis in section 4.1.A. There are two identical countries, H and F , that are
endowed with only labor and two goods, one di¤erentiated (J = 1) and one that is homogeneous
(   z   > 0). The homogeneous good is freely traded while the di¤erentiated industry faces transport
costs         > 1 in shipping …nal good varieties. Now, suppose that there is a third country, which we
will refer to as S, that does not consume di¤erentiated varieties. Choosing labor in H and F as the
numeraire, we assume that the wage in S, wS , is strictly less than one because of di¤erences in the
productivity in the outside good sector. Entry of a di¤erentiated goods producer can only occur in H
or F and requires fE units of labor. Each plant requires a …rm to incur …xed cost fD .
        Assume that the production of varieties of the di¤erentiated good can be fragmented into two
stages. The …rst is the intermediate good stage which requires one unit of labor to produce one unit
of a …rm-speci…c intermediate. The second stage is assembly that can only be done in H and F . We
again choose units such that one unit of labor makes one of unit of assembly possible. Building a
plant to produce intermediates abroad requires the …rm to incur a …xed cost fI units of labor in its
home market. Finally, while the …nal good is expensive to ship, the intermediate input is not subject
to trade costs. The technology for producing a complete …nal good is such that the marginal cost is
equal to 1=' when producing both stages locally in a northern country, while it is c(wS )=' < 1=',
when obtaining intermediates from a plant located in S.
        Consider a …rm from H that will serve both H and F . As in section 4, the pro…ts from a pure
export strategy and a pure replication strategy are

                                                      1                 1

respectively. If the …rm from H were to open a plant in S to provide intermediates to its assembly
plant located in H. The pro…t associated with this fragmenting (vertical) strategy are

                                V   ='         B(1 +                  )c(wS )1         fE        fD         fI .

Finally, suppose that a …rm were to undertake both types of multinational production (complex FDI).
In this case, the pro…ts are

                                                      1
                                     VR   = 2'            Bc(wS )1               fE        2fD       fI :

        It is straightforward to con…rm from these equations and the assumptions over the relative costs
(1 >      1     and c(wS )1   > 1) that the following inequality must hold:

                                VR        R   >   V               X    ,    VR         V   >     R          X.


The inequality establishes that if a …rm has reduced its marginal cost in serving a foreign market
through horizontal investment, it will gain more from opening an intermediate producing facility in
S than if it had not, and that a …rm that has opened an a¢ liate in S to provide intermediate inputs
gains more from opening an assembly plant in the other northern country than had it not opened an


                                                                       40
intermediate plant. In short, having lowered marginal cost through one type of foreign investment, the
…rm optimally raises its output and so gains relatively more by lowering its marginal cost through the
other type of foreign investment. Grossman, Helpman, and Szeidl (2006) call this mechanism a unit-
cost complementarity. This complementarity has interesting implications. For instance, an increase in
trade costs can raise the raise the relative payo¤ to horizontal investment and so induce a …rm that
would otherwise not do any foreign investment to simultaneously invest in F and in S as doing so
only makes sense if both are done simultaneously. Similarly, although a reduction in fI has no direct
impact on the pro…tability of replicating strategies relative to national export strategies, it can result
in local assembly in F replacing trade with H in …nal goods.
         There have been few empirical studies motivated by models of complex strategies perhaps in part
because of the conceptual complications that the models entail. Standard empirical methods treat
shocks across countries as independent, but complex models warn us that this may be problematic.40


7         Multinational Firm Boundaries
So far we have reviewed theoretical frameworks that illustrate di¤erent types of gains associated with
…rms locating production processes in multiple countries. These models, however, cannot explain
why these processes will be o¤shored within …rm boundaries (thus involving FDI sales or foreign
insourcing) rather than through arm’s length licensing or subcontracting. As such, and despite the
terminology that we have used in the last two sections, these should not be viewed as complete theories
of the multinational …rm, but rather as theories of the technological drivers behind the international
organization of production.41 In this section, we will review complete theories of the multinational
…rm that attempt to also shed light on the crucial internalization decision of multinational …rms, and
we will also review some empirical work testing these theories.
         The main unifying theme of the theoretical literature on multinational …rm boundaries is the
departure from the classical assumption of complete or perfect contracting. After all, and as …rst
pointed out by Coase (1937), …rm boundaries are indeterminate and irrelevant in a world in which
transactions are governed by comprehensive contracts that specify (in an enforceable way) the course
of action to be taken in any possible contingency that the contracting parties may encounter. In order
to shed light on the internalization decision, this new literature on multinational …rms and outsourcing
has thus borrowed from the theoretical literature on incomplete contracts (cf., Williamson, 1975, 1985,
Grossman and Hart, 1986), and has developed ways to incorporate these contracting frameworks into
general equilibrium models. Di¤erent contributions emphasize di¤erent types of contractual frictions
and they also adopt di¤erent approaches as to how the internalization of transactions a¤ects these
frictions. We will next discuss some of the key ideas and models in this literature.
    40
     Baldwin and Venables (2010) suggest an even greater complication. They show that the nature of interdependency
across countries hinges on the temporal sequence of production stages.
  41
     Remember from Caves’(2007) de…nition in the introduction that one needs to explain why multinational …rms choose
to control and manage their production establishments abroad.

7.1      Transaction-Cost Approaches
The transaction-cost theory of …rm boundaries is based on the premise that …rms will internalize
particular transactions whenever the transaction costs associated with performing these transactions
through the market mechanism are greater than within the …rm (cf., Coase, 1937). The concept
of transaction costs is somewhat vague, but it is often associated with ine¢ ciencies that arise when
transactions are not fully governed or secured by comprehensive contracts.42 We will discuss below
two types of ine¢ ciencies that have featured prominently in the literature: rent dissipation and hold
up ine¢ ciencies (see Garetto, 2012, for a di¤erent perspective).

7.1.A       Licensing versus FDI: Rent Dissipation

We …rst illustrate the relevance of rent dissipation within the horizontal model of FDI with symmetric
…rms and countries in section 4.1.A. Remember that we argued above that the pro…ts obtained by
multinational …rms were given by

                                                  1
                                       I   ='         BH + '    1
                                                                    BF   fE   2fD .

Implicit in that computation was the notion that Home …rms could fully capture the net surplus
associated with selling their varieties in the Foreign market, i.e., the amount '               1BF      fD > 0. This
is a strong assumption when considering FDI transactions, and it is even harder to swallow when
modeling market transactions. To be more speci…c, consider a licensing arrangement. In order to
secure a pro…t ‡ow equal to '         1BF       fD , the Home …rm would need to be able to costlessly contract
with a Foreign licensee that would commit to producing an amount of output optimally dictated by the
Home …rm, collecting the sales revenue generated in Foreign, and handing the whole net surplus over
to the Home …rm, either via ex-ante transfers (before sale revenue is generated) or ex-post payments
(after the revenue has been collected).43
       In practice, various types of contractual imperfections will lead to rent dissipation and the Home
…rm will end up sharing rents with foreign licensees. A particularly noteworthy source of frictions
stems from the (partially) nonexcludable, nonrival, and noncodi…able nature of the technology that
the Home …rm is attempting to sell to the Foreign …rm (see Arrow, 1962, Romer, 1990). The partial
nonexcludability of technology generates a risk of intellectual expropriation, which in turn typically
limits the ability of the Home …rm to appropriate surplus from the Foreign licensee ex post. The fact
that the …rm is selling intellectual property, a noncodi…able and nonrival good, will in turn limit the
willingness of the Foreign …rm to pay for the technology up-front (i.e., ex ante). Even abstracting from
the risk of intellectual expropriation, moral hazard and private information constraints will typically
also preclude full extraction of rents from licensees.
       We next illustrate this rent dissipation phenomenon below with a simple model inspired by the
  42
     Obviously, not all transaction costs are contractual in nature (take, for instance, the existence of taxes on market
transactions).
  43
     Strictly speaking, the tradeo¤ between FDI and exports could still be governed by (8), even when the technology
owners do not capture the entire surplus, provided that the choice of FDI versus exporting is included in the ex-ante
negotiations and that unrestricted ex-ante transfers between the licensee and the technology owner are allowed. As
emphasized below, it is important thus to consider limitations on both ex-ante and ex-post transfers of surplus.


                                                           42
work, among others, of Ethier (1986), Horstmann and Markusen (1987b), and Ethier and Markusen
(1996). With that in mind, let us return to the Horizontal FDI model with symmetric countries,
but now allow …rms the option of servicing the foreign market via licensing. We will emphasize the
contractual costs associated with licensing, so it is important to formally introduce the contracting
assumptions and the timing of events. There are three relevant periods, t = 0, t = 1, and t = 2.
       At t = 0, the …rm that owns the blueprint for variety ! decides the mode via which it will service
the foreign market: exporting, FDI or licensing. The payo¤s associated with exporting and FDI remain
identical to those derived in section 4.1.A, re‡ecting the notion that these strategies can be performed
with no transaction costs.
       When licensing is chosen at t = 0, the technology owner o¤ers a contract to a licensee abroad
which stipulates an initial payment at t = 1 (L1 ) and a second payment at t = 2 (L2 ). We allow this
initial contract to stipulate the amount of output to be produced by the licensee, but this assumption
could be relaxed, thus opening the door for the type of moral hazard e¤ects studied in Horstmann and
Markusen (1987b). In order to produce, the licensee needs to incur an overhead cost equal to fD , just
as in our Horizontal FDI model, and we assume that this …xed cost is incurred at t = 1. At t = 2, the
licensee produces the good, generates sale revenue and uses this revenue to remunerate labor and pay
the technology owner the amount L2 . Ex-post payments that exceed the revenues generated at t = 2
are not allowed. In order to generate a nontrivial trade o¤ between licensing and FDI, suppose that
the marginal cost of production faced by the licensee is 1= ( '), where               > 1.
       With no transaction costs, it is clear that the technology owner could easily choose a transfer
L1 or L2 large enough to appropriate all rents, thus making FDI dominated by this licensing strategy.
Suppose, however, that due to the nonexcludable nature of the technology to produce variety !,
the technology owner cannot completely prevent the licensee from using the technology in ways that
might prove detrimental to the accrual of cash ‡ows at t = 2. To …x ideas, suppose that the licensee
can operate the technology “on the side,” thereby diverting a share                 of revenues. Suppose that this
diversion requires a …xed cost equal to fD associated with setting up production of a competing variety.
Then, in order to avoid cash ‡ow diversion (or technology expropriation) on the part of the licensee,
the payment L2 needs to be low enough to satisfy

                                   1                                       1
                            ( ')       BF   L2    (      (     1)) ( ')        BF     fD ,                    (28)

where the left-hand side is the ex-post payo¤ of the licensee under no defection, while the right-hand
side is its payo¤ under defection, assuming that the technology owner captures all nondiverted revenue
in that case.44
       If the above was the only source of transaction costs in the model, then a simple strategy for
the technology owner would be to set L2 = 0, thus ensuring that (28) is met, and then setting
                1
L1 = ( ')           BF   fD ; thus extracting all surplus ex ante. Suppose, however, that because of the
nonrival nature of technology, the technology owner cannot credibly commit at t = 1 to not using
his own technology to service the foreign market at t = 2 via an alternative method. To be more
  44
    Equation (28) assumes that in the absence of expropriation, the choice of output maximizes total revenue net of
labor costs, which is consistent with our assumptions above.



                                                        43
speci…c, and given our assumption that all plant …xed costs are incurred at t = 1, assume that the
only feasible alternative method at that point is exporting. This ‘defection’ can have a signi…cant
detrimental e¤ect on the sale revenues obtained by the licensee at t = 2, particularly when given the
noncodi…able dimension of technology and foreseeing a future defection on his part, the technology
owner might be inclined to transfer an inferior version of the technology to the licensee. For simplicity,
we capture this in a stark way by assuming that, by exporting at t = 2, the technology owner would
drive licensee revenues to 0.
   This limited commitment constraint on the part of the technology owner e¤ectively hinders the
ability of the technology owner to extract surplus ex-ante rather than ex-post. More speci…cally, for
the technology owner not to have an incentive to defect at t = 2, the ex-post payment L2 has to be
high enough to guarantee that
                                                      1            1
                                              L2           '           BF ,                                                (29)

where the right-hand side corresponds to the ex-post payo¤ of the technology owner when defecting.
   Note that both constraints (28) and (29) can only be met whenever

                                          1                              1        1
                                  fD >               (1        )              '       BF ,                                 (30)

that is when, for a given residual demand level B F , transport costs                   are high, the scope of dissipation
  is low, the cost advantage     of the licensee is large or the defection …xed cost fD is high. Ethier and
Markusen (1996) derive similar comparative statics in a far richer framework and interpret a low fD
as a re‡ecting an intensive use of knowledge (relative to physical) capital in production.
   When condition (30) is satis…ed, no defection will occur in equilibrium and the licensing option
                                                                                              1
will necessarily dominate FDI at t = 0 since L1 can be set equal to ( ')                          BF   L2       fD thus leaving
the technology owner with all the net surplus, which exceeds the same net surplus of FDI because of
  > 1. Conversely, when condition (30) is not satis…ed, licensing will be a (weakly) dominated strategy
because, anticipating defection on the part of the technology owner, the licensee will anticipate zero
revenue ex-post, and thus it will not be willing to pay for the technology upfront, leaving the technology
owner with at most its payo¤ under exporting.
   So far we have treated the residual demand term B F as given. In our model without licensing
in section 4.1.A, we showed that the equilibrium would be one with pervasive FDI and no exporting
whenever 2fD =fE <        1     1. Plugging the equilibrium value B F = fD + 21 fE '1                             , we …nd that
such an FDI equilibrium will dominate an equilibrium with licensing whenever

                                 2fD                           1
                                     <        1                               1          1.
                                  fE               1 + (1          )              1

Interestingly, a low ratio of plant-speci…c economies of scale relative to …rm-speci…c economies of scale
(fD =fE ) favors FDI not only over exporting, as in section 4.1.A, but also over licensing. Conversely,
the positive e¤ect of trade costs on the likelihood of FDI is now less clear-cut because high trade
costs relax the temptation to defect of the technology owner. Notice that when                              1   ! 1, the above
condition cannot possibly hold and the equilibrium is one with licensing. This provides a potential



                                                          44
justi…cation for our stylized Fact Three indicating that levels of FDI tend to diminish with distance.
       Even when 2fD =fE >            1   1, so FDI is dominated by exporting, licensing can still emerge in
equilibrium when (30) holds and provided that                          is high enough. In such case too, licensing becomes
more appealing, the higher are trade frictions                     and the cost advantage                   of licensees.45
       It is worth outlining some additional results that obtain when incorporating country asymmetries
and …rm heterogeneity in the model above. For the sake of brevity, we will focus only on the choice
between FDI and licensing and will treat factor prices and demand levels as given. Consider …rst the
case of wage di¤erences across countries. Denoting by wH and wF , the wage at Home and in Foreign,
respectively, condition (30) now becomes
                                     h         1                                           1
                                                                                               i
                              fD >        wH                  (1            )   1
                                                                                    wF             '   1
                                                                                                           BF ,

which preserves the same comparative statics as before, but notice that the right-hand-side is now
also decreasing in wH and increasing in wF . Intuitively, higher Northern wages relax the incentive
compatibility constraint for the technology owner by making exporting less pro…table, while lower
Foreign wages relax the licensee’s incentive to misbehave by increasing the pro…tability of cooperating
with the technology owner. An implication of this result is that the larger are wage di¤erences across
countries, the more likely that licensing will dominate FDI, a result that very much resonates with
those obtained by Ethier (1986) and Ethier and Markusen (1996). It thus follows that in horizontal
FDI models, both the location and the internalization decisions work against the prevalence of MNEs
when relative factor endowment di¤erences are high.
       Next consider the choice between FDI and licensing when technology owners within sectors di¤er
in their productivity levels, while sharing a common residual demand level as captured by B F . Then
direct inspection of (30) reveals that there exists a productivity threshold 'L , such that all …rms with
productivity ' above 'L will prefer FDI to licensing, while all …rms with productivity below 'L will
prefer licensing to FDI. This result obtains because we have modeled defection as entailing a …xed cost
fD , and thus the no defection constraint will tend to be more binding for large …rms than for small
…rms. Introducing a …xed cost of exporting fX paid by the technology owner at t = 2 upon defecting
would generate the same exact sorting of …rms between the licensing and FDI modes and would lead
to a higher threshold productivity 'L .46

7.1.B       Outsourcing versus FDI: Hold Up Ine¢ ciencies

We next illustrate another source of transaction costs within the Ricardian, one-factor version of
Helpman’s (1984) vertical FDI model developed in section 5.3. There we argued a …rm may …nd
vertical FDI appealing when the its productivity is high and when the Home wage is su¢ ciently
  45
       The precise condition under which licensing dominates exporting is given by
                                                     1        1
                                                                        fE
                                                          1
                                                                           +1       < 1:
                                                   (1 +            )    fD
Note also that when considering licensing as a deviation from an all exporting equilibrium, the equilibrium residual
demand term B F is given in (6), but this has no qualitative e¤ect on how parameters a¤ect the likelihood of licensing
dominating FDI.
  46
     In fact, the condition becomes identical to (30) except with fD + fX on the left-hand side of the inequality.


                                                                       45
higher than the foreign wage. Vertical FDI yields a pro…t level (net of entry costs) equal to

                                                                       1   1
                                        1

For the Home …rm to actually appropriate this entire pro…t ‡ow, however, it is important that an initial
contract stipulates precisely the quantity and characteristics (quality, compatibility,...) of the inputs
produced in the foreign manufacturing plant, while including payments that transfer all the net surplus
to the Home …rm. Again, these are strong assumptions in internalized vertical relationships but they
are simply untenable in arm’s-length vertical transactions. The seminal work of Williamson (1985)
has demonstrated that contractual gaps or incompleteness (and the associated renegotiation or ‘…ne-
tuning’ of contracts) create ine¢ ciencies in situations in which the parties involved in a transaction
undertake relationship-speci…c investments or use relationship-speci…c assets, a realistic characteris-
tic of o¤shoring relationships. Intuitively, speci…city implies that, at the renegotiation stage, parties
cannot costlessly switch to alternative trading partners and are partially locked into a bilateral re-
lationship. Williamson (1985) illustrates how this so-called fundamental transformation is a natural
source of ex-post ine¢ ciencies (e.g., ine¢ cient termination or execution of the contract) as well as
ex-ante or hold-up ine¢ ciencies (e.g., suboptimal provision of relationship-speci…c investments).
       We next develop a simple model, along the lines of Grossman and Helpman (2002), that formalizes
some of these insights within the vertical fragmentation model developed in section 5.3.47 Consider
then the same model as in section 5.3, but now allow for the possibility that the manufacturing
stage of production is outsourced, rather than integrated. The main bene…t of outsourcing is that it
avoids ‘governance costs’and thus entails lower costs of production. To be more precise, we assume
that marginal costs are lower by a factor         > 1 under outsourcing, and that the …xed costs satisfy
fDO < fDV and fIO < fIV , where the subscript D and I denote Domestic sourcing and I nternational
sourcing, respectively, while the subscripts O and V refer to Outsourcing and V ertical integration,
respectively. In section 5.3, where all transactions were integrated, we used the simpler notation
fDV = fD and fIV = fI .
       As in all contracting models, it is important to be explicit about the timing of events and the
space of contracts available to agents. The model features two types of agents: headquarters H and
operators of manufacturing facility M . We shall now distinguish between four distinct periods, t = 0,
t = 1, t = 2, and t = 3.
       At t = 0, the …rm observes its productivity ', decides whether it wants to have the manufacturing
part of production be done at Home or in Foreign, and whether to have it done inhouse or at arm’s-
length. At this stage too, all …xed costs are incurred and headquarter services h are produced. At
t = 0, H anticipates that domestic vertical integration and foreign vertical integration (or FDI) will
be associated with the payo¤s derived in section 5.3 (see eq. (22) and (23)), so below we focus
on characterizing behavior in stages t = 1, t = 2, and t = 3 for the case of domestic and foreign
outsourcing.
       Under outsourcing, at t = 1, the headquarter H o¤ers an initial (or ex ante) contract to a potential
  47
   Some of the ideas to be formalized were also present in the work of McLaren (2000), but it is harder to map his
model to the type of CES frameworks we have been restricting ourselves to in this survey.



                                                       46
manufacturer for the provision of the input m. The simplest way to illustrate the e¤ects of contractual
frictions on outsourcing is to assume that the ex-ante contract is totally incomplete in the sense that
no aspect of production can be speci…ed in the contract. This is obviously a strong assumption, but
it can easily be relaxed. The important thing is that the initial contract cannot fully discipline the
behavior of agents during the production stage. The only contractible in the initial contract is a
lump-sum transfer between the two agents.
   At t = 2, M undertakes the investments necessary to produce the manufacturing input m. Because
these investments are not disciplined by the initial contract, they will necessarily be set to maximize
M ’s private (ex-post) return from them.
   Once the production of m is …nalized, H and M sit down at t = 3 to (re-)negotiate a transaction
price for the manufacturing services provided by M to H. Sale revenue is generated immediately (or
shortly) after an agreement between H and M has been reached, and the receipts are divided between
the agents according to the negotiated agreement. As is standard in the literature, we characterize this
ex-post bargaining using the symmetric Nash Bargaining solution and assume symmetric information
between H and M at this stage. This leaves H and M with their outside options plus a share of the
ex-post gains from trade (i.e., the di¤erence between the sum of the agent’s payo¤s under trade and
their sum under no trade). As pointed out by Williamson (1985), the fact that the division of surplus
is determined ex-post (after investments have been incurred) rather than ex-ante becomes signi…cant
only when investments are (partly) relationship speci…c, so that their value inside the relationship is
higher than outside of it.
   In the global sourcing environments that concern us here, there are two natural sources of ‘lock
in’ for manufacturers. First, manufacturing inputs are often customized to their intended buyers
and cannot easily be resold at full price to alternative buyers; and second, even in the absence of
customization, search frictions typically make separations costly for both H and M . A simple way
to capture these considerations in the model above is to assume that if the contractual relationship
between the two parties breaks down, (i) H does not have time to turn to an alternative M for the
provision of m (and is thus left with nothing), and (ii) M can resort to a secondary market but there
he would only be able to secure a payo¤ equal to a share 1                     < 1 of the revenue generated when
combining m with H’s headquarter services. The higher is , the higher the degree of speci…city of
M ’s investments.
   Solving for the subgame perfect equilibrium of this game under the assumption that arm’s-length
transactions are ‘totally incomplete’regardless of the location of M , we have that the pro…ts obtained
by H under domestic outsourcing and foreign (or o¤shore) outsourcing are given by

       These expressions are analogous to the insourcing ones in (22) and (23), except for the lower
…xed costs, the terms with        > 1 capturing the (governance) cost advantage of outsourcing, and the
term      O   < 1, which re‡ects the transaction costs due to incomplete contracting associated with market
transactions. Straightforward di¤erentiation indicates that                  O   is decreasing in the degree of speci…city
  and reaches a value of 1 when        goes to 0 and there is no speci…city. Consequently, outsourcing will
tend to dominate integration for low levels of speci…city and large values of , while integration will
instead tend to dominate outsourcing for high values of speci…city                       and for        close enough to 1.
       Furthermore, cumbersome di¤erentiation (see the Appendix) demonstrates that                                O   in (33) is a
strictly increasing function of , and thus the transaction costs of using the market are particularly
high when the input m is relatively important in production. The result is intuitive given that the
source of transaction costs is the underinvestment in m, and it suggests a higher relative pro…tability
of outsourcing in headquarter intensive sectors.
       So far we have focused on studying how the di¤erent parameters of the model shape the pro…tabil-
ity of a …rm when using alternative organizational models, while treating the equilibrium demand
levels B H and B F as given. The simplest way to close the model is by assuming that all Home …rms
have the same productivity level ' and that free entry brings pro…ts down to zero. We will introduce
intraindustry heterogeneity in productivity in the next section on property-rights models. With ho-
mogeneity, in any generic equilibrium all …rms choose the same organizational form. Furthermore, for
wN =wS su¢ ciently high, the equilibrium is necessarily one with all …rms o¤shoring in Foreign, with
these …rms optimally choosing outsourcing whenever

while choosing vertical FDI whenever this inequality is reversed. From our previous discussion it
thus follows that the likelihood of internalized fragmentation is increasing in the degree of speci…city
 , and decreasing in the governance costs             and headquarter intensity . Introducing intraindustry
heterogeneity generates analogous comparative static results regarding the share of o¤shoring …rms
and activity associated with vertical FDI, except for a subtle counterbalancing force of headquarter
intensity that will be discussed in the next section on property rights models (see footnote 55).
       Although we have drawn inspiration from the work of Grossman and Helpman (2002) in developing
the model above, it is important to point out some interesting features of their framework that we
have left out.48 Most notably, key to their analysis are search frictions, which we ruled out above by
  48
    In certain respects that the framework above is much richer than that in Grossman and Helpman (2002), since they
focused on a closed-economy model with no producer heterogeneity and with no headquarter investments, or = 0
in the model above. The Grossman and Helpman (2002) setup was later extended by the authors to open-economy
environments with cross-country variation in the degree of contractibility of inputs in Grossman and Helpman (2003,
2005).



                                                            48
assuming that when a …rm chooses outsourcing instead of integration, it can simply post a contract
and pick an operator M from the set of …rms applying to ful…ll the order. Grossman and Helpman
(2002) instead assume that the matching between stand-alone H agents and M operators is random
and depends on the relative mass of each type of agents looking for matches. Furthermore, once a
match is formed, agents are not allowed to exchange transfers prior to production. Other things equal,
it is clear that these features will tend to reduce the attractiveness of outsourcing vis à vis integration,
even holding constant supplier investments. Intuitively, search frictions and the lack of transfers inhibit
the ability of H producers to fully capture the rents generated in production relative to a situation
in which they can make take-it-or-leave-it o¤ers to a perfectly elastic supply of M operators. Search
frictions can generate much more subtle and interesting results when allowing the matching function
governing the search process to feature increasing returns to scale. In such a case, Grossman and
Helpman (2002) show that there may exist multiple equilibria with di¤erent organizational forms (or
industry systems) applying in ex-ante identical countries or industries. Furthermore, the likelihood of
an equilibrium with outsourcing is enhanced by an expansion in the market size, which increases the
e¢ ciency of matching in the presence of increasing returns to scale in the matching function.
       A previous paper by McLaren (2000) also provided an alternative framework in which the orga-
nizational decisions of …rms within an industry exerted externalities on the decisions of other …rms
in the industry. Rather than assuming a search/congestion externality, McLaren (2000) focuses on
the implications of market thickness on the ex-post determination of the division of surplus between
H and M agents. In his framework, the thicker is the market for inputs, the larger is the ex-post
payo¤ obtained by M producers which in turn alleviates hold-up ine¢ ciencies. Crucially, however,
the thickness of the market for inputs depends in turn on the extent to which …rms rely on outsourc-
ing rather than integration, since only outsourcers enter that market. McLaren (2000) demonstrates
too the possibility of multiple equilibria and shows that trade opening, by thickening the market for
inputs, may lead to a worldwide move towards more disintegrated industrial systems, thus increasing
world welfare and leading to gains from trade quite di¤erent from those emphasized in traditional
trade theory.49

7.2      The Property-Rights Approach
The transaction-cost theory of …rm boundaries has enhanced our understanding of the sources and
nature of ine¢ ciencies that arise when transacting via the market mechanism, but it sheds little light
on the limits or costs of vertically or laterally integrated transactions. Transaction-cost models appeal
to some vague notion of “governance costs”to deliver a nontrivial tradeo¤ in internalization decisions,
but these governance costs are treated as exogenous parameters and thus orthogonal to the sources
of transaction costs in market transactions. The property-rights theory of the …rm, as …rst exposited
in Grossman and Hart (1986), and further developed in Hart and Moore (1990) and Hart (1995), has
convincingly argued that this is approach is unsatisfactory. After all, intra…rm transactions are not
secured by all-encompassing contracts and there is no reason to assume that relationship speci…city will
  49
    Another aspect studied by both the McLaren (2000) and Grossman and Helpman (2002) papers but ignored in our
discussion above is the choice by M producers of the degree to which they customize their intermediate products to their
intended buyers (see also Qiu and Spencer, 2002, and Chen and Feenstra, 2008).


                                                          49
be any lower in integrated relationships than in nonintegrated ones. For these reasons, opportunistic
behavior and incentive provision are arguably just as important in within-…rm transactions as they
are in market transactions.
    If one accepts the notion that within …rm transactions typically entail transaction costs and that the
source of these transaction costs is not too distinct from those in market transactions, then a natural
question is: what de…nes then the boundaries of the …rm? From a legal perspective, integration is
associated with the ownership (via acquisition or creation) of non-human assets, such as machines,
buildings, inventories, patents, copyrights, etc. The central idea of the property-rights approach of
Grossman, Hart and Moore is that internalization matters because ownership of assets is a source of
power when contracts are incomplete. More speci…cally, when parties encounter contingencies that
were not foreseen in an initial contract, the owner of these assets naturally holds residual rights of
control, and he or she can decide on the use of these assets that maximizes his payo¤ at the possible
expense of that of the integrated party. Grossman and Hart (1986) then show that in the presence of
relationship-speci…c investments, these considerations lead to a theory of the boundaries of the …rm in
which both the bene…ts and the costs of integration are endogenous. In particular, vertical integration
entails endogenous (transactions) costs because it reduces the incentives of the integrated …rm to make
investments that are partially speci…c to the integrating …rm, and that this underinvestment lowers
the overall surplus of the relationship.
    The property-rights theory of the …rm has featured prominently in the international trade literature
in recent years, starting with the work of Antràs (2003). The vast majority of applications of the
property-rights approach have focused on the type of vertical integration decisions inherently associated
with vertical FDI models, rather than with lateral integration decisions of the type emphasized in the
FDI versus licensing literature (an exception is Chen et al., 2012).
    Let us thus go back to our Ricardian, one-factor, vertical FDI model …rst exposited in section 5.3.
As in section 7.1.B, we maintain the assumption that when transacting at arm’s length, only ‘totally
incomplete’ contracts are available to agents. The key innovation in this section is that integrated
transactions also entail transaction costs, and following Grossman and Hart (1986) and Hart and
Moore (1990), the source of these costs is related to the fact that intra…rm transactions are also
governed by totally incomplete contracts.50 In particular, we shall assume that when H decides its
mode of organization at t = 0, it anticipates playing an analogous game with a manufacturing operator
M regardless of whether the operator is an employee of H or an independent contractor. Both the
‘outsourcing’ and ‘integration’ branches of the game feature an ex-ante contracting stage (t = 1),
an investment stage (t = 2), and an ex-post bargaining stage (t = 3). The only di¤erence between
the two branches of the game is at t = 3, and more precisely, in the outside options available to H
and M at this stage. Remember that in the outsourcing stage we assumed that in the absence of an
agreement at t = 3, H was left with a zero payo¤ (since it could not create output without m and
there was no time to …nd an alternative M for the provision of m), while M could sell the input m in
a secondary market and obtain a share 1                < 1 of the revenue generated when combining m with
H’s headquarter services. In the case of integration, the above formulation of the outside options is
  50
     As discussed below, our framework could easily accommodate variation in contractibility across organizational forms
but we will refrain from doing so in the spirit of the property-rights approach.


                                                          50
unrealistic. It seems natural to assume instead that H will hold property rights over the input m
produced by M , and thus H has the ability to …re a stubborn operator M that has refused to agree on
a transfer price (leaving M with nothing), while still being able to capture part, say a fraction                                                         < 1,
of the revenue generated by combining h and m. The fact that                                             < 1 re‡ects the intuitive idea that F
cannot use the input m as e¤ectively as it can with the cooperation of its producer, i.e., M .
   In the ex-post bargaining, each party will capture their outside option plus an equal share of the ex-
post gains from trade. Denote by             k    the share of revenue accruing to H at t = 3 under organizational
form k = V; O. Given our assumptions, we have

                                                         1          1

which illustrates the notion that H holds more power under integration than under outsourcing.
   Because we have maintained our assumptions regarding the outsourcing branches of the game, the
payo¤s associated with domestic and o¤shore outsourcing are still given by equations (31) and (32),
with   O   given in (33). Following analogous steps, we can now solve for H’s pro…ts under domestic
and o¤shore integration in the presence of within-…rm transactions costs. These are given by

respectively, with

   These expressions are very similar to the outsourcing ones, except for the cost di¤erences in …xed
and marginal costs (due to factor prices and exogenous ‘governance costs’) and for the di¤erent levels
of transaction costs, as captured by the di¤erence between                                   V   and           O.   A key object in governing the
relative pro…tability of integration and outsourcing is the ratio                                        V = O,     which we can reduce to:

                                                                                  (   1)(1           )                    (1    )(    1)
                   O              (       1) (1        O ) (1        )                                     1        O
                       =                                                                                                                   .              (36)
                   V              (       1) (1        V ) (1        )                                     1        V

Di¤erentiating this expression with respect to , we …nd that for any                                                V    >     O,    with      k   2 (0; 1) for
k = V; O, this ratio is necessarily decreasing in                   (see the Appendix). Hence, unlike in the transaction-
cost model in section 7.1.B, low levels of headquarter intensity are now associated with higher (rather
than lower) relative pro…tabilities of outsourcing versus integration. This result resonates with one
of the central results in the property-rights theory: with incomplete contracting, ownership rights of
assets should be allocated to parties undertaking noncontractible investments that contribute dispro-
portionately to the value of the relationship. The relative importance of the operator M ’s investment
is captured in (36) by the elasticity of output with respect to that agent’s investment, i.e., 1                                                              ,
and thus the lower is , the higher the need for H to give away ownership rights to M by engaging


                                                                     51
in outsourcing. As argued below, the fact that headquarter intensity shapes the integration decision
in opposite ways in transaction-cost and property-rights models opens the door for empirical relative
evaluations of the two models.
      So far we have only discussed how          a¤ects the relative pro…tability of integration and outsourcing.
A problematic feature of the stylized property-rights model we have developed so far is that because
M is the only agent undertaking noncontractible, relationship-speci…c investments, transaction costs
stemming from underinvestment will always be higher under integration than under outsourcing.
In terms of our notation, we necessarily have               O    >   V.   Coupled with the presence of exogenous
‘governance costs’, the model thus predicts that vertical integration of any sort will be a dominated
strategy for H. Intuitively, M ’s underinvestment is minimized by conceding ownership rights to him
or her, while H can still capture all the net surplus from production via ex-ante transfers in the initial
contract.
      In order to generate a nontrivial tradeo¤ between integration and outsourcing, the literature has
followed one of two approaches. A …rst one consists in allowing some of the investments in headquarter
services carried out by H to also be noncontractible. Antràs (2003) and Antràs and Helpman (2004)
consider scenarios in which investments in h are completely noncontractible and are carried out at
t = 2, simultaneously and noncooperatively with the investment in m by the manufacturing plant.
Antràs and Helpman (2008) consider a more general framework with partial contractibility of both
h and m and show that the ratio              O= V    is necessarily increasing in the relative importance of the
noncontractible manufacturing investments, and decreasing in the importance of the noncontractible
headquarter investments. It is then clear that higher headquarter intensity                     continues to a¤ect
negatively the relative pro…tability of outsourcing. Importantly, however, for a high enough , it now
becomes possible for transaction costs to be higher under integration than under outsourcing. The
reason for which integration is no longer a dominated strategy for H is that incomplete contracting
is now generating a double-sided holdup problem and thus it is no longer always optimal to allocate
as much ex-post bargaining power as possible to M . Even though, H can extract rents upfront, it
still needs to make sure that it will have high-powered incentives to invest at t = 2, when those
initial transfers are bygones, and vertical integration provides a way to generate those high-powered
incentives.
      A second way to generate a nontrivial tradeo¤ between integration and outsourcing is to introduce
restrictions on the ability of the …rm to extract rents from M in the ex-ante contract. The literature
often motivates these ex-ante constraints by appealing to …nancial constraints (see Acemoglu et al.,
2007, Basco, 2010, Carluccio and Fally, 2012, Antràs and Chor, 2012), but other interpretations are
possible.51 It is intuitively clear that even when headquarter services are fully contractible, H will not
necessarily want to maximize the ex-post bargaining power of M if by doing so it reduces the share of
surplus it will end up with. Even though ‘…nancial constraints’a¤ect the relative transactions costs of
integration and outsourcing it can again be shown that the ratio                O= V   continues to be increasing in
the relative importance of noncontractible manufacturing investments and decreasing in the relative
importance of noncontractible headquarter services (see Antràs, 2012).

   So far we have focused on studying how the di¤erent parameters of the model shape the decision
of a …rm of how to optimally organize production. In practice, and as discussed in more detail below
in section 7.3, these …rm decisions are rarely observed by researchers, who instead often work with
product-level datasets that aggregate a subset of these …rm decisions into a particular observation.
With that in mind, we next use the model to integrate over these …rm decisions and characterize more
formally the relative prevalence of di¤erent organizational forms within a sector or industry. The
analysis is analogous to that in the vertical FDI model in section 5.3, although matters are now a bit
more involved because H is choosing from four possible organizational modes: domestic outsourcing,
domestic integration, foreign outsourcing and foreign integration.
   A …rst obvious observation, however, is that any form of vertical integration is necessarily a dom-
                                    1
inated strategy whenever                 O   >    V,    given the implied e¢ ciency advantage of outsourcing in that
case and given the lower …xed costs associated with outsourcing relative to integration. In other words,
equilibria with multinational activity are only possible whenever                                   O   is su¢ ciently low relative to    V,
which from our previous discussion requires high levels of headquarter intensity . When integration
is a dominated strategy, the sorting of …rms into organizational forms is analogous to that in Figure 8
in section 5.3, but with the most productive …rms engaging in foreign outsourcing (rather than vertical
FDI) and the least productive …rms (among the active ones) relying on domestic outsourcing.
              1
   When           O   <   V,   much richer sorting patterns can emerge. In particular, the e¤ective mar-
ginal cost is now lower under integration than under outsourcing, but outsourcing continues to be a
strategy associated with lower …xed costs, and thus a subgroup of relatively unproductive …rms might
continue to prefer outsourcing to integration. For certain parameter con…gurations, one can construct
an industry equilibrium in which all four organizational forms coexist in equilibrium, as depicted in
Figure 10. Firms with productivity '                1   below 'D do not produce, those with '                         1   2 'D ; 'DV out-
source domestically, those with '            1   2 'DV ; 'I integrate domestically, those with '                             1   2 'I ; 'IV
outsource abroad, and those with '                 1    > 'IV integrate abroad, i.e., they engage in foreign direct

these regimes in equilibrium, but their ranking by productivity will not be a¤ected.

   Assuming a Pareto distribution of …rm productivity with unbounded support (G(') = 1                       ' '
for ' > '), one can explicitly solve for the relative prevalence of di¤erent organizational modes within
this equilibrium and carry out various comparative statics exercises. To save space, let us focus on the
implications of the model for the relative prevalence of vertical FDI versus o¤shore outsourcing, since
this is an object that has featured prominently in the empirical literature (as discussed in section 7.3
below). There are many ways to measure the relative extent of vertical FDI and o¤shore outsourcing,
but it is simplest to consider the share of o¤shoring …rms (those with '     'I ) that vertically integrate.
Analogous results apply when computing, for instance, the share of imports of m that are transacted
within multinational …rm boundaries, although these formulas become more complicated (see the
Appendix). Manipulating (32), (34), and (35) to solve for the thresholds 'I and 'IV , and plugging
G(') we …nd that the share of o¤shoring …rms that integrate suppliers is given by
                                        0                                                 1          1

   Some interesting comparative statics follow from this expression. First, and rather obviously,
the prevalence of vertical FDI versus o¤shore outsourcing is decreasing in     and      O= V ,   because high
values of these make arm’s-length transacting more appealing. Second, the share NIV = (NIV + NIO ) is
increasing in fragmentation barriers (fIO   fDV and ) and decreasing in the wage gap (wN =wS ). This
result is more subtle because these parameters do not a¤ect directly the relative marginal e¢ ciency
of vertical FDI and foreign outsourcing (compare eq. (32) and (35)). Intuitively, an increase in trade
barriers or a decrease in the wage gap makes o¤shoring of any form relatively less productive, and
will thus generate an extensive margin of trade response by which some …rms will switch from foreign
to domestic sourcing. Inspection of Figure 10 reveals, however, that those switchers are necessarily
engaged in foreign outsourcing, thus generating an increase in the relative prevalence of FDI within the
set of o¤shoring …rms. Third, and unlike in the transaction-cost model above, the relative prevalence
of vertical FDI is increasing in headquarter intensity       . This is for two reasons: because a low
headquarter intensity shifts market share from domestic integrating …rms to o¤shore outsourcing
…rms (the extensive margin of trade e¤ect), and because it also shifts market share from FDI …rms to
o¤shore outsourcers (since   O= V    decreases in ). A fourth unambiguous comparative static relates
to a positive e¤ect of dispersion (a low ) on the relative prevalence of integration: the intuition here
is analogous to that in Helpman et al. (2004), which was discussed in section 4.2.
   Other contributions to the property-rights approach have suggested and formalized alternative
determinants of the organizational form decisions of …rms and of the relative prevalence of vertical FDI
versus o¤shore outsourcing. Antràs and Helpman (2008) emphasize the possibility that improvements
in the contractibility of manufacturing might increase the relative prevalence of FDI rather than of
o¤shore outsourcing, contrary to what transaction-cost models would predict. Acemoglu et al. (2007)
consider an environment in which the headquarters H contract with various suppliers and identify
a positive e¤ect of the degree of technological complementarity across inputs on the internalization
decision of multinational …rms. Antràs and Chor (2012) also consider a multi-supplier environment

                                                  54
and show that when the production process is sequential in nature, H might have di¤erential incentives
to integrate suppliers along the value chain, and thus the “downstreamness” of an input becomes a
determinant of the ownership structure decisions related to that input. Basco (2010) and Carluccio
and Fally (2012) …nd that multinationals are more likely to integrate suppliers located in countries
with poor …nancial institutions, and that the e¤ect of …nancial development should be especially large
when trade involves complex goods. The insights of the property-rights theory have also been applied
to dynamic, general-equilibrium models of international trade with the goal of understanding how
ownership decisions vary along the life-cycle of a product or input (see Antràs, 2005).52

7.3      Empirical Evidence
Empirically testing models of the various determinants of the internalization decision of multinational
…rms poses at least two important challenges. First, data on the internalization decisions of multina-
tional …rms are not readily available. The existing datasets on the operations of multinational …rms
generally contain only limited information on their market transactions, and even less is known about
arm’s-length exchanges that do not involve multinational …rms on either side. A second concern in
testing theories of internalization is that the predictions from these theories are associated with subtle
features of the environment – such as rent dissipation, relationship-speci…city, contractibility, or the
relative intensity of distinct non-contractible, and relationship-speci…c investments –that are generally
unobservable in the data (see Whinston, 2003).
       The empirical literature on multinational …rm boundaries has circumvented the …rst limitation in
two ways. A …rst approach, featuring prominently in the international business literature, consists
in employing unique datasets containing a small sample of internalization decisions of multinational
…rms in certain industries and countries.53 A second empirical approach to the study of multinational
…rm boundaries relies on indirect inference based on o¢ cial import and export merchandise trade
statistics, which in some countries identify whether transactions involve related or non-related parties.
Although most applications of this second approach rely on product- and country-level tests, some
recent contributions have made use of fairly representative …rm-level datasets that contain detailed
information on the sourcing strategies of …rms in di¤erent countries. By their nature, the data are
better suited to testing models of the FDI versus outsourcing decision underlying vertical models of
multinational …rms, than to testing ‘horizontal’models of multinational …rm boundaries.
       Some of the key contributions to this second approach (see Nunn and Tre‡er, 2008, 2012, Bernard et
al., 2010, Antràs and Chor, 2012), have employed the “U.S. Related Party Trade”data collected by the
U.S. Bureau of Customs and Border Protection, and have more speci…cally studied the determinants
of the variation in the share of intra…rm imports in total U.S. imports across products and exporting
countries. Underlying these tests is the notion that if goods in a particular product category originating
from a particular country tend to be exported to the United States within …rm boundaries, then one
  52
     The transaction-cost model has also been applied to dynamic endogenous-growth models of the FDI versus licensing
choice. See Glass and Saggi (2002) for a particular example and Saggi (2002) for a broader review of this literature.
  53
     For instance, Davidson and McFetridge (1984) studied 1,376 internal and arm’s-length transactions involving high-
technology products carried out by 32 U.S.-based multinational enterprises between 1945 and 1975. See also Mans…eld,
Romeo, and Wagner (1979), Mans…eld and Romeo (1980), and Kogut and Zander (1993) for related contributions.



                                                         55
can infer that U.S. …rms in that sector tend to …nd it optimal to internalize purchases of goods from
those countries, or alternatively that …rms in the exporting country choose to internalize their sales
of those goods to the United States. These tests are well grounded in theory, since the new vintage
models of the internalization decision featuring intraindustry heterogeneity deliver predictions about
precisely the determinants of the cross-sectional variation in the share of internalized transactions
within a sector, as illustrated above in section 7.2.
    Even after accepting that the share of intra…rm imports provides a valid empirical proxy for the rel-
ative prevalence of integration and outsourcing in vertical models of internalization, there still remains
the issue of how to proxy for the various determinants of this share, as identi…ed by these models.
This is the second main challenge facing this line of empirical work, as mentioned above. For instance,
one of the central results of the property-rights theory is that the prevalence of integration should be
higher in headquarter intensive sectors, that is, in sectors where noncontractible, relationship-speci…c
investments carried out by headquarters are disproportionately more important than those undertaken
by suppliers. A key question is then: how does one measure headquarter intensity in the data? Similar
di¢ culties arise when considering the measurement of parameters governing the degree of relationship-
speci…city and of contractibility, which were shown above to crucially a¤ect the incentives to integrate
suppliers, and in some cases, di¤erently so in transaction-cost and property-rights model.
    Following Antràs (2003), a widely used proxy of headquarter intensity is a measure of capital
intensity, such as the ratio of physical capital to employment. This approach is justi…ed within
Antràs’ (2003) stylized model, which features two factors of production, physical capital and labor,
and where it is assumed that production of headquarter services is more capital intensive than that
of manufacturing, with all investments in his framework being noncontractible and fully relationship-
speci…c. As pointed out by Nunn and Tre‡er (2012), the latter assumption is unrealistic, since standard
measures of capital intensity instead embody several investments that are fairly easy to contract on
or that are not particularly relationship-speci…c. More speci…cally, one would expect investments
in specialized equipment to be much more relevant for the integration decision than investments in
structures or in non-specialized equipment (such as automobiles or computers), which tend to lose little
value when used outside the intended production process. Measures of R&D intensity, such as the
ratio of R&D expenditures over sales, have also been suggested as appropriate proxies for headquarter
intensity (see for instance, Yeaple, 2006, or Nunn and Tre‡er, 2012), given that these expenditures
tend to be carried out by headquarters (see our Fact Three in section 2) and given that they are hard
to contract on. Finally, and for analogous reasons, skill intensity (the ratio of nonproduction worker to
production worker employment) is sometimes posited as an alternative proxy for headquarter intensity.
    The …rst three columns of Table 5 report the e¤ect of these proxies for headquarter intensity on the
share of U.S. intra…rm imports. The trade dataset is disaggregated at the six-digit NAICS level and
covers the period 2000-2011. Column 1 reports a positive and highly statistically signi…cant correlation
of the intra…rm trade share with R&D intensity, skill intensity and physical capital intensity.54 Column
2 demonstrates that the physical capital intensity e¤ect is explained by spending on equipment and
not structures, while column 3 further disaggregates capital expenditures and shows that the e¤ect of

     See the Appendix for details on the variables used. We add 0.001 to R&D intensity before taking logarithms to avoid
throwing away a large number of observations with zero R&D outlays.

capital equipment is not driven by expenditures on computers and data processing equipment or on
automobiles and trucks, consistently with the …ndings of Nunn and Tre‡er (2012). In column 4, we
further exploit the available variation in the intra…rm import share across source countries and run
the same speci…cation as in column 3 but with country-year …xed e¤ects.

    Put together, the results in columns 1 through 4 of Table 5 demonstrate the existence of a signi…cant
and robust positive relationship between the importance of relatively noncontractible investments by
headquarters and the prevalence of within-…rm import transactions. The literature has generally
interpreted this …nding as an empirical validation of the property-rights model in section 7.2, but one
should be cautious in interpreting these results since these patterns are not necessarily inconsistent
with alternative theories of …rm boundaries, such as the transaction-cost model in section 7.1.B.55
Similarly, the signi…cance of R&D or skill intensity for the integration decision of multinational …rms
could be viewed as a validation of transaction-cost theories that emphasize the importance of the
non-excludable nature of knowledge in shaping multinational …rm boundaries, with intra…rm trade
being simply a manifestation of complex FDI strategies.
    A particularly promising way to discriminate between the property-rights theory of the multina-
tional …rm and alternative theories of …rm boundaries consists in exploiting the implications of the
theory for the e¤ect of contractibility on the share of intra…rm trade. In the property-rights model,
the e¤ect of contractibility on the prevalence of integration depends crucially on the degree to which
contractual incompleteness stems from noncontractibilities in the inputs controlled by the …nal-good
producer or by his or her suppliers. Conversely, in transaction-cost models, any type of improvement
in contractibility would be associated with a lower need to integrate and, in industry equilibrium, with
a lower share of intra…rm imports.
    Column 5 of Table 5 indicates that adding this standard measure of contractibility (in particular,
one minus the Nunn 1997 measure) to the previous empirical model suggests a negative and statistically
signi…cant e¤ect of contractibility on the prevalence of intra…rm trade. Similar results are reported by
Bernard et al. (2010) using an alternative measure of contractibility based on the idea that contracting
is likely to be easier for products passing through intermediaries such as wholesalers. The observed
negative correlation between the share of intra…rm trade and contractibility is intuitively in line with
what one would expect from transaction-cost models of …rm boundaries.
    A caveat of the previous results is that all the industry controls are constructed using data related
to the selling industry, i.e., of the good or sector being imported into the United States. In assessing
the e¤ects of headquarter intensity this may be problematic when the headquarters are based in the
U.S. and import intermediate inputs under an industry classi…cation di¤erent from their main line of
business. In such a case, a more appropriate approach is to construct measures of headquarter intensity
of the buying industry. Unfortunately, the U.S. Census Related Party data, and publicly available trade
statistics more generally, do not contain information on the industry classi…cation of the importer.
Antràs and Chor (2012) compute instead measures of headquarter intensity of the average buying
industry using interindustry ‡ow data from the U.S. input-output data. The exact same approach
can also be used to construct measures of the (Nunn) contractibility of the average buyer of U.S.
imports of particular goods. Column 6 of Table 5 reports the e¤ects of buyer headquarter intensity
as well as buyer and seller contractibility on the share of intra…rm imports. Comparing the results
  55
     In section 7.1.B, we emphasized that a higher value of reduces the level of transaction costs (i.e., increases O )
and thus makes FDI less appealing relative to foreign outsourcing. But with intraindustry heterogeneity, the extensive
margin e¤ect illustrated in Figure 10 would apply also in a transaction-cost model and a higher would shrink the set
of …rms outsourcing abroad, thereby increasing the relative prevalence of FDI on this account. The balance of these two
e¤ects is generally ambiguous.


                                                          58
in columns 5 and 6, it is clear that the distinction between buyer versus seller headquarter intensity
has little e¤ect on the estimates –only the e¤ect of skill intensity is signi…cantly a¤ected –, while the
distinction between buyer and seller contractibility turns out to matter much more. In particular, the
coe¢ cient estimates imply a negative and statistically signi…cant e¤ect of buyer contractibility and a
positive and signi…cant e¤ect of seller contractibility. These results very much resonate with the subtle
predictions of the property-rights model of Antràs and Helpman (2008), while they are inconsistent
with the unambiguously negative e¤ects of contractibility on integration predicted by transaction-cost
models.
    Our discussion above regarding the e¤ects of buyer headquarter intensity and buyer versus seller
contractibility relied on an interpretation of U.S. intra…rm imports as being associated with U.S.
headquarters importing goods from foreign suppliers, integrated or not. An important share of these
imports, however, consist of shipments from foreign headquarters to their U.S. a¢ liates or to U.S.
una¢ liated parties, in which case the results in column 6 are harder to interpret. For these reasons,
in column 7 we follow Nunn and Tre‡er (2008) in checking the robustness of our results to a restricted
sample that better …ts the spirit of the vertical models developed above. More speci…cally, our re-
stricted sample regressions only include countries from which at least two-thirds of intra…rm U.S.
imports reach parent …rms in the U.S. (Nunn and Tre‡er, 2008, Table 5), while an industry category
is included only if it contains an intermediate input product according to the categorization of Wright
(2010). Although these corrections reduce our sample size in column 7 by about 60%, the results are
remarkably similar to those in column 6, both qualitatively and quantitatively.
    The vertical models of …rm boundaries developed above generate further predictions for the relative
prevalence of FDI versus foreign outsourcing. For instance, the property-rights models delivered a
positive association of the share of intra…rm trade with trade barriers and productivity dispersion,
and a negative association with the wage gap (wN =wS ). Column 8 reports the e¤ect of (buyer)
productivity dispersion, freight costs and U.S. tari¤s on the share of intra…rm trade. As is clear,
productivity dispersion indeed has a positive e¤ect on the share of intra…rm trade, but the e¤ect is
statistically weak. Conversely, we …nd that trade costs, natural or man-made, have a negative and
statistically signi…cant e¤ect on the share of intra…rm trade, a result that is inconsistent with the
models developed in this section. Later in this section, we will revisit this issue and will provide a
potential explanation for this …nding.56 As for the negative e¤ect of relative wages, the prediction has
found some indirect support from regressions that exploit the cross-country variation in the data and
have shown a positive e¤ect of a country’s aggregate capital-labor ratio on the intra…rm trade share
(see Antràs, 2003, Bernard et al., 2010). These cross-country speci…cations have also unveiled a robust
positive e¤ect of the quality of institutions on the share of intra…rm U.S. imports, a counterintuitive
result from the point of view of transaction-cost theories. Of course, the standard concerns associated
with cross-country regressions (omitted variable bias, endogeneity, etc.) apply here as well, so one
should be cautious in interpreting these correlations as necessarily falsifying certain models.
  56
     Díez (2010) …nds instead a positive correlation between the prevalence of intra…rm trade and U.S. tari¤s when working
with the more disaggregated six-digit HS data, and when introducing two-digit HS …xed e¤ects into the estimation. He
also …nds a negative correlation between U.S. intra…rm imports and foreign tari¤s and shows that it can be reconciled
with a variant of the Antràs and Helpman (2004) framework.

    Due to data availability, the bulk of work using product-level data to test the theory of multinational
…rm boundaries has employed U.S. intra…rm import data. Feenstra and Hanson (2005) and Fernandes
and Tang (2010) are two notable exceptions that instead use product-level export data from the
Customs General Administration of the People’s Republic of China, containing detailed information
on whether the exporter is a foreign-owned plant or not.
    Recent contributions to the empirical literature on multinational …rm boundaries have made use of
a few available datasets that include …rm-level information on the sourcing strategies of …rms. Because
models of the internalization decision are essentially models of …rm behavior, …rm-level data are an
ideal laboratory to use in testing it certain aspects of the models. A notable example of this is the
sorting pattern in Figure 10, which is key to some of the predictions of these models. There is fairly
robust evidence that …rms engaging in foreign vertical integration (FDI) appear to be more productive
than …rms undertaking foreign outsourcing with no FDI (see Tomiura, 2007, for Japan, Corcos et al.,
2012, for France, and Kohler and Smolka, 2009, for Spain).57 An interesting feature of the Spanish
ESEE (Encuesta sobre Estrategias Empresariales) database is that it contains information on both
the domestic and foreign sourcing strategies of …rms in Spain, thus permitting a fuller evaluation of
the empirical relevance of the sorting pattern in Figure 10, which compares domestic outsourcing,
domestic integration, foreign outsourcing and foreign integration. The probability density functions in
Figure 11 indicate that, consistently with Figure 10, domestic outsourcers are (on average) the least
productive …rms, while foreign integrators are (on average) the most productive …rms. The relative
ranking of domestic integrating …rms and foreign outsourcing …rms is instead inconsistent with the
model, and suggests that exploring the implications of a reverse ranking between these two modes is
worthwhile, as it may as well help rationalize the negative e¤ects of trade frictions on intra…rm trade
shares unveiled by Table 5.58




                                   Figure 11: Organizational Sorting in Spain

    Another appealing feature of accessing …rm-level data is that they open the door for alternative
  57
     Defever and Toubal (2007) showed that in French data, the productivity advantage of FDI …rms over foreign out-
sourcers in a given market is reversed in some sectors, but their results are based on a sample of multinational …rms, and
thus selection biases may complicate the interpretation of their results (see Corcos et al., 2012).
  58
     Intuitively, given the sorting pattern suggested in Figure 12, a reduction in trade frictions will not only lead some
marginal …rms to shift to foreign outsourcing, but might also lead some particularly productive domestic integrating
…rms to switch to vertical FDI, and on that account increasing the share of intra…rm trade.

ways to discriminate between models of the internalization decision by separately identifying the e¤ect
of certain variables on the intensive and extensive margin of o¤shoring (see Corcos et al., 2012, for a
recent attempt along these lines).


8    Conclusion
This chapter has reviewed the state of the international trade literature on multinational …rms. We
have addressed to varying degrees the answers that the literature provides to three central questions.
Why do some …rms become multinational? Where do these …rms choose to locate production? And,
why do …rms own foreign a¢ liates rather than contract with external providers? In our exposition
of the main theoretical contributions of the literature, we have adapted focal models so that they …t
within a single organizing framework. It is our hope that the use of consistent tools and notation
across models will allow researchers to more easily tease out what is common and, more importantly,
what is di¤erent about the various approaches. With respect to the empirics, we have reestimated the
econometric models of a few in‡uential papers using the latest available data.
    In reviewing a large and diverse literature one is forced to make hard decisions concerning the
scope of the coverage. In the case of this chapter, we have faced not only page constraints, but also
constraints imposed by our determination to stick to a single organizational principle. For instance, our
decision to focus on monopolistically competitive models has meant that we have entirely abstracted
from research on certain strategic aspects of multinational production associated with the oligopolistic
nature of certain industries in which multinational …rms are pervasive. As another example, because
the benchmark framework of section 3 was built on the assumption of CES preferences, we have
omitted promising recent research on the role of nonhomothetic preferences in multinational activity.
Finally, we have developed models in which capital is immobile across countries and have thus not
explored the interactions between multinational activity and FDI ‡ows, an area of utmost importance
that has not been much explored in the literature.

A     Theory Appendix: Proofs of Some Results
A.1 Horizontal FDI Model with Asymmetric Countries in Section 4.1.B
In this Appendix, we provide a more complete characterization of the variant of the Markusen and Venables
(2000) paper we have developed in section 4.1.B.


Likelihood of Equilibrium without Multinational Firms
In the main text, we have shown that for a Krugman-style equilibrium with only exporting (and no MNE
activity) to exist, it needs to be the case that

                         wH            1        wH                            1        wH
                         wF                     wF
                                                                 +                     wF                         1
                                                                                               fD + fE                +1
                                                                                                         <                 .   (38)
                                           wH
                                                +1 (             1       1)                   fD + 21 fE              1
                                           wF


     The fact that a higher fD =fE makes it easier for condition (38) to hold is obvious. The negative e¤ect of
on the likelihood of a pure exporting equilibrium, can be veri…ed by direct (though cumbersome) di¤erentiation.
In particular, note that the right-hand-side of (38) is obviously decreasing in , while the left-hand-side is
increasing in provided that (!        1) (!    !) > 0, where ! wH =wF , which is true unless ! = 1, in which
case the derivative is 0.
     We next show that the left-hand-side of (38) attains a unique maximum at !           wH =wF = 1, and thus
the likelihood of a no-MNE equilibrium is lowest when wH =wF = 1. We can write the relevant terms in the
left-hand-side of (38) as
                                                 1               1
                                           !         !    +          !
                                                                        .
                                                     (! + 1)
Taking the derivative of this function with respect to !; and rearranging we obtain

                               1                     1
                          !(       ! )+                  !
                     @             (!+1)                                  1       !2     (     1) + ! 1        ! 2(   1)
                                                                     =                                2
                                       @!                                                    (! + 1) !

Notice that this derivative is 0 when ! = 1, while it is positive when ! < 1 and negative when ! > 1. Thus
! = 1 is the unique global maximum.


Relative Wages in Equilibrium without Multinational Firms
In the main text, we have claimed that if size di¤erences between Home and Foreign are su¢ ciently large (i.e.,
LH =LF > ), then the relative wage at Home will be large enough to ensure that (38) holds and the equilibrium
                                                 1
is one with pure exporting (provided that            1 > 2fD =fE ). To see this, notice that we can write the
                                             H     F
equation pinning down relative wages ! w =w in Krugman (1980) as

                                           LH                1                     LH                 1
                                                                 +1=!                 + ( !)              ,                    (39)
                                           LF    !                                 LF

Now straightforward di¤erentiation indicates that

                                           LH            1                        LH              1
                                   @       LF    !           +1          !        LF
                                                                                       + 1 ( !)
                                                                                                          <0
                                                                         @!




                                                                          68
while it is also the case that

                                       LH          1                    LH                 1
                                   @   LF    !         +1          !    LF
                                                                              + 1 ( !)
                                                                                                   > 0,
                                                           @ (LH =LF )

                     1
as long as ! <           . But note that we can write the equilibrium condition (39) as

                                                   1               LH 1                1
                                       ! ( )                1=        !                    !   ,
                                                                   LF
                                                                      1
and thus for the right-hand-side to be positive, indeed ! <             is required. This proves that not only is
the wage higher in the larger country, but the relative wage is actually monotonically increasing in relative size
(LH =LF ) of the larger country (a result not proven in Krugman, 1980).
    From this last displayed equation, we see also that as LH =LF ! 1, it must be the case that       1
                                                                                                          ! !0
                (   1)=
and thus ! !            . Plugging this value in the left-hand-side of condition (38) reduces to

                                                       (     1)=               2fD
                                                                        1<         ,
                                                                                fE

and thus as long as this inequality holds, the equilibrium features exporting for a su¢ ciently large relative size
                                                                           1
of Home, as stated in footnote 16 of the main text. When instead               1 > 2fD =fE , it follows that the
equilibrium features some form of MNE activity for all LH =LF > 0.

   We next brie‡y sketch the equilibrium conditions for alternative candidate equilibria with MNE activity
and we next assess whether we can rule out the existence of some of those equilibria.


Equilibrium with Pure MNE Activity (No Exporting)
Consider …rst an equilibrium without exporting …rms. Notice that if there is no trade, multinationals need to
break even in each market, which implies

                                       1          wH                          1
                                                            qH         =        fE wH + fD wH
                                             '(        1)                     2
                                       1          wF                          1
                                                            qF         =        fE w F + fD w F
                                             '(        1)                     2

and thus,
                                                                               1
                                            qH = qF = (                1) '      fE + fD .
                                                                               2
    Nevertheless, this is only consistent with the labor-markets conditions

                                                  1                           qH
                                            m       fE + fD            +m          = LH
                                                  2                            '
                                                  1                           qF

                                                  2                            '

whenever LH = LF (m denotes the measure of multinational …rms). In sum, for LH > LF any equilibrium must

Equilibrium with MNEs and Exporters in Both Countries
As shown above, an equilibrium in which multinationals and Home and Foreign exporters all break even can
only exist if condition (38) holds with equality or

                              !            !            +                !    fD + fE                  +1
                                                                                        =                   ,          (40)
                                      (! + 1) (            1    1)           fD + 12 fE                1



where remember that ! wH =wF . It is clear that this condition pins down the relative wage ! as a function
of parameters independently of the relative size of the two countries LH =LF .
    Of course, for this equilibrium to exist, it is necessary to …nd a positive measure of multinational …rms m > 0
and positive measures of Home and Foreign exporters (nH > 0 and nF > 0, respectively) consistent with labor-
market clearing in each country. Following standard derivations in CES-demand models, these labor-market
conditions can be written as

                     1                 (          1)           LH
                 m     fE + fD    +m                                                         + nH (fE + fD )    = LH   (41)
                     2                                 m + nH + nF           1   !       1

                     1                    (       1)                 LF
                 m     fE + fD    +m                                                         + nF (fE + fD )    = LF   (42)
                     2                                 m+      nF   + nH     1   !1

Finally, we need only impose the free-entry condition for one type of …rm, for instance, multinational …rms

             1           !LH                           1               LF                                       1
                                                   +                                              = (! + 1) fD + fE    (43)
                 m + nH + nF      1   !       1                m + nF + nH           1       !1                 2

    In sum, m, nH and nF are jointly determined by equations (41) through (43), with ! being determined by
(40). We just need to make sure that LH and LF are such that an equilibrium with m > 0, nH > 0 and nF > 0
exists. But it is easy to construct numerical examples in which such an equilibrium exists.


Equilibrium with MNEs and Exporters only in “the Large” Home
This type of equilbrium is identical to the one above except for the fact that it sets nF = 0, while equation
(40) does not apply any more since it was derived assuming that Foreign exporters break even. In sum, we
are left with three equations – (41) through (43) with nF = 0 – pinning down m, nH and !. Again, it is
straightforward to construct numerical examples in which such an equilibrium exists and they appear to exist
for small di¤erences in relative size, or LH =LF close to one.


Equilibrium with MNEs and Exporters only in “the Small” Foreign
This type of equilbrium is analogous to the one above except for the fact that it sets nH = 0, while equation
(40) does not apply any more since it was derived assuming that Home exporters break even. We are thus left
with three equations – (41) through (43) with nH = 0 – pinning down m, nF and !. We have been unable to
generate a numerical example in which this equilibrium exists.


A.2 Variant of the Feenstra and Hanson (1996) model in Section 5.2
Here we show that in the variant of the Feenstra and Hanson (1996) model we developed in section 5.2 an
increase in the range of inputs o¤shored to Foreign increases wage inequality in Foreign. The fact that such a
shift increases wage inequality at Home can be shown similarly (in fact, it is much simpler to show).
    In the absence of factor price equalization, the North will specialize in all task with s > s , while the
unskilled-labor abundant South will specialize in the stages s   s . Furthermore, the outside good uses only

unchanged, will necessarily lead to an increase in Foreign wage inequality ( F ).

and thus @ ln@ O is no lower than that same derivative evaluated at = 0.
     Finally, when evaluated at = = 0, it is easily veri…ed that @ ln@ O = 0 from which we can conclude that
@ ln O
   @    > 0 for > 0 or > 0, as stated in the main text.

A.4 Property-Rights Model in Section 7.2
We claimed in the main text that the relative pro…tability of outsourcing versus integration as measured by the
ratio (see eq. (36))

                                                                                           (   1)(1     )                      (1          )(     1)

was decreasing in headquarter intensity . This can be proved via cumbersome di¤erentiation, but it su¢ ces
to show that it is a particular case of the more general results in Antràs and Helpman (2008). In particular,
equation (36) corresponds to the case in Antràs and Helpman (2008) in which headquarters are fully contractible
(or h = 1 in their notation), while manufacturing of components is fully noncontractible (or m = 0 in their
notation). For general h 2 [0; 1] and m 2 [0; 1], Antràs and Helpman (2008) show that O = V is decreasing
in headquarter intensity, so the same must be true in this particular case.
    In this same section, we later claimed that, instead of using the share of o¤shoring …rms engaged in FDI
as a measure of the relative prevalence of FDI versus foreign outsourcing, we could have instead used the share
of imports of manufacturing inputs that are transacted within multinational …rrm boundaries. To see this, let
us …rst compute the volume of manufacturing inputs produced in foreign insourcing and foreign outsourcing
relationships. These are given by a fraction ( 1) (1       O ) (1   ) of revenues in an outsourcing relationship
               (   1)
and a fraction        (1   V ) (1   ) in a vertical FDI relationship. Furthermore, as is well-known revenues are
  times higher than operating pro…ts, so from equations (32) and (35) in the main text, we have that

                                    (           1)                                                                        1            1

and
                                        (            1)                                                                        1           1

Integrating over all …rms choosing one strategy or the other and taking the ratio, we have that the share of
imports of manufacturing inputs that are transacted within multinational …rm boundaries is

This expression is more cumbersome than equation (37) in the main text but it continues to be decreasing in
    1
      O = V , wN = wS and , from which the main comparative statics in the main text were derived.
    We have assumed that imported inputs are valued at marginal cost consistently with the notion that the
…nal-good producer captures all the surplus ex-ante via a lump-sum transfer. It is straightforward to show,
however, that even if we were to relate the volume of inputs to the ex-post payo¤ obtained by suppliers, the
same comparative statics would continue to apply since those payments would still be proportional to sale
revenue.

B     Data Appendix: Data Sources for Tables 3-5
B.1 Table 3
This section describes the data used to generate the coe¢ cient estimates provided in Table 3 of the text. Variable
names as they appear in Table 3 are shown in parentheses.

    A¢ liate Sales (AS): For 1989 and 2009, a¢ liate sales data refers to the aggregate sales by U.S. a¢ liates
by host country and by main-line-of-business to customers located in the host country market. For robustness
checks, the a¢ liate sales data are corrected for the fact that some a¢ liates import goods from the United States.
This netting was done by multiplying local a¢ liate sales by one minus the ratio of aggregate a¢ liate imports
from the United States to the aggregate total sales of the a¢ liates where aggregation is by host country and by
main-line-of-business of the a¢ liate. To access this data, a research must become an unpaid sworn employee of
the BEA.

    U.S. Exports (Exports): For 2009, U.S. export data was downloaded from the US Census Bureau Related-
Party Trade Database (url: http://sasweb.ssd.census.gov/relatedparty/) from NAICS classi…cations. The data
was then aggregated to BEA NAICS-based industrial classi…cations. For 1989, U.S. export data was downloaded
from the website of Peter Schott (url: http://faculty.som.yale.edu/peterschott/sub_international.htm). See
Schott (2010) for details.

    Freight Costs (Freight): Freight costs are calculated using following Brainard (1997) using U.S. import
data. For year t and industry i, freight costs are measured as

                                                      CIFt i
                                                 ln             ;
                                                      F OBt;i

where CIFt i is the customs value of U.S. imports plus freight and insurance charges for year t and industry i
and F OBt;i is the freight on board value of U.S. imports in year t and industry i. The data were downloaded
from Peter Schott’s website. See Schott (2010) for further documentation. Data for 2005 were used for the 2009
regressions. Data for 1989 were used for the 1989 regression. For both years, some aggregation over industries
was necessary to BEA classi…cations. Aggregation involved only simple summations over the raw data.

    Tari¤ Levels (Tari¤s): Tari¤ data are applied tari¤s from the World Integrated Trade Solution (WITS)
database maintained by the World Bank. The data was downloaded (url: http://wits.worldbank.org/wits/) at
the NAICS 4-digit level and then concorded into the more aggregate BEA naics-based system. When aggregation
was necessary (such as when the BEA industry classi…cation was at the 3 rather than 4 digit level), the simple
average of the less aggregated data were used. For 1989, the data was downloaded using SIC based industry
classi…cations to ease concordance to BEA SIC-based industrial classi…cations. To avoid dropping observations
where tari¤s are zero (due to the fact that all data enter into the regressions in logarithms), one was added to
each observation.

    Endowment Di¤erences: Real GDP per worker in 2005 dollars (GDP/POP) was downloaded from the
Penn World Tables, V 7.1 (url: https://pwt.sas.upenn.edu/php_site/pwt71/pwt71_form_test.php), where the
variable name in that dataset is rgdpwok. It is calculated as

                       GDP=P OPi;t = ln(jrgdpwokU S;t        rgdpwoki;t j), t 2 f1989; 2009g

The measure of human capital endowment di¤erences across countries (School) is derived from the average
years of education downloaded from the Barro-Lee dataset (url: http://www.barrolee.com/data/dataexp.htm).
If EDyri is the average years of education in country i for 2005, the variable used in the regressions is de…ned



                                                        74
as
                                       Schooli = ln(jEDyrU S      EDyri j)

The capital to labor ratio (KL) is taken from Penn World Tables V7.1 for the year 2008. The variable is
calculated as

                                       KLi = ln(jKAP WU S       KAP Wi j),

where KAP Wi is the capital to worker ratio for 2005.

    Market Size: Market size was measured as the logarithm of real GDP (GDP). This data is constructed
from the Penn World Tables, V 7.1, at the natural logarithm of the product of real GDP per capita, CGDP ,
and population, P OP .

    Scale Economies: Plant scale economies (PlantSC) are measured as the average number of production
worker employees per establishments in the United States. Corporate Scale Economies (CorpSC) was mea-
sured as the average number of non-production workers per U.S. based …rm. In both cases, data for the 2009
regressions are from the Census of Manufacturing, 2007. For the 1989 regression, the data is from the Census
of Manufacturing 1992.

    The following are control variables that were included in the regressions but their coe¢ cients were suppressed
in Table 3.

    Investment Protection: Index of protection of foreign investors from expropriation or discriminary poli-
cies by country that is based on surveys of large corporations. Source: World Competitiveness Report (1996)

    Trade Openness: Index of openness to international trade by country that is based on surveys of large
corporations. Source: World Competitiveness Report (1996)

    Political Stability: Variance in political stability across country was measured using an index downloaded
from the International Country Risk Guide (url: http://www.prsgroup.com/countrydata.aspx).


B.2 Table 4
With the exception of the following variables all of the variables used to obtain the coe¢ cient estimates in Table
4 are the same as those used in the 2009 regressions that generated Table 3.

    Skill Intensity (Skillint): The skill intensity of an industry is measured as in Yeaple (2003a). It is the
cost share of non-production workers, which is calculated as wage bill of non-production workers by industry
(total wages - production worker wages) divided by total value-added by industry. The data were obtained from
the Annual Survey of Manufacturers data for the year 2009.

    Skill Endowment (Skillend): The skill endowment of a country was measured using the human capital
per worker variable calculated by Hall and Jones (1999). These data can be downloaded from Chad Jones’
website at http://www.stanford.edu/~chadj/datasets.html.


B.3 Table 5
Intra…rm import share: From the U.S. Census Bureau’s Related Party Trade Database, for the years 2000-
2011 (available at http://sasweb.ssd.census.gov/relatedparty/). For columns I through V, we use the data at the
original six-digit NAICS industry level. For the “Buyer”regressions in columns VI through VIII we follow Antràs
and Chor (2012) in mapping these NAICS codes to six-digit IO2002 industry codes using the correspondence
provided by the Bureau Economic Analysis (BEA) as a supplement to the 2002 U.S. Input-Output (I-O) Tables.



                                                        75
The share of intra…rm imports was calculated for each industry-year or country-industry-year as: (Related
Trade)/(Related Trade + Non-Related Trade).
    R&D intensity: From Nunn and Tre‡er (2011), who calculated R&D expenditures to total sales using
the sample of U.S. …rms in the Orbis dataset. We added 0.001 to R&D intensity before taking logarithms to
avoid throwing away a large number of observations with zero R&D outlays, while we dropped observations
for which R&D expenditures exceeded sales. The R&D intensity for each NAICS industry in columns I-V was
then calculated as the weighted average value of log(0:001 + R&D=Sales) over the years 2000-2006. Following
Antràs and Chor (2012), the R&D intensity for the average buyer in columns VI-VIII was calculated by taking
a weighted average over the years 2000-2005 of the R&D intensity of the industries that purchase the input in
question, with weights equal to these input purchase values as reported in the 2002 U.S. I-O Tables.
    Skill Intensity: From the NBER-CES Manufacturing Industry Database (Becker and Gray, 2009). Skill
intensity is the log of the number of non-production workers divided by total employment. A simple average of
the annual values from 2000-2005 was taken to obtain the seller industry measure of skill intensity in columns
I-V. For the buyer skill intensity measure in columns VI-VIII we followed the same procedure as for the R&D
intensity measure.
    Capital Intensity: All the capital intensity measures (Buildings, Equipment, Autos, Computers, and
Other Equipment, all divided by total employment) were taken from the Annual Survey of Manufactures (url
http://www.census.gov/manufacturing/asm/), where they are available at the NAICS level (but at a slightly
less disaggregated level than the skill intensity measure taken from the NBER-CES data). A simple average
of the annual values from 2002-2010 was taken to obtain the seller industry measures of capital intensity in
columns I-V. For the buyer capital intensity measures in columns VI-VIII we followed the same procedure as
for the R&D intensity measure.
    Contractibility: Computed as in Antràs and Chor (2012) from the 2002 U.S. I-O Tables, following the
methodology of Nunn (2007). For each IO2002 industry, we …rst calculated the fraction of HS10 constituent
codes classi…ed by Rauch (1999) as neither reference-priced nor traded on an organized exchange, under Rauch’s
“liberal” classi…cation. (The original Rauch classi…cation was for SITC Rev. 2 products; these were associated
with HS10 codes using a mapping derived from U.S. imports in Feenstra et al. (2002).) We took one minus this
value as a measure of the own contractibility of each IO2002 industry. The average buyer contractibility was
then calculated using the same procedure described for computing the average buyer R&D intensity.
    Dispersion: From Nunn and Tre‡er (2008), who constructed dispersion for each HS6 code as the standard
deviation of log exports for its HS10 sub-codes across U.S. port locations and destination countries in the year
2000, from U.S. Department of Commerce data. The dispersion for the average buyer was then calculated using
the same procedure described for the R&D intensity measure.
    Freight Costs and Tari¤s: Freight costs data were downloaded at the NAICS level from Peter Schott’s
website (see Schott, 2010, for further documentation). These were concorded to IO2002 industries as described
above for the share of intra…rm trade. Tari¤ data are applied tari¤s from the World Integrated Trade Solution
(WITS) database maintained by the World Bank. The data was downloaded (url: http://wits.worldbank.org/wits/).
Tari¤s were concorded directly from HS 6-digit level to IO2002 level (rather than HS to NAICS then to IO2002).
