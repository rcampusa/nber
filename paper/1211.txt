                    Automobile Prices and Quality:
    Did the Gasoline Price Increase Change Consumer Tastes in the U.S.?


                               ABSTRACT



        Did the 1973 and 1979 gasoline price rises change consumer views
about the relative quality of different cars? This question is investigated
by testing the null hypothesis that imputed characteristic prices have re-
mained constant over time. A hedonic model that takes gasoline costs into
account is developed and some of its theoretical implications are outlined.
The statistical methods required for its estimation and for the testing of
the particular null hypothesis are discussed and then used to analyze the
prices of U.S. passenger cars in the used market during 1970—1981. If one
does not take &asoline costs into account in such computations one must con-
clude that consumers changed their relative evaluations of car qualities
significantly in both periods: October 1973 to April 1974 and April to October
1979. However, when gasoline efficiency terms are included in the model, the
estimated relative qualities are much more stable over time, with no period
showing significant changes, and it is possible to maintain the "constancy of
tastes" assumption. Since the main model adjusts not only for the effect of
gasoline price increases but also for the effects of changes in other prices
and income, we develop two alternative approaches which adjust solely for the
increase in gasoline prices. Applying these to the 1979 period we find that
a significant fraction of the coefficient change that did occur during this
period can be attributed to the gasoline price increase alone, indicating
that this is indeed a major component of what happened.

I.   Introduction

           The energy crises of 1973 and 1979 and the associated increases

in gasoline prices (see table 1) caused consumers to change their demand

for automobiles and automotile manufacturers to adjust their products and

prices to these changes. These events affected all the major dimensions

of this market: (1) in the quantity dimension the market share of small

cars increased relative to that of the large ones; (2) the price of small

cars increased relative to that of large cars and the imputed characteris-

tic prices (of weight, engine displacement, and gasoline miles per gallon)

changed; and, (3) so did also the various automobile qualities: there

occurred a downsizing in terms of length, weight, and horsepower, and an

increase in gasoline efficiency.

           While most analyses of these events start   from the quantity

dimension, looking usually at changes in quantities demanded or market

shares [e.g. Carison (1978), Greenlees (1979), Boyd and Meliman (1980)],

a growing body of literature has recently taken the dual point of view

and looked primarily at prices [Kahn (1981), Daly and Mayor (1983), Gordon

(1983), Berndt (1983)]. We join this line of research but ask a somewhat

different question, using a different model and different statistical
           1
methods.

           We use the hedonic hypothesis that automobile prices are a function

of their characteristics, estimate the imputed prices of such characteristics

and examine the effect of the gasoline price increases on them. Since the

estimated quality of a car is the sum of the products of such imputed prices

with their respective characteristic levels, we shall be analyzing how changes

in gasoline prices affected the perceived qualities of different automobiles.
                                    —2—




         The used car market is our source of information. In the used

 car market quantities are fixed (more or less) and prices are determined

 primarily by consumer demand and can therefore be assumed to reflect

 current consumer tastes and price expectations. In contrast, new car

 prices are set by the manufacturers and need not be consistent, ex post,

 with the way consumers actually value the different models.

         While one may think that consumers changed their notions of

 "quality," shifting their tastes towards smaller cars as the result of

 the two energy crises because small cars are more fuel efficient (as

measured by miles per gallon which we abbreviate as MPG), this is not

necessarily so. Because the amount of gasoline used does not enter the

utility function directly but only through the budget constraint, it is

possible that relative quality valuations did not change during the

the energy crises once gasoline costs are accounted for appropriately.

The main purpose of this paper is to examine this possibfity empirically.

        If we define the full price of an automobile as the sum of its mar-

ket price and the (gasoline) cost of operating it, we can restate the previous

paragraph as follows: the energy crises may have increased the price of small

cars relative to the price of large cars without changing much their relative

full prices.3

        Since imputed characteristics prices depend on consumer tastes (as

well as on other factors), if we could show that correctly defined and

measured these prices did not change, we could maintain the hypothesis that
                                    —3—




 the underlying consumer preference structure did not change after all.

         The hypothesis of no change in consumer taste is important for

economic- analysis, especially for comparative statics of consumer behavior.

Hirshielfer (1976, p. 11) illustrates it by noting that when economists try

to explain the effect of a tax on the demand for liquor, they "will almost

automatically assume that the desire to drink is just as great (that is,

preferences do not change by the imposition of-tax) ——   only   that the tax

makes it more expensive to indulge that desire (that is, tax (or higher

price of liquor) affects budget constraint)." Economists cannot use their

theoretical models and empirical estimates to explain the effects of such

changes as the imposition of atax or a gasoline price increase if consumer

preferences change in an unknown manner.

        If the cost of gasoline is not taken into account, we expect to

observe large changes in the imputed prices, of automobile characteristics

and ip the estimated relative quality of different cars. We would like to

know if these changes stopped soon after the oil price shocks were over. If

this were the case, we could say that U.S. consumers adjusted their

evaluation of quality differences rather quickly to the gasoline price

        The rest of the paper is organized as follows: First (section II)

we outline Qur 'theoretical framework, restate the hedonic approach, and

outline our estimation procedure.   Next we describe our data (section

III) and present our main empirical results (section IV).   Brief    conclusions

(section' V) close the paper.

 II. Model, Implications and Statistical Method


          The hedonic approach [augh (1928), Court (1939), Griliches (1961)]

 assumes that complex commodity prices are a function of their quality

 characteristics and estimates the imputed prices of such characteristics

by regressing the prices of different commodity models on their charactcr-r

istic levels. Muellbauer (1974), Lucas (1975) and Ohta (1980) show that

the hedonic hypothesis can be based on Lancaster's (1971) consumer choice

theory.

          To make clear the distinction between characteristics that enter

the utility function and those that enter only the budget constraint we

start with a simple one—period model of consumer behavior. Suppose that

there are only two kinds of goods, automobiles and other goods. Let

    yi, y2, ...,    y)    be a vector of automobile performance characteristics

such as speed, roominess, comfort, handling, etc. Let x
                                                               (x1, x2, ...,   x)
be a vector of physical characteristics such as weight, length, horsepower,

etc. In general we expect y rather than x to enter the consumer's

utility function. But since y can be thought of as a function of x

(which is the two—stage hypothesis of Ohta—Criliches, 1976), and if this

function is stable over the period of observation we can write the utility

function as u =    u(x,   K, z), where K is the number of miles driven and

z is the quantity of other goods.

       We assume that the consumer buys only one car and that he has to

choose among a number of different car models. Then he is faced with the

following maximization problem:
                                                                   —5—




                    Max                               uu(x,K,z)

                                                                         p •K
                    subject to                        P(x, MIPG) + —- +                   =   in




where     P(x, MPG) is the price of a car with characteristics x =                                              (x.)
and fuel efficiency (miles per gallon) MPG, Pg is the price of gasoline

per gallon, p                      is the price of other goods and                   in   is       the consumer's

income.             PgK/MPG is then the gasoline cost of driving the car for K

miles.5

               Letting A be a Lagrange multiplier, the first order conditions

for this maximization problem are as follows:



                    u           — AP        = 0           (i =   1, 2, ..., n)

        To implement this model empirically we shall have to assume that

all the square and cross—product terms vanish. We have tested this

assumption partially                      and it is supported by the data for

the square terms but not for the cross—product ones. Nevertheless, since

we shall be analyzing the data as a system of equations, treating each

half—yearly observation as a separate equation, we had to pare down our

model further to make it operational. Hence we replace (2) by



          P(x, MPG)         x. + s/MPG                               (5)

        The imputed price of characteristic i(ci.) is its marginal utility

in terms of the nurneraire commodity z     .   Note that since the cost of

gasoline enters only the budget constraint and not the utility function

does not depend directly on the utility function but only indirectly through

K.


        In market equilibrium cx'   and        are determined by demand for and

supply of various models of used cars. Moreover, they will change over time

to satisfy equation (5) which indicates that        cx'   and   are related

to Pg     x, z, K and the form of the utility function. Equation (1) in-

dicates, in turn, that x, z and K are functions of Pg            m   and the
                                           —8--




 form of P(x, MPG). So,        CL'   and      depend on p , p    ,   m   and on

 consumer tastes.

             If tastes change then the relative values of a's should change.

 One of the purposes of this paper is to test the null hypothesis of the

 constancy of the relative values of the a's. But even if this hypothesis is

 rejected, this does not necessarily imply that consumers tastes did in

 fact change, since the a's depend not only on the form of the utility

 function but also on the level of x.

             Looking at (5) we see that the market price of a car is equal

 to its benefit minus cost, where benefit is the money value of the services

 it produces (     atx.)   and cost is the cost of operation (in this case just

 the cost of gasoline
                                 Pg•K/MPG)•
             Equation (5) can be rewritten as


              P(x, MPG)   + Pg•K/MPC = a x1                                (6)




The   left   hand side is the sum of the market price of a car and the gasoline

cost of operating it. Following the terminology of household production

theory (Becker, 1965), this sum is interpreted as the full price of the

car. The above equation shows that the full price of a car can be estimated

by a weighted sum of its characteristics (excluding MPG), and is equal to

its estimated "quality."

         When quality—adjusted consumer price indexes for a commodity are

constructed using the "price—link" method, it is common to assume that the

market price ratio of goods is equal to their quality ratio. Equation (6)

shows that this is wrong. The quality ratio (the ratio of the                    x.'s)
                                         —9—




 is not equal to the ratio of market prices (ratio of P(x, MPG)for different

models) but rather to the full price ratio (ratio of P(x,MPG) +
                                                                            PgK/MPG)
           To definethe true quality adjusted price index note that the imputed

absolute characteristic prices of a! can be rewritten as a! = u               p /u =
                                          1                       1         X.Z  Z
   P   ,   where   a is now the relative marginal utility of characteristic i,

and P is the quality adjusted price level (in terms of the numeraire com-

modity z) to which all these marginal utilities have to be equated. Denoting

the gasoline cost component by g, equation (5) can be reparameterized


             P(x, MPG) = P   a. x. — g                                (7)



where P       can be interpreted as the quality adjusted full price index.

When we come to actual estimation we shall have to parameterize g further

as will be explained below.
           To see the implication of our null hypothesis about the constancy

of tbe characteristics prices            (a.) we digress further: suppose the

price of gasoline (Pg) changes. Let us denote the change in values of the

various variables after the gasoline price change by L .      Then, the null

hypothesis implies that



                   AP Ea1x_Ag                                      (8)



where AP = AP(x, MPG). Comparing the resulting relative price change for

two different models, h and k, we get
                                       —10—




           hh      =    l'k   AP cxx(h) -Ag(h)
                              L ax(k) -Ag(k)
                                                                     (9)




indicating that since Ag is likely to differ for different cars the rela-

tive price structure of different car models will change as the result of

the gasoline price change even without any changes in consumer tastes (that

is, no change in the a.'s).

         When oil prices increase, it will generally be the case that

Ag > 0    and Al' > 0, where the latter happens because of the inter—industry

input—output relationships and the increase in energy cost. Then the first

term in the right hand side of equation (8) is positive whil.e the second

term is negative and it is possible that the energy crisis can increase the

prices of some cars (typically compact cars) in absolute value while de-

creasing the prices of other cars (typically full sized cars).

         If there is no change in the true "full" price index (AP =     0),
equation (8) reduces to



           AP =   —Ag                                                (10)



and the prices of all         cars decline, including the price of compact cars.

         Furthermore, if there is no change in miles driven (K), in spite of

the increase in the price of gasoline, then (10) becomes




          AP—gAp/p
                g g                                                  (11)
                                                       —11—




Wand the prices of all models decline proportionately to the rate of

increase in the price of gasoline but the crinstant of-                       proportionality)
g, is different            for different models and hence cars with a high gaso-

line cot-price ratio (gIP) will show larger price declines than those with

small gasoline cost—price ratios.

         Returning to the formulation of the regression model and remembering that

automobiles are durable goods, we have to extend it to the multi—period context.

Let P(x, MPG) be the price of a car of vintage v at                              time t with

characteristics x and fuel efficiency MPG when new.                             The age of

this    car at time t is s =              t   —   v.          Characteristics    x   and MPG

deteriorate with age s and so we write x(s) and MPG(s)                               to express this

clearly.      Since p , pz ,     in   and the form of P (x,MPG) may change over
                       g                                               tv
time, c and K depend on time, we write                             ct.(t) and K(t) to denote

this dependency. We denote the length of life of a car by T. As Manski

(1980) has shown, T is a consumer decision variable (scrappage rate in his

case) and will depend on t.

           Following Hall (1971) and Kahn (1980), we write automobile prices

as the discounted sum of their net rental values over time. Denoting

the interest rate by r, we rewrite ( 5                        )   as



                    T(t)—t+v
                                      1                                        Pg(k+t)K(k+t)       (12)

where the one—period model P has been reinterpreted as the annual net

rental and      a(k+t) is the imputed price of characteristic i at time k+t.

 expected by consumers at time t.               Consumers calculate this expected

value by using the optimization rule (1) and the expected values of their

 income and of all other prices. Assuming myopic expectations that future

relative imputed characteristic prices are expected to be constant and

equal to the present,                   we can write c(k + t) =                  (k + t) a.(t),

where (k + t) is the absolute price level free of quality change at time

k + t and a.jt)'s represent relative price ratios of characteristics at
                1

time    t. We write P(k + t)            PF1(k) where                          1. Then       is
                                                                  r1(o)
interpreted as the quality—adjusted full price level of cars and T1(k) is

interpreted as the expected rate of price inflation. Thus, we have the

following.

                                (t) F1(k)


         Similarly, we write Pg(k + t) and K(k + t) as follows



                (k + t) =
           Pg                Pg(t)•    r2(k)

                                                                                         (14)
           K(k + t) =    K(t)     F3(k)



T'2(k) represents the expected rate of gasoline price inflation, and
                                                                                           r3(k)
is   the increase in mileage driven in k + t expected at t.

         We assume a deterioration pattern of characteristics which allows

us to write x1(k + t —       v)   =   x..(k +      t —   v)   for all i   .     This assumes the
same rate of deterioration across all characteristics and car models.

Similarly, we write MPG(k + t —           v)   =   MPC/i(k + t — v).          These deterioration

assumptions and the assumptions about expectations (13) and (14) allow us

to write (12) as follows:


             P(x,MPG) =            P(s).          cx1(t)•x1 —
                                                                Y(S)•Pg(t)•K(t)/MPG

where s =     t   —
                      v (the age of the car) and q(s) and 1'(s) are defined as

follows:

            f(s)      =            (k + t         v)F2(k)F3(k)/(1       + r)

           4(s) is the index of depreciation of all the characteristics except

MPG at age s and                 '(s) is the comparable MYG depreciation               index.
These depreciation indexes are influenced by F1(k),                            F2(k) and F3(k)
which are assumed to be the same acros all models.

        Equations (15) and (16) show that                          changes in the price of

an automobile                          depend on many things: changes in the quality-ad-

justed price index                 ,    the economic life time of a car T which affects
the depreciation terms f(s) and ky(s), the relative imputed prices                                  a,

the level of characteristics x and of MPG when new, the expected mileage K,

the current price of gasoline and the expectations about the future course of its price

       Letting g(1IMPC, s:t) =                                          we can     rewrite   (15)

 as



                  + g(1IMPG, s:t)/P) =          P(t)(s)        ct.(t)   x

Taking logarithms of both sides we get



      log P       =
                      log        + log (s) + log(L ct.(t)x.) —           log(l + j-- g( , s:t))


        We now introduce a number of additional simplifying assumptions and

approximations. First, we approximate



      —log [1 +             g(      ,   S:t]     —




Second, we approximate g() by


      g(l/MPG, s:t)              (t)/NiPG + y(t).s + c(t).s/MPG



and note that the parameters ,             y,   and c   all   depend on gasoline prices, among

other things, and hence cannot be assumed constant over time.

       Next, since we wish to use the semi—logarithmic form for the hedonic

function, both because of considerations of superior fit and because of trying

to preserve comparability with the earlier literature, we approximate

log c.(t)x

                   by expanding it around Q =           c.(t)x.

level in year t, writing


       log             =    log [c.(x.—x) + QI =
                                                         log[Q(l+-(x.—))]
                                         —15--




                    =   log   Q + log [1 +         (x.— x)]


                        log Q — 1 +



where aj(t) =                  is now the relative characteristic price per unit
                 a1(t)/Q(t)
of "average" quality in year t.6             Since we are interested only in comparing

a to a. ,   in   discussing possible changes in the relative prices of charac-

teristics, this redefinition does not matter. For typographical simplicity,

we shall drop the distinction between a' = a/Q               and a, but it should be noted

that the meaning of these coefficients is now somewhat different. (We shall

ignore the Q(t) term, as it will be subsumed in the year dummies that we

shall add to each cross—section). Using dummy variables to estimate the

hedonic price index           and depreciation term s), equation (12) can be

then rewritten as follows:




       log P(x, MPG) =             71k Tk + s D +             a.(t) x.

S   =t   —   v   respectively.

          As noted before, one of the main purposes of this paper is to test
                                                            7
the constancy of the ct.'s over time in equation (17). We allow ,               y

and E to change over time in such tests, because they ef]ect also the

overall levels of gasoline, automobile, and other prices

and income.               The age coefficients     are also allowed to change

over time because deterioration patterns may have changed for different

vintages.

         There are several econometric issues which arise in trying to estimate

(17) and its various variants. First, P appears also on the right hand

side of the equation, as a divisor of the gasoline cost component. We solve

this problem by using a three—stage procedure: First the log P equation is

estimated based on the x's (characteristics) alone, yieJding a P to be

used in stage 2 to estimate equation (17). This yields a new P, which is

used in the final third stage to reestimate (17).8


             Since the ,     y,   and    parameters in (17) depend on many other

things besides gasoline prices, we would like to ask whether the changes that

occurred in the coefficients are due primarily to changes in gasoline prices

(or more correctly, to changes in the evaluation of fuel efficiency). One

way of doing this is to use equation (5) to predict car prices in time t + 1

from the estimated coefficients in time t (denoting them as             and

and the rate of gasoline price increase between t and t + 1 (denoting it

as o).       If the gasoline•prjce changes are the main cause of the changes in the

coefficients            then &.x. + (1 + o/MPG should predict car
prices at t + 1 well up to a constant.           We call this the "prediction

method."
                                       —17—




          The other way of doing this is to consider the misspecified version

 of (17), in which the gasoline terms are excluded, say log P =

 while   the true equation is a.x. — g/M, where we have dropped the various

 year and age dummy variable terms to simplify the exposition, g

 and N = MPG.     Consider the linear projection (auxiliary equation) of l/M on x:

 1/N =   P.x.;   then, by the well known omitted variables argument9 we can write

                          P. =    — gii.

         Suppose gasoline prices increase by a percent, holding other things

 constant. Then g is also increased by a percent. Letting . be the value

of P. after this increase yields

                            =       -g=
         We   can examine, therefore, the effects of gasoline price increases

isolated from other changes by estimating unconstrained and constrained

versions of (17), without the gasoline consumption terms, and ask whether the

estimated P parameters satisfy the constraints implied by the          formula.

In both versions P(x, MPG) is the price after the gasoline price increase.

If the SER of the constrained regression is not much larger than that of the

unconstrained, then changes in the imputed prices of automobile characteris-

tics can be explained mostly by the gasoline price increases. Other factors,

such as general price level and income, do not affect the imputed prices much.

         We use the SUR (seemingly unrelated regressions) procedure in estimating

the various versions of (17). Since it is likely that our list of characteris-

tics is incomplete and since we have omitted the cross terms of 1/MPG and x

we expect a non—negligible correlation between different year but same model

residuals. The observed correlation is close to 0.9.       Another way to
                                    —18—



 reduce the effect of omitted characteristics would be to use

 dummy variables for the different car makes. But even if we use such

make dummies, the correlation coefficient is still high (around 0.7).

 We use, therefore, the SUR procedure which does take into account this kind

 of correlation in evaluating the precision of our estimates.

       The usual F—statistic for testing hypotheses in such frameworks [the

 SUR version is given in Theil (1971), equation (3.6) on pp. 314] has the

 following shortcoming, as Learner (1978) points out: When the number of ob-

 servations is large,    the computed F—value tends to be large, the

critical F—level is small'0,        and the null hypothesis is almost always

rejected. (Our sample sizes are around 500.) This makes little sense and

hence several alternative testing approaches have been suggested in the

literature.

      Learner derives a Bayesian critical level LB under the assumption

of diffuseness of prior information. We will use this critical level in

our F—tests:



                    LB
                                ).(fl/n —   1)/q

Here k is the number of parameters in the unconstrained regression and q

is the number of parameters to be constrained by the null hypothesis.

      In addidition, when testing the null hypothesis we shall look not only

at the F—value but also look at the estimated standard error of regression

(abbreviated as SER). Following Arrow (1960) and Ohta—Griliches (1976), we

judge the practical significance of the null hypothesis by comparing the

difference in SER between the constrained and the unconstrained regressions.

If the difference in SER (abbreviated as ASER) is smaller than .010 in the

system under the test, we do not reject the null hypothesis practically.

Since the left hand variable is the logarithm of price, an increase in SER
                                         —19—




by .010 implies an increase in the standard deviation of the unexplained

component of price of about 1 percent. Since SER in our regression is

around .2, the .010 criterion implies that we are willing to accept up to

a 5.0 percent deterioration in fit. We call this test the ASER test. We

use the SER of OLS rather than the SUR one in this test because we are

interested in the decrease in "fit' due to the imposition of the null hypothe-

sis and because OLS minimizes the actual sum of squared residuals while the

STJR   method does not do so, minimizing instead a transformed version of it.

           The iSER test can be thought of as examining whether the imposition

of the null hypothesis of relative constancy of imputed characteristic prices

makes a substantive difference to our estimates of the overall "quality" of

different cars. Letting Xk         = (xik)     be the vector of characteristics of

                          =
car model k and
                           (aj) the vector of imputed prices of character-
istics at time t,      then a   Ia x,
                             tat    o (that is, the ratio of the fitted
values) is the estimated relative quality of model a, relative to model b,

at time t.     Since the left hand variable is the logarithm of price, ASER

measures the difference in fitted values (that is, in relative estimated

qualities) caused by the imposition of the null hypothesis.

          Since consumers buy a bundle of characteristics x embodied in a

particular car rather than specific amounts of one or other characteristic,

changes in the overall quality ax may be of more interest than changes in

the individual price ratios. If the ratios of the imputed prices are constant

over time, then relative qualities of different models do not change. Even

if there is a change in the imputed prices, relative qualities may         still   not

change. This can happen because characteristics are highly collinear. For

example, if Xa    = (1,   2) and     =   (2,   4) are the characteristic vectors of
                                      —20—




 models a and b respectively, the relative quality of model b

 is two irrespective of imputed prices. Thus, significant changes in rela-

 tive imputed prices of characteristics need not imply significant changes

 in the relative quality evaluations of different cars.




 III. Data

        Our data on U.S. domestic passenger car prices and characteristics

 are taken from N.A.D.A. Official Used Car Guide.     We collected the charac-

 teristics of 1966 to 1980 vintage cars and their prices in the used car

market biannually (October and April) from 1970 to 1981A. In these data six

years is the oldest: age that we observe. We do not use the October prices of new

vintages in our study of the used market, because transactions in these

cars are not numerous enough to make their prices a reliable reflection of
                        11
consumer evaluations.

        The earlier Ohta—Griliches data set contained only sedans and hardtops

with four or two doors. The new data collected for the 1970—80 vintages

include   also station wagons and coupes with four, two, three, and five doors,
encompassing all segments of the passenger car market.
       The following physical   characteristics were used by us:   (1) number

of   cylinders, (2) shipping weight (in pounds), (3) number of doors, (4)

wheelbase (in inches), (5) length (inches), (6) width (inches), (7) CID

(cubic inch displacement of engine), (8) brake horsepower, (9) AT (dummy

for automatic transmission, 1 if standard, 0 otherwise), (10) PS (dummy for

power steering, 1 if standard, 0 otherwise), (11) AC (dummy for aircondition—

ing, 1 if standard, 0 otherwise).
                                   —21—




      MPG data are taken from E.P.A. publications, but these are available

only for 1974 and later vintages. Furthermore, they are for city driving in

some years and for highway or combined    city and highway driving in other years.

(This is indicated in Appendix Table A2.) We can match our sample cars perfectly

with the cars in E.P.A. publications after 1975. In 1974, the ratch is imperfect

and we use occasionally the MPG data for the nearest available similar car

(nearest in CID and weight within the same make).

      We used Facts and Figures of Consumer Reports to get the MPG data for

1966—73 vintage cars. For 1966 vintage cars, we use traffic gas mileage data,

which involve acceleration, 35 mph maximum, idling, and an average speed for

the course of about 21 mph. For 1967—73 vintage cars, we use the arithmetic

average of the upper and lower extremes of the range of gas mileage to be

expected in normal use. The upper extreme is for short—range stop—and—go

traffic and the high extreme is for open—road, constant—speed trips. Thus,

the Consumer Reports MPG data correspond roughly to city MPG data of E.P.A.

although we do not use both data simultaneously. The number of models for

which Consumer Reports MPG data are available is rather small (see Table A$).

 IV Empirical Results



         The impact of the oil—price rises on the used car market is our

 primary interest.               We hope to show that these events affected

 this market in an intelligible way. We shall do this first by estimating more or

 less standard hedonic price equations for used cars and showing that their

 coefficients changed over time, especially during the two major gasoline price

 rise episodes (1973—74 and 1979—80). Second, we add fuel consumption effi-

 ciency variables to these equations and show that the coefficients of the

 remaining characteristics are now much more stable over time. Finally, we

 examine if the changes observed in the first set of results can be

accounted            for by the changes that occurred in gasoline prices. By

and large, all these questions are answered affirmatively, indicating that

this market (and the consumers that are active in it) responded as one might

have predicted to changes in its economic environment, and did so quite

rapidly.

         The first set of calculations is based on comparing pairs of
                                   -
adjacent time period equations                using the same set of vintages and
models for the comparison. One set of equations is estimated unconstrained,

allowing all the coefficients to differ across time periods, while the

seco8d       set imposes the restriction that the coefficients of the various

physical characteristics, the "imputed prices," are constant over time. Both

versions are estimated using the STiR procedure which allows the residuals in

these equations to be correlated over time, and the plausibility of the null

hypothesis (the constrained version) is evaluated using Learner's Bayesian

version of the standard F—statistic and our own ASER test.
                                   —23—




        The physical characteristics used in these equations (in addition to

time and age dummies) are: (1) CID, (2) number of cylinders (abbreviated as

NOC), (3) weight (WT, in pounds), (4) wheelbase x width (WBW, in squared inches)

(5) dummy for number of doors less than 4 (NOD2), (6) dummy for number of

doors greater than 4 (NOD5), (7) AT, (8) PS and (9) AC.   (1) and (2) contri—

bute to speed, (3) and (4) mainly to roominess of a car, (5), (6), and (9)

to the quality of the ride, and (7) and (8) to the ease of driving and

maneuvering.

        We tried a number of other variables and variants in preliminary

analyses without affecting the final results significantly. For example,

we tried using length and length times width in addition to the WBW variable

and a WT/WBW variable, a proxy for the sturdiness of a car, instead of the

WT variable, without any noticeable improvement in the results. Because the

effect of H (horsepower) relative to CID appears to have declined over

time,   we have included them both in the early 70's equations. We also

experimented with the inclusion of make dummies (thirteen domestic makes)

to capture the effects of omitted characteristics. While the inclusion of

make dummies did improve the fit, it did not change any of our testing con-

clusions. To reduce the computational burden we do not consider them further

here.

        Table 2 illustrates the types of equations estimated and the kinds of

results obtained. It also shos two problems with these estimates: the

estimated coefficient of the AC (air conditioning) dummy variable is too high.

It implies that cars with air conditioning as standard equipment are on the

average 40 percent more expensive. This is unrealistic and is probably due

to the correlation of AC with some other unmeasured characteristics2 On the
                                 —24—




other hand, the coefficient of WBW   (wheelbase   times width), a proxy for

size, is significantly negative. This too is probably due to its correla—

tion with unmeasured characteristics and multicollinearity with some of the

included ones, such as CID. Because we are interested in detecting substan-

tial changes in the valuation of the set of characteristics as a whole, a

single or even several wrong—signed coefficients do not invalidate our

overall results.

       Our first set of results is summarized in Table 3 which presents the

various test statistics for the unconstrained and constrained adjacent period

regressions while excluding the gasoline consumption terms. For such com-

parisons the conventional critical F—value is about 2.0—2.5 at the one percent

significance level while the Bayesian critical level is between 6.2 (for n

330, K = 39, and q = 18) and 6.9 (for n = 1000, K = 26, q =    9).   Even using

the more conservative Bayesian approach, the coefficients appear to be changing

most of the time. But the impact of these changes on the overall fit of these

equations is rather small. Only in 19730—74A and 1974A —740 do the constraints

cumulatively amount to about .01, and only in 1979A — 790

does     the imposition of the constraint of constancy of coefficients "cost"

more than .01 in terms of LSER.13 Although not significant by our practical



criterion, ASER adds up to .003 and the value of the F—statistic is large in

l977A — 770 and 19779— 78A. Taking all these results together, we would
                                    —25—



have to conclude, having ignored considerations of gasoline efficiency in

these comparisons, that consumers had changed their evaluation of physical

characteristics significantly during this period, especially in 19730 — 74A

and 1979A — 790.   These periods were, in fact, periods of rapid gasoline

price rises.   it is also interesting to note that these changes in relative

evaluation occurred quickly and were over soon after the gasoline price

rises had run their course. In this sense, it appears that consumers adjusted

rather quickly.

       So far we examined half—year periods (i.e., April — October comparison

within a year) in order to discern when the estimated characteristics coeffi-

cients had changed significantly. In Table 3A w check also the stability of the

estimated coefficients over longer time periods. While this is only a cursory

check, because different vintages are used at different time

points in the 19740 — 80A comparisons and because these are still only two—

point comparisons, Table 3A tells the same story as Table 3. Except for the

two oil shock periods, the estimated coefficients are stable by our tSER

criterion. 1977A — 78A period shows some instability as in Table 3, but it

is not significant.

      We turn next to the estimation of price equations which allow for the

changing cost of gasoline consumption. This is accomplished by adding to

the previous equations the three following terms.



                      (s/MPG + Age + c AgeIMPG)/P



where P is computed by the three—step iterative procedure described above.
                                   —26—




 Table 4 summarizes the results of such computations for the 1975—81 period,

 and Table 5 illustrates (for l979A and 0) the type of equation estimated

 and the results obtained.

        Comparisons of Tables 3 and 4 show that the computed F—values and the

 ASERs fall drastically when we take the cost of gasoline into consideration.

 There are no substantively significant changes in imputed characteristic prices

 in any period by our ASER criterion, although the ASER is still .005

 in 1979A—790. Table 5 shows that the imputed price of body size (WBW and WT)

 decreased relative to that of engine size (CID). This change is the same

as that observed without consideration of gasoline cost in Table 2..    From

 the ex—post point of view consumers may have over—reacted to the second oil

price shock in 1979.

       To get comparable estimates for the earlier years of this period we

had to resort to the much smaller Consumer Reports based sample. The results

of these computations are summarized in Tables 6A and 6B. When the gasoline

consumption terms are included there are no significant changes in any period

in Table 6, either on the Bayesian or the ASER criterion.'4

       Thus, once the gasoline efficiency variables are added to the standard

hedonic regressions, the hypothesis of constancy of relative imputed prices

of the physical characteristics cannot be rejected for any of the half—year

periods during 1970—81.

       So far we tested the constancy of imputed prices, using the framework

associated with equation (17). In (17) the parameters     ,   y   and c depend

not only on the price of gasoline but also on other factors such as auto-

mobile prices, the general price level and income. Our third approach to
                                         —27—




 the   problem attempts to examine the effect of gasoline price increases

 alone, holding the other factors constant. We will do this for our "worst

 fit" case, the 1979A — 790 period, following the methods described in

 Section II. The sample consists of 1974—77 vintage cars.

         To use the "prediction" method we take the unconstrained estimates

for 1979A (from Table 5) and use them to predict the 19790 prices. In

these "predictions" we allow the overall period (price level) and vintage

 (age) coefficients to change and concentrate on the differential treatment

of gasoline efficiency variables over time. More specifically we first

form the   "residual price" variable

                     LLP = log [P19790(x, MPG)] —
                                                         (czx.+GA)
where

                     GA =   [A/MPc +    2AAGE + 3A AGE/NPG]/P79A

is the predicted gasoline cost component based on l979A data and prices, and

then regress it (LLP) on a constant and vintage dummies. The SER of this

regression is .224. This is the most contrained version, one that assumes

that none of the coefficients (except for the constant and vintage dummies)

changed between l979A and 19790.

        In the next computation, we allow the C component to change in

proportion to the estimated rise in the price of gasoline during this period,

29.7 percent (based on the gasoline price component of the CPI). Here, the

regression   of
                                      —28—




                   LLPA =   log   [P19790 (x,NPG)J —   [&x. + (1 + .297)GAI
 on a constant and vintage dummies yields an SER of .214.

        Alternatively, we need not       assume the expected rate of gasoline

 price inflation but can estimate it by regressing


                   LLPB =   log [P19790 (x, NPG)J cx1


 on a constant, vintage dummies, and     GA. The resulting coefficient of GA

 is 2.2 with a standard error of .12, significantly larger than the 1.3

 implied by the actual gasoline price rise between 1979A and 19790, implying

 that some non—negligable fraction of this inflation rate was extrapolated

 (perhaps not unreasonably) into the future.       The SER for this regression

is .202.

       The fully unconstrained regression for 19790, with all coefficients

allowed to change has an SER of .177. Thus in terms of percentage change

in the unexplained variance due to the imposition of the various constraints,

out of the .0185 change in the residual variance between the constrained

to 1979A coefficients and the unconstrained version, 24 percent can be ex-

plained by allowing the gasoline component to change in proportion to the

actual inflation, and 51 percent if consumers are allowed to extrapolate some

of this inflation into the future. Thus, a significant portion of the change

in estimated coefficients during this period can indeed be associated with

the changes in gasoline prices.'5

      We use next the omitted variable approach to look at the same thing

from a different point of view and try to explain the changes that occur
                                         —29—




in   the imputed prices of characteristics when                  gasoline cost variables

are omitted from the regressions. First, we take the corresponding coef—

ficients of the unconstrained regression for 1979A from Table 2 and use

them to construct the "residual price" variable



                     LLP =   log   [P19790.] -
                                                 EiPiAXIj

where         are the estimated characteristics coefficients in the 1979A

regression.     We regress this variable on a constant and vintage dummies,

which yields an SER of .228.

         Now we calculate . =              — cgp.    ,   where    p. are the coefficients

in the regression of 1/MPG on all of the included x characteristics

(given in Table 7)6,         is the observed rate of gasoline price inflation

.297, and g =               is set to 10.17         Then, the alternative "residual
                 Pg•K/P
price"

                   LLPA =    log           —



is calculated and regressed        on a constant and vintage dummies, yielding an

SER of .207.

         Here too we need not assume that there was no extrapolation

of the gasoline price rises into the future. Instead, we can iterate on

o in a search for the value that fits best. This occurs at about .9

(rather than .3), indicating a significant extrapolation of current gasoline

price changes into future,and yields an SER of .191.
                                    —30—




        All of these estimates are to be compared to the unconstrained

 estimates for 19790 whose SER is   .182. Thus, in terms of the difference

 in the unexplained variance of 19790 prices between the unconstrained and

 the 1979A coefficients version (.0189), 48 percent of it can be explained

 by allowing the characteristics coefficients to change in proportion to

 their relationship to the left out variable 1/MPG and the observed rise in

 gasoline prices (.297), and 82 percent if we use the higher rate of gaso-

line price inflation extrapolation implied by the data.

       For reasons not entirely clear to us, the simpler omitted variable

approach, which focuses on only one variable (1/MPG), gives a greater role

to the gasoline price changes in accounting for the changes that occurred

in the hedonic price equations between 1979A and 19790, than the more com-

plete three—variable "prediction" approach. Both methods yield roughly

similar results, however, with the gasoline price change accounting for

between one quarter to three quarters of the observed change, depending

primarily on whether we allow for an extrapolation of the gasoline price

rises into the future or not.



V. Conclusions

       The purpose of this paper was to ask whether U.S. consumers changed

significantly their views about the relative qualities of different cars in

the face of the 1973 and 1979 gasoline price rises. This was done by testing

the null hypothesis that imputed characteristics prices have remained constant

over time. To accomplish this we first outlined a hedonic model that takes

gasoline costs into account, pointed out some of its theoretical implications,
                                     —31—



 and discussed the statistical methods required for its estimation and for

 the testing of the particular null hypothesis. The model and the estima-

 tion methods were then used to analyze the prices of U.S. passenger cars

 in the used market during the l97OA — 81A period.

        Our main findings are:

(a)   If one does not take gasoline costs into account then one would have to

      conclude that consumers changed their relative evaluations of car quali-

      ties significantly in 19730—74A, and 1979A—790. They were very quick,

      however, in adjusting these evaluations to the oil—price shocks.

(b) When we do take gasoline costs into account, the estimated relative

      qualities become much more stable over time and there is no period

      that shows a significant change. In this form it is much easier to

      maintain the "constancy of tastes" assumption.

(c) Our main model adjusts not only for the effect of gasoline price increases

      but also for the effects of other changes such as changes in other prices

      and income. We developed models which adjust solely for the increase in

      gasoline prices. Applying these models to the 1979A—790 period we observed

      that between one and three quarters of the decrease in the unexplained

      variance of 19790 prices which arose from allowing characteristics

      coefficients to change from those anticipated in 1979A can be explained

      by the increase in gasoline prices alone, indicating that this is indeed

      a major component of what did happen.

 1. Kahn (1981) has also analyzed the effect of gasoline price increase

 on used car prices. Our work differs from his in important points. Our

 null hypotheses and methods are different. We focus directly on the change

 in imputed prices of large, medium and small cars. We use seemingly unre-

 lated regression methods and a much larger data set. Nevertheless, this

 does not detract from the pioneering merit of his work.


 2.   There might be some patriots who made gasoline cost a direct argument

of their utility function: the amount of gasoline used may by itself now

result in disutility. But since scarcity of gasoline is reflected in its

price in a market economy, rational consumers have only to consider the

cost of gasoline in their budget constraint and do not have to make the

amount of gasoline used an argument of the utility function. We assume

that the number of such patriots is small. Consumers may have overreacted

to gasoline price increase, holding an unrealistic expectations of additional

gasoline price rises in the future. In this case, relative quality evalua-

tion among cars may have been influenced more by the energy crises than

our models allow.


3. The relation between the market price and the full price is given by

equation (6) in section II.


4. Economists usually leave it to others (perhaps sociologists and psycholo-

gists) to explain how consumer preferences are formed and change. Discussions

of endogeneous taste change are an exception but this is a very restricted

form of change (see Phlips, 1974). As Hirshleifer notes, really great social
changes in human history may have stemmed from shifts in people's goals

for living (that is, preferences), but economists have very little to say

on this topic.


5. Note that we ignore other components of user costs such as repairs, taxes,

and insurance.


6. Alternatively, we could have defined a semi—logarithmic hedonic function

to start out with. That is, equation (6) could have been defined as

            ci.x.
              1 1
P + g = e            which after several steps would have lead to the form

log P               — g/P   ,   which is essentially the same as (17).


7. We will estimate the quality—adjusted full price index in a separate

paper.


8. Also, as stated before in Section II, x and MPG are consumer decision

variables (that is endogenous variables). We do not take this into consid-

eration in the actual regression as in the usual hedonic studies, since from

the point of view of the used car market, the x's and MPG's are predetermined.


9. E.g., see Theil (1971, pp. 548—549).


10. Equation (4.3) of Learner (1978, pp. 88) shows the following relation

between the F—value and the number of observation n for OLS regressions.


                       2

         F=( 1Ro                (fl_k)
                                   q
                      1


Here        is R2 of the unconstrained regression, R is R2 of the
 constrained, K is the number of parameters in the unconstrained and        q

 is the number of parameters to be constrained. R2TS   do not change much

 in large samples and hence the F—value increases with n.




11. The information on the 1970—80 vintages was taken from the New England

Edition of the N.A.D.A. Guide. Data on the 1966—69 vintages were taken from

the earlier Ohta—Griliches (1976) study which used the Central Edition of

the same Guide. One should be careful not to confuse Central Edition used

car prices with those of the New England Edition. 1970A and 1971A used car

prices of 1966—69 vintages are Central Edition prices and all other prices

are New England Edition prices, as shown in Appendix Table Al. Our sample

distrihition is shown in that table also.


12. AC is standard equipment on high—priced cars (Cadillac, Imperial, Lin-

coln). As Ohta—Griliches (1976) show, the make effects (effects of omitted

characteristics on price) of these cars are around .4, which is roughly

equal to the estimated coefficient of AC in this study.


13. We also computed such estimates using three periods at a time, rather

than two, and looked at changes a year apart, rather than just six months

apart, with essentially similar results.


14. The Bayesian critical F—value is between 4.0 and 5.2 for these samples.
15. We did similar calculations for the 19730 — 1974A change with

similar results.

16. Wilcox (1978) used the regression of MPG on physical characteristics

in a different context.

                                               T
17. Actually in the multi-period model, g =        p (t)K(t)/(l+r)tP. As a

rough calculation, let Pg(t) =
                                 Pg(1)(l+a)t
                                               wher: a =   r,   Pg(l) =

and K(t) = 10000,   P = 5000   and T   5. Then g     10.
