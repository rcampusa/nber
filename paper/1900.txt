   Capital Utilization and Capital Accumulation: Theory and Evidence




                                ABSTRACT




     A firm may acquire additional caoital ini-ut by nurchasing new cai-

tal or by increasing the utilization of its current capital. The margin

between capital accumulation and capital utilization is studied in a model

of dynamic factor demand where the firm chooses capital, labor, and their

rates of utilization. A direct measure of capital utilization--the work

week of capital--is incorporated into the theory and estimates. The esti-

mates imply that capital stock is costly to adjust while the work week of

capital is essentially costless to adjust. The estimated response of the

capital stock to changes in its price and in the required rate of return

is more rapid than found in other estimates.

 1. Introduction

       In this paper, I examine the link between capital utilization and

the dynamic demand for capital. A firm can vary the intensity of use of

its capital by lengthening its work week as well as by changing the work

week and amount of labor. When a firm decides--for whatever reason--that

it needs more capital services than it already has, it has two options.

It may either acquire additional physical capital or use its current capi-

tal more intensively. As long as the firm is not at a corner, it has these

two choices regardless of whether the quantity of labor is increased cor-

respondingly. That is, the choice of amount of capital services can be

made separately from the choice of labor input and the capital-labor ratio.

       The Federal Reserve Board's and the Bureau of Economics Analysis's

published measures of capacity utilization are not necessarily economically

meaningful measures of capital utilization. Each measures actual output rela-

tive to potential rather than at what rate of intensity capital is being used.

In this paper, I discuss an alternative measure of capital utilization, the

work week of capital. By assuming that capital is idle if no labor is present,

the work week of capital can be deduced from data on shift work of labor.

I discuss construction of such a series, present some results about its sta-

tistical properties, and integrate it into a model of dynamic factor demand.

I estimate the model of dynamic factor demand and study how capital accumu-

lation and capital utilization respond to changes in the cost of capital.

       The aim in this paper is to analyze and quantify how the firm's abil-

ity to vary capital utilization impinges on its demand for capital. Why

firms use their capital so little is a persistent puzzle. The main purpose

of this paper is not to resolve this puzzle, but rather to analyze how the

                                     1
margin between extending shift work and adding new capital affects the de-

cision to buy new capital. Nonetheless, my estimates are consistent with

the view that the productivity of shift work is low.2

        Uncertainty about the future plays a central role in the firm's in-

vestment decision. For example, whether the firm exoects a shock to be

permanent or temporary will determine whether it responds mainly by increas-

ing its capital stock or by increasing the utilization of the current stock.

I use the research strategy advocated by Hansen and Singleton (1982) of

estimating the stochastic first-order conditions of the firm's decision

problem. This methodology allows expected future outcomes to drive current

decisions without requiring the econometricians to characterize fully their

distribution.

       To simulate the estimated model, I make further assumptions about

the environment facing the firm.   I can then solve using the algorithm of

Blanchard and Kahn (1980) for the estimated response of capital demand and

capital utilization to changes in factor prices. The current response of

demand and utilization depends on current and future values of factor prices

and the required rates of return. These changes can arise because of changes

in tax policy. Hence, the estimates can be used to study changes in tax

policy based on estimated structural parameters of the representative firmts

obj ective function.

       In Section 2, I discuss the work week of capital as a measure of

capacity utilization. In Section 3, I discuss the theory of interrelated

factor demand with variable factor utilization. I present estimates of

the model in the fourth section. In the fifth section, I consider some ex-

tensions concerning the overidentifying restrictions of the model and the

aggregation problem.   I explore in Section 6 the dynamic response of capital
                                                                            3



 to changes in costs induced, for exanirle, by changes in tax policy.

 The work week of capital overshoots the steady state when prices and rates

 of return change. The estimated response of capital stock to changes in

 prices and required rates of return is substantial. This result provides

 an important challenge to the standard view that prices and required rates

 of return are empirically unimportant in models of the demand for capital.

 I summarize the results in the last section.



 2. Neasuring Capital Utilization

       There is no officially published time series directly measuring capi-

tal utilization in U.S. manufacturing. "Capacity utilization" as published

by the FRE, BEA, or in the Wharton index is a measure of actual output rela-

tive to potential, not a measure of capital utilization. This point is

stressed not to criticize the FRB, BEA, or Wharton indexes per se but to

characterize their economic content. In particular, they are not good meas-

ures of the intensity of use of the canital stock as maintained by some re-

searchers [Nadiri and Rosen (1969) and Tatoin (1980), for example]. I discuss

in the Appendix how these measures of capacity utilization are essentially

detrended output. The correlation of detrended value-added in manufacturing

and the FRB index is 0.88.

       The measure of capital utilization I propose to use is the average

work week of capital. The series is analogous to the well-known average

work week of labor, Ht   ,   measured in man-hours. Capital is working only

if some labor is present, that is, if the plant is open. Published infor-

mation on shift work is therefore used to construct the implied work week

of capital.

       The Bureau of the Census in 1929 collected and again since 1973
                                                                                              4



collects information directly on the work week of capital [see Foss (1981)

for details]. These data are too infrequent and not collected over a long

enough continuous time span to be useful in this study.

         The measure of the work week of capital I use here is based on the

nuer of workers on late (second and third) shifts in manufacturing. Data

on shift work are available beginning in the early 1950s from the Area Wage

Survey   conducted    by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The survey gives the

percentage of workers on the second and third shifts in the various SMSAs.

Let L1 ,              and     L3 denote employment on the first, second, and third
             L2   ,



shifts. Consider a series


(1)           S =             -         +           -   L_)   +
                      [H(L1       L2)       80(L2                 120L31/L1


The series S measures the work week of capital. Equation (1) is equiv-

alent to Taubman and Gottschalk's (1971) equation (2.3) up to a normaliza-

tion. Suppose that only one shift is worked so L2 and L3 are both zero.

In this case S ,        the work week of capital, equals Fl ,                 the work week of
labor. Increasing the utilization of capital is achieved exactly by                     in-
creasingthe utilization of labor. The index is constructed so that
overlapping shifts are not double-counted. In particular, it assumes that
overtime   work on one shift overlaps with that on another shift if more than

one shift is worked. This insures that S does not overstate the length

of the work week of capital. In particular, it helps to ensure that S

is not spuriously correlated with the work week of labor, which is an al-

ternative indicator of capital utilization.3

         Now suppose that two equally-sized shifts are worked so that L1

and L2 are equal and L3 is zero. Then the work week of capital is eighty

hours. (No information is available on the length of late shifts so aver-
                                                                                    5



age hours are used.) If three equal shifts are worked, then the work week
of capital is 120. It is presumed that if more than one shift works, they

are   of equal size. Therefore, L1 ,     L2   ,     and   L3 can be deduced from

aggregate production workers, L ,      and from the shares of shift work in

the   Area Wage Survey.
         Taubman and Gottschalk (1971) construct a quarterly index S for
1952 through 1968 based on Area Wage Survey data. The Survey is conducted
for   different SNSAs at different points in       time. They use this information
to construct a quarterly series from the disaggregate data. I extend the
series through 1982 based    on published and unpublished summary statistics

for the post 1968 period.4     I then use a modification of the Chow-Lin (1969)

procedure for best linear unbiased distribution. The instrument for the

distribution is quarterly average hours.          I estimate the relationship be-

tween quarterly hours and S on the 1952 to 1968 period. From these esti-

mates, I construct fitted values for quarterly S after 1968 by redistri-

buting the annual residual equally over each quarter of the year. The

entire series is given in the Appendix.

        Use of an interpolated series creates an errors-in-variables problem.

In Section 5.2, I discuss estimates that are robust to measurement error

in S

        There are shortcomings to use of this measure of the work week of

capital as a measure of capital utilization. First, because of data limit-

ations, it does not account for work on weekends. In 1976, the average

plant in the U.S. manufacturing industry operated 5.3 days per week [Foss

(1981, p. 9)] so at least on average weekend work is negligible. Second,

the measure is for capital in use so it does not account for temporary plant

closings. Permanent plant closings should, in principle, be captured in
                                                                              6




the measured capital stock. Finally, the work week of capital is a better

measure of capital utilization in assembly industries such as automobiles

than in process industries such as blast furnaces and petroleum refining.

In process industries, it may be extremely costly to completely shut down

a plant. Hence, utilization may     be   varied by changing the quantity of

materials processed.

       Before presenting the theoretical model of the interrelation between

the stock demand and utilization of factors, it is useful to consider the

correlation of the work week of capital with other macroeconomic variables.

For the following discussion, I detrend the data with linear and quadratic

trends.5 The correlation of the work week of capital with output is 0.66,

so it is strongly pro-cyclical. The correlation of the work week of pro-

duction workers with output is 0.70; the utilization rates of capital and

labor are about equally correlated with output. The two utilizations have

correlation 0.77.

       The correlation of the work week of capital with labor productivity

(output per man-hour) is 0.13. Longer hours for capital means a higher ef-

fective capital-labor ratio, and consequently higher labor productivity.

The correlation of the capital stock with the sane measure of labor produc-

tivity is 0.08,   so   high frequency changes in productivity are more substan-

tially correlated with the work week than the stock of capital. Foss (1981)

emphasizes the importance of changes in capital utilization for the trend

determination of productivity. Tatom (1980) notes that variation in capital

utilization might explain pro-cyclical labor productivity. The correlations

presented here are consistent with capital utilization being part of the

source of pro-cyclic productivity. Tatom uses FRB capacity utilization

to proxy for capital utilization, which, for reasons I discuss above, does

not directly measure capital utilization.

 3. Factor Utilization and the Theory of Dynamic Factor Demand

        The technology I study allows the firm to choose independently its

 capital and labor stocks and their rates of utilization. The firm takes

 factor and product prices as given. The level of output is determined by

 the firm's choice of inputs and their utilizations rather than by an exog-

 enous constraint. Thus, the choice of the rate of utilization determines

 output, and not vice versa. The scope to vary utilization gives the firm

 flexibility in responding to shock to demand and cost. In particular, it

 may respond to temporary shocks principally by adjusting utilization and

 to permanent shocks principally by adjusting the stock of a factor.

       The effect of varying utilization on maximized profits can be di-

vided into four parts. First, under typical concavity assumptions, increas-

ing the utilization of one factor should decrease the marginal product of

that factor. Second, increased factor utilization may impose added vari-

able cost on the firm. For example, to increase labor utilization a firm

must pay the wage rate plus a possible premium for overtime. To add a shift

the firm may pay a shift premium. Third, as I demonstrate, changing util-

ization or quantities employed by different factors implies different

adjustment costs. These different adjustment costs have different impli-

cations for profits. Specifically, the adjustment cost of capital is sub-

stantial and significant, that of employment is smaller yet significant,

and that of hours of employees and of capital is nil. Fourth, the rate of

utilization may affect user cost of capital by changing the rate of depre-

ciation Isee Taubman and Wilkinson (1970)]. Haking the rate of deprecia-

tion endogenous has the unfortunate consequence of making the level of the

capital stock unobservable. I do not examine the implications of utiliza-

tion for user cost in the context of this paper's model.
                                                                            8



         Nadiri   and Rosen (1969) study capacity utilization in a model where

finns are not explicitly forward-looking. They study dynamically interre-

lated factor demands for labor and capital where the level of utilization

of both capital and labor are choice variables of the firm. They use a

Cobb-Douglas production function where capital, capacity utilization, em-

ployees, and hours of employees all have different shares. Nadiri and Rosen

use capacity utilization to measure capital utilization. Measured capacity

utilization is essentially output divided by potential. Consequently, capac-

ity utilization as measured cannot be an independent choice of the finn.

It   is therefore misleading to estimate an independent "demand" for it.6

        The literature on interrelated factor demand under rational expec-

tations largely overlooks the issue of capacity utilization. That is, it

is typically assumed that the current stock of factors is always utilized

fully. An exception is theoretical work by Abel (1979), whose model is

close to the one in this paper. Sargent (1978) estimates a dynamic demand

function for labor. He does in a sense address the issue of utilization

by estimating separate demands for straight-time and overtime employment.

He finds that straight-time employment has a cost of adjustment far in excess

(e.g., 40 times) that for overtime employment. His conclusion regarding

the different cost of adjustment of overtime and straight-time work is simi-

lar to a result in this paper: that the number of employees is costly to

adjust but that the number of hours they work is not. He does not, however,

study demand for capital or its utilization.

        In other studies of dynamic factor demand under rational expectations,

factors are utilized fully. Meese (1980) estimates the interrelated demands

for capital and man-hours. Kennan (1979) estimates the demand for labor
                                                                                           9



as a function of current and expected future output. Pindyck and Rotemberg

 (1983) separate white-collar from blue-collar employment but again assume

that each is utilized at a constant rate.

         I now consider an explicit model of the firm that yields demands

for both capital and labor and their rates of utilization.


3.1. Technology

         This section extends the theory of interrelated factor demand to

account explicitly for the firm's separate choice of factor utilization. /

In   addition to choosing its stock of capital, Kt      ,   its        stock of produc-

tion workers, Lt ,      and their hours, Ht ,      and its stock of non-production

workers, N ,     it   can   also   choose the number of shifts it operates. The

number of shifts is proportional to the work week of capital, St .                  That

is, the number of shifts is essentially the ratio of                   to Ht
        If the firm   chooses to extend the work week of capital, S , with-
out changing labor input, it would correspondingly reduce the effective

capital-to-labor ratio. Thus, one would expect, but not require, that the

firm add labor when it adds shifts. If the work week of capital is extended

by lengthening the work week of production workers,
                                                            I-It
                                                                   ,    then   no corres-

ponding increase in labor is required to keep fixed the ratio of workers

to machines. Recall from Section 2 that to chose the work week of capital

the firm in fact choses the amount of work on late shifts. To emphasize

this connection I refer to S as the work week of capital, but the reader

is free to think of an increase in S as the decision to move workers

from the early to late shifts. In any case, S is a choice variable of

the firm independent of the total production worker employment, Lt

Terms in levels are the standard, Cobb-Douglas, components. Those in changes

represent the output foregone when the levels of factors are varied. The

parameter d is the survival rate of capital (one minus the depreciation

rate); the variable                  is the survival rate of labor (one minus the quit

rate). In a related model [Shapiro (1984)], I find that the estimated ad-

justment cost parameters are insensitive to choosing different values of

the elasticity of substitution in a constant elasticity of substitution

specification. The cost of adjustment determines the dvnathcs of the model,

Hence, the Cobb-Douglas specification appears to be a reasonable, simplify-

ing specialization in this class of applications.

 S .     Varying St may involve costs of adjustment. As with hours, H.t
 I expect the cost of adjusting the work week of capital to be small. Chang—

 ing St ,         ceteris   paribus, involves a rescheduling of production, which

 should be easy to do relative to changing the level of inputs.

          Now consider the effect of the level of the work week of capital on

 output. Suppose that the production function exhibits constant returns

 to scale so that doubling capital and workers holding work week constant

doubles output. This implies the parameter restriction                        aK + aL            aN = 1

Suppose the firm wants to replicate the output produced by the plant not

by doubling Kt ,            L    ,     and    Nt ,   but   by doubling the work week of capi-

tal keeping the capital-to-labor ratio constant. That is, a second shift

is added that replicates the first shift. To double output, the firm needs

to double the labor input but only change the work week of capital holding

capital stock fixed. Presuming labor is as productive at night as during

the day, which is likely to be true as a first approximation, this scheme

should just double output. This discussion abstracts from the adjustment

costs.

         This example illustrates a natural restriction on the parameters

aK ,     aL   ,
                  aN   ,   and       aS .    If doubling     L ,   Nt   ,   and S while hold-

ing Kt (and Ht )              constant doubles output, and aK +              aL
                                                                                  +
                                                                                      aN
                                                                                           = 1    ,   then

aK equals aS .             Such a result is highly intuitive. Extending the work

week of capital creates capital services in exactly the same way as adding

a new piece of equipment does. Therefore, Kt and S should have the

same output elasticities. One would expect them to have very different

costs of adjustment. In particular, one would expect the output foregone

by adjusting the physical quantity of an input to far exceed the cost of

changing the length of time that it operates.
                                                                              12



         The costs of increasing Kt and St are, however, very different.

 In particular, increasing K involves the purchase of additional equip-

ment. How the cost of extending S is measured effects critically the

estimate of a .      I   discuss issues of measuring factor cost in the next

section.


3.2. Input Costs

         The labor costs of a firm are a function of the number of employees,

the number of hours they work, and the degree to which they work late shifts.

That is, in addition to the premium for overtime there is a premium for

hours worked on late shifts.

         I assume that non-production workers are paid a fixed amount. The

wage bill of production workers is given by the expression



(3)           wLH = wLt1J [w0 + .5w1 (Hr/Ho)    +
                                                    w2 (SfI10)] +


where w is the average real wage, w the straight-time wage, H0 the
average of Ht , and v an error term. The term in S captures the
premium for work at hours other than the standard shift. It is paid when
the   work week of capital exceeds the work week of the typical worker.

         The overtime premium, w1 ,    is   typically 0.5. Information on the

reported premium for work on late shifts is available in the Area Wage

Survey. For 1973 through 1975, the average percentage pay differential

for work on the second shift is 7.8 percent and for work on the third shift

is 10.3 percent (see BLS Bulletin 1850-89, Area Wage Survey Summaries,

1975, p. 101).

         The low value of the late-shift premium, w2 ,        which I confirm in

the time—series estimates, poses theoretical difficulties for the model

and estimates of the work week of capital. The premium is very small (corn-
                                                                               13



pared to the overtime premium, for example). If w2 as directly estimated

represents the true marginal labor cost of extending the work week of cap-

ital, one is confronted with the puzzle discussed in the introduction:

Why is the work week of capital so low? Given the low incremental labor

cost, why is late shift work so rare? Put another way, if costs are indeed

this low, then labor productivity on late shifts must be very low. Based

on the low figure for w2 ,      the estimate of a5 is substantially lower
than that of aK

          Consider another alternative explanation for the low value of

Firms in manufacturing operating late shifts typically rotate such work

using a schedule that is essentially fixed among their existing work force.

If late work is expected and rotation is customary, most of the premium

needed to get workers to umdertake it may be built into the average wage

rather than explicitly made a function of late work. In this case,

would be substantially underestimated. There is evidence in British data

that such practice is customary [see ?farris (1964, p. 137)].

          Note that a similar argument cannot be made for overtime. The Fair

Labor    Standards Act requires that a standard premium be paid for overtime
hours so these payments cannot be averaged into the straight-time wage.
Hence,    the measured data for overtime, unlike those for late shifts, more

closely approximate the marginal cost to a firm. There are no such legal

restrictions on shift premium.

         The proposed solution to the puzzle of why there is so little shift

work given that the average cost of labor does not increase much on late

shifts is that the average cost does not replicate the marginal cost.      I


posit that the true marginal cost may be better proxied by the overtime

premium. Alternatively, one can ask what is the estimate of marginal cost

given the theoretical condition that aK equal      a .   In   the next section,
                                                                              14




I discuss the initlications of these considerations.

       In addition to there being variable cost for production workers,

there is fixed cost of employing both production workers and non-production

workers. These are any payments not a function of hours worked, which, in the

case of non-production workers, are all the costs. The fixed compensation

cost of a production worker is denoted s ;       the compensation of a non-

production worker is denoted as

       The real purchase price of capital is given by


                      -             -
(4)         P             tPVCCAt       ITC)

where p is the real, after-tax purchase price of capital, Pt the real

before-tax price, t the corporate tax rate, PVCCA the present value

of depreciation allowances, and ITCt the investment tax credit rate.

I assume that the survival rate of capital, d ,      is   a constant. Given

that the intensity of use of capital is variable in the model this assump-

tion may be controversial. The advantage of making the assumption is that

it makes the capital stock easily measured. The disadvantage is that it

may lose one of the substantial costs of increasing the work week of capi-

tal. The construction of these data is discussed in the Appendix.

The final equation of the model is the expression for the wage bill of pro-

duction workers (3).    I   estimate equation (3) and the five first-order con-

ditions (6) on data for U.S. manufacturing.       The data   are described in the

Appendix.


4. Results
       Estimation is carried out using non-linear three stage least squares.

Realized values replace the conditional expectations. The error terms in

the resulting equations are strictly expectational (except for the measure-

ment errors v in equation (3)). In particular note that the productivity

shock v from equation (2) does not enter the system (6). That is, the

shock is embodied by the output data. The shock does not appear even if

it is serially correlated.9

       Data known at time t are valid instrumental variables. The

instruments used are the level and logs of the factors, Kt ,             Lt.   Nt

       and St ,     the level of the factor prices, w                      ,   and
Ht ,

   ,   the tax rate, t ,       survival   rate of labor,      ,   the   rate of re-

turn, ri ,        and a constant and trend. Only the lagged rate of return

is a valid instrument because rt is not known until the beginning of

period t+l .      Although output appears in the equations, it, like the fac-
tors, is endogenous. Output is not used as an instrumental variable.

Rotemberg (1984) shows that if the overidentifying restrictions of the model

do not hold exactly what different lists of instruments can yield differ-

ing estimates. I discuss the importance of this issue in Section 5.1.

        Table I gives the estimates of the parameters of the firm's deci-

sion problem. Column (i) gives estimates where there are no interrelated

adjustment costs; column (ii) gives them for where there are no adjustment

costs for the work weeks of capital and labor, Ht and S. ,               but   where

the stock of capital, production workers, and non-production workers, Kt
                                                                               18



       and       ,   are subject to interrelated adjustment costs. All other
interrelated adjustment costs always differ insignificantly and economic-

ally unimportantly from zero.

        Consider the estimates of the parameters of equation (3) relating

hours and shift work to wages. The estimate of the overtime premium,
                                                                               w1
is 0.42 in column (i) and 0.50 in column (ii). The estimate in column (ii)

is exactly the theoretical value; the estimate in column (i) is close to

it. Hence, the estimate of the function for the wage bill is broadly con-

sistent with the stylized facts about overtime pay.

        As anticipated in the theoretical discussion, the estimated premium

for work on the late shift, w2 ,       is   small. The estimated premium of 0.05

in either column (1) or (ii) is consistent with the observation from the

Area Wage Survey discussed above. The time series evidence does not rely

on the information about the wage premium given in the Area Wage Survey.

Both the evidence and the time series evidence point to a late shift prem-

ium substantially below that of the overtime premium. I discuss below the

implications of the estimate of w2 for the estimate of the output elas-

ticity of the work week •of capital.

        Consider now the estimates of the output elasticities. The elastic-

ities for production workers,      aL ,     and non-production workers, aN

and the implied elasticity for capital,       aK ,   are   consistent with their

shares in national income. The elasticity of hours of production workers,

Ht ,   is   only slightly larger than that of the stock of production workers,

Lt .   If they were equal, production workers and their hours would be perfect
substitutes!0 In that case, the level of labor input could be treated

as man-hours rather than workers and hours separately. The adjustment costs,

which depend on the changes in inputs, and the contribution to the wage

bill, are, of course, still very different for hours and workers.
                                                                             19



       The output elasticity of the work week of capital,   a ,    is   esti-

mated to be only 0.026. Recall that the theoretical value of      a is equal
to that of aK ,   which is plausibly estimated to be about one-quarter.

Hence, if the estimate of the shift premium is taken from the data on the

average wage, the productivity of shift work is estimated to be very low.

The only way for the model to be consistent with that data is for the im-

plied productivity of lengthening the work week of capital to be very low.

This finding is consistent with the observed low apparent productivity of

shift work found in studies discussed in footnote 2.

       As argued above, the data on average wages may be misleading about

the marginal cost of work on late shifts. Specifically, if firms and workers

have an implicit contract to share work on late shifts equally among workers

and if the pattern of such work is reasonably predictable, the straight-

time wage might average a low wage for work during the day and a high wage

for work during the night. In that case, the average wage is a poor mdi-
                                                                        11
cator of the marginal cost of increasing shift work to the company.

       Consider the coefficients measuring the lost output from changing

the amount of an input. Column (i) of Table I gives estimates without

interrelated adjustment costs. Colun (ii) gives estimates with interre-

lated adjustment costs for capital, production workers, and non-production

workers. All other interrelated adjustment costs are insignificant and

insubstantial. Indeed, the adjustment costs for hours and shifts are like-

wise insignificant and economically unimportant so they are left out of

column (ii).

       It is difficult to evaluate the size of the adjustment costs based

on the parameters alone. It is informative to consider the marginal adjust-

ment costs that they imply. Consider first the costs of adjustment in the

equation for capital. The estimate of g of 0.0008 in column (ii) im-
                                                                                20


plies    an adjustment cost of 5.0 percent of the cost of investment. That

is, for an average amount of investment, if there is no gross change in

the amount of labor, output is reduced by 5.0 percent of amount of the

investment. Average investment in the sample is 9.6 and average output is

62 measured in billions of 1972 dollars at quarterly rate. Therefore, the

foregone output caused by adding the average amount of capital is less than

one percent of average output. In particular, it is substantially smaller

than    other estimates ISummers (1981) and Heese (1980) , for example]. Pindyck
and Rotemberg (1983) ,      on   the other hand, share my finding of moderate ad-
justment      costs.

         The interrelated adjustment costs for capital and production workers

and non-production workers are small: they are an order of magnitude smaller

than the own-adjustment cost of capital. The sign of g is negative,

so the cost of adjusting capital is reduced when non-production workers

are also being adjusted. That is, changing the stock of capital is facil-

itated by adding non-production workers.

         It is more difficult to evaluate the adjustment costs of labor be-

cause although the stock is being adjusted, labor, unlike capital, is paid

as a flow. In any case, one can compare the marginal adjustment costs to

the flow cost of labor. In the case of production workers the adjustment

costs   are all small. Consider the estimate of 0.0403 for g in (ii),
that is, the adjustment cost for non-production workers. It is substantial:
the marginal adjustment cost for the typical change in non-production workers
is   about 3 percent     of output   per   quarter. Non-production workers receive
about one quarter of output.
         In   summary,   the adjustment costs of both the work week of capital
and of labor are small. This result is not surprising given the relative
ease of adjusting the schedule of production relative to adjusting the stock
                                                                         21


of    an input. The cost of adjusting production workers is also small. The

cost of adjusting capital is significant but substantially smaller than
found in other studies. Thus, the estimate iuqlies quicker adjustment of
the   capital stock than others find.



5. Extensions

5.1. Failure of the Overidentifying Restrictions

         The J statistic given at the bottom of Table I is a test of the

overidentifying restrictions of the model. It is distributed as chi.-squared

with degrees of freedom equal to number of instruments minus number of parm-

eters. There are 114 instruments (19 instruments times 6 equations) so

the overidentifying restrictions are soundly rejected in all the specifi-

cations.

         Rotemberg (1984) suggests that if the overidentifying restrictions

of such a model are rejected, different instrument lists can yield widely

different estimates. Specifically, if the weighting of the instruments is

arbitrary, the estimates can have any probability limit. Note that the

weighting scheme is determined here not arbitrarily, but optimally by three-

stage least squares.

         In order to evaluate the problem raised by Rotemberg's work,

I present estimates of the model with alternative instrument lists.

The first uses just price data; the second uses just quantity data. This

division is economically as well as statistically meaningful. That is,

the stochastic properties of prices and quantities are very different. In

particular, factor quantities have high variance and are strongly pro-cyclic;

factor prices vary little and are only weakly cyclic.

         Estimates of the model with the two instruments lists are presented

in columns (ii) and (iii) of Table II. The exact lists are given at the
bottom of Table II. Both lists yield overidentification, but to a lesser

degree than by taking the union of the lists. Column (i) replicates column

(ii) of Table T for comparison. In columns (ii) and (iii), the parameters

    and w2 are constrained to have the same value as in column (1). The

estimates of w1 and w2 ,       the   parameters of the equation for the wage

bill (3), require both price and quantity data to be identified. Hence,

they are left out of the experiment.

        The estimates in column (ii) and column (iii) of Table II also strongly

reject the overidentifying restrIctions. Therefore, one cannot infer either

that it is only the price data or only the quantity data that are invalid

instruments. An economically meaningful way to evaluate the problem is

to see how much the estimates change given the rejection.

        The estimate of aL ,   the    production workers' output elasticity,

changes little over the choice of instruments. Likewise, the coefficient

aH is stable. The coefficient aN ,         the   output elasticity for non-

production workers, and consequently capitaPs implied output elasticity,

does change substantially. The implied aK is column (ii) is 0.18 which

is somewhat lower than conventional estimates. The coefficients in

the adjustment cost change more, but they are less precisely estimated

in the first instance. The most serious change occurs in g ,

where the estimate not using price data implies a very high adjustment

Cost.

        Errors in variables can be analyzed as a failure of the over-

identifying restrictions. The work week of capital contains a measurement

error because of the distribution of annual data to quarterly frequency.

The importance of this problem can be evaluated by considering estimates

where St is excluded from the instrument list. These estimates may be

consistent even if St is measured with error.           In column (Iv) of Table 2,
 I present estimates of the model where   St and its log are excluded from

 the instrument list. The estimates are virtually identical to those in

 colunni (i). Hence, the measurement error does not have a quantitatively

 important affect on the results.

        The results of the analysis of varying the instruments is indecisive.

 In particular, it does not isolate the invalid instruments as either belong-

 ing to the price or quantity subset. With either set of instruments, about

 half the coefficients are remarkably stable. The other half change by

 amounts that would importantly affect the dynamics implied by the model,

but they never change so much as to take on values that could be excluded

a priori. Moreover, it is a minor victory that I am able to arrive at a

not entirely implausible set of estimates with the price data alone as in-

struments even though they vary much less than the quantities. In any case,

one is less confident about the point estimates of the parameters that change

importantly.

       The rejection of the overidentifying restrictions indicates either

the theory is false or that some of the strong auxiliary assumptions are

false. These assumptions include a Cobb-Douglas production function and

the presence of only one lag in the cost of adjustment term. These assump-

tions could be relaxed by less parsimonious paranieterizations. A cost of

less parsimony is increased difficulty in interpreting the estimated pararn-

eters. On the other hand, a less parsimonious model is much more likely

to fail to reject the overidentifying restrictions. Seeking less parsiinon-

ious models that fail to reject overidentifying restrictions is not necessarily

a promising research strategy. Tests of such models are likely to lack power.

5.2. Aggregation Problem

        Problems with using aggregate data are pervasive in macroeconomics.

There is typically a tension between the theoretical discussion and the

empirical implementation. The aggregation problem is, perhaps, more severe

or more obvious, in the application to shift work. Specifically, finns

may be heterogeneous in their policies toward shift work. This section

evaluates the consequences of this aggregation problem for the analysis

in this paper.

        Suppose that there are two types of firms, one that always works

only one shift and one that has varying shifts. Let S1 be the constant

work week of the first type of firm and S2 be the work week of the second

type of firm. I assume that the fraction of type one firms is a constant,

b .   Then


             S =         4
(7)                bS1       (l-b)S2

All the variation in S comes from the second type of firm. Substituting

(7) into the objective function (5) and differentiating with respect to

the choice variable, S2 ,         yields   the following modified first-order con-

dition for S


(6e')        a5(1_b)Y/S = WtLtHtW2/HO


In light of the estimates of the adjustment cost coefficients, I set them

to zero. The tax rate cancels so (6e') is the familiar marginal product

equals marginal cost condition. The estimates of a in Table 2 do not

allow b to be separately identified. That b is large is another pos-

sible explanation for why a is estimated to be so much lower than aK

when w2 is freely estimated. If many firms, for whatever reason, never
                                                                              25




work late shifts, then the interpretation that shift work is unproductive

seems to be correct. In any case, b can be regarded as a normalization

of equation (6e') because a5 is a free parameter. Therefore, the reasons

discussed in footnote 11, whether there is an aggregation problem of this

type affects the interpretation of the coefficients but does not change

the dynamics iilied by the estimated model.



6. Dynamics

       In this section, I explore the dynamics implied by the estimates

of the model. In particular, I examine the effect of changes in the price

of capital and investors' required rate of return on the demand for capi-

tal and its work week. The estimates have broader application, but the aim

here is to study the demand for capital. Estimating the first-order conditions

of the model allows more realistic parameterizations than estimating the

solution directly. The model cannot, however, be solved analytically.

To study the dynamics, I linearize the first-order conditions to study the

response of the model to small changes in the cost of capital.

      The exact procedure I follow is (a) linearize the estimates of equa-

tions (6) and (3) from Table I, column (ii), about the sample average values

for the variables;12 (b) put the linearized system in the canonical form

of Blanchard and Kahn (1980) and solve it; and (c) examining how the factor
                                                            13
demands change when the price affecting them are changed.         Linearizing

these equations is unlikely to be misleading. First, the estimated cost

of adjustment parameters carry implications for the   dynamics.    The   simula-
tions serve to illustrate what the estimates already imply. Second, the

cost of adjustment terms are linear except for multiplication by the level

of other variables. These terms govern the dynamics of the simulation.
                                                                            26




Abel and Blanchard (1983) show linearizing such functional forms is a good

approximation.

          Some assumption must be made to close the model. In particular,

though the representative firm in the manufacturing sector is a price-taker

in the labor market, the sector as a whole does not face elastic labor supply.

To the contrary, labor supply is highly inelastic, and hence bounds the

response to a shock that could otherwise make the economy expand indefinitely.

I add a final relationship to the system to take into account inelastic

labor supply.      I assume that the labor supply curve has a constant elasticity

of o.i.14 The equation that labor supply equals labor demand is solved

with equations (6) and (3).

          I consider the effect of changing both the purchase price of capital

and the investors? required rate of return on the demand for capital and

its   work week.    I consider decreases in these two components of the iurplied
cost of capital, but the results are exactly reversed for increases. A
decrease    in the required rate of return of investors increases the discount

rate and hence increases the value of the firm. The discount rate, r

enters the del highly non-linearly. As I outline above, this problem is

overcome by linearizing the system. Bernanke (1983) uses a similar pro-

cedure.

          Figures 1 through 4 give the response of the capital stock and its

work week to different changes in the price of capital and the rate of re-

turn. The changes can be thought as changes in tax rates. A decrease in

the purchase price of capital can arise when the investment tax credit is

increased or depreciation allowances are liberalized. A decrease in investors'

required rate of return may occur when the tax rate on investment income

is   reduced.
                                                                            27




           In Figure 1, I present the change in the demand for capital and its

 work week for a permanent, ten percent reduction in the cost of capital.

 The reduction is unexpected; once it occurs, it is expected to, and indeed

 does, last indefinitely. The first column gives the change in the price.

 The second and third columns give the percent change in the stock and work

 week of capital. The fourth and fifth columns give the levels of the stock

 and work week (deviation from steady state). In the long run, the capital

 stock   increases by 3.1 percent and the work week of capital increases by 9.7
percent iiying respective elasticities of about one-third and one. The
capital stock is costly to adjust so it responds only gradually to the change
in   price. Half the adjustment has taken place after five quarters, which

is much more rapid than found in other studies. In a similar experiment,

Summers (1981) finds half the adjustment taking twenty years. The magnitudes

of the long run changes are comparable with those Summers estimates.'5

          The work week of capital is costless to adjust. Indeed, it overshoots

its steady state value by 17 percent in quarter 3. It then gradually falls

to its steady state value. For the entire period of adjustment, the firm

has a lower capital stock than it desires given the new factor prices.

Hence, it correspondingly increases the utilization of its stock by expand-

ing its work week. Note that the figures give the response of demand for

capital and its work week to changes in prices. The response of equilibrium

quantities will be smaller and depend on elasticities of supply. In par-

ticular, the interest rate may rise when demand for capital is stimulated

by policies such as the investment tax credit. Noreover, the premium for

work on late shifts may rise in the face of large increases in demand by

firms    for night work.
                                                                           28



       In Figure 2, I present the response of capital to the ten

percent decrease in its cost that is expected in quarter I to be perm-

anent. In quarter 9, the price of capital unexpectedly increases to its

original level. Through quarter 8, the dynamics are exactly as in the first

example. In quarter 9, when the firms   discover   that the reduction is only

temporary, they suddenly have capital substantially above the steady state

value of zero. Because of the ad-ustment cost, the stock only gradually

returns to its steady state value. On the other hand, the rate of utili-

zation is free to adjust and therefore overshoots to offset the capital

stock being above its steady-state value. The work week approaches the

steady state from below.

       Figure 3 gives   the response of capital to a permanent decrease

in investorst required rate of return.     It has a large effect on the

demand for capital because it increases the present discounted value

of cash flow as well as reducing the implied rental rate on capital. The

steady state increase in the capital stock from a ten percent reduction

in investors' required rate of return is 20.3 billion 1972 dollars, or ten

percent of the average stock.16 Because of the linearity of the solution,

the relative changes of the stock and the work week and the rates of adjust-

ment are exactly as in Figure 1. Note that the increase of the capital

stock would be smaller if the shock to the required rate of return were

not permanent, or, 'of course, if the shock were smaller.

       In a final experiment, I consider an expected, future, permanent

reduction in the investors' required rate of return. But when the reduc-

tion is expected to take place, it is revealed that no reduction will take

place. Hence, the interest rate never changes. These dynamics are displayed

in Figure 4. Such a scenario could occur if the govermnent announces

a tax cut on investors' income to take effect in 9 quarters, if
                                                                               29




 the firms believe the government, and if the government then reneges on its

commitment. This is an effective policy for temporarily increasing the

capital stock, but one which cannot be repeated often [see Fischer (1980)].

 Future flows from the current capital stock are discounted at a lower rate,

so the stock increases. In quarter 9, the firms discover they have been

misled. They only gradually reduce their capital stock, but immediately

adjust its utilization. Indeed, the utilization rate overshoots its steady

state value and approaches it from below.

         I find a potentially substantial effect of the real interest rate and

the purchase price of capital on the demand for capital. The standard view

is, however, that "The rental price of capital, a conglomeration of interest

rate and tax variables, is not very useful in explaining quarterly data of

business fixed investment in the United States over the past twenty-five

years" fClark (1979, p. 104)] .   Clark   does not conclude that the cost of

capital is unimportant in theory, but that they do not vary enough given

slow adjustment of the stock to be important in the data.

         The findings of this paper provide important challenges to this standard

view. First, I find a substantial effect of interest rates and factor prices

on the demand for capital. Second, the adjustment costs I estimate are

small enough so that the capital stock can respond somewhat to business-.

cycle frequency changes in interest rates and prices. Third, lower interest

rates increase the present discounted value of cash flow so future labor

services, which will be associated with the capital services, are also more

highly valued.

         It is useful to consider why prices and interest rates are important

in my model but not in non-structural reduced forms such as considered by

Clark.    ISee also Bernanke (1983) for a related discussion.] My procedure
                                                                           30




is as follows: I specify a structural model; I estimate the first-order

conditions of the model with a parameterization that is too complicated to

solve explicitly; and I linearize the estimated system to study its dynamics.

Clark estimates linear reduced forms. Although the linear reduced form

may correspond to some structural model, estimating it may not obey the

restrictions implied by the production function and by profit maximization

(in equation (6) for example))7 Consider equation (6a). The interest

rate enters the implied rental cost of capital by multiplying p ,    but
also by multiplying the future value of the factors. The implied reduced

form is highly non-linear in variables and parameters. It is easy to im-

pose the appropriate restrictions by estimating the first-order condition.

By linearizing after estimating, I impose the restrictions, at least locally,

when examining the effect of prices and interest rates on investment.



7. Conclusion

       This paper provides the analytic mechanism and empirical evidence

to analyze the dynamic demand for capital, labor, and their levels of util-

ization. The work week of capital measures the utilization of the stock.

It is constructed using data on the amount of shift work.

       The productivity of extending the work week of capital must be low

relative to the costs given how few late shifts are worked. The average

wage premium for working on late shifts is low. This implies that the output

elasticity will be estimated to be low.   I consider two alternative explana-

tions of these facts, both of which are consistent with the data, and both

of which imply the same macroeconomic dynamics. The first is that the
                                                                            31



marginal wage premium is much higher than the average wage premium. The
second   is that there is an aggregation problem if some firms have rules

against late shifts.

         The estimated adjustment costs are also consistent with theory. The

adjustment cost on capital is again estimated to be much lower than found

in other studies, imtlying more plausible rates of response to stocks.

As with hours of production workers, the work week of capital is virtually

costless to adjust. Thus, it provides a margin to easily absorb transitory

shocks to product or factor prices.

         Additionally, when the work week of capital is taken into account,

the output elasticity of the work week of labor is not substantially larger

than that of the stock of labor. Hence, the greater marginal product of

hours (Ht) compared to workers (Lt) the work week of capital is excluded

can be understood to arise because those extra hours imply a lengthening of

the work week of capital, not because a current worker working an extra

hour is more productive than a new worker. The estimates of (6) provide

some justification for letting hours and workers enter multiplicatively in

levels in the production function. On the other hand, their adjustment

costs and contribution to labor's compensation are very different.

         The work week of capital is essentially costless to adjust so it

will respond immediately to shocks whereas the stock of capital will respond

slowly. The plausibly estimated adjustment costs imply that the rate of

adjustment is not instantaneous, but is much more rapid than as estimated

in other studies. The work week of capital provides an extra margin along

which to adjust. In the response to a shock, the work week of capital will

overshoot to compensate for the slow adjustment of the stock. The ma2nitude

of the overshooting is about twenty percent.
                                                                             32




        I find a large effect on the capital stock of changing interest rates

and   factor   prices. These estimates provide a challenge to the standard

view that prices are not important in determining demand for capital. The

long run elasticity of the capital stock with respect to the price of capi-

tal is estimated to be about thirty percent. The elasticity with respect

to the required rate of return is about one.

A. Capacity Utilization Data

       This Appendix discusses how published data on capacity utilization do

not represent directly data on capital utilization. Ideally, one would have

an independent measure of the rate of utilization of each of labor and cap-

ital. At any point in time, the firm has four choices, how much labor and

capital to hire or buy, and at what rate to use each. Because higher util-

ization has a cost, it does not always pay to have maximum utilization.

       There are no published figures at the macroeconomic level for util-

ization of capital analogous to average hours of labor. An analogous figure

would measure the physical utilization of the capital. For a machine it

could measure the rate of speed of operation or percentage of the time it

is in operation. For a structure, it could measure the percentage of the

time it is in use. The published figures for capacity utilization reflect

the ratio of output to "potential output" rather than the actual utilization

of capital. One could imagine using energy consumption as a proxy for capital

utilization. Such a procedure again asks how much of an alternative factor

is utilized.

       The Fed constructs its index of capacity utilization by dividing its

index of industrial production by an index of capacity measured in units

of output.     [See the Federal Reserve System, Measures of Capacity and

Capacity Utilization (1978) for details.] It bases the index of capacity

on McGraw-Hill surveys and the BEA's data on capital stock. The capacity

figures are available only annually; the Fed interpolates the within-year

figures. Therefore, most of the variation in the Fed's index of capacity

utilization is caused by variation in output. Indeed, the concept being
                                                                          40




measured is close to output divided by potential or trend output.

       The BEA constructs its series for capacity utilization from a quar-

terly survey of firms. In the survey's questionnaires the BEA fails to

define what it means by capacity utilization but it "believe[s] that most

respondents use a measure of 'maximum practical capacity. "    [See Bureau

of Economic Analysis, Handbook of Cyclical Indicators (1977, p. 25), emphasis

added. ]   The BEA defines maximum practical capacity as output where a stand-

ard work-week's of labor to be supplied.

       Variations in both measures of capacity utilization come mainly from

the amount of labor input. Therefore, the choice of measured capacity

utilization is not independent from the choice of other inputs.


B. Data for the Estimates

       The data are quarterly for manufacturing from 1955 through 1980.

The output data         are the Federal Reserve Board's quarterly index of

output in manufacturing scaled so it equals annual NIPA output in 1967.

The quarterly data for investment is from the Survey of Current Business.

Structures and equipment are aggregated. I construct the capital stock

data (Kt) using a fixed depreciation rate of 0.0175 per quarter and a

benchmark net capital stock of 311.8 billion 1972 dollars at the end of

1981 (see the Survey of Current Business (October 1982, p. 33)). This de-

preciation rate is also imposed in estimating the Euler equations.

       The data for employment (Lt, N) ,     wages, the quit rate, and hours

are from the BLS establishment survey. The wage (wt) series is the aver-

age straight-time rate per hour for the production workers. The data on

average hourly earnings (w) are also used in equation (3). The hours

(Hr) series is total average weekly hours. Hours are multiplied by the
                                                                            41




number of weeks in the quarter in the marginal cost expressions in the Euler

equations to express cash flow at quarterly rate. To construct the fixed

cost of employing a worker     s- and sN ),    I   divide the compensation minus

wages, salaries, and contribution to social insurance into the number of

workers using annual national income and product accounts data. These costs

include employer contributions to pensions and health insurance. The annual

NIPA figures are interpolated.

       The expression for the price of capital is given in equation (4).

The purchase price          is the implicit deflator from the BEA. The

quarterly series for the present value of depreciation allowances (PVCCAt)

and the investment tax credit (ITCt) are those computed by Data Resources

Inc. The present value of depreciation allowances are computed using the

technique outlined by Jorgenson and Sullivan (1981). Expected tax savings

assuming current law remains unchanged are discounted by using the firm

structure of interest rates.     I estimate the required rate of return with

the after-tax, real return on three-month Treasury bills plus a constant

risk premiuiu of two percent per quarter.     I calculate the premium by taking

a weighted average of the   return   in excess of the return on Treasury bills

of the stock market and of corporate bonds. The weight for equity is 0.8.

The excess return of the stock market is 6,7 percent; the excess return of

corporate bonds is 0.6. ISee Ibbotson and Sinquefeld (1982, p. 15) .1       There-

fore, the premium is about eight percent at annual rate or about two percent

at quarterly rate.

       Construction of the work week of capital is discussed in detail in

the text. The data are given in Table A-i.

1This paper is a revision of the second chapter of my 1984 M.I.T. Ph.D dis-

sertation. I am very grateful to my committee, Stanley Fischer, Jerry

Hausman, and Olivier Blanchard, and to Andrew Abel, Ernst Berndt, Zvi

Griliches, N. Gregory Mankiw, James Poterba, David Romer, Julio Rotemberg,

and Lawrence Suimners for their extensive comments and discussion.    I grate-

fully acknowledge the financial support of the National Science Foundation

and   the Social Science Research Council Subcommittee on Monetary Research.

      has long   been observed that most capital in most countries is idle most

of the time (.see Foss (1963, 1981) and Betancourt and Clague (1981)). For

example, the average work week of capital for United States manufacturing

industries is 55 hours according to the series to be discussed below. This

low level of utilization is common across countries. Moreover, businesses

typically plan investment so that most capital is idle most of the time

(see Marris (1964, 1970)). That is, many firms plan to operate only one

shift. Given that the productivity of capital is not constrained by pref-

erence, custom, law, or biology as is labor, it seems surprising that the

work week of capital only slightly exceeds that of labor. The biological

and social constraints on shift work are discussed in Mott, etal. (1965),

Maurice (1975), and Hedges and Sekscenski (1979). Mott, etal. provide

survey evidence on attitudes of workers and their families toward work on

late shifts. Work on late shifts yields substantial disutility beyond work

in the day, but the added disutility does not appear to be enough to explain

the low level of shift work. Maurice provides a summary of law about shift

work for a sample of developed countries. Hedges and Sekscenski survey the
                                                                         44




biological literature on the physiological effects of work on late shifts.

Winston (1974, 1982) surveys the theoretical literature on the utilization

puzzle. Betancourt and Clague study the choice of shift work in a static

context.


31f there is only one shift then average hours of workers would also be the

average hours of capital.


4The sources of the annual data on the distribution of shift work is the

Bureau of Labor Statistics, Area Wage Surveys: Metropolitan Areas, United

States and Regional Summaries, various years. [The BLS report numbers are

1660—92, 1685—92, 1725-96, 1775-98, 1795-29, 1850—89, 1900—82, and 1950-77,

Table B-i.] I am grateful to the BLS for providing me with unpublished

data for years after 1978. Murray Foss provided me with part of an unpub-

fished monograph which alerted me to these data.


51n the estimates of the model itself, the data are not detrended.


6Feldstein and Foot (1971) and Eisner (1978) include capacity utilization

in a regression to explain investment. In their models, firms are quantity

constrained, so capacity utilization is a proxy for the shadow profitability

of investment. A quantity-constrained firm with low utilization has little

incentive, to add capacity.


7Shapiro (1984) gives more detailed consideration of a related model but

where capital is utilized at a constant rate given labor input.
                                                                                 45




    8i estimate the required rate of return with   the   after-tax, real return on

    three-month Treasury bills plus a constant risk premium of two percent per

    quarter. See Appendix for details. An instrumental variables procedure

    allows consistent estimation even though the rate of return is uncertain

    and may, in general, covary with the other variables in equation (5).


9Use of output data makes the     productivity   shock observable (abstracting

from the sampling error in the estimated parameters). Hence, these esti-

mates do not become unidentified in the presence of productivity shocks as

discussed by Garber and King (1983). In their paper, the shocks are unob-

servable. Of course, identification of this model, as with all models,

depends on assumptions on the error terms. In any case, the approach in

this paper of incorporating a particular productivity shock seems a substan-

tial improvement over the standard practice of assuming that there are no

shocks at all.

     If shifts are omitted from the analysis, the output elasticity of hours

will be substantially greater than that of production workers because the

hours of workers are then in part proxying for the hours of capital.



Consider rescaling the shift work equation (6e) by multiplying it by a

constant. Note that the estimated coefficients for the cost of adjustment

'               ,   and so on) are essentially zero. Hence, multiplying (6e)

by a constant will simply increase a and w2 by the sane proportion.

Suppose we wished to constrain aS to equal the estimated aK ,            which

is about one-quarter. To achieve this, equation (6e) would be multiplied

by about ten. In particular, the implied w2 would be about ten times
                                                                                                                         46



the estimated value of 0.05, that is 0.5. Hence, if we imDose that the

productivity of capital and shifts are the same, the implied shift premium

is exactly the overtime premium. Hence, one way of understanding the low

propensity to use late shifts is that the actual cost of running late shifts

is substantially higher than the data seems to ily. Note, however, that

this issue only effects the interpretation of the coefficients. The dynamics

studied below are unchanged by the scale of equation (6e).

estimates. I ignore technological progress so the simulations are devia-

tions from the steady state.


     alternative would be to simulate the non-linear Euler equations. Given

that more assuniptions are needed to simulate the model than to estimate it

(see footnote 14) ,        studying        the linearized system is a cost effective way

to approximate its dynamic properties. The simulations are carried out

using a computer program written by                          Jeffery      Zax and provided to me by

Olivier Blanchard.

 14Hausman (1981) estimates the uncompensated wage elasticity of labor suDply

 to be virtually nil for adult males, but substantially higher for females.

Ten percent in a compromise.   I assume that non-production workers are in

elastic supply because the sector demands relatively few of them. Also,

implicit in the simulations is that the price of capital is given except

for the tax considerations and that capital is elastically supplied.


'5Suinmers studies the entire non-farm business economy which is over four

times the size of manufacturing. His simulation in Table 6 (p. 37) yields

results substantially similar to those in this paper in the long run, but

with much slower adjustment to the steady state.


16This change in the capital stock is larger than Summer's (p. 109). He

assumes inelastic labor supply, which could partially account for the differ-

ences. It may also be the case that my linearization breaks down for changes

this large.


'71n that I reject the overidentifying restrictions my estimates are not

consistent. It is difficult to judge the consistency of estimates in

Clark'S tradition.
