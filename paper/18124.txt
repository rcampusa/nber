Water Availability as a Constraint on China's Future Growth

JEL No. O44,O47,Q25

                                               ABSTRACT

Recent writings on China’s water situation often portray China’s water problems as severe and suggest
that water availability could threaten the sustainability of China’s future growth. However, China’s
high growth of the last 20 years or more has been obtained with relatively little increase in the physical
volume of water. In this paper, we use a growth accounting approach to investigate both the contribution
played in the past by water availability in constraining China’s growth performance, and what would
be involved in the future. We use a modified version of Solow growth accounting in which water in
efficiency units enters the production technology, and investment in water management assets raises
efficiency of water use. Our results suggest that if investments in water assets in the future were lower
than they were in the past, growth might slightly increase by about 0.1 percentage points if non-water
capital and water in efficiency units are close substitutes but growth rates could decrease by as much
as 0.2-3.9 percentage points if investments in water assets were small, and if the elasticities of substitution
were low. On the other hand, our experiments suggest that with faster growth of investments in water
assets than in the past and a low elasticity of substitution growth rates could increase. But if non-water
capital and water in efficiency units are close substitutes growth rates could even decrease, as in other
cases.

1. Introduction


     There has been considerable discussion in popular writings on China’s potential to
continue high growth performance at rates comparable to those prevailing before the
2008 financial crisis of water availability as a constraint on future growth prospects
(Naughton, 2007; Shalizi, 2008; Gleick, 2009; Jiang 2009; World Bank, 2009). In
agriculture growing consumption of grains, the grain requirements of sharply increased
meat consumption, falling water tables in the North China plain and rising water
demands from increased agricultural output have all attracted attention. And in urban
areas sharply increasing water demand from rapid urbanization and industrialization are
thought to play a similar role.
     Over the past 20 years, however, China has been able to experience continued
high growth with relatively small increase in the physical volume of water used. Since
1990 China’s GDP growth has been around 10% per year while water use increased by
only 14.8% in total between 1993 and 2009. Agricultural water use, which is the largest
user of water in 2009 accounting for about 63% of total water use, decreased by 8%
between 1993 and 2009. Agricultural water use increased until the mid 1990s but
decreased later as agricultural water use efficiency increased (Jin and Young, 2001;
Shalizi, 2006). This has been achieved through increased investment in water treatment
plants, improved irrigation and water management, and water diversion and other
infrastructure projects. The throughput of water volume in the economy has grown
much more slowly than the economy in general, since through investment in water
management assets the speed and ease of reuse has increased. Thus, water use per
capita in China differs by only small amounts from much higher income per capita
economies in Europe and North America, and has changed far less over time than GDP,
suggesting water availability need not be a serious impediment to future higher growth.
     Here we investigate water availability as a potential constraint on Chinese growth
using a growth accounting framework in which water enters the aggregate production
function along with capital and labour, but in efficiency terms reflecting speed and



                                          ‐2‐
quality of water treatment. The efficiency of water use can be raised through
investment in water management and so Chinese investment is differentiated between
water management assets and all other assets. Using calibration procedures we
calibrate a water efficiency function which relates increments in efficiency units of
water to investment in water assets in each period using a power function. We then
perform growth accounting analysis for the period 1998‐2009 using this structure, and
forward project growth rates using various assumed investment rates in water and
other assets over a 10 year period.
     Our results suggest that if water asset investment occurs at similar rates as for
other assets, water availability need not constrain future high growth in China. The
extent of any such constraint depends on the elasticity of substitution in technology.
Water constraints also depend on elasticities of substitution between water and other
inputs in production.

2. China’s Water Situation


      Recent writings on China’s water situation often portray China’s water problems as
severe and suggest that water availability could threaten the sustainability of China’s
future growth (Shalizi, 2008; Gleick, 2009; Jiang 2009; World Bank, 2009). Gleick (2009)
reports that China’s water problems are poor water quality, water‐related
environmental disasters, water availability and quantity, groundwater overdraft, floods
and droughts, climate change and water, water and politics and growing regional
conflicts over water. Since 1980 China’s water quality 2 decreased due to rapid
industrialization, urbanization and intensive use of agricultural pesticides and fertilizers.
Water in China is severely contaminated with pollutants from untreated industrial and
municipal wastewater and from agricultural pesticides and fertilizers. It is estimated that
40% of surface water can be used only for industrial or agricultural use (Gleick, 2009)
and that water quality in 20.7% of China’s river length in below class V, which means
that it is not safe for human contact or appropriate even for irrigation (Naughton, 2007).
The World Bank (2009) estimates that water that is below class V is used to irrigate
about 7.4% of China’s irrigated land especially in North China plain. This type of water is
essentially wastewater that lowers harvests and reduces the quality of crops.
      In addition to water quality deterioration, water shortage is another major source
of concern. Water is unevenly distributed between Southern and Northern China, with
Northern China having far less water per capita than Southern China. This uneven
distribution of water has led to reliance on groundwater in the North China Plain which
is unsustainable. Water is extracted from underground faster than the natural capability
of reload and this has caused the water table to fall especially in Hebei province. In the
Hai River basin water tables fall by 0.5 m per year and in Beijing groundwater tables fell
by 100‐300 m (Jiang, 2009).

 As measured by biological oxygen demand and chemical oxygen demand. Water quality decreases as it is
depleted of oxygen and the increasing presence of heavy metals and chlorinated hydrocarbons in the
water also decreases its quality (see Naughton, 2007).


                                                ‐4‐
     Climate change compounds China’s water problems because rising temperatures
accelerate the melting of glaciers (Gleick, 2009). China is one of the largest countries in
the world covered by glaciers. However, due to climate change it is estimated that
glaciers decreased by about a third in the past century. In many regions in China, water
is obtained from glaciers melting and the loss of glaciers leads to fewer water resources.
     Another recent study by Jiang (2009) suggests that the severity of China’s water
problems could threaten China’s food security and extends China’s water problems to a
global scale. If China had to rely on global markets to feed its population it could have
major impacts on the global economy through increasing demand of food and
increasing prices for food products. Brown (1996) goes even further and says that
“China’s water scarcity will become the world’s water scarcity”. He suggests that China’s
rapid industrialization and increasing incomes will increase the demand for food and
combined with water scarcity could led China to rely heavily on food imports.
     Despite all of the problems related to water availability, while China’s economic
growth over the last 2 decades was high this growth was achieved with little increase in
physical water use. Table 1 reports data on China’s water use and real GDP growth from
1997 to 2009. The data show that water use increased very little. In 1997 water use
(measured in 100 million cu.m.) was 5,566 and it increased to 5,965 in 2009, a 7.2%
increase. In contrast, real GDP (measured in 100 million 1995 yuan) increased from
72,493 to 204,251, a 181% increase, over the same period.
     The slow growth in water use over the last decade was achieved by increased
investment in water treatment plants, improved irrigation and water management, and
water diversion and other infrastructure projects. Table 1 reports growth rates of
investments in non‐water assets and growth rates of investments in water assets.
Investments in water assets grew 3‐4 times faster than investments in non‐water assets
in the period 1997‐2000. In 2001 the growth rate of investments in water assets was
almost zero and picked up again in 2002‐2004 when it was almost the same at the
growth of investments in non‐water assets. In 2009 the growth rate of investment in
water assets reached 58%, the highest since 1997.

        Table 2 shows that nominal investments in water assets increased 17 fold in the
last 14 years from 29 to 503 billion yuan (nominal investments in non‐water assets
increased 7.5 fold over the same period). Investments in the period 2006‐2009 totaled
1,314 billion yuan and surpassed the investments for the period 1995‐2005 which
totaled 1,168 billion yuan. Moreover, the Chinese government announced that
investments in water assets would amount to 4 trillion renminbi over the next 10 years 3
which is twice as high as investments made in the last 10 years. The largest investments
are in management of water conservancy which account, on average, for 53% of total
investments and investments in production and supply of water which account for 27%
of total investments. Data on investments in drainage works and treatment in
wastewater are not available before 2000 or there were no investments in these, but

        Even though water quality is still below national standards in many rivers, China
made significant progress at improving the treatment rate of wastewater through
investments in wastewater treatment facilities. Wastewater treatment is a relatively
recent phenomenon as can be seen from the data. In 1980 China had only about 20
wastewater treatment plants which were small with low capacity of water treatment.
Through increased investment, in 2000 the number of wastewater treatment facilities
increased to 400. The urban wastewater treatment rate increased from 16.2% to 35% in
2000. 4 In 2005 the municipal wastewater treatment rate was 45%. The 11th Five Year
Plan set a target to increase the municipal wastewater treatment rate to 70% by 2010.
However, in small cities, towns and rural areas the wastewater treatment rate is still

much lower and overall in China it seems that wastewater treatment rate is as low as
20%. In 2002, 500 municipal treatment facilities operated in 310 of the 660 of cities, but
17,000 towns had no municipal wastewater treatment facilities (OECD, 2007).
Compared to the OECD, the share of China’s urban population connected to wastewater
treatment plants in the early 2000s was about 33%, while in the OECD on average it was
64% and in some countries such as Germany and UK it was as high as 90‐95%.
      Industrial wastewater treatment has also improved in the last 10‐15 years.
According to the OECD (2007) there were more than 60,000 industrial wastewater
treatment plants built in China and about 90% of industrial discharge complies with
national standards. The building of so many wastewater treatment plants came as a
result of Chinese policy that required industries that are heavy polluters to treat the
water or to close the enterprise if water treatment was not feasible.
      In the agricultural sector, which is the largest user of water, water saving
technologies have also been expanded in recent years (see Blanke et al, 2007) which
increases the efficiency of water use 5 . Blanke et al. conducted two surveys in Northern
China provinces covering more than 400 villages and found that the most benefit in
water saving came from water saving technologies adopted at the household level. In
the early 1990s the rates of use of household water saving technologies accelerated. In
1995 surface pipe use was 23% and in 2004 it increased to 48%. The use of other water
saving technologies at household level have also increased such as drought resistant
technologies, plastic sheeting and retaining stubble. On the other hand, traditional
technologies (such as border irrigation, furrow irrigation, level fields) and saving
technologies at community level (such as underground pipe, lined canal and sprinkler)
grew more slowly. For example, the adoption rate of lined canals increased between the
early 1990s and 2004 but the adoption is still low at only 25% in Northern China. The
water saving technologies that expanded more slowly require high fixed investments.
But even though water saving technologies in agriculture expanded in recent years in

 Water use efficiency is defined as crop production at the field level per unit of water input (see Blanke et
al (2007).

China increasing water use efficiency, the efficiency of irrigation is still low (40‐50% in
China and 55‐65% in North China Plain) (see Blanke et al. 2007; Hubacek and Sun, 2007).
     China has also undertaken major investments in projects to transfer water from
the South to water scarce Northern China. A South‐North water transfer project is being
built to transfer 45 billion cubic meters per year to the North China Plain from the
Yangtze River basin by 2020 and it was approved in 2002 (OECD, 2007; Gleick, 2009).
The construction of a western route was expected to begin in 2010 and will transfer 17
billion cubic meters per year at a cost of around USD 37 billion. The central route will
transfer 14.6 billion cubic meters by 2020. The eastern route already transfers 9 billion
cubic meters and this will increase by 2020 to 13 billion cubic meters. The costs for the
eastern and central routes will be USD 14.5 billion and USD 3 billion in resettlement
costs. However, even all this may not be enough to meet China’s growing demands for
water. According to the Ministry of Water Resources (2007) additional investments in
key water projects were 96 billion yuan to harness 717 large rivers and lakes which were
under construction in 2007, 63 billion yuan accumulative investment in reservoir
projects including completion of Phase‐III of the Three Gorges Project, investments in
irrigation, drainage and rural water supply, rural hydropower and electrification, soil and
water conservation and ecology restoration and capacity building.

3. China’s Growth and Water Constraints: A Growth Accounting Approach


     We use a growth accounting framework to assess both the past and potential
future effects of water availability on China’s real output growth. Unlike in traditional
growth accounting exercises which use only two factors of production (capital and
labour) and total factor productivity, here we add a third factor of production, water.
This, however, enters the production function in efficiency units to also reflect water
treatment and recycling as well as physical volume. Thus if investment in recycling
occurs, water in physical volume terms need not expand for water in efficiency units to
increase. We distinguish between Chinese investments in water assets and investments
in all other assets. Investments in water assets increase the efficiency of water use, but
the resources shifted to improve water use efficiency cannot be used in other
productive activities.
     Growth accounting exercises decompose the growth rate of output into a growth
rate of factors of production (capital, labour and water) and a growth rate of total factor
productivity (TFP). Thus, it is possible to find what portion of China’s growth is
attributable to the growth in capital stock, labour and improved water use efficiency.
Total factor productivity in the growth accounting exercise is a “residual” and it
accounts for the growth in output that is not explained by the growth in factor inputs
weighted by their respective shares in national output. Essentially, the growth of total
factor productivity accounts for the efficiency change in the combined use of capital and
labour but because it is “residual” total factor productivity can embody many other
things in addition to efficiency change such as technological progress and omitted
variables.
     Growth accounting originates with Solow (1957) who ran an experiment on the US
economy for the period 1909‐1949 using 2 factor inputs (capital and labour). Solow
wanted to find out how much of the increase in output per man hour was attributable
to technical change (shifts in the production function) and how much was attributable
to the increase in capital per man hour (movements along the production function). His



                                           ‐ 10 ‐
results showed that 87.5% of the increase in output per man hour in the US was due to
technical change and 12.5% of the increase was due to an increase of capital per man
hour. His initial calculations were modified and extended in various ways in Kendrick
(1961), Denison (1962), and Jorgenson and Griliches (1967).
           More recently, Wang and Yao (2003) and Whalley and Zhao (2010) have used a
growth accounting framework to find the contribution of total factor productivity and
factor input growth to China’s economic growth. They also incorporate human capital
accumulation into the growth accounting exercise. They find that human capital
accumulation played an important role in the growth of Chinese economy. They use a
Cobb‐Douglas production function.
         Here, we assume that China’s production function can be characterized by the
following three factor input function, with capital, labour and water as inputs


         Yt  At F ( K t , Lt , etW )                                               (1)


where Y is the output, A is total factor productivity, K is the capital stock in non‐water
assets, L is the quantity of labour, W is the quantity of water used and e is the
efficiency of water use. The quantity of water use changes little over time, which is
represented by the bar sign on W . The et that we use in the production function allows

for water management‐augmenting technological progress which is the result of
investments in water assets; that is, even though the growth of water use remains
constant, if water‐augmenting technological progress through investments in water
assets increases it is as if water inputs would grow with unchanged technology 6 . Thus
water use does not have to increase in order to increase output; water use could remain
constant and if China invests in more water management assets, water is used more
efficiently and water is not a constraint.

where At is Hicksian neutral technological progress,  is the elasticity of substitution

between non‐water capital and water,  is the elasticity of substitution between labour
and the composite of capital and water and a and b are share parameters.
         The elasticity of substitution,  , shows how easily water and non‐water capital
can be substituted for each other, and the elasticity of substitution,  , shows how
easily labour and the composite of non‐water capital and water can be substituted for
each other. With an aggregate production function that has an elasticity of substitution
less than one the diminishing returns to the faster growing factor occur faster than
otherwise. For given water augmenting technological progress, and a given elasticity of
substitution between water and non‐water capital, as the implicit price of water
increases, the share of water in the production also increases.

  It is common to argue that water and capital are pairwise complements. In this function, substitutability
only occurs between the composite of capital and water and labour, and so there is no calibration for the
pairwise capital‐water substitution possibilities. Kemfert (1998) discusses this also.

Germany industry using three approaches of a two‐level CES production function.

where (1  a) is the share of national income attributed to labour, a is the share of
national income attributed to a composite of non‐water capital and water, (1  b) is the
share attributed to water and b is the share attributed to non‐water capital 9 . The shares
of factors of production in output are the factor social marginal products multiplied by
factor inputs and divided by output. We assume that factors are paid their marginal
products with the exception of water. The production function is a constant returns to
scale production function.
          Using calibration procedures we next calibrate a water efficiency function which
relates increments in efficiency units of water to investment in water assets in each
period using a power function of the following form:


        eˆ  g ( I w )  a ( I w ) b ; b  1                                                           (5)


where ê is the increment in the period in efficiency units of water use, I w is investment
in water assets and a and b are positive numbers with b  1 . The expectation is that
b will be a positive number but less than 1 due to diminishing incremental efficiency
returns to investments in water assets.
          Here, we investigate the degree to which water availability could constrain
China’s growth under the different assumptions on elasticities of substitution. The
elasticticy of substitution between labour and the composite of non‐water capital and
water in efficiency units is held constant at unity. The assumptions on the elasticity of

 If the elasticties of substitution are unity, the production function is Cobb‐Douglas and factor shares are
constant. If the elasticity of substitution between non‐water capital and water in efficiency units is greater
or less than 1 non‐water capital and water shares will change over time if the non‐water capital‐water in
efficiency units ratio changes. For example, if the elasticity of substitution is less than 1, an increase in
non‐water capital‐water in efficiency units ratio will result in an increase in the water share over time.

4.1 Output


      GDP data is from China Statistical Yearbook various years and covers the period
1995‐2009. Because GDP data reported in China Statistical Yearbooks is in nominal
terms (at current prices) we construct a GDP deflator to convert nominal GDP data into
the real terms which are actually used in our growth accounting exercise. We choose
1995 as the base year. Following Zheng et al. (2009), we first calculate a year‐on‐year
GDP deflator and calculate the GDP deflator and real GDP using the following:

Indices of GDP that are reported in China Statistical Yearbook are calculated at
comparable constant prices with the previous year as the base year (ie 100). Table 3

4.2 Capital Stock Data


     Capital stock data for non‐water assets is not directly available in the China
Statistical Yearbook. To construct capital stock data we use an initial real capital stock
for year 1995 calculated by Wang and Yao (2003) (from which we deduct the initial
capital stock in water assets) and gross fixed capital formation from the Chinese
Statistical Yearbook (2010). Wang and Yao (2003) estimate capital stock based on
investment data from Hsueh‐Li for the period 1952‐1995 and from CSY for 1996‐1999.
They use total social fixed investment to measure gross fixed capital formation.
     Our chosen series to construct the capital stock is gross fixed capital formation
because this is a more accurate measure of the change in reproducible capital stock (see
Bai et al, 2006). We observed that investment in fixed assets to GDP ratio increased
from 32% of GDP in 1995 to 65% in 2009. NBS includes in investment in fixed assets the
value of land purchases and expenditure on used machinery and preexisting structures.
These should not be included in the calculation of the capital stock. On the other hand,



                                                       ‐ 15 ‐
NBS does not count expenditures on small‐scale investment projects. Liang (2006) note
that China’s real estate development expanded fast in recent years which led to an
overstatement of investment if land purchases are included in investment spending.
       For gross fixed capital formation we rely on Table 2‐18 [CSY, 2010] from national
accounts which provides data on components of GDP by expenditure approach for the
period 1978‐2009 at current prices. Gross fixed capital formation is defined by [CSY,
2010] as “the value of acquisitions less those disposals of fixed assets during a given
period. Fixed assets are the assets produced through production activities with unit
value above a specified amount and which could be used for over one year….Total
tangible fixed capital formation includes the value of the construction projects and
installation projects completed and the equipment, apparatus and instruments
purchased (less those disposed) as well as the value of land improved… Total intangible
fixed capital formation includes the prospecting of minerals and the acquisition of
computer software minus the disposal of them”.
     Therefore, this series does not include the land purchases and expenditure on
used machinery and preexisting structures but it includes the expenditures on small‐
scale investment projects. Gross fixed capital formation (in nominal terms) grew at a
much slower rate after 2003 compared with investment in fixed assets and its share in
GDP in 2009 was 45% as opposed to 65% for investment in fixed assets. Between 2003
and 2009 gross fixed capital formation grew at 20% per year while investment in fixed
assets grew at 26.4% per year. Between 1995 and 2002 the levels and growth rates for
both series are almost the same.
     We use the price index for investment in fixed assets reported in Table 9‐1 [CSY,
2010] to calculate the real investment in fixed assets (see Table 4) and the real capital
stock is then calculated via a perpetual inventory method using


      K t  I t  (1   ) K t 1                                                    (9)




                                          ‐ 16 ‐
where the real capital stock at time t is equal to the sum of investment in fixed assets at
time t and the balance of the depreciated capital stock from the previous period;
and  is the depreciation rate. Here we use a depreciation rate of 5% as in Wang and
Yao (2003) and Zheng et al. (2009).

         The price index is important in the calculation of the growth of real output, the
growth of real capital stock in non‐water assets and the growth of real capital stock in
water assets. Literature on China argues that the rate of inflation is often
underestimated and therefore, real output growth is overestimated (Bosworth and
Collins, 2007). The same argument also applies to the calculation of the growth rate of
the real capital stock. If the price index is underestimated, the growth rate of real capital
stock is overestimated. As a result of this problem with the data, alternative price
indexes have been constructed by Young (2003) and other researchers.


                                                       ‐ 17 ‐
     Here, we calculate the real variables based on Chinese prices indices. These
Chinese indices show that the inflation rate was faster for GDP in general than for
investments in fixed assets. Indices of GDP are higher than the price indices of
investment in fixed assets. These calculations show that the growth in real capital stock
in non‐water assets accelerated especially after 2002 from 10‐11% per year to 13‐15%
per year in 2008‐2009 (see Table 4).
     In our calculations, we assume that there is no idle capacity for the capital stock. If
there is idle capacity the calculation needs adjustments for the capital stock that is not
in use. Because there is a lack of data on the utilization of capital, this could be
approximated by the labour force unemployed. Capital stock in use in each year would
be equal to the capital in place multiplied by the percentage of the labor force
unemployed under the assumption that idle capital stock and labour unemployed are
equal with the same percentage (Solow, 1957). China’s unemployment rates are not
high; in 2008‐2009 these were in the range of 3‐4% depending on the region. Thus,
taking into calculation the idle capacity of the capital stock would thus likely not
significantly change our calculations.
     Investments in water assets refer to investments in the production and supply of
water, investments in geologic prospecting, investments in management of water
conservancy, investments in drainage works and investments in treatment of
wastewater. The data is denominated in 100 million yuan and is taken from CSY various
years and covers the period 1995‐2009. In 2004 the National Bureau of Statistics of
China changed the format for reporting these investments. Between 1995 and 2003,
investments in fixed assets were reported as investment in capital construction and
investment in innovation by type of construction and sector. Since 2004 data on
investments in fixed assets is reported as investments in fixed assets, and in both urban
and rural areas. CSY reports data by sector only for investments in urban areas. For
nominal investment in fixed assets in production and supply of water, geologic
prospecting and management of water conservancy (investment in capital construction
and investment in innovation) we rely on Tables 5‐14 and 5‐19 [CSY, 1996], Tables 5‐16



                                           ‐ 18 ‐
and 5‐21 [CSY, 1997], Tables 6‐16 and 6‐21 [CSY, 1998, 1999], Tables 6‐16 and 6‐20 [CSY,
2000, 2001, 2002, ], Tables 6‐9 and 6‐22 [CSY, 2004], Table 6‐13 [CSY, 2005‐2007] and
Table 5‐13 [CSY, 2008‐2010].
     Investments in drainage works and treatment of wastewater data is taken from
Table 12‐47 [CSY, 2010] “Investment in the Treatment of Environmental Pollution” and
Table 12‐49 [CSY, 2010] “Investment Completed in the Treatment of Industrial
Pollution” from the Resources and Environment section of the China Statistical Yearbook.
Table 12‐47 “Investment in the Treatment of Environmental Pollution” reports data on
Investment in Urban Environmental Infrastructure (Gas Supply, Centralized Heating,
Drainage Works, Gardening and Greening, Environmental Sanitation), Investment in the
Treatment of Industrial Pollution (Treatment of Waste Water, Treatment of Waste Gas,
Treatment of Solid Waste, Treatment of Noise Pollution and Treatment of Other
Pollution) and the “Three Simultaneities” Environmental Investment for New Projects.
Here we use only data that is related directly to water treatment such as drainage works
and treatment of waste water. The data on investment in drainage works is available
starting in the year 2000 and investment in treatment of wastewater is available starting
in the year 1999.
     The initial capital stock in water assets in year 1995 is not directly available in the
China Statistical Yearbook nor is it calculated in previous research studies. Thus we rely
on a method of calculation of the initial capital stock reported by Nehru and
Dhareshwar (1993). We calculate the capital stock in water assets each year via a
perpetual inventory method initially assuming that the initial capital stock in water
assets is zero. Then we calculate the average of the capital‐output ratio for the years
2005‐2009 and apply this ratio to find the initial capital stock in the year 1995. The
average capital‐output ratio in the last 5 years is 0.071 and the initial water asset capital
stock in year 1995 is 4,338.13 (100 million yuan).
     When the initial capital stock is estimated, the real capital stock calculated in the
first 2‐3 years is sensitive to the initial capital stock estimate (Barro and Sala‐i‐Martin,
2004). This can be seen from Table 5 where the growth rates of the real water capital



                                            ‐ 19 ‐
stock between 1996 and 1998 are lower (3‐7% per year) than in subsequent years,
suggesting that the initial capital stock could be overestimated and real investments are
low relative to the real capital stock in water assets. But as the real capital stock in
water assets depreciates, the capital stock becomes more accurate, especially from
1999 on, when growth rates remain in the range of 10‐13% per year.

4.3 Labor Data


            Labor force data is from World Bank Development Indicators database and is for
the years 1995 to 2009. The total labor force consists of economically active population
of age 15 or older as reported by the International Labour Organization criteria. We
assume that average hours per worker do not change over the period. 11

11
  We take the labor input in production as the number of hours worked in a year under the assumption
that each worker worked 2,080 hours per year.


                                                       ‐ 20 ‐
4.4 Factor Shares


     The shares of factors of production in output are the factor social marginal
products multiplied by factor inputs and divided by output. In order to compute factor
shares we need to have estimates for the social marginal products of labour, capital and
water. These are not directly available from the data but the assumption used in the
research literature is that the social marginal products are equal to their input prices
(Barro and Sala‐i‐Martin, 2004). Therefore, the social marginal product of capital is equal
to the rental rate of capital and the social marginal product of labour is equal to the
wage rate.
     Labour factor shares are calculated using data from China’s National Accounts. We
use Table 2‐16 [CSY, 2008‐2010], Table 3‐10 [CSY, 1998‐2003, 2006], Table 3‐12 [CSY,
2004, 2005], Table 2‐17 [CSY, 1997] and Table 2‐18 [CSY, 1996] which report data for 31
regions based on an income approach to components of gross regional product. The
data is calculated at current prices. We obtain labour shares as the ratio of
compensation of employees to the sum of gross regional product. The NBS defines the
compensation of employees as “the total payment of various forms to employees for
the productive activities they are engaged in… includes wages, bonuses and allowances,
which the employees earn in cash or in kind… includes the free medical services
provided to the employees and the medicine expenses, transport subsidies and social
insurance, and housing fund paid by the employers”. Between 1995 and 2004 the
labour share is stable in the range of 0.50‐0.53. In 2005 it decreased to 0.41 and
remained at this value until 2008. In 2009 the labour share increased again to 0.47. On
average for the entire period labour share it was 0.48. This is almost the same as the
labour share used by Wang and Yao (2003) but is smaller than the labour share
computed by Young (2003) who found an average labour share of 0.6 for the period
1978‐1997.
     In the case of China, the assumption that social marginal product of water is equal
to the water price is not realistic. It is common in developing countries that water prices



                                           ‐ 21 ‐
are usually significantly lower than their marginal product. Wang and Lall (2002)
estimated the marginal productivity of water using a production function for the
industrial sector with 5 inputs (capital, labour, water, energy and other raw materials)
and data for about 2,000 Chinese industrial firms. They obtained data from China’s State
Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) for 1993, and found that the industry
average marginal productivity of water was 2.45 yuan per cubic meter of water while
the price of water in 1996 was in the range of 0.70 and 1.20 yuan in cities in Hebei
Province. This suggests that the water price was about 2 to 3.5 times lower than the
marginal product. Giving that the comparison data is for year 1996 and the study uses
data for year 1993, the gap between water price and marginal product could be even
larger. The authors also note that their sample consists of large and medium sized
enterprises and that the marginal value product of water could be as high as 3.92 yuan
per cubic meter of water if small‐scale industries were included.
     Also, World Bank (1997) noted that the willingness to pay was about 1.8 yuan per
cubic meter in some coastal cities and 4.3 yuan per cubic meter in a representative city
for water‐scarce Hai River Basin. The industries’ economic value of water in Shanxi and
Hai River Basin was about 24 yuan per cubic meter; in sharp contrast with the average
price in the region which was in the range of 0.5‐0.9 yuan per cubic meter.
    Because the marginal product of water is higher than the price charged for water,
we calculate the share parameter of water (1  b) under different assumptions. These
are if the marginal product of water is 4 times higher than the average price of water
reported by the Ministry of Water Resources 2006 and 2007, and if the marginal
product of water is 8 times higher and 12 times higher. The implied values for
distribution parameters in the aggregate production function are reported in Table 6.

4.5 e‐function


     To calibrate the e function, we find the values for the positive parameters a and
b by constructing a system of two equations and solving for the two parameters. Our
system of equations takes the efficiency of water use at time t , denoted by et as equal

to the efficiency of water use at time t  1 , denoted by et 1 plus the water efficiency

increment function, denoted by ê .


      et  et 1  eˆ  et 1  a ( I tw ) b                                           (10)


     Using data for 1998 and 2008 in Table 7 , and assuming that the efficiency of water
use at time t is equal to real GDP at time t divided by water use at time t , we can solve
for the values of parameters in equations (4) and (5) as


     14.38  13.02  a (609.97) b

      31.68  29.52  a(2,408.95) b


     Solving these equations for the parameters a and b yields values 0.1526648 and
0.3402391 , and substituting these values into the water efficiency function yields


      eˆ  0.1526648( I w ) 0.3402391                                                  (11)


     Equation 11 implies that the function ê exhibits positive and diminishing returns to
                                                  eˆ

assets increases ê but the increase falls as investment in water assets increases.

        We perform sensitivity analysis on the parameters used in the e‐function. Table 8
reports our calculations for the calibration of e function using data for 7 different pairs
of years which are taken randomly. The calculations show that there are significant
differences for the values of parameters a and b suggesting that the results of the
counterfactuals could change if the calculations are performed using the values from
other rows (the values from row 6 are used in our counterfactual analysis). For all pairs
of years reported (see Table 8, rows 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) the value of parameter b is less
than 1 and greater than 0; the e function exhibits positive and diminishing marginal
products with respect to investment in water assets.

5. Results


     Here we report the results of growth accounting calculations on the significance of
water availability for China’s growth for a number of counterfactual cases. We use
values for parameters a and b as reported in row 6 from the Table 8 for the e function.
The marginal product of water is calculated as the average price of water reported by
Ministry of Water Resources for years 2006 and 2007 and multiplied by a factor 
which can take the alternative values of 4, 8 and 12. The elasticity of substitution
between the composite of non‐water capital and water, and labour is assumed to be
unity and this value does not change during the experiments.
     Table 9 reports the results of change in growth rates under the hypothesis that
investments in water assets grew at zero after 1997 and under the assumption of
different elasticities of substitution between water and non‐water capital and different
marginal products for water. The results show that if there was no growth in
investments in water assets, output growth rates would have been changed only a little
when compared with actual output growth rates if elasticity of substitution between
water and non‐water capital was 1.1 or 0.75.
     Larger changes in output growth rates occur if the elasticity of substitution
approaches zero and water and non‐water capital become almost perfect complements.
If elasticity of substitution was 0.25 or 0.025 output growth rates would have been
decreased in 2009 by as much as 1.3‐1.8 percentage points. In the first years of the
experiment, the magnitude of growth decrease when compared with actual growth
rates is not so large but as diminishing returns to non‐water capital, the faster growing
factor, occurs faster than otherwise the decrease in output growth rates becomes larger
and larger. When the elasticity of substitution is 0.025 the diminishing returns sets in
much faster and growth rates fall earlier than when the elasticity of substitution is 0.25
(see Table 9).
     The actual average growth rate of real non‐water capital for the period 1998‐2009
was around 12.5% per year and the growth rate of water in efficiency units was 9.29%. If



                                          ‐ 27 ‐
       there was no growth in investments in water assets the efficiency of water use would
       have increased from 13.02 in 1997 to 27.09 in 2009 (20.8% lower than the actual
       efficiency of water use) and water efficiency increments would have been around 1.17
       unit per year. The growth rate of water in efficiency units falls from 9.29% to 6.93% per
       year (around 25% lower) and because there is more investment available for non‐water
       capital assets, the growth rate of real non‐water capital raises a little to 12.7% per year.
       Therefore with a very low elasticity of substitution, a faster growth of non‐water capital
       input relative to water in efficiency units indicates that the implicit share of non‐water
       capital would decrease and the share of water would increase over time. As a result the
       growth rate of output would decrease because of the larger share on the growth rate of
       water in efficiency units which was lower than the growth rate of non‐water capital.

              Table 10 reports the results of change in growth rates under the strong hypothesis
       that there were no investments in water assets (they were set at zero) between 1997
       and 2009. We assume that the savings rate in the economy was the same between 1997



                                                              ‐ 28 ‐
       and 2009 and instead of investing in water assets, investments took place in non‐water
       assets. Under these assumptions the change in growth rates is negative. When elasticity
       of substitution is 1.1 or 0.75 the change in output growth rates is small (but larger than
       in the case of no growth of investments in water assets). As the elasticity of substitution
       decreases, growth is lowered to a larger extent.
               The major changes in output growth occur when the elasticity of substitution is
       0.25 and 0.025. In 2009 growth rates would be reduced by 4.1 to 5.5 percentage points.
       This is because with no investments in water assets the efficiency of water use remains
       constant at 13.02 and water in efficiency units changes very little (grows at 0.6% per
       year). On the other hand, the capital stock in non‐water assets grows at the rate of
       12.7% per year. With a higher growth rate of the capital stock and almost no growth in
       water in efficiency units and an elasticity of substitution less than 1, the share of water
       (the slow growth factor) increases and the share of the faster growing input decreases
       leading to a fall in output growth which gets larger every year.

              Table 11 reports our results under the hypothesis that investments in water assets
       grew twice the rate actually observed between 1997 and 2009. In this case, investments
       in non‐water assets would have been smaller than they were in the period considered.
       In this case growth rates would have decreased by 0.03 to 1.38 percentage points if the
       elasticity of substitution was 1.1 or 0.75. But output and growth rates would increase if
       elasticity of substitution was 0.25 or 0.025. The biggest increase in output and growth
       rates occurs if the elasticity of substitution was 0.025. With double the growth rate for
       investments in water assets the efficiency of water use increases from 13.02 in 1997 to
       45.87 in 2009, 33.9% higher in 2009 when compared to the actual efficiency of water
       use of 34 in 2009. Along with this increase in efficiency, water use in efficiency units also
       increases at an average rate of about 11.73% per year. On the other hand, the growth
       rate of the real capital stock falls a little to 11.7% per year. Therefore, water in efficiency
       units contributes positively to growth of output in this case.

       We also report sensitivity analysis of change in growth rates using the CES
production function under different assumptions of values of parameters a and b that
are calculated in Table 8. The sensitivity analysis shows that the results of the
counterfactual experiments are almost the same in all cases if non‐water capital and
water are close substitutes. On the other hand the results show larger variations in
counterfactual experiments if non‐water capital and water are poor substitutes. If the
power of e‐function, parameter b , takes higher values closer to 1, a one unit increase in
investments in water assets increases the efficiency of water use by larger amounts then
if the parameter b is closer to 0.

                     Given the results obtained under the assumption of different elasticities of
                substitution and investments in water assets, one could also ask what would be the
                optimal value of investments in water assets which minimize the reduction in output in
                the year? The response to this question depends on the elasticity of substitution
                between non‐water capital and water in efficiency units. If the elasticity of substitution
                is high and the share of water in production is low then it is optimal to invest more in
                non‐water capital assets instead of water assets because the share in production is
                higher. The growth in output is about 0.1 if there would be no growth of investments in
                water assets. If the elasticity of substitution between non‐water capital and water in
                efficiency units is low then by investing more in water assets would also benefit growth
                (see Table 14).
                     Table 14 reports some projections of future changes in real GDP growth rates for
                the period 2010‐2022 if there is no growth of investments in water assets, no
                investments in water assets and double the growth rate of investments in water assets.
                We compare the growth rates of real GDP under counterfactual analyses with projected


                                                                     ‐ 32 ‐
       growth rates of real GDP if real GDP, real investments in non‐water assets and real
       investments in water assets continue to grow at the average annual growth rates from
       the last 10 years. If the elasticity of substitution between non‐water capital and water in
       efficiency units,  , is 1.1 then GDP growth rates would slightly increase by 0.1
       percentage points per year if there is no growth of investments in water assets. If the
       growth rates of investments in water assets were twice the growth rate from the past,
       the GDP growth rates would decrease by 0.05 to 2.13 percentage points per year
       between 2010 and 2022.
                If non‐water capital and water in efficiency units are poor substitutes,  is 0.025,
       GDP growth rates would increase by 0.2 to 1.89 percentage points per year if
       investments in water assets would increase at twice the rate from the past. The growth
       would decrease by 0.2 to 1.5 percentage points per year if there would be no growth of
       investments in water assets and by 3.6 to 4.1 if there would be no investments in water
       assets.

6. Concluding Remarks


     In this paper, we use a growth accounting approach to investigate both the
contribution played in the past by water availability in constraining China’s growth
performance, and what would be involved in the future. We use a modified version of
Solow growth accounting in which water in efficiency units enters the production
technology, and investment in water management assets raises efficiency of water use.
We note that China’s high growth of the last 20 years or more has been obtained with
relatively little increase in the physical volume of water. We adopt various assumptions
on the relationship between the price of water and marginal product, and on
substitution elasticities in making our calculations.
     Our counterfactual experiments suggest that water affects China’s growth rates
and will affect growth in the future but at uncertain rates. The degree depends on the
elasticity of substitution between non‐water capital and water in efficiency units and on
the size of investments in water assets. If investments in water assets in the future were
lower than they were in the past, growth might slightly increase by about 0.1
percentage points if non‐water capital and water in efficiency units are close substitutes
but growth rates could decrease by as much as 0.2‐3.9 percentage points if investments
in water assets were very small or small, and if the elasticities of substitution were low.
     On the other hand, our experiments suggest that with faster growth of
investments in water assets than in the past and low elasticity of substitution growth
could increase. But if non‐water capital and water in efficiency units are close
substitutes growth rates could even decrease.
