                                              ABSTRACT

This paper distinguishes two kinds of Endogenous Business Cycle models; EBC1 models, which display
dynamic indeterminacy, and EBC2 models, which display steady-state indeterminacy. Both strands of
the literature have their origins in the sunspot literature that developed at the University of Pennsylvania
in the 1980s. I argue that EBC1 models are part of the evolution of modern macroeconomics that has
classical roots dating back to the 1920s. EBC2 models provide a microfoundation to one of the most
important ideas to emerge from Keynes’ (1936) General Theory; that high involuntary unemployment
can persist as part of the steady-state equilibrium of a market economy.

         This paper distinguishes two kinds of Endogenous Business Cy-

     cle models; EBC1 models, which display dynamic indeterminacy, and

     EBC2 models, which display steady-state indeterminacy. Both strands

     of the literature have their origins in the sunspot literature that de-

     veloped at the University of Pennsylvania in the 1980s. I argue that

     EBC1 models are part of the evolution of modern macroeconomics

     that has classical roots dating back to the 1920s. EBC2 models pro-

     vide a microfoundation to one of the most important ideas to emerge

     from Keynes’ (1936) General Theory; that high involuntary unemploy-

     ment can persist as part of the steady-state equilibrium of a market

     economy.



1    Introduction

In a special issue of the Journal of Economic Theory, Benhabib and Farmer
(1994) introduced a representative agent business cycle model in which equi-
libria are indeterminate. Writing in the same issue of the journal, Farmer
and Guo (1994) developed a discrete time analog of the Benhabib-Farmer
model and added self-fulfilling non-fundamental stochastic shocks to beliefs.
    The models developed by Benhabib and Farmer and Farmer and Guo
are characterized by a propagation mechanism in which the persistence of
business cycles arises endogenously as opposed to the Real Business Cycle
(RBC) model in which persistence is explained by an exogenous autocorre-

                                       1
lated shock to total factor productivity (TFP). Their work signalled an im-
portant departure from the conventional RBC model by demonstrating that
business cycles may not be the eﬃcient responses of rational agents to shocks
to technology; instead, they may be ineﬃcient fluctuations in employment
and GDP, caused by shocks to the self-fulfilling beliefs of households and
firms. The 1994 JET volume spawned a literature on Endogenous Business
Cycles (EBC) that reconciled the Benhabib-Farmer model with a broader
range of micro and macro stylized facts.
   In the Benhabib-Farmer model there is a unique steady state and a con-
tinuum of equilibrium paths that converge to it. I call the class of models
that exploit dynamic indeterminacy to explain business cycles, first genera-
tion EBC models, or EBC1 models for short.1 In a recent series of books and
papers, (Brown, 2010; Farmer, 2006, 2008a,b, 2010a,b,c, 2012a,b,c, 2013a;
Kashiwagi, 2010; Plotnikov, 2013) my students and I have introduced an
endogenous business cycle model in which there is not just dynamic indeter-
minacy, but also steady-state indeterminacy. Significantly, in Farmer (2006,
2008a, 2012b), I develop a model with a continuum of steady-state unem-
ployment rates. I will refer to this model, and to related models that exploit
steady-state indeterminacy to explain business cycles, as second generation
EBC models or EBC2 models for short.2
   EBC1 models were innovative, but not revolutionary. Although they
reintroduced the idea that beliefs may independently influence outcomes, (a
concept that was present in the macroeconomic theory of the 1920s), they


                                      2
did not break free from the classical assumption that the labor market is
always close to an eﬃcient steady state equilibrium.
    This paper explains the evolution from EBC1 models, which display dy-
namic indeterminacy, to EBC2 models, which display steady-state indeter-
minacy. Both branches of this literature have their origins with an impor-
tant idea that was developed at the University of Pennsylvania in the 1980s;
what people believe to be true can independently influence what actually hap-
pens. By combining this revolutionary idea with recent work on labor market
search, the EBC2 models developed in my recent books and papers explain
how high unemployment can persist indefinitely. In so doing, they oﬀer an
explanation for the Great Depression and the Great Recession of 2008 that
combines Keynesian and classical ideas in a new way.



2     The History of Macroeconomic Theory

Modern macroeconomics traces its origins to Lucas Jr. (1972), a paper about
the role of money in business cycles. Lucas’ work was followed by the seminal
papers of Kydland and Prescott (1982) and Long and Plosser (1983), which
introduced the idea that business cycles are the eﬃcient fluctuations of a
competitive economy in response to exogenous persistent technology shocks.
This idea, dubbed Real Business Cycle theory, represents a return to classical
ideas that characterized business cycle theory in the 1920s (Pigou, 1929).
    Although the Real Business Cycle model is grounded in classical eco-


                                      3
nomics, it is mathematically more sophisticated. Because the math was hard,
the initial RBC model was simple. In place of the rich panoply of shocks that
drive business cycles in Pigou’s work, the RBC model is driven by a single
random shock; innovations to total factor productivity. The next twenty five
years were characterized by a research agenda in which the business cycle
shocks of the 1920’s were brought back, one by one, into the classical model.
The models developed over this period are referred to as DSGE, or dynamic
stochastic general equilibrium models. EBC1 models were an important part
of this DSGE agenda.
   Like the RBC model, DSGE models have a general equilibrium core. They
diﬀer from it by adding nominal frictions as in Christiano, Eichenbaum, and
Evans (2005), additional shocks as in Hall (1997) and Beaudry and Portier
(2006) or by making small departures from the core assumptions that provide
a richer propagation mechanism as in Farmer and Guo (1994). By the onset
of the Great Recession in 2007, Smets and Wouters (2007) had managed to
replicate the verbal theory of Pigou using the language of dynamic stochastic
general equilibrium theory. They showed that a DSGE model, loaded up with
enough frictions and multiple shocks, does a credible job of replicating the
dynamics of post-war U.S. business cycles.
   RBC models were developed in response to the failure of Keynesian the-
ory to explain economic events of the 1970s. It now appears that Keynesian
economics was discarded prematurely as the classical models that replaced
Keynesian theory are themselves unable to explain either the Great Depres-


                                     4
sion or its recent reincarnation on a smaller scale, the Great Recession of
2008. The Great Depression shattered the classical view and in response
to the depression, Keynes (1936) argued instead that the economy can get
stuck in a state of involuntary unemployment and that any unemployment
rate can be an equilibrium. In my work on EBC2 models, I capture this
concept by adding a theory of labor market search to an otherwise stan-
dard general equilibrium model. In so doing, I reconcile the economics of
involuntary unemployment with microeconomic theory in a new way.



3     Indeterminacy, Sunspots and Self-fulfilling

      Prophecies: Macro at Penn in the 1980’s

EBC models of both generations are based on an idea developed at the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania in the early 1980’s with the work of Cass and Shell
(1983), Azariadis (1981), and Farmer and Woodford (1984); that indetermi-
nacy can be combined with self-fulfilling beliefs to create a positive model
of business cycles. Indeterminacy acts as the propagation mechanism and
shocks to beliefs, caused by non-fundamental uncertainty, act as the impulse.
    Using the term ‘sunspots’ to refer to non-fundamental uncertainty, Cass
and Shell (1983) were the first to show that sunspots can have real eﬀects
on consumption, even in the presence of a complete set of financial markets.
Using the term, ‘self-fulfilling prophecies’ to refer to non-fundamental uncer-
tainty, Azariadis (1981) was the first to show that non-fundamental shocks

                                      5
could be added to a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model to drive
business cycles. The models of Cass and Shell and Azariadis were two-period
lived overlapping generations models with a finite number of determinate
steady states.
   Indeterminacy as a positive explanation of business cycles was first in-
troduced by Farmer and Woodford (1984), (published later as Farmer and
Woodford (1997)) who combined self-fulfilling prophecies with indeterminacy
to generate a model in which sunspot shocks generate endogenous autocor-
related responses of GDP and employment. Up to this point, models of
indeterminacy and sunspots, or self-fulfilling prophecies, were recognized as
theoretical possibilities, but because they were constructed in static models
or in models where agents live for only two periods, they remained discon-
nected with quantitative models of the business cycle.
   That changed with the 1994 JET volume in which Benhabib and Farmer
(1994) demonstrated that indeterminacy occurs in models that are similar to
the RBC model and Farmer and Guo (1994) provided a framework where,
for the first time, sunspot theory could be taken seriously as a positive ex-
planation of the business cycle.

4       EBC1: Multiple Dynamic Equilibria and

        Increasing Returns-to-Scale

The Benhabib-Farmer model alters the RBC model by adding a technology
with increasing returns-to-scale. The key idea of this model is to exploit
a production externality that reconciles increasing returns-to-scale with the
neoclassical theory of distribution. The model has been successful because
it is simple and closely related to the RBC model that by 1994, had become
the industry standard.
      The canonical RBC model (King, Plosser, and Rebelo, 1988) consists of
five equations and three boundary conditions to explain the time paths of
five variables; GDP  , consumption   capital  , labor supply   and
total factor productivity   These five equations are,


                 
(1)      =  −1 1−
                         


(2)      = −1 (1 − ) +  −  
                ½            µ              ¶¾

(3)        =                 1−+            
                1 +  +1           
                           
(4)       = (1 − )      
                           
              
(5)      = −1 exp ( ) 




                                       7
and the three boundary conditions are given by,


(6)     0 = ̄0 


(7)     0 = ̄0 
                (µ         ¶        )
                      1         
(8)     lim                            = 0
         →∞         1+        

      Equation (1) is a production function, (2) is the capital accumulation
equation, (3) is the representative agent’s Euler equation, (4) is the first order
condition for labor and (5) describes the evolution of TFP as a geometric first
order autoregressive process, hit by an iid innovation. The innovation to TFP
has a distribution function  (·) with mean 0 and variance  2 

              ¡     ¢
(9)      ∼  0 2 


      The boundary conditions are the initial conditions for capital, (6) and
TFP, (7), and the transversality condition, (8). The model has five para-
meters; these are the rate of time preference , the capital elasticity , the
labor supply parameter , the autocorrelation parameter  and the standard
deviation of the innovation to TFP, .
      The Benhabib-Farmer model has an almost identical structure to the
canonical RBC model but it diﬀerentiates between the private technology


                 
(10)  =   −1 1−
                         

                                                8
and the social technology,


               
(11)  =  ̄−1 ̄ 


where the two are related by the identity


            − −1+
(12)  ≡ ̄−1 ̄   


Here, ̄−1 and ̄ refer to the economy-wide average use of capital and labor
and  is a productive externality. In a symmetric equilibrium, ̄ =  and
̄ =  at all dates. An equilibrium of the model is a time path for the
variables which satisfies the dynamic equations (1)-(5), the initial conditions
(6) and (7) and the transversality condition, Equation (8).
    In addition to the parameters of the RBC model, the Benhabib-Farmer
model has two new parameters,  and . When   1 +  the social
technology exhibits increasing returns-to-scale. In this case, Benhabib and
Farmer show that the model has multiple dynamic equilibria. Each of them
is represented by a diﬀerent path for capital, labor, consumption and GDP
and all of these paths converge back to the same steady state. Which of the
equilibrium paths prevails is determined by the self-fulfilling beliefs of the
agents in the model.

5     EBC2: Multiple Steady-State Equilibria as

      a Microfoundation for Keynesian Economics

My version of an EBC2 model (Farmer, 2006, 2008a, 2012b) alters the RBC
model by adding a theory of labor market search. I assume that workers and
firms act competitively and take prices and wages as given and I demonstrate
that this assumption leads to a model that displays what I call incomplete
factor markets.3 The key idea of this model is to exploit the fact that, when
a worker meets a firm, there are many possible ways of splitting the surplus
that arises from the meeting. My reason for developing this model is that
EBC1 models provide an inadequate description of major recessions like the
Great Depression or the Great Recession of 2008.
    As with other DSGE models that enhanced the RBC framework, first
generation EBC1 models represent employment fluctuations as small devia-
tions from a unique full employment steady-state equilibrium. Because the
economy is never far from a Pareto Optimal steady state, the welfare costs of
business cycles in these models are small.4 This characteristic is undesirable
because it is inconsistent with the fact that recessions appear to be hugely
costly to unemployed workers. The EBC2 model I have developed solves this
problem by explaining high persistent unemployment as a socially ineﬃcient
equilibrium that arises as a consequence of incomplete factor markets. In
this model, self-fulfilling beliefs trigger permanent movements in economic
activity.


                                     10
   The defining feature of the Farmer EBC2 model is the assumption that
households are not on their labor supply curve. In this sense, this model
follows Keynes’ General Theory.5 But it goes beyond the General Theory by
providing an explicit microfoundation that explains why households are not
on their labor supply curve. The labor supply equation is missing because
there are incomplete factor markets. By this I mean that there are no prices
for the two independent inputs to a technology that describes how searching
workers are matched with vacant jobs; instead, workers find jobs through
random search.
   My work replaces the assumption that the demand and supply of labor
are equal with an explicit model of unemployment based on the search and
matching framework of Mortensen (1970), Pissarides (1976) and Diamond
(1982a,b, 1984). Following Howitt and McAfee (1987), I drop the Nash
bargaining equation that is typically added to search models of this kind,
and I assume instead that firms produce as much as is demanded. Demand
is determined by forward looking households who form a sequence of self-
fulfilling beliefs about the value of their wealth. Beliefs are determined by
an alternative independent equation that replaces the assumption that firms
and workers bargain over the wage.
   The EBC2 model, like its first generation cousin, relies on the idea that
DSGE models may have multiple indeterminate equilibria to explain real
world phenomena. Unlike the EBC1 model, the EBC2 model displays steady-
state indeterminacy. This is a significant departure from the earlier literature.


                                       11
Whereas the EBC1 model adds an additional shock, self-fulfilling beliefs,
to a classical model; the EBC2 model provides a microfoundation for the
Keynesian idea that there may be many equilibrium unemployment rates.
This work recasts the central ideas from The General Theory (1936) in the
language of dynamic stochastic general equilibrium theory.6



6     Plotnikov’s Example: An EBC2 Model with

      Investment

In Farmer (2006, 2010a, 2012b) I embedded a search market into an asset
pricing model where capital is fixed and cannot be reproduced. This model
is distinct from the RBC model and does not explicitly include a theory of
investment. I chose that framework because I wanted to model the connec-
tion between the value of the stock market and the value of unemployment,
a connection that is strong and structurally stable in the post-war period
(Farmer, 2012c, 2013b).
    In the model with non-reproducible capital, the value of a capital asset
varies with expectations of future dividends. Although this leads to a model
where there is an obvious analog of stock market valuation, it cannot easily
be compared with the RBC model because it does not allow for investment.
In his Ph.D. thesis, Plotnikov (2013) estimates an incomplete factor markets
model with reproducible capital. Since stock market wealth does not enter
his model, Plotnikov assumes instead that households form beliefs about

                                     12
their permanent income using adaptive expectations as in Friedman’s (1957)
work on the consumption function. I will use Plotnikov’s second generation
EBC2 model in this discussion because it explicitly models investment and
can therefore be more easily compared with the RBC model.
   The Plotnikov model has the following characteristics. Output is pro-
duced from labor and capital by a large number of competitive firms. Firms
are owned by a representative household that allocates output between con-
sumption and investment and next period’s capital stock is determined by a
standard capital accumulation equation. These assumptions lead to a model
that has five equations in common with the RBC model and with first gen-
eration EBC1 models.        It is closed by adding an explicit theory of the
determination of beliefs.
   In a paper written in 2002, (Farmer, 2002), I developed an EBC1 model
where adaptive expectations determine beliefs. Because, in that model, there
are many dynamic equilibrium paths, there are ways of forming adaptive
expectations that are also consistent with the assumption that expectations
are rational; it is the form of the adaptive expectations equation that selects
an equilibrium. Plotnikov (2013) uses that same idea. In his model, because
there are multiple steady-state equilibria, adaptive expectations are fully
rational.
   The RBC model does not contain prices. But when the solution to the
model is decentralized with competitive markets, the household’s labor allo-




                                      13
cation decision, Equation (4), can be split into two parts as follows,


(13a)                            =   
                                                
(13b)                            = (1 − )       
                                                

where   is the real wage. Equation (13a) reflects the assumption that the
representative household equates the slope of an indiﬀerence curve between
leisure and consumption to the real wage. Equation (13b) is the first order
condition for the choice of labor by a competitive firm.
   If we add the real wage as a variable, the RBC model explains the six
variables          and   as functions of the innovation to TFP, with
six equations; Equations (1)—(3), (5) and Equations (13a) and (13b). The
EBC2 model has five equations in common with the EBC1 model; these are
equations (1a—5a),


                 
(1a)  =   −1 1−
                         


(2a)  = −1 (1 − ) +  −  
             ½            µ              ¶¾
     1           1    1            +1
(3a)    =                 1−+            
             1 +  +1           
                     
(4a)   = (1 − )      
                     
           
(5a)  = −1 exp ( ) 




                                        14
The model also retains the boundary conditions, given by,


(6a) 0 = ̄0 


(7a) 0 = ̄0 
             (µ         ¶        )
                   1         
(8a) lim                            = 0
         →∞      1+        

    But this gives only five equations to determine the six unknowns,  
       and    The Plotnikov EBC2 model is missing Equation (13a).
Instead of assuming that the labor market is competitive, employment is
determined in a search equilibrium. Households do not vary labor supply in
response to changes in wages and interest rates as in the RBC and EBC1
models; instead, each household sends a fixed fraction of its members to look
for a job in every period and variation in employment arises as a consequence
of endogenous changes in the eﬃciency with which workers are matched with

7       Unemployment and Search Externalities

The EBC1 and EBC2 model both exploit the idea that there is an externality
in the production function; but they do it in fundamentally diﬀerent ways.
In EBC1 models, the externality leads to multiple dynamic equilibria; in
the EBC2 model, it leads to multiple steady state equilibria. This section
explains how that works by utilizing the concept of incomplete factor markets.

                                             15
   To model the frictional costs of recruiting, assume that a representative
firm with  workers, can allocate them to the activity of recruiting or pro-
duction. If we let  be the number of recruiters and  the number of
production worker,  and  are related to  by the equation.


(14)  =  +  


Now assume that every recruiter can hire  workers,


(15)  =   


where  is taken as given by the representative firm but is determined in ag-
gregate by the degree of congestion in the labor market. Using the definition
of  , we can express the output of the representative firm as,


(16)  =   1− 


Substituting (14) and (15) into (16) leads to the expression,


(17)  =    1−
                        


where

         µ       ¶1−
              1
(18)  = 1 −         
              


                                     16
   In words, the externality,  , is a function of the number of workers,
 , than can be hired by a representative worker assigned to the task of
recruiting. The term  is taken as given by each firm, but it is determined
in aggregate by the number of other firms who are trying to attract workers.
The connection with aggregate recruiting activity is found by specifying a
matching technology that relates aggregate hires to the aggregate number of
recruiters, ̄ . The important idea here, is that the assumption that workers
and firms take prices and wages as given does not lead to enough equations
to determine  .
   Farmer (2012b) adds a Cobb-Douglas matching function to this model
to determine the number of workers that are hired when firms, in aggregate,
allocate ̄ workers to recruiting and when a measure 1 of workers looks for
a job. By making the simplifying assumption that all workers are fired and
rehired every period,7 he shows that  = 1̄ and hence the externality 
is given by the expression,

         ¡        ¢1−
(19)  = 1 − ̄      


   As in the EBC1 model of Benhabib and Farmer (1994), the term 
represents a labor market externality. In the EBC2 model, this is represented
by Equation (19), where ̄ is average employment by all other firms.




                                     17
8      Closing the EBC2 Model with Adaptive

       Expectations

The models developed in Farmer (2006, 2012b,c), and Farmer (2013a) are
closed by assuming that households form self-fulfilling beliefs about the value
of their wealth. In Plotnikov (2013), there is no analog of stock market
wealth, but households must still form expectations of their human wealth.
To capture this concept, Plotnikov adapts Friedman’s concept of permanent
income. As in Friedman (1957), those expectations are formed adaptively.
And as in Farmer (2002), because the model has an indeterminate set of
equilibria, adaptive expectations are also rational.
    If we evaluate Equations (1a)—(5a) at a steady state, we are able to pin
down a value for ̄ which equals 1, and values of the ratios, ̄̄ ̄ ̄ and
̄̄ , which are given by the expressions

       ̄    +  (1 − )
(20)      =               
       ̄         

       ̄   +
(21)      =     
       ̄    

and

       ̄    +  (1 − )
(22)      =               
       ̄      +

But the steady-state real wage, ̄ and steady employment, ̄ cannot be


                                      18
found from these equations. Instead, the model is closed by assuming, as
in Friedman’s work on the consumption function, that consumption,  is
proportional to permanent income,  


(23)  =  


Here, permanent income is defined to be the value of income that would be
earned by the representative household in the absence of shocks.
      Because permanent income and current income are the same in a non-
stochastic steady state, the coeﬃcient  is constrained by Equation (22) to
be,

             +  (1 − )
(24)  ≡                  
               +

      Under the adaptive expectations hypothesis, permanent income depends
on current income and on the view of permanent income that households
formed one period in the past. That assumption leads to Equation (25),

          ¡  ¢ 1−  ¡ ¢
(25)  = −1  exp  


The parameter  measures the speed with which revisions to current income
are incorporated into permanent income and  is a belief shock that repre-
sents the optimism or pessimism of households. This shock has distribution




                                     19
 (·) with mean 0 and variance  2 

            ¡      ¢
(26)  ∼  0 2 


   Finally, since  is a state variable, the model must be closed with the
initial condition


(27) 0 = ̄  


The complete EBC2 model consists of the dynamic equations (1a)—(4a), (23)
and (25), the initial conditions (6a), (7a) and (27) and the transversality
condition, (8a).
   For any set of initial conditions, equations (1a)—(4a), (23) and (25) define
a unique dynamic equilibrium. But setting the shocks to zero and solving for
the steady state yields one less equation than unknown. This indeterminacy
of the steady state arises because although Equations (23) and (25) define a
unique path for any set of initial conditions, they do not add information to
help pin down the steady state. The steady-state value of (25) defines ̄ 
to be equal to ̄  the steady-state value of (23) replicates the information
from (22) and the complete set of equations defines a system that is path
dependent. In the absence of shocks, the economy would converge to a
steady-state value of employment that depends on the initial belief about
permanent income, 0 .
   What have we gained by adapting a DSGE model in this way? The

                                        20
important feature that distinguishes EBC2 models from other DSGE models
is that data generated by the model display hysteresis: a small perturbation
of the initial conditions leads to a similar perturbation of the eventual steady
state. As Blanchard and Summers (1986, 1987) have argued convincingly,
and as I have argued elsewhere, (Farmer, 2012a,c, 2013a), this is exactly the
behavior we see in the data.8



9     Conclusion

This paper has discussed the use of endogenous business cycle models that
display indeterminate equilibria as a positive explanation of real world phe-
nomena. This idea originated at the University of Pennsylvania during the
early 1980s with the work of Cass and Shell (1983), Azariadis (1981) and
Farmer and Woodford (1984) and it evolved into the EBC agenda; a re-
search program that explains business cycles as endogenous responses to
self-fulfilling shocks to beliefs.
    I have identified two generations of EBC models. First generation EBC1
models display indeterminate dynamic equilibria in which many equilibrium
paths converge to the same steady state. Second generation EBC2 models
display steady-state indeterminate equilibria in which there are many steady-
state equilibrium unemployment rates.
    One of the most important ideas to come from Keynes’ General The-
ory was that high unemployment can persist as an equilibrium phenomenon.


                                      21
Second generation EBC2 models provide a microfoundation to this idea, and
just as EBC1 models were part of the DSGE agenda that provided a mi-
crofoundation for the economics of Pigou (1929), EBC2 models provide a
microfoundation for the economics of Keynes (1936). The idea that invol-
untary unemployment can persist as an equilibrium phenomenon is one that
will gain more credence, the longer the current recession persists.



Notes
   1
       Benhabib and Farmer (1999) survey EBC1 models and discuss the issues related to
dynamic indeterminacy and the mechanisms that generate it and Farmer (1999) explains
how indeterminacy can arise in general equilibrium models and provides an accessible
introduction to the topic. Since the Benhabib-Farmer survey in 1999, many important
papers have been published in the field. Due to space restrictions, this paper is unable to
provide a comprehensive introduction to that literature.
   2
       Related papers that I would include in the second generation EBC2 literature include
Angeletos and La’O (2011), Benhabib, Wang, and Wen (2012), Brown (2010), Farmer and
Plotnikov (2012), Gelain and Guerrazzi (2010), Guerrazzi (2011, 2012), Heathcote and
Perri (2012), Kashiwagi (2010), Kocherlakota (2011, 2012), Michaillat and Saez (2013,
2014), Miao, Wang, and Xu (2012), Plotnikov (2013), and Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2011,
2012).

       Kocherlakota (2012) uses the term, incomplete labor markets, to refer to the concept
that I call incomplete factor markets Farmer (2006, page 12).
   4
       Lucas (1987) showed that, in an RBC model, the welfare costs of business cycles are
less than one tenth of one percent of steady state consumption. In DSGE models with
added frictions, the welfare costs of business cycle fluctuations are also small (Galí, Gertler,



                                              22
and Salido, 2007).
   5
       Keynes drops what he calls ‘Postulate II of classical economics’. By Postulate II, he
means that: “The utility of the wage when a given volume of labour is employed is equal
to the marginal disutility of that amount of employment”, (Keynes, 1936, page 5).
   6
       Alternative approaches include Phelps (1994) work on structural slumps and Blan-
chard and Summers (1986, 1987) who use the insider-outsider model of Lindbeck and
Snower (1986) to generate models of persistent unemployment. Frydman and Goldberg
(2011), argue the case for non-stationarity of the fundamentals.
   7
       In most models of unemployment, see the survey by Rogerson, Shimer, and Wright
(2005), the number of unemployed workers appears as a state variable. Farmer (2010a,
2012b) assumes instead that labor is fired and rehired every period. I maintain that
assumption here since it allows me to write a second generation, EBC2 model that is
close to first generation, EBC1 models and to the canonical RBC model. Farmer (2013a)
develops a model that relaxes this assumption and shows that nothing of substance hinges
on the simplification.
   8
       Blanchard and Summers (1986, 1987) argue that unemployment is highly persistent
and that persistence should be modeled by a dynamical system that displays hysteresis.
Hysteresis means that a small perturbation of the initial conditions leads to a similar per-
turbation of the eventual steady state. In a system that displays hysteresis, the equilibrium
is path dependent.
