                                           ABSTRACT

       This paper examines 'traditional' (non-environmental) efficiency consequences and
environmental effects of two energy tax policies: a tax on fossil and synthetic fuels based on Btu
(or energy) content and a tax on consumer purchases of gasoline. It uses a model that uniquely
combines attention to details of the U.S. tax system with a consolidated treatment of U.S. energy
use and pollution emissions.
        On traditional efficiency grounds, each of the energy taxes emerges as more costly to the
economy than increases in personal or corporate income taxes of equal revenue yield. Simulation
experiments indicate that the excess costs of energy taxes are due partly to their relatively narrow
tax base. The Btu tax's application to gross output (as compared with net output under an
income tax) serves to expand its excess costs; in contrast, the gasoline tax's focus on
consumption (as opposed to income) tends to mitigate its excess costs. On the environmental
side, we find that for each of eight major air pollutants considered, energy taxes induce emissions
reductions that are at least nine times larger than the reductions under the income tax alternatives.
        Overall, this study indicates that the Btu and gasoline taxes considered are inferior to the
alternatives on narrow efficiency grounds but superior on environmental grounds. Whether the
environmental attractions of energy taxes are large enough to offset their relatively high non-
environmental costs remains an open question.

I. Introduction


        There is rencwcd interest in energy taxes as sources of public revenue. In February of this year

the Clinton Administration proposed a Btu tax as a key component of its deficit-reduction package.

Although this particular component was eventually removed from the budget package. the legislation

passed by Congress several months later introduced in its place another (albeit smaller) energy tax -- a

tax on gasoline arid other transportation fuels. Other energy taxes (such as carbon taxes) continue to be

examined closely by policymakers.

        There are many reasons for the intensified focus on energy taxes. Some are purely political. To

many policymakers. certain types of energy taxes seem more acceptable to the voting public than typical

tax increases such as increments to personal or corporate income tax rates. Environmental considerations

also are relevant here. Many have argued that the use of energy contributes disproportionately (in

comparison with other activities) to major forms of pollution, and that taxing energy is a sensible way to

discourage environmentally damaging activities. Efficiency concerns also apply. Some consider energy

taxes to be relatively efficient instruments for obtaining government revenue in companson with other

plausible taxes.'

        Despite the extensive debate on the attractions and drawbacks of energy taxes, there has been

relatively little quantttauve analysis of the gross efficiency costs2 (the efficiency costs before netting out



      On the other hand, some analysts contend that energy taxes have larger efficiency costs than ordinary income
taxes, and some would go so far as to maintain that any possible advantages of energy taxes in the environmental
domain would be more than offset by the disadvantages in traditional cost dimensions.

    2 Ii is important to make clear what is meant by "efficiency costs" here. Among economists, the nouon of
efficiency customarily refers to the aggregate net benefit or cost to the economy from a policy change. as measured
by adding up the dollar value of welfare impacts to each person. In its broadest sense. "efficiency" should
encompass both environment-related as well as other welfare effects stemming from a given policy change. For
convenience, in this paper we separate the environmental considerations from other efficiency considerations.
tJnless indicated otherwise, "efficiency costs" will mean the gross welfare costs -- before netting out the benefits
environmental benefits) and the environmental effects of these taxes in comparison with plausible
alternatives such as increases in income ta,xes. This paper provides a quantitative assessment.

         We concentrate on two main types of energy taxes: a general tax on energy (a Btu tax) and a ta.c

on consumer purchases of gasoline. For these taxes, we ask the following questions:

1. What are the (gross) efficiency costs of these energy taxes, and how do they compare with the
efficiency costs of more traditional sources of revenue such as increases in income taxes? How can the
different efficiency costs among energy taxes and between these and other taxes be explained?

1 How do these energy taxes differ from each other and from equal-revenue income taxes in terms of
the impacts on emissions of important air pollutants? Vihat are the sources of these differences?

It should be noted that these questions focus on the aggregate economic and environmental impacts. Here

we do not consider important distributional issues -- how these policies differ in the distribution of their

impacts across household income groups, across geographical regions, or across nations (impacts on

international competitiveness).
        To address the above questions, we First offer some theoretical considerations relevant to the

choice between energy and income taxes. We then investigate these issues numerically using a simulation

model of energy-economy-environment interactions in the U.S. The numerical model projects paths of

economic variables and pollution emissions under alternative tax regimes.

        The simulation model adopts a dynamic general equilibrium framework. This framework is

especially useful for examining energy tax options for at least two reasons. First, the general equilibrium

structure addresses inleractions across various sectors and industnes. In contrast with partial equilibrium

models, which consider a particular sector or industry in isolation, a general equilibrium model treats the

different sectors and industries as part of a single interactive system. Thus, one can examine, for example.

how the impacts of an energy tax are transmitted from energy markets to other markets, and how


stemming from environmental changes.

       Studies by Goulder (1993) and Jorgenson and Wilcoxen (1993) have examined the overall costs of policies
in which a carbon tax ia combined in revenue-neutral fashion with cuts in income taxes. These overall costs of
such policies implicitly indicate the relative coats of the carbon tax and the changes to income taxes. This paper
differs from the earlier studies by concentrating on Btu and gasoline taxes. In addition, in contra.st to Jorgenson
and Wilcoxen (1993) ii examines closely the mechanisms that account for the differences in costs between energy
taxes and the income tax alternatives.
responses in other markets feed back' on energy markets. Second, a dynamic general equilibrium
framework pays close attention to effects on saving and investment and other inlertemporal adjustment

issues. The taxes under consideration here can be expected to influence rates of return in different
industries, thereby affecting incentives to invest and economic growth. A dynamic general equilibrium

model is geared to address these effects.

          Beyond the basic attractions of the general equilibrium framework, the particular model employed

in this paper has features that make it especially well suited to the task at hand. First, the model uniquely

combines a detailed treatment of the U.S. tax system with a close attention to sources and uses of energy

in the U.S. In contrast with other general equilibrium tax models, this model isolates important energy

industries, takes account of substitution possibilities among energy fuels, incorporates the non-renewable

nature of oil and gas resources, and accounts for the transition from conventional fuels to "backstop"

resources. And in contrast with other energy models (general equilibrium or otherwise), this model
contains a detailed treatment of U.S. taxes. Building on earlier tax policy work4, it incorporates specific

tax instruments and addresses tax incentive effects along a number of important dimensions, including

firms' investment incentives, equity values, and profits5, and household consumption, saving, and labor

supply decisions. The appeal of accounting for existing taxes is not simply that of comprehensiveness.

A well-known principle of public finance is that the economic distortion or cost of a new tax depends

fundamentally on what taxes already exist in the system: taxes interact, It is simply impossible to

calculate the effects of new tax initiatives without accounting for pre-existing taxes.

         Another distinguishing feature6 of the model is its consideration of environmental impacts.




        See, for example. Goulder and Summers (1989), Goulder (1989). or Goulder and Thalmann (1993).

        Here the model applies the asset price approach to investment developed in Summers (1981).
    6
       Perhaps the closest cousin to the current model is the inlertemporal general equilibrium model of Jorgenson
and Wilcoxen (1990. 1993). However, the two models differ in some significant ways. The Jorgenson-Wilcoxen
model stands out in having a stronger econometric foundation and in capturing price-responsive technological
change within industries. The present model, on the other hand, contains considably more detail on U.S. taxes.
explicitly addresses the transition from exhaustible conventional fuels to backstop technologies, and captures effects
of policies on emissions of a range of air pollutants.

                                                          3
Previous applications of the model have concentrated on the economic costs of a number of energy or

environmental ta.x policies.7 Recentiy. this model was extended to capture the impacts of tax policies on

emissions of eight major air pollutants. This permits us to examine numerically a key dimension of the
debate about energy taxes -. the extent to which such taxes might yield environmental gains relative to

other tax options. It should be recognized that attention to emissions represents only a first step along the

environmental dimension. Ultimately, one would like to be able to assess the environment-related welfare

impacts of vanous tax policies. This would require one to capture all the links from (1) changes in
emissions to (2) changes in concentrations to (3) changes in environmental impacts (such as human health)

to (4) changes in welfare (evaluated in dollars). No economic model has yet consolidated all of these
links for the nation as a whole for several major pollutants. The model applied in this paper takes a first

step in this direction by connecting tax policy initiatives to changes in emissions for various pollutants.

        The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II discusses some theoretical issues relevant

to the choice between energy and income taxes, Section II! provides an overview of the simulation model

employed to assess these options numerically. The fourth section presents and interprets resulLs from
simulations of energy and income tax policies, and the final section offers conclusions.7




H. Efficiency Effects of Energy and Traditional Taxes: Theoretical Considerations



        This section examines, from a theoretical vantage point, the attractions and disadvantages of

energy taxes in terms of their efficiency impacts. In its broadest sense, the notion of "efficiency"
encompasses all of the aggregate welfare impacts of policy changes, including those that arise from policy-

induced environmental changes. However, it is convenient to separate out the environmental and non-

environmental impacts of policies. In this section we will start with non-environmental considerations and

then turn to environmental issues,



      See, for example, Goulder (l992a, 1993).

                                                     4
       One important qualification deserves attention at the outset. Here we are comparing 'pure' tax

policies. Real-world taxes usually are not pure. The U.S. income tax, for example. is actually a mix of

a pure income tax and a pure consumption tax. Similarly, energy taxes often apply at different rates to

different forms of energy, and may have very specific exemptions and other special provisions. This

section abstracts from such complications.



A. Traditional (Non-Environmental)Considerations

1. Distortions in Labor, Capital, Intermediate Input and Commodity Markets

       To gauge thc non-environmental efficiency impacts of energy and income taxes, It is necessary

to consider the different dimensions along which these taxes generate economic distortions and excess

burdens. We identify four main margins in which the principal distortions occur: the labor-leisure
margin, the intertemporal margin, the margin of intermediate good choice and the margin of consumer

good choice. These margins are associated with labor, capital, intermediate good, and consumer good

markets. The labor market is the domain in which the choice between working and enjoying leisure is

made. The capital market is the domain for intertemporal choice, that is, the choice of how much to

consume tomorrow (by saving and investing today) rather than consume today. input and consumer good

markets determine the allocation of producers' expenditures on inputs and of households' expenditures

on consumer goods at given points in time.
        Energy and income taxes have different effects along these margins, and these differences help

explain their relative efficiency impacts. As is well known, the personal income tax -- in particular. the

component that applies to individual wage income -- distorts the labor-leisure margin by driving a wedge

between the marginal social value of labor (as indicated by the before-tax real wage) and the marginal

private value of labor (as expressed by the after-tax real wage).i In addition, it distorts the intertemporal

margin (capital market) through the tax on the return to capital: it dnvcs a wedge between the marginal

social value of a urut of capital (the pre-tax return to capital) and the marginal private value (the after-tax



      On this issue see, for example, Bradford (1984) and Auerbach and Kotlikoff (1987).

                                                       5
return). The corporate income tax likewise can introduce an intertemporal distortion.9 Since the corporate

tax does not apply to labor income, it has no direct impact on the labor-leisure margin.

        These notions are summarized in Table 1. The X's in the table indicate the markets where a given

tax directly distorts resource allocation. For the income taxes, there are no X's in the input and consumer

good market,s: these taxes do not directly affect input choice or the choice across consumer goods.

         For the energy taxes, in contrast, there are direct impacts on input choice and consumer good
choice. The Btu tax raises the cost of energy inputs (fuels) relative to other inputs, and in so doing affects

firms' input choices. As shown by Diamond and Mirrlecs (1971) and Stiglitz and Da,sgupta (1971). the

distortion of input choice corresponds to a (gross) efficiency loss. Similarly, a consumer-level gasoline

tax alters the relative prices of gasoline and other consumer goods. Under fairly plausible assumptions.

uniform taxation of consumer goods is optimal.° When these conditions apply, the gasoline tax distorts

the choice among consumer goods to the extent that it makes taxation of these goods less uniform.

        This might lead one to suppose that energy and income taxes introduce direct distortions in
different markets -- that energy taxes distort product (intermediate input and consumer good) markets
while income taxes distort factor (labor and capital) markets. A closer look indicates that this is not the

case. Even though energy taxes are not imposed directly on labor, they still distort labor-leisure choice:

such taxes are implicit taxes on labor. To the extent that a Btu tax raises the costs of producing consumer

goods, it raises the overall cost of commodities and thereby lowers the real after-tax wage. It therefore

creates a labor market distortion by widening the gap between the marginal social value of labor (the real

wage before taxes) and the private return to labor (the real wage after taxes). Correspondingly, a
consumer-level gasoline tax raises the overall cost of the consumer's basket of commodities by raising the




      Stiglitz (1976) points out that for certain combinations of interest deductibility and depreciation allowances,
the tax rate on the marginal investment will be zero, and the corporate tax will function as a (nondistortionary
pure profits tax.

       Sufficient conditions are homotheticity of the utility function and weak separability between leisure and
overall consumption. See Auerbach (1985).

                                                          6
price of one commodity -- gasoline. Thus it also serves to reduce the after-tax real wage.°

        Moreover, energy taxes can directly distort the intertemporal margin as well. Although energy
taxes may not appear to be taxes on the return to capital, they function as capital taxes and affect the

intertemporal margin insofar as they raise the costs of producing capital goods. Energy is an important
input into the production of capital goods. and thus a tax imposed on the use of energy inputs into
production (that is, a tax on fuels) will raise these costs.'2 The Btu tax is such a tax. Other things equal,

this tax will reduce the rate of return to investment, because the acquisition prices of capital goods will

rise (without a compensating increase in the after-tax value of the returns to the services from these

goods). Thus, insofar as energy inputs are important to the production of capital goods, a Btu tax
functions as a tax on investment, or a negative investment tax credit.'3 Not all energy taxes affect the

intertemporal margin, however. Consider a tax on consumer purchases of gasoline. This tax does not
directly affect the cost of producing capital goods or directly alter the returns from investments in such

goods. Hence it does not introduce a distortion on this margin." In this respect, a consumption-level
gasoline tax shares the attraction of a more general consumption tax of avoiding intertemporal distortions.

These considerations indicate that energy taxes may have very different (non.environmental) efficiency

impacts depending on whether they are imposed at the production stage or at the level of household

consumption. We investigate this issue numerically later in this paper.


       The labor market distortion depends on the extent to which the after-tax real wage differs from its value
in a no-tax situation. The after tax real wage is the (1) the after-tax nominal wage divided by (2) the gross of tax
price of consumption. Income taxes directly affect the after-tax real wage by reducing (I). while energy taxes
directly influence this wage by raising (2). For a further analysis of this and related labor market issues, see
Bovenberg and de Mooij (1993) and Poterba (1993).

       Policy simulations indicate, however, that tire effects on capital goods prices are relatively small. The Btu
tax considered later in this paper ultimately raises oil and gas prices by about 14 percent and refined product pnces
by about 8 percent, but leads to real increases in capital goods prices of less than 0.4 percent.
    ° There is a difference between a Bni tax and personal income tax in their effects on "new" and "old" capital.
While the income tax reduces the return to all capital -- whether previously installed (old) or just acquired (new) -
- a Btu tax reduces the return only on new capital, that is, capital purchased since cite introduction of the tax.

    " A consumer-level gasoline tax can have indirect, general equilibrium effects on the return to capital, despite
the fact that it is not directly imposed on capital goods production or on capital income. In comparing the
efficiency impacts of the different taxes, one can regard such indirect effects as second-order.

                                                          7
out, however, that it is difficult to make the case that energy is more lightly taxed than other commodities.

Favorable tax rules had apptied to depreciation and resource depletion in the oil and gas extraction
industries, but these rules were eliminated under the Tax Reform Act of 1986. Moreover, specific forms

of energy (such as gasoline) face Federal and state excise taxes that do not apply to most other
commodities. There is little basis for expecting that differences in pre-existing tax rates would cause the

intercommodity effect to contribute to rather than detract from the appeal of a new energy tax.

        Is the SupiDly of Energy Relatively Inelastic? The other consideration is whether energy supply

and demand are relatively inelastic in comparison with other commodities. A basic principle of public

finance is that, other things equal, for a given tax rate the excess burden (or efficiency cost) is smaller the

more inelastic the supply or demand of the good upon which the tax is applied.1'

        This principle can be related to the inter-commodity efficiency effect. If energy is supplied more

inelasticaily than other commodities, then a given tax rate can potentially lead to a smaller efficiency cost

when applied to energy than when applied to other commodities. Under these circumstances a tax on

energy can improve efficiency on the inter-commodity margin.n
        Some analysts claim that the supply of energy is relatively inelastic. A common argument is that.

to a large extent, stocks of fossil fuels are essentially fixed, so that the long-run supply of such fuels is

highly inelastic. This argument ignores an important distinction between the natural supply of
unrecovered reserves and the quantity of economically recoverable (and thus extractable) reserves. While

the supply of unrecovered reserves may be fixed, the quantity of economically recoverable reserves may




of an incremental increase in other commodity taxes.
     7
       This principle is consistent with the well-known Ramsey Rule of optimal commodity taxation (from Ramsey
[1927]) that endorses taxes on commodities in inverse relation to the elasticities of demand. The "inverse elasticity
rule" is often misleading, however, because it ignores cross-price elasticities of demand and adding-up restnctions
that apply to consumer demand systems. Indeed. l)eaton (1979) and Auerbach (1985) have shown that optimal
commodity taxation involves uniform tax rates when utility functions are homothetic and leisure and consumption
are weakly separable. (See also Atkinson and Stiglitz [1980, chapter 12].) For comprehensiveness, we include
here a discussion of the relative inelasticity of energy supply, but it should be recognized that under certain
conditions this issue has no bearing on whether higher laxes are justified on efficiency grounds.

     a For further discussion. see Bovenberg and de Mooij (1993).

                                                         10
nonetheless be very elastic.         Consider in panicular the case of crude oil. There is considerable
heterogeneity across producers in terms of the Costs of extracting given amounts of fuel. This reflects the

differences in geological characteristics of different fields (oil depth, types of subsurface minerals, etc.)

When producers have different production costs, the "rents" on produced oil will differ as well. Producers

with especially tow production costs will earn large rents, while others, with high extraction costs, will
earn small ones. For some, marginal, producers. taxes on oil can reduce the rent just enough to make

what was marginally profitable production uneconomic. This means that the supply of oil will be sensitive

to taxes on oil, even in the very long run. In other words, the commercial supply of nonrenewable
resources is not completely inelastic.

         Thus, it remains an open question whcther supplies of energy are more or less elastic than other

commodities in general. The answer depends, in each fossil fuel industry, on the distribution of
production costs across producers, now and in the future. The empirical verification of this notion has

not yet been accomplished.0
         In sum, while it is possible that energy taxes could improve efficiency Ofl the inter-commodity

margin, the conditions that would allow this result to hold either do not apply or require a degree of
empirical verification that has yet to be established.



         Overall, the theoretical considerations from this subsection do not produce a clear winner on (non-

environmental) efficiency grounds. There are many dimensions along which energy taxes can be expected

to be more costly than increased income taxes. But there are at least some dimensions where energy taxes

might be less costly. To gauge how these different efficiency impacts add up, we need to adopt an
empirical analysis. We perform such an analysis in Section IV.


    '    Jones and Bremmer (1990). considering supply effects for Texas wells over the period 1973.83. report
elasticities ranging from .13 to .38. Walls (1991) uses information on the price responsiveness of exploration and
dnlling activity to project a supply elasticity of.l5. tnterpreting these elasticities is inherently problematic because
it is difficult to discern whether the observed changes in supply represent "permanent" increments to the total
amount to be extracted from given reserves or "temporary" increases that, because of rising extraction costs, will
eventually be offset by future reductions in supply (so that there is no increase in the total amount ultimately
extracted). The supply elasticities relevant to the efficiency discussion should measure permanent increments.

B. Environmental Considerations

1. Connections between Pollution Intensity and Environmental Improvement

        Environmental considerations might seem to favor energy taxes. The argument is simple. If

energy use is generally more damaging to the environment than other activities, then an energy tax may

be superior to the other taxes considered here because it targets the source of the damage.

        Later in this paper (Table 9 below) we provide evidence that supports the conventional wisdom

that energy use contributes disproportionately to economy-wide emissions of important air pollutants.

However, environmental regulations complicate the connection between energy taxes and changes in

energy use. To the extent that pre-existing regulations constrain emissions of certain pollutants, higher

energy taxes need not always lead to further reductions in these pollutants below the levels mandated by

regulations. Consider, for example, the sulphur dioxide emissions from coal-fired electric power plants.

Such emissions are regulated through provisions of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. To the extent

that an energy tax reduces demands for electricity, power plants whose output levels fall can comply with

the limits on total sulphur dioxide with higher rauos of sulphur dioxide per unit of output. Such plants
need not 'ratchet down' their emissions-output ratios as far as would be the case if no tax were
implemented. We return to this issue in the next section.



2. Do We Know That "Small' Energy Taxes Are Superior to the Alternatives?

        The   previous discussion suggested that energy taxes are likely to     be   more costly than the

alternatives in the non-environmental dimensions. Thus, even if energy taxes are more environmentally

beneficial than the alternatives, the question remains as to whether they are most efficient overall. One

line of reasoning would suggest that they must be. provided that the tax rate is not "too high.' Figure 1

is a typical diagram indicating the costs and benefits from an environmental tax. The supply (S) and
demand (D) curves can be interpreted as the marginal private cost and marginal benefit from energy use.

The marginal external (or environmental) cost from energy use is represented by MEC. Adding this
marginal cost to private marginal cost yields the social marginal cost curve. MSC. The shaded area in

the diagram indicates the efficiency loss from excessive use of energy when purchasers of energy do not

                                                    12
face the external costs. Here, introducing a small energy tax (for example. t1 in diagram) helps reduce
the differential between marginal social cost and marginal private cost and shrinks the efficiency loss.

So long as t1 does not greatly exceed the marginal external cost, the tax will lead to benefits in excess

of costs. This suggests that so long as the energy tax rate is conservative -- falls short of (or at least does

not vastly exceed) the marginal environmental cost -- then the energy tax will pay for itself. An energy

tax will not only be more attractive than the alternatives -- it will be efficiency-improving!

        This argument, while appealing, is not entirely valid. If no other taxes are present in the economy.

then the case can be made that a 'small' energy tax pays for itself. But in an economy with pre-exisling
taxes -- whether in the energy markets or in other markets -- there is no guarantee that small energy taxes

will generate environmental gains larger than the non-environmental efficiency costs. The issue here is

reminiscent of the notion, presented in subsection A above, that energy taxes can generate large efficiency

costs because they not only affect energy markets but also introduce distortions in labor markets (the

dimension of labor-leisure choice) and capital markets (the incertemporal dimension). In general
equilibrium, even small environmentally-motivated taxes can generate large efficiency costs through the
distortions they introduce in other markets. This notion receives support from analytical work by
Bovenberg and de Mooij (1993) and simulation work by Goulder (1993).

        The upshot is that the existence of a net efficiency gain from an energy tax -- even a small one -

- cannot be established on a priori grounds. Determining whether the tax yields net benefits and

ascertaining the magnitude of the net benefit or cost relative to the net benefits or costs of alternative

policies requires empirical investigation.


3. National Security Benefits
         A potential benefit from energy taxes is increased national security associated with reduced

reliance on oil imports. Under a broad definition of "environmental." this might be considered an
environmental benefit because the benefits are arguably external to those involved in oil purchase and

supply decisions.
        The argument for national security benefits turns on the idea that reduced importation of oil

                                                      13
implies smaller economic costs in the event of a supply disruption. This benefit is extremely difficult to

quantify, in part because of the difficulty of calculating the probability and magnitude of oil supply
disruptions. En the spirit of comprehensiveness. we mention this potential benefit here, but we do not

attempt to quantify this benefit in this paper.



C. Summary
        All in all, the theoretical issues from this section paint a mixed picture regarding the attractiveness

of energy taxes in comparison with income taxes. On the one hand, theory points out several ways in

which energy taxes might be more costly than the alternatives on non-environmental (traditional
macroeconomic) grounds. On the other hand, energy taxes appear likely to have the advantage in the

environmental domain. The overall efficiency impact cannot be determined from theory alone. In Section

IV we use a general equilibrium model to explore the magnitudes of the traditional non-environmental

impacts and evaluate some of the environmental consequences.




III. Basic Features of the Simulation Model


        We assess the effects of energy and income taxes using a general equilibrium model of the United

States that incorporates international trade. Here we sketch Out some main features of the model. Some

details on the model's structure and parameters are offered in the appendix. A more complete description

is in Goulder (1992b).

        The model generates paths of equilibrium prices, outputs, and incomes for the U.S. economy under

specified policy scenarios. All variables are calculated at yearly intervals beginning in the 1990
benchmark year and usually extending to the year 2070.

        The model is unique in combining (1) a detailed treatment of the U.S. tax system, (2) a close

trealaneni of energy production and demand, and (3) attention to stationary-source and mobile-source

emissions of major air pollutants. The representation of taxes incorporates very specific tax instruments

                                                      14
and addresses effects along a number of important dimensions. These include effects on firms' investment

incentives, equity values, and profits,2° and impacts on household consumption, saving and labor supply

decisions. The specification of energy supply includes an attention to the nonrenewable nature of crude

petroleum and nawral gas and a treatment of the transitions from conventional to synthetic fuels. The

treatment of emissions is based on historical relationships between emissions and fuel used, processes

employed, and levels of output.



A. Industry and Consumer Good Disaggregation
           The   model divides U.S. production into the 13 industries indicated in Table 2. The energy
industries Consist of coal mining, crude petroleum and natural gas extraction, synthetic fuels production.

petroleum refining. electnc utilities, and gas utilities. The model also distinguishes the 17 consumer
goods irs Table 2.



B. Producer Behavior
1. General Specifications
           In each industry, a nested production structure accounts for potential substitutions between
different forms of energy as well as between energy and other inputs. Each industry produces a distinct

output (K). which is a function of inputs of labor (L). capital (K), an energy composite (E) and a materials

composite (M). as well as the current level of investment (I'):

(I)                 X f[g(L,K),h(E.M)1 - i(1/K) 'I
The energy composite is made up of the outputs of the six energy industries, while the materials composite

is made up of the outputs of the other industries:

(2)                E = E(.                 x7)

(3)                M   = M(.
where       is a composite of domestically produced and foreign made input i. Industry indices correspond

to those provided in Table 2.21

         Managers of firms are assumed to serve stockholders in aiming to maximize the value of the firm:

this objective guides the choices of input quantities and investment levels in each period of time. The

model incorporates capital adjustment dynamics. In equation (I), (IIK)' I represents capital adjustmcrn

(or installation) costs; these are an increasing function of the rate of investment.22



2. Special Features of the Oil-Gas and Synfuels Industries
        The production structure in the oil and gas industry is somewhat more complex than in other

industries to account for the nonrenewable nature of oil and gas stocks. The production specification is:

(4)               X = y(Z) 'ffg(L,K).h(E,M)j - i(I/K)         'I
where y is a decreasing function of Z. the amount of cumulative extraction (or output) of oil and gas up

to the beginning of the current period. This captures the fact that as Z rises (or. equivalently, as reserves

are depleted), it becomes increasingly difficult to extract oil and gas resources, so that greater quantities

of K, L, E, and M are required to achieve any given level of extraction (output). Increasing production

costs ultimately induce oil and gas producers to remove their capital from this industry.13

        The model incorporates a synthetic fuel -- shale oil -- as a backstop resource, a perfecl substitute




                                                                                                ..
   21The functions!, g, and h, and the aggregation functions for the composites E, M, and are CES in form.
Consumer goods are produced by combining outputs from the 13 industries in given proportions.

    The cost function. . represents adjustment costs per unit of investment. This function is convex in I/K (see
appendix) and expresses the notion that installing new capital necessitates a loss of current output, as existing
inputs (K. L. E and M) that otherwise would be used to produce output are diverted to install the new capital.
Here adjustment costs are intemal to the firm. For a discussion of this and other adjustment cost specifications.
see Mussa (1978). In choosing the optimal rate of investment, producers must balance the marginal costs of
current investment (both the acquisition costs and installation costs of new capital) with the marginal benefits (the
stream of increased dividends made possible by a higher future capital stock).

       The attention to resource stock effects distinguishes this model from several other general equilibrium
energy-environmental models, Many equilibrium models treat the domestic oil&gas industry as a constant-returns-
to scale production, disregarding resource stock effects or fixed factors. (See, for example. Jorgenson and
Wilcoxen [1990. 1993].) In their global energy-environment model, Manne and Richels (1992) impose stock limits
on resources such as oil and gas, but these limits have no effect on production costs prior to the point where the
resource is exhausted.

                                                         16
for oil and gas!4 As in other industries, in the synfuels industry producers choose input arid investment

levels to maximize the equity value of the firm. There is one difference, however. The technology for

producing synthetic fuels on a commercial scale is assumed to become known only in the year 2010.

Thus, capital formation in the synfuels industry cannot begin until the year 2010.

        All domestic prices in the model are cndogenous, except for the domestic price of oil and gas.

The latter is given by the exogenous world price of oil and gas plus whatever oil tariff may apply.
Following the baseline assumptions of the Stanford Energy Modeling Forum25, this world price is
specified as $24 per barrel in 1990 and rising in real terms by $6.50 per decade. At any given point in

time, the supply of imported oil and gas is taken to be perfectly elastic at the given world price. So long

as impons are the marginal source of supply to the domestic economy, domestic producers of oil and gas

receive the world price (adjusted for tariffs or taxes) for their own output. However, rising oil and gas

prices stimulate investment in synfuels. Eventually, synfuels production plus domestic oil and gas supply
together satisfy all of domestic demand. Synfuels then become the marginal source of supply, and the
cost of synfuels production rather than the world oil price dictates the domestic price of fuels!6



C. Household Behavior
        Consumption. labor supply. and saving result from the decisions of a representative household

maximizing its intertemporal utility. The household maximizes utility subject to the intertemporal budget

constraint requiring that the present value of the consumption stream not exceed potential total wealth

(current nonhuman wealth plus the present value of potential labor income and net transfers). In each

period, overall consumption of goods and services is allocated across the 17 specific consumption
categories of Table 2. Each of the 17 consumption goods is a composite of a domestically and foreign-

produced consumption good of that type. Households substitute between domestic and foreign goods to

equation (2).

mirumize the cost of obtaining a given composite good.



D. The Government Sector

         The government collects taxes, distnbutes transfers, and purchases goods and services (outpuLs of

the 13 industries).

         The model incorporates a wide array of tax instruments. These include energy laxes. output taxes.

the corporate income tax, property taxes. sales taxes, and taxes on individual labor and capital income.

         In the benchmark year, 1990, there is a government deficit equal to approximately two percent

of GNP. In the reference case (or statu,t quo) simulation, the deficit-GNP ratio is approximately constant.

In the policy experiments in this paper, we require that real government spending and the real deficit

follow the same path as in the reference case. This implies that, to meet the cash flow requirement, the

real tax revenues collected under the various policies must be the same as in the reference case.

Ordinarily, the policies considered in this paper -- new energy taxes or increases to income taxes -- would

lead to an increase in tax revenue (relative to the reference case) in the absence of some other tax

adjustment, To make these policies revenue-neutral, we accompany the rate increases that define the

various policies with reductions in other taxes, either on a lump-sum basis or through reductions in other

tax rates.



E. Foreign Trade

         Except for oil and gas imports, which are perfect substitutes for domestically produced oil and ga.s.

imported intermediate and consumer goods are imperfect substitutes for their domestic counterparts.27

As indicated above, demands for foreign intermediate inputs stem from cost-minimizing producer behavior,

while demands for foreign consumer goods derive from household utility maximization. Import prices

are exogenous in foreign currency, but the domestic-currency price changes with changes in the exchange

rate,




        Thus, we adopt the assumption of Annington (1969).

                                                      18
         Export demands are modeled as functions of the foreign price of U.S. exports and the level of

foreign income (in foreign currency). The foreign price is the price in U.S. dollars plus tariffs or

subsidies, converted to foreign currency through the exchange rate. We impose the assumption of zero

trade balance at each period of time. The exchange rate variable adjusts to achieve trade balance, that is.

to reconcile the value of US, import demands with the value of foreign export demands.



F. Modeling Pollution Emissions

         Recent extensions of the model enable it project emissions of important pollutants under different

policy circumstances. The model considers eight major pollutants: total suspended particles (TSP).

sulphur oxides (SOX), nitric oxides (NOX), volatile organic compounds (VOC's), carbon monoxide (CO).

lead (Pb), particulate matter (PMIO), and carbon dioxide (C01).

        The extension of the model to project emissions was accomplished through close collaborations

with persormel at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Environmental Law Institute. We

have made use of detailed, highly disaggregated data on emissions rates for specific industrial processes

and fuels.28

        The key parameters used to project emissions levels (under baseline assumptions or in response

to a change of policy) are emissions factors. The model includes three types of emissions factors: fuel-

based factors, output-based factors, and mobile-source-based factors. The fuel-based emissions factor

e_f represents the rate of emissions of pollutant i per unit of input of fuel j used in industry k.29 Fuel-




    u These data come from a wide variety of sources. mcluding the Annual Survey of Manufacturers from the
U.S. Department of Census, the Quarterly Coal Report and Petroleum Supply Report from the U.S. Department
of Energy, and the Minerals Yearbook. Personnel at the Environmental Law Institute (ELI) organized the detailed
emissions data and aggregated these data to conform to the 13-industry and 17-consumer good aggregalion of this
model.

      29 In each industry, we take the ratio of the fuel-associated emissions to the quantity of fuel used in a given
industry to obtain the fuel-based emissions factor for each potlutant from that industry. We calculate this ratio
in 1990. based on ELI data on fuel-associated emissions and the general equilibrium model's data on fuel use.
Thus, for example, the emissions factor defining the rate of emissions of TSP per unit of coal input in the electric
utilities industry was calculated by taking the ratio of observed 1990 TSP emissions from coal used in electric
utilities to the quantity of coal used by electric utilities in 1990.

                                                         19
based emissions factors do not account for all of the emissions of a given pollutant from a given industry.

Industrial emissions over and above those that can be attributed to given fuels are deemed output-based.

The output-based emissions factor e_o denotes the ratio of output-related emissions of pollutant i to the
quantity of gross output from industry k.3° The mobile-source emissions factors e_m are express the

ratio of emissions i from a given mobile source to the level of use of that source (vehicle).3'

        By applying the emissions factors to the levels of fuels used and levels of outputs produced in

each industry, we generate the predicted levels of emissions of each pollutant from each industry.
Changes in emissions sternniing from a policy change reflect the policy-induced changes in fuel use and

output levels.3


G. Equilibrium and Growth
        The solution of the model is a general equilibrium in which supplies and demands balance in alt


       We calculate the output-based emissions factors by taking the ratio of the residual emissions to the level
of indusuy output. As with the fuel-based emissions factors, the ratio is calculated based on 1990 data on
emissions from ELI and on industry outputs from the general equilibrium model's data set.

    ° We aggregated data on emissions from very specific sources to obtain total emissions for each pollutant
from the following mobile-source categories: (I) passenger vehicles. (2) other highway vehicles. (3) farm
equipment, (4) construction equipment, and (5) other mobile sources, Because the model does not measure vehicle
use directly, we use proxies for vehicle use to determine mobile-source emissions, Gasoline consumption is the
proxy for the quantity of passenger car and other highway vehicle use. Agriculture output, construction industry
output, and services industry output are proxies for the level of use of farm equipment, construction equipment,
and other mobile sources, respectively.

    This approach is not perfect. One loses potentially important information when detailed industrial processes
are aggregated to the level in the model, Even though the model has considerable industry and consumer good
disaggregation. it masks some important detail that is highly relevant to emissions levels, Many important
contributions to emissions stem from industries or industrial processes that are more detailed than can be captured
in this 13-industry, 17-consumer good model, In addition, we assume that emissions factors do not change over
time; hence the model does not aptly capture industry-specific technological change that may alter these factors
over time.
         Moreover, this approach, which assumes that emissions are proportional to fuel uses and industry outputs,
does not directly address ways that environmental regulations might affect emissions rates. We make one
adjustment in this approach to confront this issue: we assume that aggregate emissions of sulphur dioxide from
coal-fired electric power plants are constrained by the provisions of the 1990 Clean Air Act. Thus, ta-s policies
cannot reduce this particular emission from this particular source. To the extent that taxes reduce demands for
electricity from these plants, the reduced electricity output does not lead to a reduction in SO3 emissions. The
reduced output instead enables electric power producers to meet the aggregate emissions constraint somewhat more
easily.

                                                        20
markets at each period of time. Thus the solution requires that supply equal demand for labor inputs and

for all produced goods33, that firms' demands for loanable funds equal the aggregate supply by

households, and that the governments tax revenues equal its spending less the current deficit. These

conditions are met through adjustments in output pnces. in the market interest rate, and in lump-sum taxes

or lax rates.3

         Economic growth reflects the growth of capital stocks and of potential labor resources. The

growth of capital stocks stems from endogcnous saving and investment behavior. Potential labor resources

are specified as increasing at a constant rate. In each period, potential labor divides between hours worked

arid leisure time in accordance with utility-maximizing household decisions.



H. Data and Parameters

         Complete data documentation for model is provided in Cruz and Goulder (1992). In the present

subsection we indicate the sources for some important data and parameters.

        The data stem from several sources. Industry input and output flows (used to establish production

function share parameters) were obtained from 1986 input-output tables published in the February 1991

Surve'i of Current Business. These tables were also the source for consumption, investment, government

spending, import and export values by industry. 1990 is the initial period for the simulations of this paper.

To obtain 1990 values, we scaled up the 1986 data using information for major industry groups in the

1991 Economic Report of the President. For the oil and gas. coal, and petroleum refining industries.

further adjustments were made to make the relative 1990 values correspond closely to relative values

projected for 1988 by the OECD (see OECD/IEA. 1990).

         Elasticities of substitution for industry production functions were obtained by transforming translog



    "Since oil and gas arid synfuels are perfect substitutes, they generate a single supply-demand condition.

    When oil/gas imports are the marginal source of supply for the domestic economy, the quanwy of these
imports is an equilibrating variable. and the oil/gas price is exogenous. Once synfuels become the marginal source
of supply (that is. once synfuels drive oil/gas imports to zero), the synfuels price becomes an equilibrating variable.
         Since agents are forward-looking, equilibrium in each period depends not only on current prices and taxes
but on future magnitudes as well.

and household sectors.




IV. Simulation Experiments and Results


         In this section we describe simulation experiments performed to compare effects of energy and
other taxes. In addition, we report and interpret the simulation results.



A. Policies Considered
         To assess the impacts of policy changes, we compare results under each simulation of a policy

change with results from a baseline or reference case simulation (which assumesno change in tax policy).

In the baseline simulation, all tax rates remain constant through time.

         We simulate the following four policies:



         I. A Btu tax. This is a tax on imposed on oil, natural gas, and coal in proportion to the 8w
         content of these fuels." The same tax rates apply to imported fuels as to the domestically




    "   The model treats crude petroleum and natural gas together as a single industry. It was still possible.
however, to capture the different tax rates applying to these fuels, because nearly all crude petroleum is devoted
as an input into the petroleum refining industry. Thus the indusuy 3 (crude petroleum and natural gas industry)
inputs into industries other than petroleum refining faced a Lax equal to the tax rate on natural gas, in keeping with
the fact that very little crude oil (except for some feedsrocks) is used outside of the petroleum industry. In
contrast. industry 3 inputs in to the petroleum refining industry faced a sax reflecting the share of natural gas and
crude oil as inputs into petroleum refining.
        produced counterparts. Exports are exempt from the tax.36

        2. A gasoline tax. This is a specific, or per-unit tax on the purchases of gasoline by consumers.
         'Gasoline and other fuels" is one of the 17 consumer goods distinguished in the model. The
        gasoline tax is applied to household purchases of this good.

        3. An increase in marginal rates of the personal income tax. The model includes marginal tax
        rates on individual wage income, dividend income. interest income, and capital gains income.
        These are the average marginal rates that apply in the benchmark year. 1994. Under the policy
        of an increase in personal income taxes, each of these marginal rates is increased in the same
        proportion.

        4, An increase in the corporate income tax rate. This is an increase in the rate of lax on
        corporate profits.


        Table 3 indicates the tax rates employed under the baseline and policy change scenarios. The rates

shown for the policy changes are after the policy in question is fully phased in. All policies are phased
in over a three-year period, beginning in 1994.
        Each of these policies is introduced in a revenue-neutral fashion: the path of tax revenues under

each policy is made identical to the revenue path in the baseline. In the absence of compensating tax

reductions, new energy taxes or higher income tax rates generally would lead to a higher overall
government revenues. To assure revenue neutrality, we accompany the rate increases with compensating

tax reductions either through lump-sum reductions in personal income taxes or by way of reductions in

the marginal tax rates on individual income.

        For comparability, the policies are scaled to imply the same gross revenue impact -- the same

revenue yield, abstracting from the revenue-preserving reductions in other taxes. The gross revenue impact

of these policies, over the infinite time horizon, is $1155 billion in present value. Over the first five years,

these taxes yield gross revenues ranging from 61 to 76 billion 1990 dollars.




     36
        This avoids putting U.S-produced fuels at a cost disadvantage relative to imported fuels in the domestic
market, and avoids putting exported U.S. fuels at a cost disadvantage relative to foreign-produced fuels in the
international market,

                                                       23
B. Simulation Results: "Traditional" Effects
1. Differences in Aggregate Economic Impacts
        Figures 2a-2c show the effects of the alternative policies on real GNP. consumption, and
investment. These results are from experiments with lump-sum replacement of revenues. The figures

indicate the percentage change in these variables relative to a reference case involving no policy change.

The first year corresponds to 1994.

        Figure 2a compares the GNP effects. Within the first 12 years following implementation, the Btu

and gasoline taxes imply larger reductions in GNP than the income tax alternatives. For example, in the

year 2000 (six years after implementation), the Btu and gas taxes imply GNP reductions (relative to
baseline) of about .22 and .18 percent. as compared with .14 and .07 percent under the personal and
corporate tax increases. The GNP costs of the BLu tax remain larger than those of the income tax
alternatives. In contrast, the ONP cost of the gasoline tax eventually becomes smaller than that of the

personal tax increase. The relatively benign long-term GNP impact of the gasoline tax reflects its more
favorable impact on investment, as discussed below.

        The impacts on consumption are compared in Figure 2b. As with the GNP losses, the losses in

consumption are greatest for the energy tax policies. However, in contrast with the GNP results, the losses

here are greater for the gasoline tax than the Btu tax. While the 8W tax raises the costs of production for

intermediate, capital, and consumer goods, the gasoline tax is targeted to consumption. Thus, in
comparison with the Btu tax, under the gasoline tax the GNP reductions come more in the form of reduced

consumption rather than investment.

        Figure 2c contrasts the investment impacts. The investment losses of the gasoline Lax are less

severe than those of any of the other policies. Hence the path of the capital stock is higher under the

gasoline tax than under the other policies. This helps explain why,over time, the ONE' path under the
gasoline tax improves relative to the paths under the other policies.

        There are various ways to discern economic well-being from the above figures. One way is to

apply the equivalent variation measure. This measure translates changes in consumption from a given



                                                    24
policy into a dollar equivalent.37 The welfare costs of the different policies arc given in Table 4. To

give a perspective on the magnitude of these numbers: the welfare cost of the Btu tax with lump-sum
income tax replacement is shown as -0.394. This means that this tax is roughly equivalent to a permanent

reduction in consumption of about .39 percent.

        The numbers in Table 4 indicate that the energy taxes have larger welfare costs than the income

tax alternatives. The Btu tax implies the largest welfare cost. The rankings of welfare costs correspond

to the differences in consumption paths from Figure 2b.3 It should be kept in mind that these welfare

measures abstract from the possible welfare benefits associated with policy-induced improvements in the

environment (or avoided environmental damages).



2. Explaining the Differences in Aggregate Impacts

        The above results indicate that the Btu and gasoline taxes tend to impose larger costs in terms of

consumption, welfare, and GNP than the two income tax alternatives. It is important to ascertain how

these cost differences arise. Here we harken back to the issues raised in Section II. How significant is

it that energy taxes apply to a relatively narrow set of industries? How important is the fact that, in

contrast with income taxes, a Btu tax applies to intermediate inputs? And how much difference does it

make whether an energy tax applies to consumer goods as opposed to all final goods?

        It is possible to address these questions by performing some additional simulations designed to

isolate the different dimensions along which energy and other taxes differ.

        Significance   of the Breadth of the Tax Base. One important feature of energy taxes, in
comparison with income taxes, is that their tax bases are relatively narrow. The Btu tax applies only to


    " The equivalent variation measure used here is the amount that a dynastic or infinitely-lived household would
require under the status quo to be made as well off as under the policy change. It is a single number that
consolidates the welfare impacts from changes in current and future consumption. As applied here, this measure
does not address equity issues as reflected in changes in the distribution of well-being across household income
groups or between current and future generations.

        Welfare depends on the household's enjoyment of both consumer goods and leisure. To the extent that
leisure changes are imperfecdy correlated with the changes in consumption from Figure 2b, the values in the figure
will not be perfect indicators of welfare changes.

                                                        25
a few industrial outputs -- the outputs of the oil, natural gas, coal, and synthetic fuels industries. These

industries account for less than three percent of the value of the nation's gross output. Similarly.
consumer purchases of gasoline account for a very small share of household expenditure on goods and

services.

        To consider the importance of the breadth of base, we perform two new simulations. First, we

simulate a uniform, broad-based tax on gross oUtput with the same gross revenue impact as the taxes
already considered. Since the Btu tax is also a tax on gross output (of oil, natural gas, and coal), the main

structural difference between the broad-based tax and the Btu tax is the breadth of the base. Second. we

simulate a uniform general consumption tax -- applying to all consumer goods, not just consumer
purchases of gasoline. This isolates the significance of the breadth of the tax base at the level of

household consumption.
        Table 5 compares the GNP and welfare impacts of these new policies with those under the policies

already considered. The excess cost of the Btu tax over the personal tax increase is .233; in contrast, the
excess cost of the broad output tax over the personal tax increase is .086. Thus, about two thirds ([.233-

.086]/.233) of the Btu tax's excess cost can be attributed to its relatively narrow industrial base.39 For

the consumer-level gasoline tax, the breadth of base is important as well. This is clear from a comparison

of rows 3 and 4 of Table 5. While the gasoline tax leads to a welfare cost about twice as large as that

under the income tax, the general consumption tax produces a smaller welfare loss than under the income

tax increase -- the "excess cost" is negative. This suggests that financing a general consumption tax with




       The broad-based output tax is imposed as a specific, or per-unit tax, where units are defined as that quantity
of output worth one dollar in 1990. A subtle difference between the broad-based output tax arid the Btu tax is
that the latter tax is not unifonn with respect to quantity units (or 1990 dollars' worth of output): instead, it was
specified as uniform with respect to energy content. In further simulation experiments, we compare the effects
of the Bui tax already considered with those of a "strictly uniform Bui tax -- a tax with the same rates per unit
of output. The differences in welfare effects are small. The strictly unifoiin Bni tax generated a welfare toss
of 0.375. as opposed to 0.394 under the original But tax, and .246 under the broad-based gross output tax. With
this information, a small fraction of the excess cost now attributed to the narrowness of the base can be attributed
to the lack of strict uniformity. Recall that the excess cost of the ordinary Bus tax is .233. The results from the
"strictly uniform" Bus tax imply that the lack of strict uniformity accounts for about 8 percent ([.394-.375]/.233)
of the excess cost, and that the narrowness of the base accounts for about 55 percent ([.375-2463/233) of this cost.

cuts in the personal income tax would yield a net welfare gain.40

        Significance of Taxing Gross, Rather Than Net, Output. The overall difference between a Btu tax

and the personal income tax can be decomposed into:

(1)     the difference between a tax on particular industry outputs (fuels) and a tax on all industry gross
        outputs. and

(2)     the difference between a tax on all gross outputs and a tax on all final goods (the income tax).

The welfare importance of the first of these differences was seen by comparing the results in rows I and

2 of Table 5. as discussed in the previous paragraph. The significance of the second of these differences

is indicated from a comparison of the results in rows 2 and 5 of the table. These results indicate that

about a third (.086/.233) of the difference in GNP and welfare costs between the Btu and personal income

tax is attributable to this second dimension.

        Significance of Taxing Consumption Goods Rather Than All Final Goods. Table 5 affords another

useful comparison. The overall difference between a gasoline Lax and the personal income tax can be

decomposed into:

(I)     the difference between a tax on a particular consumer good (gasoline) and a tax on all consumer
        goods, and

(2)     the difference between a tax on all consumer goods and a tax on all final goods (the income tax).

The first of these differences was already observed by comparing rows 3 and 4 of Table 5. It is clear that

the first difference has a negalive impact relative to the personal income tax. The second of these
differences is seen by comparing rows 4 and 5. From the table it is clear that the narrow consumption

base of the gasoline tax exerts a strong negative welfare impact. In fact, the narrowness of the base is

important enough to undo the positive welfare impact (relative to an income tax) of taxing consumption

in general.
        Table 6 consolidates these findings. It shows the contributions of each of the above dimensions

to the differences in overall welfare impacts between the energy taxes and the personal income tax. For




       Subsequent simulation experiments confirm this suggestion.

                                                     27
both the Btu tax and gasoline tax, the relatively narrow base of the tax accounts for the greatest share of

its excess cost over a personal income tax increase. The other key feature of the gasoline tax -- its focus

on consumption goods -- narrows the excess cost of this policy; in contrast, the other key feature of the
Btu tax -- its focus on intermediate goods rather than final goods -- enlarges ils excess cost over an
income tax. This general pattern of results is sustained through further simulation expcrimenls.4' These

results are qualitatively similar to those obtained by Rotemberg and Woodford (1993) in a more
aggregated model that addresses issues of imperfect competition. These authors find that the costs of

energy taxes are considerably lower when the taxes are applied at the household level only, as compared

with the case where the taxes are applied on all energy use.

        Two important qualifications are in order. First, it is important to keep in mind that these results

ignore environmental effects; we consider such effects later in this section. In addition, strictly speaking

these results only indicate the relative impacts of "marginal" reforms -- lax changes which are
superimposed on the existing tax structure. They do not directly compare the effects of pure tax systems

in which the tax base is exclusively of one form (energy, gasoline use, or income).



3. Further Sensitivity Analysis
        Table 7 shows the sensitivity of results to key parameters. We concentrate on parameters that

govern the relative significance of the various "margim" discussed in the theoretical section of the paper.

        The intertemporal elasticity of substitution in consumption regulates the responsiveness of
household savings to changes in interest rates. The higher the value of this elasticity, the greater the



    " For example, we find that this pattern is the same regardless of the scale of the tax policies. We have
performed experiments in which the scale (or gross revenue yield) of the policies is 0.5. 2.. and 4 times that
considered in the main experiments. The rankings of the policies, as well as the relative significance of the various
smsctural features, remain the same as in the original experiments.

         En addition, we have examined the effects of a tax imposed on industrial users of gasoline. 'I'his latter
tax represents a narrowly-based gross output tax. This tax (scaled to imply the same gross revenue yield as the
consumer-level tax) produces a welfare change of -0.442. l'his is consistent with the results from tables 5 and 6.
As under the Btu tax, the welfare cost is larger than the cost of a broad-based gross output tax of equal revenue
yield.

                                                         28
potential for efficiency or welfare losses under policies that distort the capital market, or intertemporal
allocation of resources. Higher values for this elasticity imply larger welfare costs per dollar for the

energy tax policies and for the personal income tax increase. As this elasticity increases, welfare costs

rise less for the consumer-level gasoline tax than for the income tax; hence the excess cost declines with

an increase in this elasticity. This is in keeping with the fact that the income Lax is inferior to this

gasoline tax on the intenemporal margin, and the higher elasticity raises the significance of this margin.

Higher intertemporal elasticity increases somewhat the excess costs of the Btu tax, although the effect is

not strong.

         A higher elasticity of labor supply raises the potential magnitude of efficiency losses along the

labor-leisure margin. Higher values for this elasticity raise the welfare costa per dollar of all three taxes

shown here. The excess costs of both energy taxes decline with increases in this elasticity, indicating that

income taxes tend to distort the labor-leisure margin more than the energy taxes.

        Higher energy demand elasticities imply a greater potential for efficiency losses along the margin

of producer choice between energy inputs and the margin of consumer choice between energy products

(such as gasoline) and other consumer goods. Since energy taxes distort this margin more than income

taxes (subject to the qualifications of Section II). it is no surprise that the excess costs of the energy taxes

rise with increases in energy demand elasticities.

        Interestingly, although certain parameter values significantly reduced the excess costs of the energy

taxes, there were no cases where the excess costs were eliminated. AppaienUy. the narrowness of the

economic base of these taxes (and, in the case of the Btu tax, the focus on intermediate production) is

enough to generate excess costs along a wide range of parameter values.42



4. Effects on Particular Industries

        The focus of this paper is on economy-wide impacts. However, as will be seen below, there are



    •2 Further sensitivity analysis is performed in Bovenberg and Goulder (1993) for quite similar policies. That
analysis examines the sensitivity of excess costs to the rates of pre.existing taxes on labor and capital. Under the
range of lax rates considered, energy Ia.xes remain more costly than income taxes.

                                                        29
significant differences in the pollution impacts of the policy alternatives, and such differences are
explained by different patterns of industry impacts. Thus we present, in Table 8. the effects of the energy

and income taxes on the gross outputs of each industry. These results stem from the experiments in which

revenue-neutrality is accomplished through lump-sum reductions in personal taxes.
        The distribution of impacts across industries is quite different across policies. As one might have

expected, under the two energy taxes, the effects on gross output are much more concentrated. Under the

gasoline tax, the industrial effects are the most concentrated, with the petroleum refining industry (whose

activities include the processing of gasoline) experiencing the greatest Impact by far. Under the Blu tax.

effects are concentrated among the fossil fuels industries, petroleum refining industry, and the electric and

gas utilities industries. li contrast, under the two income tax policies the effects are much more evenly

dispersed.



C. Emissions Impacts
1. Comparison of Results across Policies

        An ideal comparison of efficiency effects of energy and income         taxes   would incorporate value

measures of the economic benefits from reduced pollution. The traditional efficiency costs from a given

policy would be subtracted from the value of the environmental benefits, producing the net efficiency gain

or loss. However, the values of the environmental benefits are largely unknown. Although valuing the

environmental impacts is a worthwhile ultimate goal, at present it seems most sensible to take a first step

toward that goal: namely, assessing the different emissions impacts of the different policies. To our

knowledge, no other general equilibrium study has linked the economy-wide impacts of these or other tax

reforms to the emissions impacts.43

         The different distributions of output effects shown in Table 8 will translate into differences in

emissions impacts to the extent that industries vary in their "pollution intensities," that is. in pollution



    '  Argonne National Laboratories is currently developing a model that explores the economy-wide emissions
impacts of alternative energy policies. The model has considerable detail on energy technologies. The model does
not have a general equilibrium structure, although it attends to some important market mteractions.

                                                       30
emissions per unit of output. Table 9 provides information on pollution intensities.                  It shows the
relative contributiort to emissions of the eight pollutants from the different industries of the model in the

baseline or reference case. These intensities are not exogenous inputs to the model; rather, they are

functions of the underlying emissions factors, input choices, and output levels for each industry and

household activity. Results n the table are for the year 2000 in the baseline. For SOX, NOX. and C02.

energy industries account for the lion's share of emissions. For this reason one might expect the energy

taxes -- which havesignificant impacts on these industries -- to induce much larger emissions reductions

than   income taxes of equal revenue yield.

         This expectation is borne Out by the policy impacts shown in tables lOa and lOb. These tables

show the emissions reductions stemming from the four policies in the years 2000 (Table lOa) and 2020

(Table lOb). The differences in emissions impacts between the energy tax and income tax policies are

striking. For every pollutant, the emissions reduction under the Btu or gasoline tax is at least nine times
larger than under either of the income tax policies. Under the energy taxes, the reductions in emissions
are much larger in percentage terms than the reductions in overall economic output (GNP). and reflect

substitutions of cleaner activities and fuels for those involving more pollution.

         In percentage terms, the emissions reductions from the Btu lax are largest for CO2 and NOX

compounds. While the Btu tax induces significant reductions from both stationary and mobile sources.

the gasoline tax (as expected) promotes reductions mainly from mobile sources. The gasoline tax leads

to 'substantial' reductions itt mobile-source emissions of all pollutants except particulate matter (PM 10)

and carbon dioxide (C02).

         Overall, these results offer evidence that Btu and gasoline taxes afford significant environmental

benefits relative to increases in income taxes. This complicates the ranking of energy and income taxes

in terms of overallefficiency: as yet, we do not have enough information to determine whether the larger

emissions reductions from energy taxes are important enough to offset the disadvantages of these taxes


    "  To gauge the emissions impacts of different policies, it does not suffice to observe the changes in industrial
output and the status quo pollution intensities. This is the case because pollution intensities will also change in
response to policy initiatives. As discussed in Section III. the simulation model attempts to account for such
changes.

on narrower efficiency grounds.



2. A Partial Benefit-Cost Analysis
        Despite the information limitations, some useful comparisons arc possible. Table II offers partial

benefit-cost information. The first row show the average annual emissions reductions from the two energy

tax policies.45 To give an idea of the levels (tons) of emissions reductions implied by these percentages.

we apply the average reductions to projected 1994 (baseline) emissions. These implied reductions are

presented in the second row of the table. As in previous tables, the units in row 2 are thousands of metric

tons for all pollutants except lead (which is in metric tons) and C02 (which is in millions of metric tons

of carbon).

        In the second portion of this table, we make suggestive benefit-cost comparisons. Row 3 presents

the annualized excess cost of the two energy tax policies. This cost index translates the overall excess

cost (a stock concept) into an annual cost flow that grows at the long-run growth rate of the economy.46

        In row 4, we make a tentative foray into the benefits dimension. Several Caveats are in order here.

First, we only consider C02-related benefits. Obviously this understates the overall environmental
benefits. Our purpose here is simply to consider what portion of the GNP costs might be offset by C02-

related benefits, and to allow readers to ponder whether the remaining GNP costs might be offset by the

reductions in other pollutants.

        The benefit-cost numbers are limited in another sense. The true benefits from reductions of CO2

(or other pollutants) are the result of complex links from benefits to concentrations to ultimate health and


    '   More precisely, these are averages of the excess reductions in C02 emissions over and above the
(negligible) reductions that would occur from a personal income tax increase. The averages are computed by
taking the present value of the changes in emissions over an infinite horizon, using the long-run after-tax interest
rate (4.8 percent) as the discount rate. An alternative approach is simply to treat the percentage reduction in
cumulative emissions (at some future point in time) as the average emissions reduction. In an economy where
output and emissions tend to increase through time, this latter approach tends to assign more weight to future
emissions reductions than does the approach we have taken.

       The annualized excess cost is equal to EV * (r-g)/( l+r). where EV is the excess cost of the policy change
(as measured by the equivalent variation), r is the long-run or steady-state after-Isa interest rate, and g is the long-
run growth rate of the economy. The values for r and g in the model are 4.8 percent and 2.0 percent, respectively.

                                                          32
welfare impacts. Given the complexity of these connections, it is likely that for each pollutant the benefits

per unit of emission reduction will vary geographically and through time. We have disregarded these
important complications. Instead, we assume, in the case of C02. fixed ratios of benefits per unit of

emission reduction. It is hoped that, despite these limitations, the figures in Table 11 are illuminating

rather than misleading.
         First steps toward assessing C02-related benefits were taken by Nordhaus (1991). who postulated

marginal environmental benefits from C02 emissions reduction as ranging from approximately $1.80 to

sixty-six dollars per ton. Row 4 of the table shows the annualized benefits from the C02 reductions under

two cases for each policy.4' The low C02 damages" scenario imputes the $1.80/ton value; the "high

C02 damages" case imputes the $66.00/ton value.45

         The results in the table indicate that the residual GNP losses -- annualized excess costs minus

annualized C02-related benefits --    are   highly sensitive to assumptions about the C02 damages. In the

case with high C02 damages, the C02-related environmental benefits from a Btu tax offset over 75
percent of the excess cost; in the case with low C02 damages, about three percent of the excess cost is
offset. The residual GNP losses are smaller for the gasoline tax than for the Btu tax; the reverse is true

in the high C02 damage scenario. This reflects the significant differences in the induced C02 reductions

of the two policies.39


    '   We annualize the environmental benefits in the same way excess costs are annualized. The annualized
benefit equal to EB * (r-g)/(l+r), where EB is the present value of the environmental benefits. r is the long-nm
real after-tax interest rate, and g is the long-nm real growth rate.

        These figures are based on assessments of the potential global-warming-related damages from C02. Direct
health effects of C02 are not considered. For this reason they may understate overall benefits from C02
reducuons. On the other hand, it should be noted that the Nordhaus estimates are of worldwide damages from
C02 emissions (or worldwide benefits from C02 emissions reductions). Benefits to the U.S. from C02 reductions
would be only a fraction of the worldwide benefits.
    "      It may seem surprising that when C02 damages of $66 are assumed, the Btu tax still fails to create
positive net benefits (or a negative residual ON? loss). Basic Pigovian tax principles would indicate that, so long
as an environmental tax rate is below (or not far above) the value of marginal environmental damages, then the
tax will be efficiency-improving. Under the Btu tax, the implied rate of tax per ton of carbon is $12.80 on coal.
$17.90 on natural gas, and S32.50 on crude oil. These rates are less than the assumed marginal damages from
carbon emissions, which would suggest that the Btu tax should be efficiency-improving. The positive residual
GNP loss thus seems to defy the Pigovian prediction.

                                                        33
           Table II does not answer the question whether either of the energy taxes is efficiency-improving

overall. Answering this question requires more information on the environmental benefits associated with

reductions in the other pollutants (as well as reduced uncertainty about C02-related benefits). Economics

and environmental science may one day be able to provide this information.




V. Conclusions

           This paper has employed a dynamic simulation model of the U.S.           to assess traditional' uson-
environmental) efficiency consequences and environmental effects of two U.S. energy tax policies: a tax

on fossil and synthetic fuels based on Btu (or energy) content and a tax on consumer purchases of

gasoline. The model uniquely combines attention to details of the U.S. tax system with a consolidated

treatment of U.S. energy use and pollution emissions.

           On traditional efficiency grounds, each of the energy taxes emerges as more costly to the economy

than equal-revenue increases in personal or corporate income taxes: the time profiles of GNP and

consumption are significantly tower under the energy taxes than under the alternatives. Likewise, the

welfare costs of the energy taxes are more than twice as large (Table 4) as the costs of equal-revenue

increments to personal or corporate income taxes. This result that energy taxes involve higher gross costs

is sustained over a fairly wide range of values for key behavioral parameters.

           An important structural difference between the Btu tax and the consumer-level gasoline tax is that

the former applies to a form of gross output while the latter applies to a particular final consumption good.

This difference underlies the contrasting investment and consumption profiles of the two energy tax

options.




         The Pigovian prediction falls because ii does not account for pre-existing taxes. Specifically, it neglects
the ways that energy taxes compound the gross distortions that other taxes generate in other markets. When other
taxes are present, the welfare (and GNP) costs of "small" environmental taxes can be quite large. The fact that
tax rates are below the marginal environmental damages does not assure a welfare improvement. This issue is
analyzed in detail in flovenberg and Goulder (1993).

                                                        34
        We perform a number of simulation experiments designed to which features of these taxes account

for their excess costs -- the non-environmental welfare cost over and above that of an equal-revenue

increase in the personal income tax. For both energy taxes, the relative narrowness of the tax base

accounts for most of the excess cost. For the Btu tax, the type of tax base -- its focus on gross output (as

opposed to net output under the personal income tax) -- also contributes to a significant share of the

excess cost. For the consumer-level gasoline tax, the fact that this tax applies to consumption rather than

income has a mitigating effect, serving to reduce the excess cost.

        On the environmental side, we find that for each of the eight major air pollutants considered, the

energy taxes induce emissions reductions that are at least nine times larger than the reductions under the

income tax alternatives. The differences in emissions impacts reflect the close connections between energy

use and pollution generation. For the Btu tax, the largest emissions reductions (in percentage terms) are

for C02 and NOX compounds. For the gasoline tax, the emissions reductions are spread fairly evenly

across six of the eight pollutants considered.

        Overall, this study indicates that the Btu and gasoline taxes considered are infenor to the

alternatives on narrow efficiency grounds but superior on environmental grounds. It remains an open

question whether the environmental attractions of these taxes are large enough to offset their relatively

high non-environmental costs. To settle this issue, analysts need to be able quantify more accurately the

link from emission reductions to environment-related improvements in human welfare. Further research

along these lines will help important environmental considerations gain a firm footing in the general

domain of tax policy analysis.

b. Endogerieitv of y in the Oil&Gas Production Function

        In industries other than oil&gas. the element y in the production function is
parametric. In the oil&gas industry, 'I'!   is   a decreasing function of cumulative oil&gas
extraction:


8)                                  Yf, =    [i
                                                  - (Z,/Z)]
where e1 and C2        are   parameters, Z represents cumulative extraction as of the

beginning of period t,       arid   Z is the original estimated total stock of recoverable
reserves of oil&gas (as estimated from the benchmark year). The following equation of
motion specifies the evolution of Z,:

9)                                          Z,,1 =Z +X,

Equation (8) implies that the production function for oil and gas shifts downward as
cumulative oil&gas extraction increases. This addresses the fact that as reserves are
depleted. remaining reserves become more difficult to extract and require more inputs per
unit of extraction.


2. Behavior of Firms

         In each industry, managers of firms are assumed to serve stockholders in aiming
to maximize the value of the firm. The objective of flim-value maximization determines
firms' choices of input quantities and investment levels in each period of time.
         The value of the firm can be expressed in terms of dividends and new share
issues, which in turn depend on profits in each period. The firm's profits during a given
period are given by:

where -ç is the tax rate on profits. p is the output price net of output taxes. w is the
wage rate net of indirect labor taxes, tL is rate of the indirect tax on labor, EMCOST
is the cost to the firm of energy and materials inputs, i is the gross-of-tax interest rate
paid by the firm, DEBT is the firm's current debt. TPRQP is property tax payments,
DEPL is the current gross depletion allowance, and DEPR is the current gross
depreciation allowance. TPROP equals tpPK,,j K,,                where t      is the property tax rate,

PK    is   the purchase price of a unit of new capital, and s is the time period. Current
depletion allowances, DEPL ,            are    a constant fraction          of the value of current
extraction: DEPL = 3pX. Current depreciation allowances, DEPR , can be expressed
as &KT, where KT is the depreciable capital stock basis and & is the depreciation rate
applied for tax purposes.3
             In equation (10) , EMCOST is given by:

                      EMCOST =            (I   +                   +

approximated by a schedule involving constant exponential tax depreciation.

of revenues:

12)                         it+BN+VN=DJV÷IEXP
The left-hand side is the firm's source of revenues: profits, new debt issue (BN) and
new share issues (VN) .    The uses of revenues on the right-hand side are investment
expenditure (1EXP) and dividend payments (D!V) .                     Negative share issues are
equivalent to share repurchases. and represent a use rather than source of revenue.
        Firms pay dividends equal to a constant fraction, a of profits net of economic
depreciation, and maintain debt equal to a constant fraction, 1, , of the value of the
existing capital stock. Thus:

consists of the current after-tax dividend plus the after-tax capital gain (accrued or
realized) on the equity value (V) of the firm net of the value of new share issues. This
return must be comparable to the after-tax return from an investment of the same value

capital stock:

Capital is augmented by net investment. Cumulative extraction is augmented by the level
of current output (or extraction). In the oil&gas industry, the equation of motion (9)
also applies.


B. Household Behavior
         Consumption, labor supply, and saving result from the decisions of an infinitely-
lived representative household maximizing its intertemporal utility with perfect foresight.
The nested structure of the household's utility function is indicated in Table A2. In year
  the household chooses a path of "full consumption' C to maximize

arbitrage equation to account for risk differentials across assets. See Goulder (1989).

C. Government Behavior
        A single government sector approximates government activities at all levels --
federal, state, and local. The main activities of the government sector arc purchasing

goods and services (both non-durable and durable), to transfemng incomes, and to raising
revenue through taxes or bond issue.


1. Components of Government Expenditure
        Government expenditure, G , divides into nominal purchases of nondurable goods
and services (GP) , nominal government investment (Gfl , and nominal transfers (Gfl:


23)                              G,=GP,+Gl,+GT,

        In the reference case, the paths of real GP , Gi, and GT all are specified as
growing at the steady-state real growth rate, g . In simulating policy changes we fix the
paths of GP , CI , and GT so that the paths of real government purchases, investment


                                           47
and transfers are the same as in corresponding years of the reference case. Thus, the
expenditure side of the government ledger is largely kept unchanged across simulaUons.
This procedure is expressed by:

(24a)                    GP   I p,      =   GP/
(24b)                    GI' I    p,   =    GII p'o,
(24c)                    GT I Pi.1 = GTI PT.I
The superscripts P and R denote policy change arid reference case magnitudes, while

PGP ' Pai'   and PGT are price indices for GP , GI , and GT . The price index for
government investment, PGI' is the purchase price of the representative capital good. The
price index for transfers, PGT' is the consumer price index. The index for government

purchases, p,     is defined below.


2. Allocation of Government Purchases
        GP divides into purchases of particular outputs of the 13 domestic industries
according to fixed expenditure shares:

25)                      tiQP =       GPXp1                      i= /     /3

GPX, and p are the quantity demanded and price of output from industry i .       and ti0,

B. Parameters of Stock Effect Function in Oil and Gas Industry


Parameter:                 Z0                    z



      Complete data documentation is provided in Cruz and Goulder (1992).

                                                 49

Note: The stock effect function is 2arameterized so that y1 approaches 0 as Z approaches Z
(see equation (8)). The value of Z is 450 billion barrels (about_IOU times the 1990 production
of oil and gas, where gas is measured in barrel-equivalents.) Z is based on estimates from
Masters el at. (1987). Investment in new oil and gas capital ceases to be profitable before reserves
are depleted: the values of e1 and e, imply that, in the baseline scenario, oil and gas investment
becomes zero in the year 2031

and a personal tax increase of equal revenue yield.

        The decomposition of overall excess cost is based on the following comparisons:

         Line Ia: Difference in welfare cost of broad-based output tax and the income tax increase.
         Line ib: Difference between excess costs of line 1 and line la.

Notes:

         Figures in columns 1-3 are the equivalent variation divided by the present value of gross tax revenues from the policy
         change. Figures in the last two columns arc the difference in results for the energy tax in question (from column I or 2)
         and the personal income tax increase (column 3). Central case values for intenemporal elasticitity of substitution and
         labor-leisure substitution elasticity are 0.5 and 0.69, respectively. The value of 0.69 for the labor-leisure substitution
         parameter implies a compensated elasticity of labor supply of 0.5 a! initial baseline prices.

Notes:
I.     Units are metric tons for lead, millions of metric tons for cabon dioxide, and thousands of metric tons for other
       pollutants.
2.     The synfuels industry is not shown because synfuels production does not begin until 2015.
3.     C'02 emissions were allocated based on the emissions content of    fossil fuel inputs.    Hence, no emissions are
       attributed to residential and transportation uses of derivative (refined) fuels.
