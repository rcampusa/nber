In   1944 Franco Modigliani published a famous article summarizing the

Keynesian model; in 1963 he extended the 1944 framework. This paper,

written for a conference in honor of Modigliani, asks how the earlier

papers would be modified in the light of recent developments in

macroeconomics. The attempt is not to summarize modern macroeconomics,

but rather to describe the structure modern macroeconomists should have

in mind in thinking about the way the economy and macroeconomic policy

work. The paper argues that the basic structure of the 1963 model still

stands, with modifications. The 1985 version is an extended Phillips-

curve—augmented IS—LM model. The major modifications to the 1963 model

are in the treatment of the Phillips curve and aggregate supply, in the

analysis of expectations, and in the openness of the economy.

pointing in 1963 to developments that were soon to be embodied in the

 policy and unemployment "equilibria' in the Keynesian model. It is

 interesting too for its grappling with the Hicksian Value and Capjal

argument that the short term interest rate is determined by the

 transaction costs of moving between zero interest money and interest—

bearing short-term securities. The same issue has been emphasized

recently by Neil Wallace (1981); the well-known difficulty of generating

a demand for the non—interest bearing asset, money, when interest-

bearing assets are available is typically overcome by modern theorists

by postulating that money has to be used to make a purchase (the Clower

constraint) or that money—holding yields unspecified utility services.

        The 1963 article describes its macroeconomics as those of the

mid—fifties. The basic macroeconomic model is more sophisticated than

the 1944 version in its handling of the banking system and the

distinction between inside and outside money, the consumption and

investment functions, and the exp1icit inclusion of a government budget

constraint potentially linking monetary and fiscal policy. Most

interesting from the viewpoint of current controversies are the brief

discussion of markup pricing as an alternative to the Keynesian supply

function that makes output a decreasing function of the real wage, the

demonstration that credit rationing does not much change the

macroeconomic analysis of the operation of monetary policy3, and the


3Recent work on the microeconomics of credit rationing (for example,
Jaf'fee and Russell (1976), Keeton (1979), Stiglitz and Weiss (1981)) has
not been assimilated into analytic macroeconomic models, though credit
rationing is an essential component of the operation of monetary policy
in the MPS model. See Blinder (1985) for a recent attempt at a simple
macroeconomic model in which credit rather than interest rates is the
main transmission mechanism for monetary policy; Friedman (1983) has
emphasized the credit—GNP relationship.

real wage rigidity. There is in addition a hint that the author did not

at the time regard the Phillips curve trade-off dilemma as a serious

one

        In this paper I ask what 'my 1985 article" would look like if

Franco Modigliani had the time to set out a representative macroeconomic

model——or rather two models-—of the mid—eighties. The attempt to set

out representative models may reasonably be regarded as not only

presumptuous but also foolish.   I trust that the presumptuousness will

be excused as an attempt to smoke out the views of the discussant.5

        The attempt may be regarded as foolish because no single model

can possibly hope to encompass the many substantial analytic

contributions to modern macroeconomic theory. To name only a few:

commodity monies, and about multiple equilibria arising from non-

        The list of topics is incomplete—-among the missing are

indexation, the microeconomics of money, models of banking, information-

based macroeconomics, real business cycle theory, and search theoretic

models of labor market dynamics and the natural rate of unemployment--

and the lists of authors can be multiplied many times. However, in the

spirit of the earlier papers, the attempt is not to summarize all of

modern macroeconomics but rather to describe the structure most modern

macroeconomists should have in mind if and when they think about the way

the economy and macroeconomic policy work.

        The essential question is what difference do the many

contributions described above make to our basic understanding of the way

the economy works? Does "my 1963 model" have to be thrown away, or does

the basic structure still stand?   Modern textbooks, and this paper, say

the structure still stands, to be sure with some rooms added, with some

altered, and with modern styling replacing the fashions of twenty years

ago.
                                                                          6



         In saying this, I certainly do not mean we have learned nothing

 in the last twenty years: the sample of topics and papers above is

 sufficient evidence of the fundamental significance of much of the

research of the past twenty years. Nor would I want to encourage any

Bourbons who see no reason to go beyond what they knew under the

previous regime: the technical level and sophistication of modern

macroeconomics demand full time attention and effort.

        While no single model comfortably encompasses the basic views of

unreconstructed Keynesians, old-line monetarists, and fresh-water

macroeconomjsts6 along with those of the eclectic center, the model that

comes closest, and that best serves to focus discussion of macroeconomic

Controversies, is the extended Phillips-curve-augmented IS-LM model.7

The choice of a non—maximizing model may render the exercise suspect to

many in the profession.8 But it has the benefit of providing a

believable account of the operation of the economy.



        The major modifications that have to be made to the 1963 model

are in the treatment of the Phillips curve and aggregate supply, in the


The phrase is Robert Hall's.
 Policano (1985) expresses some surprise that the IS-LM model is still
the basic model used in modern macroeconomics textbooks. The
versatility of the model is responsible for its survival: it can be used
to analyze both monetary and fiscal policy, in both full employment and
unemployment modes; it can generate quantity theory or pure Keynesian
results with only minor modifications. The model Is capable of
accommodating monetarist and Keynesian views, as Friedman's (1970)
theoretical framework shows. In my view it can also accommodate a basic
rational expectations—market clearing view, though I am not sure
adherents of that approach would agree.
 There is no necessary inconsistency between IS—LM type models and
maximizing models; see for Instance Aiyagari and Gertler (1985).

analysis of expectations9, and in the openness of the economy. Because

dynamics depends sensitively on details of lag specifications in each

component of the model, I will not lay much stress on the specifics of
                      10
dynamic adjustment.



I. THE SIMPLEST CLOSED ECONOMY MODEL.

        The general structure of the models is the same as that of the

1944 and 1963 versions and the standard textbook model in using separate

equilibrium conditions for the goods market, the asset markets, and the

labor market.

        In the closed economy model, the level of output is determined

by aggregate demand and supply. Aggregate demand is a function of

permanent labor income (YP), current income (Y), wealth, the real

interest rate (r), government spending on goods and services (G), and

taxes net of transfers (T).


9me earlier models assumed unitary elasticity of expectations, which
translates into the assumption that all changes that take place are
expected to be permanent. The assumption is not fully specified until
It becomes clear whether it applies to levels of variables or their
tes of change.
  A view implicit in much recent literature is that each dynamic
adjustment mechanism by itself should be capable of explaining business
cycle dynamics, which ——waiving questions about the existence of a
trend--can be summarized by the second order difference equation for
detrended output,     =   y - + a t-2 + e where c is  serially
uncorrelated, a1 Is about i5   an   a2 Is about (—.45). The multiplier-
accelerator mecfianism or Metzlerian inventory dynamics come close to
producing this adjustment pattern, but it may rather be the interaction
of the many dynamic adjustment mechanisms in the economy--slow price and
wage adjustment, slow adjustment of labor and capital inputs, inventory
and fixed Investment dynamics, exchange rate dynamics-—that is
responsible for GNP's hump shape. Rose (1985) in ongoing research asks
why so many economic variables appear to have very similar, and very
simple, dynamic behavior when lagged adjustment is assumed to be
widespread.
                                                                          8

                                + K, r, q, G, T)


Current income enters in addition to permanent labor income because of

evidence that Consumption demand is more sensitive to current income

than is implied by the pure life cycle—permanent income hypothesis.11

Permanent income may affect not only consumption but also investment

demand, as has been emphasized by Eisner (1978). Real non-human wealth
Consists of real high-powered money (H) and government bonds (B) plus

the value of physical capital. We discuss below the issue of whether

debt is wealth, and the related question of whether future taxes should

also affect aggregate demand. The inclusion of just a short—term

interest rate is a simplifying assumption; the long rate, or Tobin's q—-

the ratio of the market value of capital to its replacement Cost——is

more relevant to the investment decision than the short rate.12

        Assuming the marginal propensity to consume out of current

income is less than unity, (1)' can be rewritten:

                   H ÷B
(1) V = A( V, ——— + K, r, 6, T)
                    P



For example, Flavin (1981) and Hall and Mishkin (1982).
  In an alternative formulation of the model, g would enter explicitly,
both in determining the value of the capital stock, and in affecting the
investment decision. The model would then be essentially that of Tobin
(1969). With q normally inversely related to r, an open market purchase
that reduces the interest rate then increases aggregate demand both
through a wealth effect on Consumption demand and a cost of capital
effect on investment (Modigliani, 1971). However, as Tobin shows, the
inclusion of q does not sigificantly change the analysis of the
operation of policy so long as bonds and capital are gross substitutes.
                                                                             9



             The demand for real balances is a function of the level of

income and output (in some versions spending replaces income), of' the

nominal interest rate, and of real wealth, designated V. Assuming a

constant ratio between the stock of money and the stock of high-powered

money13, the equilibrium condition in the money market can be written

(2) H/P =       L(Y,    r+ir, V)

where it is the expected rate of inflation and

             The treatment of capital in the assets markets is the same as

that of the 1944 and 1963 papers, implicitly assuming that capital and

bonds are perfect substitutes (Tobin, 1963). The more complete

treatment in which adjustment costs imply that the price of installed

capital-—Tobin's q--may vary and in which capital and bonds are gross

substitutes does not much affect the analysis of open market operations

(Tobin, 1969).

             Aggregate supply starts with a wage setting equation:

(3) W =
        t
                  e +
                        f(Y
                        —   t'e

where          is the predetermined wage rate in period ,   P and e are the
price level and level of output expected to obtain in period t at the

time wages are set;14 Y appears in the wage setting equation to reflect

the possibility that the wage in period t is determined in part on the


13Movements in the money multiplier have at times, notably in the Great

sufficiently important to carry the money multiplier as a separate

basis of a pre--determined overtime schedule. A price setting equation

completes the supply side:

(4) Pt =   h(W,    Y
The price setting equation is consistent with two major alternatives:

first that output supplied is a decreasing function of the real wage; or

second that price is set as a constant mark—up on the wage or on costs.

The conventional Keynesian supply function with output a decreasing

function of the real wage can obtain when the function h( )   Is
increasing ifl both its arguments; the simplest mark—up pricing equation

holds when Y drops out of the function h( ).

        The model is completed by the government budget constraint:

(5) Gt —        + It(Bt')t) =
           Tt                   (Mt÷1—Mt + Bt+1—B)/P
In (5), net transfers, T, are defined exclusive of interest payments on

the debt. The interest payments are singled out for separate treatment

for the later discussion of debt dynamics.



Comparison with 1963 and Discussion.

        Equations (1), (2) and (5) are virtually Identical to equivalent

equations in the 1963 paper15. The major differences are in the lack of

detail about the banking system in the 1985 version and In the

specification of aggregate supply. The details of the 1963 version were

heavily influenced by the author's desire to discuss both the Gurley-

Shaw inside—outside money distinction and the Patinkin dichotomy—

neutrality controversy. The 1985 version shares the judgment of both


5That model did not explicitly include government spending however.
                                                                        11




the 1944 and 1963 papers in placing the main leverage of monetary policy

in price stickiness rather than equilibrium non-neutralities.

        On the aggregate supply side, the 1963 version formalized the

notion that the wage is constant up to the point of full employment with

labor input determined by the demand for labor, and that thereafter the

nomina1 wage adjusts to generate the rea1 wage at which labor supply is

equal to demand,16 As previously noted, there is also a discussion of

markup pricing, in which In the short run output is determined by demand

at the price level determined by the prevailing level of wages.

        In the 1985 version the wage for each period is mostly

predetermined by a Friedman-Phelps-Phillips curve. The length of the

period is not specified. Output and labor input is then determined by

demand, perhaps even beyond the point of conventional full employment as

workers go on overtime. The formulation in terms of output rather than

unemployment saves an Okun's law equation relating output to

unemployment; it is possible that this formulation beyond its parsimony

has served also to reduce the attention paid to unemployment as the

macroeconomic problem,

        The demand determination of output is at the heart of one of the

key controversies in macroeconomics. The fact of predetermination of

wages is not necessarily disputed, but the Keynesian notion that demand

determines output-—implying that there might be either under- or

overemployment of labor--is (Barro, 1977).   I have nothing new to


16Eguation (6) of the 1963 model comes close to writing down the "mm"
formulation of disequilibrium economics in which labor input is
determined by the minimum of quantity supplied and demanded at the
existing wage/price vector.
                                                                         12




contribute on the issue of whether the labor market should be thought of

as clearing in some sophisticated sense in the very short as well as the

long period, but record the view that the aggregate supply framework of

this paper, which includes the expectations—adjusted Phillips curve, has

performed well in recent years in providing an interpretation of the

recent disinflation.

        The long—run Phillips curve in the 1985 model Is vertical:

nominal wages adjust to anticipated changes in the price level so that

there is no trade-off between output and inflation when the inflation is

anticipated.17 In this framework, the length of the period over which

the wage is predetermined is a major determinant of macroeconomic

dynamics. The model's dichotomy in which the wage is predetermined for

a period is a substantial simplification of the real-world adjustment

process in which staggered wage and price setting can generate long-

lived adjustments out of comparatively short contracts.18

        A further controversy centers around the role and determinants

of expected price and output levels in the wage setting process. The

17
   The specification of the wage setting equation in levels is not
innocent. One implication is that past mistakes are forgotten in the
wage—setting process. A formulation in which the rate of change of the
real wage is made a function of the level of output builds mistakes
permanently into the real wage. Another implication is that there is a
unique full employment real wage, whereas in the rate of change
formulation, the steady—state level of employment is independent of the
real wage. The latter property would be more plausible if the wage
equation (3) were formulated in terms of the unemployment rate rather
than output. The two formulations do not differ in their implications
for short—run output determination, but have different dynamic and
policy Implications.   The empirical evidence is mixed, though for the
period since the mid—sixties the rate of change formulation appears more
gnsistent with the data (Blanchard, 1985a)
  Taylor (1980), Blanchard (1983). See also footnote 10.
                                                                            13




spirit of the rational expectations approach is to condition those

expectations on expectations of policy and other exogenous variables.

Counterposed to this view is the undoubtedly true statement that most

people do not know what the money supply--let alone its expectation--is,

and thus that they base expectations on the actual behavior of the

relevant variable. Adaptive expectations are likely used in routine

circumstances when the consequences of error are small and more

comprehensively-based expectations at times when there are major changes
in policy.

           Assuming expectations are rational neutralizes expectations as

an independent source of economic dynamics; the implications of

alternative expectations assumptions can usefully be investigated if

there is reason to believe they are not rational. So can questions of

the credibility of announced changes in policy. But rational

expectations is the right initial hypothesis.

The Agggate Supply      Curve.

           The aggregate supply curve, AS, in Figure 1 is derived from (3)

and (4).     If the markup is constant and the nominal wage is not a

function of the current level of output, the aggregate supply curve is

horizontal, as on AS'. If the mark—up and/or the wage increases with

the current level of output, the aggregate supply curve is positively

sloped, as is AS. We henceforth assume the short—run supply curve is

positively sloped.

           Held constant along an aggregate supply curve are the expected

price level and expected level of output. An increase in either shifts

 the aggregate supply curve up, raising price at each level of output.

 Provided output in equation (4) is a function of the real wage, there is

 a unique long-run full employment level of output at which the long run

aggregate supply curve is vertical.

aggregate_Demand.

         The aggregate demand curve AD in Figure 1 represents equilibrium

in both the goods and the assets markets. Substituting for the real

interest rate in (1) from (2) and the relationship between real and

nominal rates, we obtain the AD curve as a relationship between the

price level and current level of output; its position depends on the

expected rate of inflation, the stock of bonds, and fiscal policy

parameters. In calculating the slope of the AD curve we assume

permanent income increases, but not much, with current income.19

        The negative slope of the AD curve reflects both the so-called

Hicks—Keynes effect that arises from the increase in the nominal

interest rate (and with expected inflation held constant, the real rate

of interest) as real balances fall, and the wealth effect of an increase

in prices on the real value of wealth. The Hicks-Keynes effect is

sufficient to produce AD's negative slope.

        An increase in the expected rate of inflation, or government

spending, or a reduction in taxes, shifts the AD curve up and to the

right, increasing output and the price level. An increase in the stock

of high—powered money or government bonds likewise shifts the AD curve


19For the AD curve to slope down, the total effect of a unit increase in
current income on aggregate demand, operating on consumption both
directly and through permanent income, and on investment through the
accelerator has to be less than unity.
                                                                         15




to the right. We discuss later the question of whether bonds are net

wealth. An equiproportionate increase in the stocks of money and bonds

shifts the AD curve up proportionately, indicating the potential

neutrality of such a policy change.

Equilibrium.

        Output and the price level are determined at point E in Figure

1. We describe E as a position of short—run equilibrium, though the

expectations on which wages were determined may be falsified. If either

the price level or the level of output is different from the level that

was expected, the quantity of labor employed will not be equal to the

quantity workers would prefer to supply. Point E can be a position of

long—run equilibrium only if workers' expectations are fulfilled, if the

budget is balanced, and if the remaining exogenous variables are

constant.

        We now use the model to analyze a variety of' policy changes.

An_Open_arket_Purchase.

        An open market purchase increases H while decreasing B by an

equal amount. There is no wealth effect at the initial price level. At

any given level of Income, the larger money stock reduces the interest

rate, shifting the aggregate demand curve to the right.

        If the change in the money stock was unanticipated, both the

level of output and the price level rise In the short run. Then as

expectations adjust, the short run supply curve shifts up, and more of

the adjustment takes the form of a price increase. Eventually output

returns to the full employment level at a higher price level. The real
                                                                         16




and nominal interest rates fall because the ratio of money to bonds has

risen; the stock of real high powered money increases, implying that

prices rise proportionately less than the money stock.

        Because the open market purchase reduces the public's holdings

of bonds, disposable income would fall unless there were an offsetting

reduction in net taxes, which we therefore assume to have been made. In

addition, the lower real interest rate increases the rate of investment,

implying the full employment level of output rises relative to what it

would otherwise have been. We do not take explicit account of this

effect of the monetary change.

                                 Run.

        Suppose the government increases spending and reduces taxes; the

change has not been anticipated in wage setting. Both the tax reduction

and the increase in spending raise aggregate demand; if the expected

rate of inflation remains unchanged or rises, the price level and level

of output will rise. Again provided the expected rate of inflation does

not fall, and if wealth effects on the demand for consumption and real

balances are small, both the real and the nominal interest rates will

increase. The analysis is entirely that of the conventional IS—LM

model, except for the need to consider the effects of the fiscal

expansion on the expected rate of inflation.

        Except when fiscal policy takes the form of balanced budget

changes in expenditure, fiscal expansion implies subsequent changes in

the stocks of money and bonds. If the fiscal policy change is

transitory, there need be only one—time changes in asset stocks; if the
                                                                         17




change is permanent there will be ongoing changes in asset stocks. We

consider permanent fiscal changes.

Money-Financed_Deficits.

        Suppose there was initia1ly no government debt and that after

the fiscal expansion, high-powered money Is printed to cover the

deficit. In the new steady state, and absent growth of output, the

growth rate of money and the inflation rate will both be 8 where e

satisfies
(6) e.(H/P) =   G —   T.

Permanent money financing of deficits Is possible only if the deficit is

small, for the maximum amount of steady state seigniorage is small.

        The goods market equilibrium condition can be rewritten

(7) Y = A( Y, L( Y, r+e, V) + K, r, G, T)

The fiscal expansion—-the increase In G and reduction in T---tend to

Increase the real interest rate at the full employment level of output.

Offsetting that effect is the reduction in real balances that arises

from the Increase In the expected rate of inflation. But if the wealth

effect of reduced high-powered money holdings on consumption demand Is

small——as it is——the real interest rate will increase to maintain goods

market equilibrium in the long run. With the real interest rate higher,

the nominal rate too must rise.

        Thus permanent fiscal expansion, even if it is money financed,

raises the real interest rate in both the short and the long runs. This

conclusion would be changed If Individuals were infinite horizon

maximizers with a constant rate of time preference: in that case saving
                                                                                   18




 behavior adjusts so that the real after-tax interest rate is always

 driven to the rate of time preference.               The real interest rate could be

 changed in the long run in such models only through taxation of the

return on capital.

Bond Financing of Deficits.

           Pure bond financing of deficits Is not possible in the steady

state In a non-growing economy. Holding the stock of nominal balances

Constant, the government budget constraint is


(8)           =        —        +
                  Gt       Tt       (l-i-it)(Bt/Pt)

If interest payments are not included in T (net taxes minus transfers),

or if the non-interest deficit does not for any other reason decrease as

the stock of bonds increases, then (8) is an unstable equation provided

the real interest rate is positive; the simple notion that ever-

increasing interest payments overwhelm the budget is true in this

case.2° Even if the budget deficit is defined inclusive of real

interest payments, there can be no steady state unless the deficit is

zero. 21


20Rewriting the left hand side as
                                  (Bt+i/Pti)(P +1' and dividing
through by (P        the coefficient on the real stock of bonds on the
right hand sie becomes the real interest rate. The effect of
in reducing the real value of G - T on the right hand side is an
artifact of discrete time and should be ignored. Modification of this
uation to the case of a growing economy is straightforward.
  If the budget deficit Is defined inclusive of nominal interest
payments on the debt, then equation (8) appears to make possible a
steady state with positive deficit. But (a) this is purely a result of
an inflation illusion in fiscal policy, in which non-interest transfer
payments are reduced as the debt increases and (b) there will be a
steady state only if the stock of money is increasing at the same rate
as the nominal stock of debt.
                                                                         19



        Although pure debt financing of a deficit is not possible in

steady state in a non-growing economy, mixed money and debt financing of

small deficits is possible: essentially the seigniorage pays the

interest bill on the outstanding stock of debt as well as covering the

deficit. This is one sense in which Sargent and Wallace's (1980)

argument that deficit financing is inflationary is correct. Similarly,

transitory debt financing of a deficit wiLl leave a larger debt and

larger interest payments than money financing, so that eventually a

higher inflation rate will be needed to finance the larger interest—

inclusive deficit.

        The contrast between the short run discussed in the previous

section and the long run in this section is very sharp. In the short

run debt financing probably raises the price level less than money

financing; in the long run it does not. Equivalently, short term debt

financing of a transitory deficit, with all future interest—inclusive

deficits held constant, raises the price level less than money financing

of the same deficit.22

Bonds and Net Wealth

        The long-run non—neutrality of money when the ratio of money to

bonds is changed results from the assumption that government bonds are
net wealth. The assumption that bonds are net wealth was discussed by

Patinkin (1963) who recognized that the issue was whether individuals in

aggregate regarded themselves as having a future tax liability with


22This implies that future net taxes are increased to offset the effects
of higher interest payments resulting from the transitory debt financed
deficit.
                                                                        20


 present value equal to that of the debt. If the debt was to be paid off

 by future generations, the logical assumption seemed to be that the debt

was net wealth. Barros (1974) contribution to the debate was the

recognition that finitely lived individuals could nonetheless have

effectively infinite horizons if they cared in a particular way about

their heirs' utility. In this case the debt would not be wealth.23

        The issue turns out to be surprisingly far-reaching. For

instance, does the pay as you go nature of social security affect

capital accumulation? Is the national debt a burden in the Modigliani

(1960) sense that it leaves future generations with a smaller capital

stock? Does deficit rather than tax financing raise the real interest

rate?   In all cases the answer turns on the same considerations as

whether the debt is wealth.24

        Further, if individuals act as if they are infinitely lived, the

life—cycle hypothesis of consumption has to be significantly modified to

include the making of bequests. Indeed, recent research by Kotlikoff

and Summers (1981) argues that most wealth is the result not of life—

cycle saving, but of bequests.


23The question arises whether the government can keep rolling over the
debt rather than paying it off. The rolling over strategy is possible
only if the growth rate of population exceeds the real interest rate, in
which case the equilibrium is inefficient. When the equilibrium is
efficient, a transversality condition for the government debt in effect
p1ies that the debt is paid off.
  That is, provided individuals are not liquidity constrained.
Liquidity Constraints dominate the issue of Ricardian equivalence in the
sense that with liqudity constraints, flows of current income affect
aggregate demand whether or not individuals would treat the debt as
wealth if they were not constrained.
                                                                        21




          Despite the importance of the issue, there have been no

empirical tests sufficiently decisive to move prior beliefs about the

issue.25 The Ricardo-Barro hypothesis implies that private consumption

should be invariant to the financing of government spending; private

saving should thus rise when the budget deficit increases. Neither this

implication of the hypothesis or its opposite, nor the effects of social

security on savings, have yet been convincingly established

econometrically. Those willing to accept more casual evidence point to

reductions in private saving rates and increases in real interest rates

as budget deficits have increased since 1981 as prima_fade evidence

against the hypothesis.

          Tobin and Buiter (1981) have shown that childlessness, zero

bequests, and a variety of other likely events cause the failure of the

Ricard-Barro mechanism, all in the direction that causes the debt to be

treated as net wealth. Drazen (1978) suggests that a national debt

overcomes the difficulty for parents of appropriating some of the return

from investing in their children's human capital and thereby raises

national wealth. Barsky, Mankiw and Zeldes (1984) show that in the

absence of human capital insurance, future taxes to repay debt reduce

the variance of future income, raising current consumption and thus in

effect making the debt net wealth. Abel (1985) shows that with

uncertain lifetimes, the debt may be net wealth.


25Seater (1985) provides a useful review of research on this issue, with
references to much of the literature. See also Modigliani and Sterling
(1985).
                                                                          22




         The weight of the theoretical arguments26 and in my view the

 empirical evidence suggests the debt is to a significant extent net

 wealth, but those whose priors are sufficiently strong can continue, at

 least for the present, to believe it is not.   In the remainder of the

paper we treat the debt as net wealth, recognizing that in practice

future tax liabilities fall to some extent on those now living, and that

the debt would thus be discounted to some extent.

         The short run effectiveness of monetary policy is not dependent

on whether the debt is net wealth. So long as wages and prices are

sticky in the short run, monetary policy will have real effects. This

is very much the message of Modigliani (1963), who downplays the

importance of the long-run non-neutralities of money of the type that

arise when the debt is wealth. On the fiscal policy side, the issue of

whether the debt is net wealth is crucial to the question of whether a

tax cut is expansionary and raises the real interest rate.27

The Fisher Relation and the Mundell--Tobjn Effect.

        Because the 1963 paper was written before persistent inflation

became a primary concern of United States macroeconomics, the Fisher

relation and Its distinction between the real and the nominal interest

rates was not discussed.28

26
  Bernheim and Bagwell (1985) make what they describe as the reductioad
absurdum argument that if all individuals are effectively linked——for
instance by the possibility that their descendents might marry each
other——then all redistributions have no effects on real resource
allocation, being Immediately undone by the recipients. Further, tax
distortions are non-existent because individuals internalize the
eratIon of the government.
28 footnote 24.
 The Fisher effect is discussed by Friedman (1968).
                                                                        23



        The pure Fisher effect, in which the real interest rate is

invariant to the inflation rate, does not obtain in the current model,

even when the nominal stocks of both money and bonds increase at a

constant rate. The Mundell—Tobin effect is responsible for the non—

neutrality.

         Consider the full employment version of the current model in

which inflation has been anticipated in wage setting.   Suppose for

simplicity that the stock of bonds is zero, and that the growth rate of

money has increased from zero to some positive rate. The money enters

the economy through transfer payments, but there is an offsetting

reduction in disposable income arising from capital losses on existing

holdings of money.

        Real balances will be constant in the new steady state. Suppose

for the moment that the real interest rate remained unchanged, with the

nominal interest rate increasing one for one with the inflation. Then

real balances would be reduced. But this means the goods market cannot

be in equilibrium, because aggregate demand is reduced below supply.

The real interest rate has to fall to maintain equilibrium, the final

result being an increase in the nominal and a reduction in the real

interest rate. Because the real high powered money stock is small,

though, this non—neutrality is likely to be empirically unimportant in

the long run.29 Tax distortions of the type emphasized by Feldstein

(1983) are potentially a more important source of non—Fisher results.


29The mechanism that has been described here is that of Munde1l (1964).
The Tobin (1965) non-neutrality of inflation arises from the assumption
that individuals consume a constant fraction of disposable income, which
includes the value of net (inflation adjusted) transfer payments. In a
growing economy, the value of these net transfer payments includes a
term g.m where g is the growth rate of the economy and a is the value of
real balances. With m falling with the rate of inflation, consumption
at a given level of output will fall when the inflation rate rises,
producing the same effect on aggregate demand as that in the text.
                                                                          24



          Perhaps the most interesting Fisher—related result is the

 claimed rejection of the Fisher effect by Summers (1982). Summers,

 working with decadal averages, finds almost no relationship between the
 nominal interest rate and the inflation rate. He interprets this as

 showing that even in the long run the nominal interest rate barely

 changes with the expected inflation rate, thus going well beyond Irving

 Fisher1s claim that it takes decades for the Fisher neutrality to

 obtain .30

         The question of the Fisher effect is still open though. Barsky

 (1985) argues that the price level in the ineteenth century essentially

followed a random walk, so that the ex ante nominal and real rates were

the same; he also shows that the differences in decade average real

rates are not significant. Further, controversy still obtains (McCallum

(1984) and Summers (1984)) over whether working with data averaged over

long periods, or with the low frequency end of the spectrum as Summers

does in his econometric tests, handles the difficulty of the distinction

between actual and anticipated inflation.



II. Qpening the Economy..




30me early Fama result (1975) of constancy of the real interest rate
appeared even then to be a result peculiar to the period of the
regression; after the real interest rate changes of the early eighties,
any notion of even approximate real interest rate constancy must be
rejected.
                                                                        25



        In 1944 it was certainly reasonable for the basic model of U.S.

macroeconomics to represent a closed economy.3l Even in 1963 when

balance of payments concerns were serious, recognizing the openness of

the economy would not have required much change in the basic model.

With the nominal exchange rate fixed and the price level assumed

constant, the real exchange rate in an open economy version of the 1963

model would have been constant and the current account a simple function

of the level of income. With capital flows relatively insignificant,

the current account could be taken as the driving force in international

transactions.

        In 1985 international transactions play a larger role in

determining the behavior of the U.S. economy. Supply shocks that

originated abroad were instrumental in the two inflationary episodes of

the seventies; the volume of trade has more than doubled as a percentage

of GNP in the last twenty years; the gap between domestic absorption and

output amounts at present to several percent of GNP. Under flexible

exchange rates and substantial capital mobility, monetary and fiscal

policy affect the nominal exchange rate quickly and, because domestic

prices are sticky, also affect the real exchange rate and resource

allocation.32 Monetary policy changes, such as the ill fated late 1978

31
  Keynes' own use of a closed economy model of Britain has frequently
been criticized. It is not obvious what features of the Keynesian
message would have been changed by recognizing the openness of the
British economy: government spending and tax cuts are still expansionary
in an open economy, as is an increase in the money supply unless the
onomy is in a liquidity trap.
  Dornbusch and Fischer (1984) contains an extended discussion of
international linkages of the U.S. economy and presents an open economy
model on which I draw.
                                                                           26




contraction, and the October 1979 "regime change" can be triggered by

concern over the dollar. No modern forecaster of inflation can ignore

the dollar.

          The exchange rate directly affects both goods and assets market

equilibria, and the aggregate supply or markup equation.    In the goods

market:

(1)" Y = A(Yp, V, r, G, T, e/P)

V is real wealth. The variable P now denotes the consumer price index.

The variable q will be used to denote the price of domestic output.33

          The money demand equation remains unchanged, though there is an

issue of whether the price of domestic output or the CPI, or some

combination, should be the deflator for real balances. The asset market

equilibrium condition has to be extended because domestic residents can

now hold an extra asset--foreign bonds. The simplest, risk neutral,

assumption is that expected returns on domestic and foreign bonds are

equalized. If 1* is the foreign interest rate, then

(9) i = 1* + e

where e is the expected rate of change of the exchange rate. Attempts

to locate a risk premium in the relationship between domestic and

foreign rates, perhaps as a function of the outstanding stocks of the

assets (Frankel, 1982) have not been successful. We thus will use (9),


33Denoting the price of domestic output by q, and setting the price of
foreign goods at unity, the CPI can be written

P = qSel—s; the relative price of foreign goods is then

e/q = (e/P)l/s; thus e/P in (1)" represents the price of foreign
relative to domestic goods.
                                                                            27




together with the assumption that the foreign interest rate is given, as

the portfolio equilibrium condition linking domestic and foreign

interest rates.34

           The price of domestic output, q, depends not only on wages and

output but also on the exchange rate:

    q = H(W, Y, e)

An increase in e is a depreciation of the exchange rate that increases

the price of domestic output. Using the definition of the CPI as a

weighted average of the price of domestic output and the exchange rate.

the pricing equation can be rewritten as:

(10) P = h(W, Y, e).

        Net wealth now consists not only of high—powered money, bonds

and capital, but also net ownership of foreign securities, F. Foreign

asset accumulation is equal to the current account surplus:

(11) V =   ((M+B)/P)   + K +   eF/P


(12) e(F÷l_p)/p         =   NX(Y, e/P) +   eti*(Ft/Pt)
        The analysis of monetary and fiscal policy is essentially that

of the Mundell—Fleming model.



An Open Market Purchase.

        Suppose the economy starts from a position of equilibrium and

that an open market purchase takes place. The domestic interest rate


34Although there is no compelling evidence for risk premia, there is
also no evidence that suggests the forecast implicit in (9) is a good
one. See for example Cumby and Obstfeld (1984).
                                                                         28



tends to fall, output and the price level to rise. Assuming the open

Market purchase is a once over event, with budgetary implications

neutralized by offsetting changes in taxes, the domestic price level

will be expected to rise further next period as wages adjust.

        With the domestic nominal interest rate lower, international

interest rate equalization implies that the exchange rate has to be

expected to fall next period. The real exchange rate therefore

depreciates (rises) this period (Dornbusch, 1976). Equivalently, the

lower domestic interest rate produces a capital outflow that causes the

exchange rate to depreciate. The depreciation increases the

inflationary effect of the expansionary monetary policy; to the extent

that the trade balance responds in the short run to the exchange rate,

the exchange rate effect also increases aggregate demand.

        In the longer term as prices adjust fully the exchange rate

returns close to its initial level. The increase in the ownership of

foreign assets during the adjustment period implies a capital inflow in

future years, requiring a slightly appreciated future exchange rate.



Fiscal_Expansion

        Expansionary fiscal policy tends to increase the domestic

interest rate and appreciate (reduce) the exchange rate. The

inflationary impact of the expansion is modified by the exchange rate

appreciation. Both domestic investment and net exports are crowded out.

The decline in ownership of foreign securities during the adjustment

periods requires a slightly depreciated exchange rate In future to
                                                                         29



generate the current account surplus to pay the interest on the foreign

borrowing.



        Recognition of the openness of the economy thus modifies the

analysis of monetary and fiscal policy. For a given increase in nominal

aggregate demand, a monetary expansion is more inflationary and a

fiscal expansion less inflationary in the short run than they would be

in the closed economy. Empirical estimates suggest the differential

effects are not mere theoretical niceties, but are rather empirically

significant and to be taken account of in the choice of policy, for

instance during a process of disinflation.35



iii. conciudg_cornrnents.



        None of us has not heard the joke about the unchanging questions

and the changing answers in economics exams. Contrary to the joke, the

basic answers in this paper to how monetary and fiscal policy work are

close to those of the earlier papers. But it is only the basic answers

to the question of whether changes in monetary and fiscal policy have

real effects that are unchanged. The modern answers differ in placing

much greater emphasis on expectations, on stock—flow relations, on the

openness of the economy, and in the modelling of aggregate supply. They

differ also because they are less certain than they were then, and they

command less consensus within the profession.

                                                                          30



         Part of the loss of certainty arises from the complexity of

 dynamics in model even as simple as the present ones36: serious

 macroeconomics that attempts to describe the behavior of the economy

 rather than ll1ustrate particular points may no longer be possible with

 just pen and paper, but may rather need more powerful technology.

Certainly analysis of the adjustment of the economy to disturbances or

policy changes to be used in actual policy making is bound to use a more

detailed model than can be solved explicitly. The dynamic properties of

the major econometric models, or of maximizing models such as those of

Kydland and Prescott (1982), can be understood by means of simulations,

but not from analytic exercises.   It could be argued that the right way

to do macroeconomics is to study the detailed structure of such models

and to develop understanding of how they work through a variety of

simulation exercises. That is the only way to understand a particular

large-scale model; the purpose of simpler models like those in this

paper is to develop a sense of the overall structure of the economy and

intuition about its working.

        The loss of assurance is best explained by asking what view was

being contested in the 1944, 1963, and 1985 papers. In 1944 Franco

Modigliani was contesting Keynes' claim to have produced an unemployment

equilibrium and analyzing Keynesian interest rate theory. In 1963 he

was contesting the Gurley-Shaw--Radciiffe view that the basic model would

be significantly altered by including financial intermediation, and the


36For instance, the analysis of the open economy model in Section II did
not pursue the dynamics of foreign and domestic debt accumulation in
detail; the analysis of Section I did not pursue the dynamics of capital
accumulation.
                                                                         31




Patinkin emphasis on equilibrium non—neutralities. The 1985 paper

implicitly contests the views of the rational expectations-market

equilibrium school that anticipated changes in money have no real

effects and that the only significant fiscal variables are government

spending and the micro—structure of tax rates.37

        Two factors are responsible for the loss of mainstream self-

assurance. The first is empirical. Lucas and Sargent (1978) emphasize

the inconsistency of the 1970's inflation with 1960's vintage Phillips

curves. But the expectations—augmented Phillips curve was rapidly

assimilated into the mainstream and has stood up well from the early

1970s to the present. The deeper reason for unease is that significant

components of the mainstream model have had empirical difficulties, in

different ways. The demand function for money has shifted. The

investment function refuses to conform to neoclassical theory. The

consumption function shows more sensitivity than it should to current

income. There is no consolation in these difficulties for competing

schools in macroeconomics, for none has produced empirically superior

formulations.

        The second factor responsible for the loss of mainstream self-

assurance and lack of consensus within the profession is the theoretical

depth of the rational expectations—equilibrium attack. The models

analyzed in this paper are not fully based on maximization--the wage and

price setting assumptions in particular are ad hoc.38 Progress in


Modigllanl (1977) directly confronts those views.
  The use of "ad hoc" as a term of derision makes the point; ad hoc
could also be interpreted as fulfilment of the terms of Occam's Razor.
                                                                         32



repairing that weakness is being made by many of those cited in the

introduction. But until and unless a new model appears that both

satisfies the critical standards of the best theorists and is consistent

with the behavior of the macroeconomy, macroeconomics will continue to

be faced with a tradeoff between theoretical purity and relevance. That

will be the macroeconomist's burden for a long time.

        As a master macroeconomist, Franco Modigliani has shown the

ability to live creatively with that tension.
