Experimental Evidence on the Effectiveness of Non-Experts for Improving Vaccine Demand

NBER Working Paper No. 28593
March 2021, Revised June 2021
JEL No. I1,I12,I14

                                          ABSTRACT

We experimentally vary signals and senders to identify which combination will increase vaccine
demand among a disadvantaged population in the United States ≠ Black and White men without a
college education. Our main finding is that laypeople (non-expert concordant senders) are most
effective at promoting vaccination, particularly among those least willing to become vaccinated.
This finding points to a tradeoff between the higher qualifications of experts on the one hand, but
lower social proximity to lowsocio-economic status populations on the other hand, which may
undermine credibility in settings of low trust.

I       Introduction
Preventive health investments can yield considerable benefits for individ-
uals and society, yet are often adopted at low rates (see Newhouse 2020).
Immunization against infectious diseases is a leading example of a measure
that improves health and reduces employee absenteeism (CDC 2020; Nichol,
Mallon and Mendelman 2003).1 However, despite near universal recom-
mendation of the seasonal influenza vaccine for individuals over the age of
6 months in the United States and federally mandated zero cost-sharing un-
der the Affordable Care Act, take-up rates among adults average only 45%
(CMS 2010; CDC 2021a). Take-up rates are particularly low among certain
demographic groups, such as men, individuals without a four-year college
degree, and non-Hispanic Black Americans (see Panel A of Appendix Figure
A1; CDC 2018; Newhouse and Insurance Experiment Group 1993).
    Among the groups with the lowest vaccination rates, the reasons fre-
quently reported for not taking up flu vaccines relate to pessimistic beliefs on
the benefits or non-pecuniary costs of vaccinations, as opposed to financial
costs or lack of recommendation by a health professional.2 These findings
echo prior research on higher levels of medical mistrust among Black Amer-
icans as well as among individuals with less education (Blendon, Benson
and Hero 2014; Kinlock et al. 2017; Nanna et al. 2018; Hammond et al. 2010;
Idan et al. 2020). This mistrust likely has deep historical roots, including the
government-led experiment in Tuskegee, Alabama, as well as contempora-
neous racism in medicine (Alsan and Wanamaker 2018; Bajaj and Stanford
2021; Brandt 1978). The findings on beliefs also relate to growing scholar-
ship on misperceptions in the net benefits of preventive care (i.e. behav-
ioral hazard) leading to underutilization (Handel and Kolstad 2015; Bhar-
gava, Loewenstein and Benartzi 2017; Ericson and Sydnor 2017; Handel and

    1
      The seasonal influenza vaccine alone averts 3,500 to 12,000 deaths a year and reduces
work loss due to the illness by nearly one-fifth (CDC 2020).
    2
      See Appendix Figure A2, which explores reasons for not vaccinating among our sam-
ple. Note that vaccination take-up among Hispanic men is also relatively low, but this pop-
ulation was not included in this study.
Schwartzstein 2018; Chandra, Flack and Obermeyer 2021). There is scope,
then, to change individuals' views on vaccination through the provision of
credible and accurate information (Kamenica and Gentzkow 2011).
    In this study, we aim to evaluate the effectiveness of messaging inter-
ventions designed to shift knowledge, beliefs, and take-up behavior regard-
ing vaccines among low socio-economic status (SES) populations. We ran-
domly assigned respondents recruited online to one of four video messages
with information about flu vaccination. We then elicited beliefs and behav-
iors regarding flu vaccination as well as spillovers to COVID-19 vaccination,
including at a follow-up survey a few weeks later. Our sample consists of
2,893 White and Black men without a college education who had not re-
ceived their seasonal influenza vaccine at the time of recruitment.3
    Understanding the determinants of demand for preventive health care,
including vaccines, has been of great interest to researchers. Important ex-
perimental work has shown the effectiveness of celebrity messages (Alatas
et al. 2019), cues and nudges (Milkman et al. 2011) or increased accessibil-
ity (Brewer et al. 2017; Banerjee et al. 2010), particularly among those plan-
ning to be vaccinated. There is limited evidence, however, on how to per-
suade those who are not already intending to be immunized (in our sample,
nearly half of respondents report they are completely unwilling to receive
an influenza vaccine). Which messages will resonate under such circum-
stances? And could some well-intentioned messages backfire? The urgency
of answering such questions is underscored by the disproportionate impact
of COVID-19 on disadvantaged communities and the unequal vaccination
rates across racial and ethnic groups in the U.S.
    Our videos, which were narrated by ten separate senders, held informa-
tion about the safety and effectiveness of the influenza vaccine constant and
varied along three policy-relevant dimensions: (1) the perceived medical ex-
pertise of the sender ("expertise"), (2) the admission/omission of acknowl-

   3
    The education cutoff still represents a substantial fraction of US men (approximately
50% of Black men and 35% of Non-Hispanic White men in the US population (Health Day
News 2021)).

                                           2
edgement of past injustice committed by the medical community by discor-
dant senders ("acknowledgement"), and (3) the race of the sender ("con-
cordance"). We tailored the expertise and acknowledgement interventions
to Black respondents since Black men continue to comprise less than three
percent of the U.S. physician workforce, with their representation among ad-
mitted medical students stagnant since the late 1970s (Gallegos 2016; AAMC
2019). Understanding the potential of concordant community members to
substitute for medical experts, as well as the role of acknowledgement of past
injustice by discordant physicians may play in bridging trust gaps, holds rel-
evance amidst challenges in diversifying the physician workforce and persis-
tent racial health inequalities (Street et al. 2008; Williams and Rucker 2000).
    The layperson sender intervention was motivated by the ambiguous ef-
fects expertise may have on belief and behavior change. Medical doctors,
the relevant experts in our study, have specialized training and experience
and may therefore be considered more credible sources of health informa-
tion than peers, all else equal. They are, however, also more socially distant
from those who are disadvantaged, and such class cleavages could engen-
der skepticism (Gauchat 2012; Eichengreen, Aksoy and Saka 2021). Recent
research in economics has revisited the role of expertise: Sapienza and Zin-
gales (2013) find that providing ordinary Americans with information on
the consensus opinions of academic economists does not move their beliefs,
while DellaVigna and Pope (2018) document that non-experts perform sim-
ilar to experts in forecasting the rank of interventions. Representative sur-
veys on trust and credibility indicate that respondents find "a person like
yourself" as credible as academic experts and show a growing gap in insti-
tutional trust between individuals of high and low SES (Ries 2016). Exper-
imentally, the variation we induce is between senders wearing a white coat
and stethoscope (expert condition) versus the same senders wearing a white
short-sleeved shirt (layperson condition), narrating the same script.4 In a
separate survey conducted on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk), senders

   4
    In the remainder of the paper, we refer to senders in the expert condition as expert
senders while senders in the layperson condition as layperson senders.

                                           3
in layperson attire are rated by respondents as 1.7 standard deviation units
less educated than those in a laboratory coat (Appendix Table B1), indi-
cating that our experimental variation had the intended effect (i.e. a "first-
stage").
    The concordant expert arm was motivated by recent research showing
that treatment by a race-concordant physician in an in-person setting can
increase demand among Black Americans for preventive care as well as im-
prove health outcomes (Alsan, Garrick and Graziani 2019; Greenwood, Car-
nahan and Huang 2018; Greenwood et al. 2020; Hill, Jones and Woodworth
2020). Evidence is limited, however, on whether these effects exist in one-
way communication settings. In a pair of randomized evaluations of video
messages recorded by physicians regarding mask-wearing and social dis-
tancing during the COVID-19 pandemic, the first such messaging study found
small but robust sender concordance effects among Black respondents on
information-seeking behavior (Alsan et al. 2020). However, the second study,
by the same set of authors and using a more complicated design, failed to
detect such effects (Torres et al. 2021). This paper builds on and extends the
prior studies to include vaccination views and behavior.
    The acknowledgement arm, in which some White senders acknowledge
past breaches of trust committed by the medical community, could pro-
vide an alternative, scalable way to increase trust in medical recommenda-
tions amidst a largely non-Black physician workforce. While acknowledge-
ment of historical medical injustice can be expressed through a variety of ap-
proaches, we developed a short statement corresponding closely to the one
proposed for use by physicians in an Annals of Internal Medicine editorial on
responding to vaccination concerns (Opel, Lo and Peek 2021). The proposed
script from Annals reads "I understand why you have a lot of mistrust. The gov-
ernment and research systems have not always treated your community fairly," and
can be compared to our script found in Section II. Before distributing this
type of message at scale, however, it is imperative to test its effectiveness, as
unintended negative consequences are also conceivable.
    We establish three main results. First, when comparing layperson to ex-


                                       4
pert senders, we find that lay senders are rated by respondents as substan-
tially less qualified (0.54 standard deviation units) to give medical advice.
However, individuals in the non-expert condition exhibit greater recall of
factual signal content and increase their willingness to receive the COVID-
19 vaccine by 8.8 percentage points (20%). Furthermore, respondents as-
signed to lay senders were 15 percentage points (39%) more likely to report
that they or their household members had received the flu vaccine in the
weeks between the baseline and follow-up surveys. Indeed this is the only
treatment condition that affects this outcome.
    Second, we find concordance effects on sender and signal ratings are
present exclusively among Black respondents, with no such effects evident
among White respondents. We further find that acknowledgement of past
breaches of trust by a race-discordant expert sender increases ratings of the
signal by approximately the same magnitude as a race-concordant expert
sender providing the standard signal without acknowledgement (an increase
of 0.14 standard deviation units). Neither intervention, however, signifi-
cantly affects vaccine take-up as measured in the follow-up survey, although
coefficient estimates on intent to vaccinate against influenza and COVID-19
are weakly positive in both arms.
    Third, we find striking heterogeneity by treatment arm across respon-
dents with varying levels of vaccination reluctance. Viewing previous flu
vaccination experience as a proxy for distance from a take-up "threshold," we
divided the sample into never-takers, ever-takers, and recent-takers based
on the date of a respondent's last influenza vaccine. We find that both the
concordance and acknowledgement interventions demonstrated significant
effects on flu and COVID-19 vaccination intent among recent takers, those
who had received seasonal flu vaccines within the past two years (about a
quarter of the sample). In sharp contrast, the effectiveness of non-experts
was strongest among those who had never previously received a flu vaccine
(another quarter of the sample), with individuals in this group rating the
signal from a non-expert significantly higher than respondents who had pre-
viously taken up the flu vaccine and exhibiting substantial increases in flu


                                     5
and COVID-19 vaccination intent (by 47% and 49%, respectively).
    Taken together, these findings represent a step towards identifying effec-
tive ways to influence immunization views and behaviors. While messages
from concordant and empathetic experts may resonate most among individ-
uals familiar with vaccination, our study suggests that peer figures, such as
community health workers or citizen ambassadors, could play an important
role in communicating benefits and dispelling myths about vaccines among
those least inclined to receive one.


II       Experimental Design
We collected data in two flu seasons: 2019-2020 and 2020-2021. Respondents
were recruited via survey panels from Qualtrics, Lucid, CloudResearch, and
Facebook and participated in the experiment through an online survey on
Qualtrics. We timed the experiment so that it would fall into the middle of
the flu season (between December to February in 2019-2020 and between
late October to January in 2020-2021), so as to ensure recruitment of partici-
pants who would be unlikely to get the flu vaccine in the absence of our inter-
vention.5 Upon completing the consent process, participants answered a set
of questions to determine eligibility based on self-identified gender (male),
race (Black or White), age (25-51), education (no college), and flu vaccine
status (had not yet been vaccinated for influenza in the current season).6
Within each treatment condition, subjects were randomly assigned in equal
proportions to one of five recorded senders of the assigned race. The ran-
domization was stratified by season and recruitment platform.
    Eligible respondents continued to answer basic demographic questions,
reported their baseline attitudes and beliefs about the flu vaccine, and then
     5
      By the fourth week of October 2020, flu shot distribution was on par with the first
week of December 2019 (165 and 169 million doses, respectively), likely accelerated by the
pandemic (CDC 2021b).
    6
      We did not recruit participants aged older than 51 because a different vaccine than
the one covered by our flu shot coupon is advised for older individuals. We also excluded
those aged between 18 and 24 because we aimed to recruit individuals without a college
education, and they may still be in college.

                                            6
watched the video infomercial. After the infomercial, we gathered the main
survey-based outcome measures and distributed a coupon for a free flu shot.
We note that many places distribute free flu shots for indigent populations
and that many insurance providers cover flu shots. However, in the event
that cost was a barrier for a handful of individuals - the coupon removed it,
thus leaving only non-monetary barriers to vaccination. At least two weeks
later, participants were invited to complete a follow-up survey to measure
medium-term impacts of our video treatment and to measure respondents'
self-reported flu vaccination status. See Appendix Figure A3 for an overview
of the study design. Participants received a financial incentive for complet-
ing the baseline and follow-up survey (between $5 and $20), in the form of
an electronic gift card.
    In order to test whether the expertise of the sender, race concordance,
and acknowledgement statements influence the key outcomes of interest,
we aimed to produce videos that held all other factors precisely constant.
This required tight control over key features of the video, such as the light-
ing, script, intonation, speaking rate, and sender appearance (such as age,
height, facial hair, and clothes). Ensuring such consistency necessitated the
use of a professional recording studio, as well as the use of actors for the
recording of the videos.7
    We produced videos with a total of five Black and five White male actors
("senders"), recruited from the same casting agency. Each sender recorded
the video in four variations, representing the experimental variation in ex-
pertise (expert vs. non-expert layperson) and signal content (standard vs.
including an acknowledgement statement).8 All senders wore the exact same
   7
       In prior work (Alsan, Garrick and Graziani (2019); Alsan et al. (2020); Torres et al.
(2021)), our team used licensed medical doctors for messaging. However, given the fine
titration of all elements of the messaging and the need for the same person to play multiple
roles, we used actors in this instance. Note that the same person who delivered the message
as an expert recorded as a non-expert too, thus either experts would have had to have acted
as non-experts or vice-versa. We debriefed respondents about the use of non-expert actors
in the influenza infomercials as well as the tracking of coupons, per IRB guidance, at the
end of the follow-up survey.
     8
       Because of the low marginal cost of recording additional videos, we had each actor
record all four video variations; however, for power considerations and because pipeline

                                             7
clothes, provided by the research team. In the expert role, the senders wore
a button-down blue shirt, striped tie, laboratory coat and stethoscope. In the
layperson role, they wore a white short-sleeved shirt.
     The standard signal (video script S1) was 40 seconds long and read:9
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, recommends everyone
6 months and older get the flu shot. The shot protects you from getting sick by
cutting your chance of catching the flu in half. It's also very safe: less than 1 in 100
vaccinated people experiences a side effect such as fever or chills. The flu shot does
not contain an active flu virus, so you cannot get the flu virus from the shot. I get the
flu shot every year to protect myself, my family, and my community. I recommend
you look into getting vaccinated as soon as possible.10
     The script of acknowledgement signal (S2) was identical to the above,
except that three sentences were added acknowledging historical injustices
committed by the medical establishment. They were placed in between the
first and second sentence of script S1, and read: I know some people are nervous
to follow medical advice about vaccines. In the past, there may have been times when
the medical community broke your trust. But I hope that sharing some information
with you can help you understand how important the flu shot is.
     We aimed for the two groups of actors to have a similar distribution of
age and training in acting. We validated the former criterion via external
MTurk ratings of each actor (in each role) on age and also collected percep-
tions of attractiveness and educational attainment from the MTurk sample.
Columns (1) through (3) of Appendix Table B1 reveal that Black MTurkers
rate lay senders as less educated, less attractive, and younger than the same
set of senders wearing white coats. Such results support the notion that
the senders in casual attire were perceived as less advantaged than expert
senders.


issues for medical professionals are not as relevant for White respondents nor the shameful
history of medical exploitation, we only used the standard lay and standard expert videos
for Black actors, and the standard expert and acknowledgement expert videos for White
actors in the experiment.
    9
      See Appendix Section D for links to the videos we recorded.
   10
      In the layperson video, we replaced the word "cannot" with "can't" in the script.

                                            8
    There are no statistically significant differences in perceived age and ed-
ucation between concordant and discordant expert senders among Black
MTurk respondents (Appendix Table B1, columns (4) to (5)). Black re-
spondents do, however, rate Black expert senders as more attractive (column
(6)).
    Consistent with implicit bias, White MTurkers perceive Black expert senders
wearing a white coat as 0.53 standard deviations younger and 2.84 standard
deviations less educated than White senders in a white coat (columns (7)
to (8)). These differences are statistically significant. They should be kept
in mind when interpreting the (null) results among White respondents.
Appendix Figure A4 presents perceived within-sender education differences
(white coat vs. casual attire for Black vs. White senders). We observe that
the penalty for a Black male wearing casual attire is much greater than for
a White male, as they are perceived to be significantly less educated. These
findings connect to a broader literature about stereotypes and the profiling
of Black men in the U.S. (Hester and Gray 2018; Oliver 2003).


III    Outcome Variables
We group the outcome variables into eight families described below. Ap-
pendix Section E presents survey question text for each outcome variable.
For the first five families, we constructed one index that combines outcome
variables within each family, weighting by the inverse of the covariance be-
tween variables, as described in Anderson (2008). The index is our main
outcome of interest from each family. These outcomes follow our pre-analysis
plan.
   (1) Rating of sender: this outcome was comprised of responses to sur-
vey questions regarding whether the respondent was interested in further
medical advice from the given sender, trusted advice from the sender, and
the respondent's assessment of the sender's qualification to provide medical
advice.
   (2) Rating of signal: this outcome was comprised of responses to survey

                                     9
questions on recommending the video to friends and family, recommending
the flu shot to friends and family, and the respondent's assessment of the
extent to which the information contained in the video was useful.
    (3) Signal content recall: this outcome was comprised of responses to
survey questions on the age group for whom the flu vaccine is recommended
and whether the flu shot contains the flu virus (recall of information dis-
cussed in the video).
    (4) Safety beliefs: this outcome was comprised of the point belief and
certainty on the likelihood to contract the flu from the flu shot measured by
a Likert scale and balls and bins method. The outcomes in this family were
elicited twice, once before and once after the video message treatment.
    (5) Coupon interest and redemption: We elicited two revealed prefer-
ence measures of demand for a free flu shot coupon ≠ willingness to pay
(WTP) for the coupon and demand for information regarding locations to
redeem the coupon. As seen in Appendix Figure A2, only 3% of individuals
in our sample mention cost as a major barrier to vaccination take-up.
    Pharmacies reported to TotalWellness, Inc., the coupon vendor, whether
the coupon was used and shared this information with the study team. Be-
cause well below 1% of coupons were recorded as redeemed, we show re-
sults on redemption only in the appendix (Appendix Table B2). Low recorded
redemption rates stand in contrast to self-reported usage rates of 15.5% as
per our follow-up survey. The gap is likely due to pharmacists billing in-
surance instead of using coupons ≠ 75% of respondents with discrepancies
were insured. If we recode all inconsistencies as not having been vaccinated,
the conclusions reported herein are unchanged.
    (6) Flu vaccination intent: this refers to the respondent's likelihood to
receive the flu vaccine before the end of the flu season. This was elicited
on an 11-point Likert scale, once before and once after the video message
treatment, but we present the results on the posterior intent. We re-scaled
this outcome to have support 0 to 1.
    (7) COVID-19 vaccination intent: this refers to the respondent's likeli-
hood to take up the COVID-19 vaccine if made available free of charge. We


                                    10
re-scaled this outcome to have support 0 to 1.
    (8) Flu vaccine take-up: respondents reported in the follow-up survey
whether they or their family members had received the flu shot or redeemed
the coupon since the intervention.


IV     Descriptive Statistics, Balance and Attrition
Our main sample includes all respondents who fulfilled our eligibility cri-
teria (see Section II), passed our quality check, and completed the survey.
Attrition after randomization was low: among all respondents who arrive
at the video treatment stage of the survey, 89% completed the survey. Ap-
pendix Table B3 tests for imbalance in attrition by treatment status. The
only statistically significant differential attrition we detect is among White
respondents who were assigned to a Black sender: they exited the base-
line survey at a higher rate (2.3 percentage points, p-value 0.09), suggesting
those who remained were not as averse to discordant senders.
    Summary statistics are presented in Appendix Table B4. We recruited
approximately 400 Black respondents for each of the interventions (concor-
dant expert, concordant lay, discordant expert, discordant expert plus ac-
knowledgement) and approximately 600 White respondents for each of the
two interventions to which White respondents were assigned (concordant
expert, discordant expert). Respondents were on average 37 years old and
about 53% reported an annual household income below $30,000. Approx-
imately 27% of the sample had never received a flu vaccine, while 28% re-
ceived one in the past two years and the remainder more than two years ago.
Among the latter group, the majority (66%) received the flu vaccine more
than five years ago. Before viewing the infomercial, respondents report a
mean likelihood of receiving the flu vaccine of 2.57 on a 0-10 point scale.
    We detect differences across racial groups that reflect broader social in-
equality: Black respondents report lower incomes, rates of high school com-
pletion, and health insurance coverage rates, although they express slightly
higher average subjective health status. The relationship between COVID-

                                     11
19 vaccination intent and flu vaccination intent (as measured following the
video intervention) is strongly positive (correlation coefficient = 0.58, Ap-
pendix Figure A5), indicating there may be a generic aversion to immuniza-
tion.
    Observable characteristics and pre-intervention views are well-balanced
across treatment assignment in the baseline survey (Appendix Table B5).
As noted above, there was a lower response rate for the follow-up survey,
though we do not detect differential response rates across study conditions.
Characteristics are generally well-balanced across conditions in the follow-
up survey although a handful of exceptions are observed (see Appendix
Table B6).


V    Results

A   Main Treatment Effects
Results are organized corresponding to the four study arms (i.e. lay vs. ex-

nal among Black respondents, concordance vs. discordant expert senders
for Black respondents, and concordance vs. discordant expert senders for
White respondents). We report estimates with robust standard errors ob-
tained from a linear regression of the variables described in Section III on
treatment indicators. We include the stratifying variables of recruitment
season and survey platform (combining the Facebook and CloudResearch
platforms given their low recruitment numbers) in all regressions.
    We present our main results from the baseline survey in Table 1. The
columns correspond to the main outcome families: columns (1) to (5) are
normalized to mean zero and standard deviation one, while columns (6) to
(7) are the likelihood of flu and COVID-19 vaccination intent and column
(8) is a binary outcome of flu vaccine take-up.

     Notes: Table reports OLS estimates. Each dependent variable in columns (1) to (5) is an inverse-covariance-weighted index as de-
     scribed in Anderson (2008) and standardized to a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. Dependent variables in columns (6) to
     (7) are on a scale of 0 to 1. Dependent variable in column (8) is binary. COVID-19 vaccine Intent was asked during the 2020-2021
     flu season only. Outcome variables are described in Section III and in Appendix Section E. The p-value in Panel (B) tests the null
     hypothesis that the acknowledgement signal treatment and layperson treatment effects are equal. The p-value in Panel (D) tests the
     null hypothesis that the concordance treatment effects are the same across Black and White respondents. Stratifying variables (plat-
     form and season) are included but not reported; an additional stratifying variable (an indicator (=1) if the respondent is married) is
     included in the regression of the take-up outcome which measures vaccination of self and/or others in household. Robust standard
     errors are in parentheses. p-values are in brackets.
son condition provide less favorable ratings of the sender, by 0.54 standard
deviation units. The large negative effect on the rating of the sender lends
credence to respondents paying attention: the measure includes a rating of
the sender's qualification to give general medical advice. This finding also
accords with the perception that senders wearing a white short-sleeved shirt
are less educated and younger than those wearing a white coat (Appendix
Table B1 columns (1)-(3)). Despite their lower perceived expertise, how-
ever, respondents absorbed more information on the flu vaccine from lay
senders, as reflected by a sizable positive effect of the lay treatment on sig-
nal content recall (0.12 standard deviation units). This finding is consistent
with patients experiencing increased anxiety levels when interacting with a
doctor (which can sometimes raise blood pressure, a phenomenon in clini-
cal medicine dubbed "white coat hypertension"), which may in turn impair
the ability to retain information. The lower rating of lay sender qualifica-
tions, moreover, did not translate into significantly less favorable beliefs or
attitudes, such as on the perceived safety of the flu vaccine, interest in a flu
vaccine coupon, or stated interest in receiving the flu vaccine, compared to
individuals randomized to an expert sender.
    In addition, assignment to a non-expert sender significantly increased
intent to receive the COVID-19 vaccine by 8.8 percentage points relative to an
expert sender. A non-expert sender was the only condition to increase take-
up of the vaccine: respondents assigned to lay senders were 15 percentage
points more likely in our follow-up survey to report that they and/or another
household member received the flu vaccine in the weeks since the baseline
survey (a 39% increase). Demand bias is not a reasonable explanation for
these patterns since all arms were "treated" in the study and there would
need to be higher self-report bias among those viewing a signal from a non-
expert versus a health authority figure, which seems very unlikely.
    Panel B of Table 1 reports the main effect of the acknowledgement sig-
nal intervention among Black respondents. Recall this signal was only pro-
vided by White expert senders. On average, Black respondents assigned to
the acknowledgement statement condition rate the statement 0.14 standard


                                      14
deviation units higher than the default statement conveyed by the same set
of senders. They are also 5.4 percentage points more likely to intend to take
up the COVID-19 vaccine. We do not detect statistically significant effects of
the acknowledgement statement on flu vaccine take-up.
    For Black respondents (Panel C), race concordance has a positive, size-
able effect on the respondent's ratings of the sender (0.18 standard deviation
units), and on the rating of the signal itself (0.14 standard deviation units).
By contrast, we do not detect concordance effects on sender or signal ratings
among White respondents (Panel D).
    Among both Black and White respondents, we find no meaningful effects
of concordance on signal content recall or safety beliefs. Concordance is as-
sociated with weak positive effects on flu and COVID-19 vaccination intent
for Black respondents, but these are not statistically significant.11 As men-
tioned in Section IV, White respondents assigned a discordant sender attr-
ited at higher rates, which we view as a relevant outcome. It does, however,
suggest that estimates reported in Panel D are biased towards the (reported)
null effect of concordance.12
    Figure 1 displays means of sender ratings, flu and COVID-19 vaccination
intent, and flu vaccine take-up, as well as 95% confidence bands by treat-
ment condition. Across all outcomes except sender ratings, the layperson
treatment condition performs the best among Black respondents (dark blue
bars), whereas discordant expert senders fare poorly among Black individu-
als. White respondent averages (light blue bars) across concordant and dis-
   11
       There may be a concern that Black and White senders may differ along other charac-
teristics besides race (e.g. Heckman 1998 and Pager 2007). We designed this experiment to
minimize such concerns, by holding key other dimensions (e.g. sex, age, clothing, setting
and script) constant. We also demonstrate that the effect of any given Black sender on most
of the outcomes is indistinguishable from other Black senders in the concordance arm (see
Appendix Table B8 for the rating outcomes). For one outcome (COVID-19 vaccine intent)
we do reject the null; however, there are no concordance effects detected for this outcome
(see column (7) of Table 1 Panel C). Similarly, we do not detect heterogeneity in the layper-
son treatment effect by sender (Appendix Table B7).

Estimates with Lee (2009) bounds, available on request, also fail to find an effect.

     Notes: Figure shows the mean of each outcome by treatment condition among the sample of Black respondents (dark blue bars), as well as among the sample of White
     respondents (light blue bars). Outcomes are ratings of the sender (Panel (A)), flu vaccine intent (Panel (B)), COVID-19 vaccine intent (Panel (C)), and flu vaccine
     take-up (Panel (D)). Sender rating is an inverse-covariance-weighted index as described in Anderson (2008). For dark blue bars, p-values test the null hypotheses
     that the concordant expert, concordant non-expert (standard signal condition), and discordant expert (acknowledgement condition) means each differ from the
     discordant expert (standard signal condition) among Black respondents. For light blue bars, p-values test the null hypothesis that the concordant expert (standard
     signal condition) mean differs from the discordant expert (standard signal condition) among White respondents. 95% confidence intervals using robust standard
     errors are shown.

                               Figure 1: Treatment Effects on Sender Ratings, Vaccine Intent and Take-up
cordant treatment conditions do not meaningfully differ. Soberingly, flu vac-
cine take-up and COVID-19 vaccination intent are significantly lower among
Black respondents paired with a discordant expert sender than among White
respondents paired with a concordant expert sender. As 85% of White pa-
tients in the U.S. have a concordant physician yet nearly 75% of Black patients
do not, such a comparison mirrors the experience of many Black Americans
in the U.S. healthcare system (Blewett et al. 2018). We find, however, that
layperson senders shift Black respondents to levels of vaccination intent and
take-up comparable to White respondents.
    An assessment of the overall effect of any one signal on outcomes, rel-
ative to no signal at all, is of interest in itself as well. However, since the
focus of this study is on testing the differential effectiveness of signal frames
aimed at bridging trust gaps relative to a standard signal from a typical ex-
pert sender, we did not include a no-signal control group. Therefore, we
cannot assess the impact of any one signal relative to a no-signal counter-
factual directly, but differences between posterior and prior flu vaccination
intent do provide some suggestive evidence (Appendix Figure A8). Reas-
suringly, we observe an increase or no change in flu vaccine intent among
the vast majority (approximately 90%) of respondents.


B        Heterogeneity
Responses to messaging may depend upon past experience with medical ex-
perts and vaccination. Those who elected to receive an influenza vaccine at
some point in their lifetime may be less opposed to vaccines than those who
never evinced a willingness to do so, all else equal.13 We divided the sample
into never-takers, ever-takers and recent-takers of the flu vaccine based on
whether the respondent reported never receiving a flu vaccine, receiving a
flu vaccine over two years ago (with the majority of these individuals receiv-

    13
     Indeed, we find that 69% of never-takers state prior to the video treatment that they
are "not at all likely" to receive the flu vaccine in the current season, compared to 54% of
ever-takers and 20% of recent-takers. Appendix Figure A9 provides a histogram of prior
flu vaccine intent by respondent vaccination experience.

Notes: Table reports OLS estimates. Each dependent variable in columns (1) to (5) is an inverse-covariance-
weighted index as described in Anderson (2008) and standardized to a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1.
Dependent variables in columns (6) to (7) are on a scale of 0 to 1. Dependent variable in column (8) is binary.
COVID-19 vaccine Intent was asked during the 2020-2021 flu season only. Outcome variables are described in Sec-
tion III and in Appendix Section E. Never Taker is a binary variable equal to 1 if the respondent has never received
the flu shot. Ever Taker is a binary variable equal to 1 if the respondent received the flu shot more than 2 years ago.
Recent Taker is a binary variable equal to 1 if the respondent received the flu shot within the past 2 years, not in-
cluding the current season. The p-value: Never Taker=Recent Taker tests the null hypothesis that [treatment] ◊ Never
Taker = [treatment] ◊ Recent Taker. Stratifying variables (platform and season) are included but not reported; an
additional stratifying variable (an indicator (=1) if the respondent is married) is included in the regression of the
take-up outcome. Robust standard errors are in parentheses. p-values are in brackets.

ing their last vaccine over five years ago), or receiving a flu vaccine recently
(within the past two years exclusive of the current season).
    We fully interact our treatment effects with never, ever and recent-taker
indicator variables and report the results for each study arm in Table 2. We
also test the null hypothesis that treatment effects for never- and recent-
takers are equal. In column (1) of Panel A, non-experts are consistently
judged as unqualified to provide medical advice and this does not vary by
prior flu vaccination experience. However, the rating of the signal deliv-
ered by non-expert senders is positive and statistically significant among the
never-takers, a result strikingly different from the perception among recent-
takers (column (2)).14 Moreover, the effect of non-expert senders on both
influenza and COVID-19 vaccine intent is large, significant, and positive for
never-takers, and in the former case statistically different from recent-takers.
The positive effect of layperson senders on vaccine take-up is similar among
all groups.
    The positive effect of the acknowledgement intervention on signal rat-
ings is driven by those who have ever received a vaccine, with the coefficient
estimate among recent-takers large but imprecise (column (2) of Panel B).
The acknowledgement signal increases flu and COVID-19 vaccination intent
substantially among recent-takers of the flu vaccine, while effects on intent
among never-takers are muted and significantly different from respondents
with recent immunization experience. The effect of the acknowledgement
condition is negative for the outcome of flu vaccine take-up for recent tak-
ers, which suggests a potential concern with this approach among some in-
dividuals.
    Panel C demonstrates that among Black respondents, concordance ef-
fects on signal ratings and flu vaccination intent are positive and statistically
significant only among those that have recently taken up the vaccine. There
is no such heterogeneity among White respondents in Panel D.

VI      Conclusion
Low demand for high-value preventive care is of interest to policymakers
and a puzzle for researchers. In this paper, we examine the effect of vari-
ous sender and signal combinations on vaccination outcomes in a sample of
low SES men. Although race-concordant expert senders and race-discordant
expert senders acknowledging past medical injustice earned higher ratings
from Black individuals, we find that signals on vaccination delivered by a
race-concordant layperson led to the greatest increases in health knowledge
recall, intent to be vaccinated against influenza and COVID-19, and take-
up of the flu vaccine. The effects of non-expert senders were concentrated
among respondents with no prior experience with flu vaccination, a group
that may be particularly difficult to persuade, whereas experts move vacci-
nation intent most among those immunized in recent years.
    These results are important in understanding how best to improve vac-
cination take-up rates and reduce health inequality. The effectiveness of
non-expert senders relates to work by Larson (2020), who notes that indi-
viduals reluctant to vaccinate may be more moved by "heard truths" from
proximate community members than elite experts. An alternative explana-
tion is that medical doctors discussing the benefits of vaccination are viewed
as agents not solely of the individual patient, but also of broader social in-
terests or private interests such as insurers or pharmaceutical companies.15
Through such a lens, professionals, though qualified, may also appear con-
flicted, whereas laypersons do not. More broadly, our results suggest a role
for communicating information on preventive care through senders diverse
both in racial background as well as level of expertise.

ple to buy their nonsense." We thank Keith Ericson for the interpretation of doctors as agents
acting on behalf of potentially multiple principals.

       Panel (A): By Sex, Race, Education and Household Income                               Panel (B): Intersectionality of race, sex and education

      Notes: Figure is based on data from the 2017 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2018). Panel (A) reports
      means by sex, race, education level, and household income. Panel (B) reports the intersectionality of race, sex and education. Observations are weighted using survey
      sample weights. 95% confidence intervals are shown.

                                                Appendix Figure A1: Seasonal Flu Vaccination Rates
Notes: Figure is based on the follow-up survey sample, restricting to the respondents who indicated that they had
not received a flu vaccine since the baseline survey (N=499). Respondents were asked the following question:
"You said that you did not get the flu shot. Why is that? Please see list below and check all reasons that apply." The question
on and list of reasons for not wanting an influenza vaccination were adopted from a 2010 RAND survey (Harris,
Maurer and Uscher-Pines 2010).

      Notes: Figure displays the mean of MTurkers' ratings of sender education by race and role of senders based on a sample of 381 Mturkers. Each sender was rated on
      their level of education on a scale of 1 (lowest; less than high school education) to 6 (highest; a graduate degree), in both a layperson and expert role. The red lines
      represent the mean education rating in an expert role for all Black senders (Panel (A)) and White senders (Panel (B)). The orange lines represent the mean education
      rating in a layperson role for all Black senders (Panel (A)) and White senders (Panel (B)).

                 Panel (A): Black Respondents                           Panel (B): White Respondents
Notes: Figure shows the relationship between Flu Vaccine Intent (on a scale of 0 to 1) and COVID-19 Vaccine
Intent (on a scale of 0 to 1). The size of dots represents the number of respondents in each bin of Flu Vaccine
Intent. The figure is based on the sample of respondents from the 2020-2021 flu season, as the question about
COVID-19 Vaccine Intent was not asked during the 2019-2020 flu season.

      Notes: Figure shows treatment effects on each individual outcome that enters a primary outcome, for each treatment comparison (A: layperson vs. expert sender; B:
      acknowledgement vs. standard message; C and D: concordant vs. discordant sender). Outcomes are described in Section III and in Appendix Section E. Outcomes are
      standardized except take-up and intent which are presented as in the main text. Dots represent coefficient estimates obtained from OLS regressions of each outcome of
      interest on the treatment indicator variable. Stratifying variables (platform and season) are included but not reported; an additional stratifying variable (an indicator
      (=1) if the respondent is married) is included in the regression of the take-up outcome. 95% confidence intervals using robust standard errors are shown.

      B: acknowledgement vs. standard message; C and D: concordant vs. discordant sender). Outcomes are standardized except the flu vaccine coupon redemption and
      take-up outcome. Dots represent coefficient estimates obtained from OLS regressions of each outcome of interest on the treatment indicator variable. Stratifying
      variables (platform and season) are included but not reported; an additional stratifying variable (an indicator (=1) if the respondent is married) is included in the

      Notes: Panel (A) shows a histogram of prior and posterior flu vaccine intent. Panel (B) plots the histogram of the individual-level difference. See Appendix Section
      E for definitions.

                                           Appendix Figure A8: Prior and Posterior Flu Vaccine Intent
Notes: Figure shows the distribution of the variable Prior Intent for Flu Vaccine among never-takers, ever-takers and
recent-takers of the flu vaccine. Never-takers of the flu vaccine are defined as respondents who reported having
never received the flu vaccine. The ever-taker category encompasses respondents who reported having received
their last flu vaccination over two years ago. Recent-takers include respondents who reported having received
their last flu vaccination within the past two years but not in the current influenza season.

       Notes: Figure reports heterogeneity in treatment effects for each treatment comparison (A: layperson vs. expert sender; B: acknowledgement vs. standard message; C
       and D: concordant vs. discordant sender). Estimates are obtained from a regression of the variable Flu Vaccine Intent on the treatment indicator, moderator, and their
       interaction. Both the outcome and the moderator are standardized to a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. Dots represent coefficient estimates on the interaction
       coefficient. Stratifying variables (platform and season) are included but not reported. Moderators (before standardization) are defined as: Low Income = 1 if the
       respondent's self-reported household income is less than or equal to the median income among Black respondents in the sample (=$30k); Pharmacy Distance =
       distance to nearest pharmacy in miles; Flushot Cost Belief = belief about own out-of-pocket cost for the flu shot in USD; Flushot Safety Belief = prior belief of fraction
       of individuals who get the flu from the flu shot; Insured with PCP = dummy for having a primary care provider and health insurance; Age Proximity = dummy
       equal to one if sender and receiver age difference is no more than ten years; Southern State = dummy for residence in the U.S. South; Married = dummy for being
       married; and Response Time = log of time in seconds that the respondent spent on the survey up to (but excluding) the video treatment screen. 95% confidence
       intervals using robust standard errors are shown.

Notes: Table reports OLS estimates based on the MTurk sample. Dependent variables are perceptions of age,
education and attractiveness. The outcomes are described in Appendix Section E and standardized to a mean of 0
and a standard deviation of 1. Columns (1) to (6) include ratings from Black Mturk respondents only. Columns
(1) to (3) include sender fixed effects, thus comparing MTurkers' ratings of the same sender, assuming a different
identity (lay vs. expert). Columns (4) to (9) compare MTurkers' ratings of Black vs. White experts. Columns (7)
to (9) include ratings from white Mturk respondents only. The mean of each dependent variable for the omitted
group is shown. Robust standard errors are in parentheses, and p-values are in brackets.

full sample (columns (3) to (5)). Columns (4) and (5) assume non-responders to the follow-up survey did not
receive the vaccine. All outcome variables are binary and described in Section III and in Appendix Section E. The
p-value in Panel (B) tests the null hypothesis that acknowledgement signal treatment and layperson treatment
effects are the same. The p-value in Panel (D) tests the null hypothesis that the concordance treatment effects are
the same across Black and White respondents. Stratifying variables (platform and season) and an indicator (=1)
if the respondent is married are included but not reported. Robust standard errors are in parentheses. p-values

Notes: Table reports OLS estimates on the baseline sample. The dependent variable is at-
trition from the baseline survey, which is an indicator variable equal to 1 if the respondent
was randomized but did not complete the baseline survey and 0 otherwise. Column (1)
corresponds to the sample of Black respondents. Column (2) corresponds to the sample of
White respondents. The reported p-value at the bottom of the table tests the null hypothe-
sis that the effect of all four treatments on attrition, among Black respondents, is the same.
Stratifying variables (platform and season) are included but not reported. Robust standard
errors are in parentheses. p-values are in brackets.

Notes: Columns (2)-(4) show the mean, standard deviation, and sample size for all respondents. Columns (5)-(7)
restrict the sample to Black respondents, and columns (8)-(10) restrict the sample to White respondents. Low
Income is a binary variable equal to 1 if the respondent's self-reported household income is less than or equal
to the median income of Black respondents in the sample (=$30k). Subjective Health Status is measured on a 5-
point Likert scale (where 1 is poor and 5 is excellent). Subjective Flu Shot Cost is in US$; the values above the 99th
percentile are set to the 99th percentile value. Never Taker is a binary variable equal to 1 if the respondent has never
received the flu shot. Ever Taker is a binary variable equal to 1 if the respondent has received the flu shot more
than 2 years ago. Recent Taker is a binary variable equal to 1 if the respondent has received the flu shot within the
past 2 years. Flu Vaccine Intent is the respondent's prior intent to receive the flu vaccine before the end of the flu
season elicited on an 11-point Likert scale. Likelihood of Contracting Flu is the respondent's subjective likelihood
of contracting flu before the end of the flu season elicited on an 11-point Likert scale. Belief about Safety of Flu
Vaccine is belief over how many individuals out of 100 will not contract the flu from the flu shot. (C) indicates
that the variable is continuous; (B) indicates that the variable is binary. In cases when the variable is not binary
or continuous, the scale of the raw variable is provided.

Notes: Table reports estimates obtained from OLS regressions of each respondent characteristic (rows) on treat-
ment variables by study arm. Columns (1) to (3) test the effects of the concordant non-expert (vs. concordant
expert) treatment with the standard signal, among the sample of Black respondents. Columns (4) to (6) test the
effects of the acknowledgement (vs. standard) signal treatment with discordant, expert senders, among the sam-
ple of Black respondents. Columns (7) to (9) test the effects of the concordant (vs. discordant) expert treatment
with the standard signal, among the sample of Black respondents. Columns (10) to (12) test the effects of con-
cordant (vs. discordant) expert treatment with the standard signal, among the sample of White respondents. See
table notes of Appendix Table B4 for the definitions of each respondent characteristic. Total respondents com-
pleting the follow-up survey by experimental condition are as follows: 72 for concordant-Black respondents; 67
for discordant-Black respondents; 184 for concordant-White respondents; 193 for discordant-White respondents;
70 for acknowledgement signal treatment; 67 for standard signal treatment; 79 for non-expert treatment; and 72
for expert treatment. Stratifying variables (platform and season) are included but not reported. The reported
F-statistics in Column (13) test the null hypothesis that the effects of all four treatments (i.e. concordant expert,
discordant expert (standard signal), concordant non-expert, and discordant expert (acknowledgement signal) are
the same, among the sample of Black respondents. Robust standard errors are in parentheses. p-values are shown
in brackets.                                          A.16

Notes: Table reports estimates obtained from OLS regressions of each respondent characteristic (rows) on treat-
ment variables by hypothesis based on the follow-up survey sample. Columns (1) to (3) test the effects of the
concordant non-expert (vs. concordant expert) treatment with the standard signal, among the sample of Black
respondents. Columns (4) to (6) test the effects of the acknowledgement (vs. standard) signal treatment with
discordant, expert senders, among the sample of Black respondents. Columns (7) to (9) test the effects of the
concordant (vs. discordant) expert treatment with the standard signal, among the sample of Black respondents.
Columns (10) to (12) test the effects of concordant (vs. discordant) expert treatment with the standard signal,
among the sample of White respondents. See table notes of Appendix Table B4 for the definitions of each re-
spondent characteristic. Stratifying variables (platform and season) are included but not reported. The reported
F-statistics in Column (13) test the null hypothesis that the effects of all four treatments (i.e. concordant expert,
discordant expert (standard signal), concordant non-expert, and discordant expert (acknowledgement signal) are
the same, among the sample of Black respondents. Robust standard errors are in parentheses. p-values are shown
in brackets.

Notes: Table reports OLS estimates among the sample of Black respondents who were assigned to either a layperson
or expert Black sender, from a regression of each primary outcome on sender fixed effects, a layperson treatment
indicator, and their interaction. Each dependent variable in columns (1) to (5) is an inverse-covariance-weighted
index as described in Anderson (2008) and standardized to the mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. Dependent
variables in columns (6) to (7) are on a scale of 0 to 1. Dependent variable in column (8) is binary. COVID-19
vaccine Intent was asked during the 2020-2021 flu season only. Outcome variables are described in Section III and
in Appendix Section E. The p-value tests the null hypothesis that all interaction terms are the same. The omit-
ted sender is Sender 2. Stratifying variables (platform and season) are included but not reported; an additional
stratifying variable (an indicator (=1) if the respondent is married) is included in the regression of the take-up
outcome. Robust standard errors are in parentheses. p-values are shown in brackets.

Notes: Table reports OLS estimates among the sample of Black respondents, from a regression of each primary
outcome on sender fixed effects. Each dependent variable in columns (1) to (5) is an inverse-covariance-weighted
index as described in Anderson (2008) and standardized to the mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. Dependent
variables in columns (6) to (7) are on a scale of 0 to 1. Dependent variable in column (8) is binary. COVID-19
vaccine Intent was asked during the 2020-2021 flu season only. Outcome variables are described in Section III and
in Appendix Section E. "(B)" indicates Black senders, while "(W)" indicates White senders. The p-value labeled
"White Senders" tests the null hypothesis that the effect of all White senders is the same. The p-value labeled "Black
Senders" tests the null hypothesis that the effect of all Black senders is the same. The omitted category is Sender 1
(W). Stratifying variables (platform and season) are included but not reported; an additional stratifying variable
(an indicator (=1) if the respondent is married) is included in the regression of the take-up outcome. Robust
standard errors are in parentheses. p-values are shown in brackets.
