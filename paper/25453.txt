Infringing Use as a Path to Legal Consumption: Evidence from a Field Experiment

                                           ABSTRACT

Copyright infringement may result from frictions preventing legal consumption, but may also
reveal demand. Motivated by this fact, we run a field experiment in which we contact firms that
are caught infringing on expensive digital images. Emails to all firms include a link to the
licensing page of the infringed image; for treated firms, we add links to a significantly cheaper
licensing site. Making infringers aware of the cheaper option leads to a fourteen-fold increase in
the ex-post licensing rate. Two additional experimental interventions are designed to reduce
search costs for (i) price and (ii) product information. Both interventions-immediate price
comparison and recommendation of images similar to those infringed-have large positive effects.
Our results highlight the importance of mitigating user costs in small-value transactions.

1     Introduction

Search engines and social media have made it easy for users to search for digital content or to

encounter it serendipitously, and consumers’ use of this content may be informative about their

unobserved preferences for specific products. When legal options for purchasing content are dif-

ficult to access, or when licensing obligations are not sufficiently clear, consumers may—possibly

unwittingly—violate copyright law. When this happens, infringement may provide demand discov-

ery and, hence, serve as a marketing opportunity. Indeed, it may be less costly to monitor online

infringement than to identify potential customers ex-ante through other means.

    These observations suggest the possibility of approaching infringing users to (i) clarify their

legal obligations; (ii) increase their awareness of more-suitable purchasing options; and (iii) mit-

igate their search and transactions costs (e.g., by recommending replacement products based on

information revealed by their infringing use). Our paper explores the feasibility of an ‘ex-post li-

censing’ approach by private parties.1 Naturally, from a copyright holder’s perspective, the value of

this approach depends on a number of factors, including the characteristics of the infringing users

and the infringement, the costs of identifying infringement relative to that of predicting demand

ex-ante, and the ability to motivate users to pay ex-post.2,3 In a frictionless world, infringing users

are typically thought of as price-sensitive users who would not purchase content legally. However,

if frictions are sufficient to prevent legal consumption, it is possible that reducing these frictions

may result in legal purchases.

    Our empirical context is the stock-photography (pre-shot images) industry.4 On behalf of

photographers, stock-photo agencies license images to business customers. The industry is divided
   1
     The idea that transactions costs are mitigated by allowing follow-on products to be created without obtaining
permission from right holders is a key argument for establishing an alternative copyright regime (Lessig (2008);
Gans (2015); Menell (2016)). Gans (2015) provides the first theoretical framework on the impacts of different
remix—broadly defined as derivative works created by combining or editing existing materials—rights regimes on
the incentives to create not just follow-on, but also original, content. Menell (2016) makes a legal case for a remix
compulsory licensing regime.
   2
     The approach we analyze is qualitatively different from strategies that aim to maximize enforcement revenues by
exploiting a legal threat. See Scott Morton and Shapiro (2014) for enforcement strategies and the notion of reasonable
royalties for patents.
   3
     Digimarc and Thomson Reuters provide infringement-detection services for movies, music, software, and publish-
ing. YouTube automates the detection of infringement and takes actions according to copyright owners’ pre-specified
choices, including sharing ad revenue from uploaded videos.
   4
     According to one estimate, the global revenue of this industry was $2.88B in 2011. In comparison, the royalties
collected by the two largest public performance rights organizations in the music industry, ASCAP and BMI, were
$1B each in 2012.



                                                          2
into premium and micro-stock segments. The premium segment targets usage occasions such as

advertising campaigns. The price is typically in the hundreds of dollars, and a license often restricts

use to a pre-specified scope, including duration. For small and medium-sized firms that want to

display images on their websites, the micro-stock segment tends to be the suitable option because

of its low price (tens of dollars or less) and lack of usage restrictions.

   The data used in this paper are generated from a new field experiment conducted by one of the

leading stock-image agencies (the ‘Agency’), which offers products in both the premium and micro-

stock segments through separate websites. The Agency monitored unauthorized use of a small set

of its most expensive premium images on commercial websites. In related work using evidence from

different experiments, Luo and Mortimer (2017) show that many infringement incidences appear

to be ‘uninformed,’ in the sense that users lack awareness of their licensing obligations or options,

or because third parties (e.g., web designers) infringed on their behalf.

   The new experiment focused on infringement cases involving small firms, which make up about

20 percent of all detected cases. The goal was to encourage infringing users to purchase a legitimate

image license by, first, increasing their awareness of the significantly cheaper micro-stock website

(also owned by the Agency) and, second, lowering search costs for relevant product and price

information. Specifically, emails to all the treatment groups offered a micro-stock licensing option

in addition to the option of licensing the infringed premium image. In contrast, emails to the control

groups included only the premium licensing option. We further varied the treatment conditions

by (a) whether or not to recommend four images from the micro-stock site that are similar to

the infringed premium image; and (b) whether or not to include the price range of the premium

infringed image, thus making the price comparison between the two options immediately clear.

(The micro-stock price is available in the emails to all treatment groups.)

   We find that awareness of the micro-stock option leads to a fourteen-fold increase in the prob-

ability of licensing an image. The treatment groups’ average licensing rate, 2.63 percent of opened

emails, consists almost entirely of licenses of the micro-stock option, and is several times higher

than the most effective email marketing campaigns conducted by the Agency for micro-stock im-

ages. This result is consistent with the idea that infringing use is informative of demand. In the

treatment groups, both additional interventions have a large, positive average effect: image recom-

mendation increases the probability of licensing a micro-stock image by 45 percent, and the price

                                                    3
comparison increases the micro-stock licensing rate by 31 percent.

        Data on whether users click onto either of the licensing sites suggest that both interventions are

effective in reducing users’ costs of finding a replacement image. Furthermore, the evidence suggests

that image recommendation induces marginal users (i.e., those with a relatively low willingness to

pay) to start a search instead of choosing the outside option; whereas providing premium price

information may direct infra-marginal users (i.e., those with a relatively high willingness to pay)

away from the unsuitable premium option faster.

        Our results contribute to the literature on information provision and search costs, in particular

in the context of electronic marketplaces. Both interventions appear to facilitate matching between

users and their preferred products, consistent with studies on the effect of information provision on

the quality of matching (Anand and Shachar (2011); Tadelis and Zettelmeyer (2015)) and the effects

of reducing search costs on peer-to-peer platforms. See Fradkin (2017) and Horton (forthcoming)

on providing better-updated information about the availability of homes on Airbnb or of workers

on oDesk.

        Our paper also relates to the sampling effect investigated by the piracy literature, as piracy

may encourage users to experiment and discover (and, hence, reveal) their preference for specific

products (Peitz and Waelbroeck (2006); Gans (2012); Zhang (2016)).5 Indeed, a novel aspect of

our experimental design is its use of such information to exogenously reduce user search costs.

Our paper also joins a small but growing literature that studies proactive supplier responses that

improve the availability and attractiveness of legal options (Danaher et al. (2010); Mortimer et al.

(2012); Aguiar and Waldfogel (2018); de Matos et al. (forthcoming)).



2        Experimental Design

Table 1 summarizes our experimental design: there are two control and four treatment groups.

Emails to the two control groups (the first row in table 1) include only a link that directs the user

to the licensing page of the infringed premium image currently displayed on the firm’s website.

Emails to all the treatment groups add an affordable micro-stock licensing option (indicated by

“Micro” in the second and the last rows), in addition to the premium option.
    5
    On whether piracy displaces or complements sales, prior studies generally find that piracy hurts sales. Waldfogel
(2012) provides a survey.


                                                         4
        We further vary the treatment conditions in two dimensions. First, emails to two treatment

groups (second row) contain a link to the home page of the micro-stock site. In contrast, emails

to the other two treatment groups (the last row, indicated by “Rec”) recommend, based on the

Agency’s proprietary algorithm, four images from the micro-stock site that are similar to the

infringed premium image. The emails contain a thumbnail and a link to the licensing page for

each of the four recommended images. Second, emails to two treatment groups and one control

group (indicated by “Price” in the second column) add the following premium price information:

“Licensing costs for online use of Rights Managed images typically range from $545 to $1140 for

a 3-month period.” The price information on a micro-stock image (“as low as $12 per image”) is

presented in the same way in the emails to all four treatment groups.

        Cases included in the experiment involve small businesses whose infringement was identified

within the preceding two years. Cases were allocated across groups using a random-number gener-

ator. We intentionally allocated more cases to the two treatment groups for which similar images

were recommended, as, ex-ante, the Agency deemed this to be the most constructive approach. We

sent 24,090 emails in four batches between November 15 and December 04, 2017.6

        To generate the analysis sample, we removed cases for which (1) the email was bounced back due

to an invalid address (13 percent); and (2) the email was not opened in the first 14 days (65 percent

of the valid emails).7 We focus on outcomes in the first 14 days to avoid the confounding effect

that worse-performing groups in the initial two weeks received more intense follow-up.8 Our data

show that about 65 percent of licensing takes place within the first three days, and 79 percent takes

place within the first 14 days. The final analysis sample includes 7,407 cases; appendix table A4

shows that the groups are well-balanced with respect to basic case characteristics.


3        Results

3.1       Effects of awareness of the micro-stock licensing option

The average 14-day licensing probability (including both the premium and micro-stock options) for

all treatment groups is fourteen times that for the two control groups (2.63 versus 0.17 percent for

    Cases that had not yet licensed received follow-up emails after 14 days.

opened emails, and p-value < 0.001). Almost all of the licenses in the treatment groups are of the

micro-stock option (only four licenses are of the premium option),9 indicating that the premium

option is too expensive for most firms in our sample, and that awareness of an affordable option

can significantly increase the licensing rate. Consistent with the idea that infringing use may be

informative of demand, the average licensing rate by the four treatment groups is several times

higher than the Agency’s most effective email marketing campaigns for micro-stock images.10

       Moreover, within the two control groups, we find that users not given the premium price infor-

mation are more than four times likely to click the email links to the premium site than users given

this information (0.190 vs. 0.045, p-value < 0.001; reported in table 4), suggesting that users’ prior

beliefs about the premium price are substantially lower than the actual price.

       Given that licensing of the premium option is extremely rare, the rest of our analysis focuses

on licensing of micro-stock images by the four treatment groups. We look at each intervention

separately, pooling observations from both treatment groups for the other intervention. We discuss

detailed break-outs as necessary.


3.2      Effects of the two interventions on licensing the micro-stock option

Column 1 of table 2a shows that recommending images increases the likelihood of licensing by 45

percent, from 0.020 to 0.029 (p-value 0.058). Column 2 shows that the average revenue per case

increases by 60 percent, from 0.366 to 0.586 (p-value 0.054). The increase in average revenue is

driven solely by a higher probability of licensing, rather than by a change in revenue conditional

on licensing, as the average revenue per license is about $20 across groups (column 3).

       Table 2b shows that providing premium price information increases the licensing rate by 31

percent, from 0.022 to 0.029 (p-value 0.108), and revenue per case by 45 percent, from 0.422 to

0.611 (p-value 0.075). Similar to image recommendation, the increase in average revenue is driven

solely by a higher probability of licensing.11
   9
     There are three licenses in the two control groups, making the total number of premium licenses seven.
  10
     For confidentiality, detailed statistics about the Agency’s marketing campaigns are not disclosed. It is plausible
that the relatively high licensing rate in our experiment is driven partly by an implicit threat, even though the emails
are non-threatening by design. Apart from the follow-up emails, there are no consequences of continued infringement.
  11
     Regression results (appendix tables A6 and A7) are consistent with the raw-data comparisons.

3.3    Search and potential mechanisms

The above results show that both interventions have an economically large effect on licensing

outcomes. We can also analyze whether a user conducts a search, using data on whether the user

clicks the email links to either of the two licensing sites. Before presenting the results, we describe

a conceptual model of user search choices that might help us interpret the data.

    Consider a user in group “Micro” who is aware of both licensing options but is not offered

either of the two interventions. For the premium option, the user knows which product to use

(i.e., the image currently being used) but needs to learn the price. For the micro-stock option, the

user knows the price level (“as low as $12”) from the email but needs to search for a replacement

image, whose quality is uncertain. We assume the user has three choices: (1) search for the price

information on the premium site first, and, if the price is too high, decide whether or not to search

for a replacement image on the micro-stock site; (2) go to the micro-stock site directly; or (3) take

the outside option (which includes, for example, self-photography, piracy, and non-consumption).

    To obtain either the price or quality information, the user needs to incur a search cost. Moreover,

the marginal cost of additional search is potentially increasing (e.g., due to time constraints). Thus,

relative to searching the micro-stock site directly, a downside of first visiting the premium site is

that the user may face a higher search cost on the micro-stock site after spending time on the

premium site.

    Users may vary in their willingness to pay. With fairly intuitive specifications, one can show

that the expected benefit of first searching the premium site is greater for users with a greater

willingness to pay and that users follow a threshold rule: those with the highest willingness to pay

visit the premium site first; those with the lowest willingness to pay take the outside option; and

those in the middle search the micro-stock site directly.12


Image recommendations

In the above conceptual model, image recommendations may affect the expected payoff from search-

ing the micro-stock site through two mechanisms: (i) reducing the search cost for a replacement
  12
     For group “Micro,” we see some support for this statement: the mean of log(Total stock images on site+1), a
noisy proxy for a firm’s demand for images, is 1.68 for users who logged onto at least one of the two sites and 1.37
for users who did neither (p-value is 0.05).




                                                         7
image; and (ii) reducing the uncertainty over image quality. The effect of lowering the search cost

is straightforward—by making the micro-stock option more attractive than the outside option, we

should increase the likelihood of browsing the micro-stock site (with or without first visiting the

premium site). The effect of revealing image quality, however, may vary: the likelihood of brows-

ing the micro-stock site may increase if the user’s prior belief about image quality is sufficiently

pessimistic, but not otherwise.

   The data show that users who receive image recommendations are twice as likely as those

without recommendations to search the micro-stock site (0.112 vs. 0.057, p-value < 0.001; column

2 of table 3a). Conditional on visiting the site, however, column 3 of the same table shows that

users given recommendations are, on average, significantly less likely to license than users not

given recommendations (0.253 vs. 0.350, p-value 0.05). These results are consistent with both (i)

the idea that users face non-trivial search costs and image recommendations reduce these costs,

and (ii) the idea that users’ prior belief about image quality is sufficiently pessimistic and image

recommendations correct this belief. Both effects are likely to attract marginal users (i.e., those with

a relatively low willingness to pay) away from the outside option, resulting in a lower conditional

licensing rate than that of their counterparts who do not receive recommendations but still decide

to search.

   Image recommendations, by increasing the option value of searching for a replacement image

afterwards, may also increase the user’s expected (standalone) payoff from first visiting the premium

site. With constant marginal search costs, however, the increase in the value of searching the

micro-stock site directly will be even larger, so that a “cannibalization effect” is likely to result

in a decrease in the likelihood of searching the premium site. A different possibility arises with

increasing marginal search costs: having a specific replacement image to fall back on may make the

user less concerned about subsequent search costs on the micro-stock site. If this effect is sufficiently

strong, we may even observe an increase in the likelihood of visiting the premium site, especially

for users not given the premium price information.

   This is exactly what we find in the data: column 1 of table 3a shows that users are also more

likely to search the premium site when they receive image recommendations than when they do

not. The difference is 1.8 percentage points, or a 24-percent increase (p-value is 0.02). A further

breakdown is also intuitive (see the second and third rows in table 4): when the premium-image

                                                   8
price information is not given, the difference in the probability of searching the premium site is 2.5

percentage points (p-value is 0.074), which is larger than the 1.1 percentage point difference when

users are given the premium price information (p-value 0.169). These results are consistent with

an increasing marginal search cost and the notion that image recommendations may mitigate the

opportunity cost of learning the premium price first.13

       Finally, we show that, conditional on licensing, half of the images purchased by users who

received recommendations are recommended images. In comparison, five percent of users who

do not receive recommendations, but who license an image found through independent search,

ultimately license images that coincide with images generated by the same algorithm. This large

difference (45 percentage points) confirms that image recommendations influence users’ choices.


Provision of the premium-image price information

Conceptually, the effect of the premium-image price information on the probability of visiting the

premium site depends on how the actual price compares to the users’ prior beliefs about the price

level. The comparison between the two control groups, reported in section 3.1, suggests that users’

prior beliefs are substantially lower than the actual price level. Column 1 of table 3b confirms this

result: within the four treatment groups, the likelihood of searching the premium site after receiving

the price information is less than one third the likelihood without receiving this information (0.042

versus 0.129, p-value < 0.001).

       Whether or not the premium price information affects users’ likelihood of searching the micro-

stock site is less obvious. This is because users who would have searched the premium site (in

the absence of the price-information intervention) can continue to search the micro-stock site. In

our conceptual model, with a constant marginal search cost, the total likelihood of searching the

micro-stock site stays the same. However, if the marginal cost increases with additional search,

we may observe more search on the micro-stock site by price-informed users because these users—

without having to spend time discovering the premium price information—now face a lower cost

for searching the micro-stock site.

       Consistent with an increasing marginal search cost, column 2 of table 3b shows that providing
  13
    Note that clicking onto a site does not necessarily constitute a serious search. For example, users may click only
to see larger versions of the recommended images, and more email links may simply grab people’s attention. These
alternative explanations alone, however, cannot explain the overall data patterns.


                                                          9
premium price information increases the likelihood of visiting the micro-stock site by 18 percent

(from 0.087 to 0.103, p-value 0.019). Different from the case of image recommendations, we do

not observe a lower likelihood of licensing conditional on searching the site (see column 3). This

is consistent with the idea that those induced to search the micro-stock site after receiving the

premium price information are likely to be infra-marginal users (i.e., those with relatively high

willingness to pay), who would have searched for the premium price.



4         Conclusion

In this study, we contacted infringing firms of expensive digital images and directed them toward

a significantly cheaper product. We designed two interventions to reduce search costs for (i) re-

placement images and (ii) the price comparison of the two products. We find that awareness of the

cheaper option leads to a fourteen-fold increase in the licensing probability. Both interventions have

a large positive effect on the licensing rate, and evidence suggests that users face nontrivial, po-

tentially increasing (marginal) search costs. These findings highlight the importance of simplifying

the search and transaction process for digital goods and other small-value transactions.

         We caution that our results need not reflect an equilibrium effect, as making it easier to license

ex-post may affect the demand for ex-ante licensing and, in turn, the overall list prices. Similarly,

making the cheaper option easier to use could reduce overall firm profits unless additional changes

are made to make the premium products and the process of using them more attractive.14

    Including the premium licenses, the expected revenue per case for the treatment groups is only 2.5 times that for
the control groups ($0.92 vs. $0.38; p-value = 0.218), despite the 14-fold increase in the licensing rate. This is because
the revenue per premium license is much higher than that for the micro-stock option ($423 vs. $23 per license).

Notes: 14-day licensing outcomes of the micro-stock option for the four treatment groups in the analysis sample. We pool
groups to estimate the average effect of each intervention. For example, ‘without image recommendations’ includes both
“Micro” and “Micro + Price;” and ‘with image recommendations’ includes “Micro + Rec” and “Micro + Price + Rec.”
License equals one if the user purchases a micro-stock license, and revenue (in $) is the licensed revenue ($0 if there is no
license). p-values in parentheses are based on two-sided t-tests.

Notes: Includes all cases sent. As explained in detail in section B.3, we removed about four percent of the cases for the third
and fourth batches because the Agency adjusted the tiering system of the firms during the experiment. As a result, some of
the firms were no longer eligible for the experiment. The removed cases are statistically similar across different groups in their
characteristics and proportional in quantity.

Notes: Includes all cases sent. p-values in parentheses are based on two-sided t-tests between a given group and group “0” in
the first row. Multi-image case indicates whether the case involves the unauthorized use of multiple images represented by the
Agency; high resolution indicates whether the displayed image is high-resolution; secondary page equals one if the image is
displayed on a secondary page of the firm’s website rather than on the home page; age is the number of months between the
date when the case was identified and the date when the email was sent; and the number of total stock images on a website
captures the number of unique images identified by a service provider as stock images represented by its client stock-photo
agencies.

Notes: the analysis sample. p-values in parentheses are based on two-sided t-tests between a given group and control group
“0”. Multi-image case indicates whether the case involves the unauthorized use of multiple images represented by the Agency;
high resolution indicates whether the displayed image is high-resolution; secondary page equals one if the image is displayed
on a secondary page of the firm’s website rather than on the home page; age is the number of months between the date when
the case was identified and the date when the email was sent; and the number of total stock images on a website captures the
number of unique images that are identified by a service provider as stock images represented by its client stock-photo
agencies.

“Micro + Price + Rec;” and “with premium-image price info” equals one if in groups “Micro + Price” or “Micro + Price +
Rec.” Robust standard errors are reported in parentheses. * p < 0.10, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01.

B.2 Case eligibility

At the Agency, infringing firms are categorized into five ‘tiers,’ using a formula developed by a third-

party data firm. The formula uses information about each infringing firm, such as annual revenues,

number of employees, and industry, in order to predict the likelihood that the firm will settle an

infringement claim at the list price of a premium image. Tier 1 is the most likely to settle and tier

5 the least likely. We do not observe the formula that maps a firm’s observable characteristics to

a particular tier, but firms with lower annual revenues (or if the revenue information is missing)

tend to have a higher tier number. In a different experiment, Luo and Mortimer (2017) show that

the likelihood of settlement increases significantly with a firm’s annual revenue (or, equivalently,

decreases significantly with the tier number).

   As of January 2014, the Agency no longer requested any settlement amount from firms in tiers

4 and 5 but continued to pursue settlement from firms in lower tiers (larger firms). The new

experiment that this paper analyzes included only firms in tiers 4 and 5 (that is, the smallest firms)

to avoid disrupting the normal operation of the compliance team at the Agency. The cases were

identified within the two years preceding the experiment.


B.3 Allocation

The cases were allocated into the six groups in two steps. For about ten percent of the cases

eligible for the experiment, the similar-image algorithm initially did not yield any results. To avoid

confounding the effect of our interventions with the possibility that the user might not find similar

replacement images on the website through their own searches, we excluded these cases at first.

All other cases were randomly allocated using a random-number generator to the six groups, as

presented in table 1. Specifically, we allocated one tenth of the cases to each of the four groups (two

control and two treatment groups) that do not receive image recommendations, and three tenths to

each of the two treatment groups that received recommendations. We intentionally allocated more

cases to the two treatment groups for which similar images are recommended, which the Agency

deemed to be the most constructive approach. It turned out later that the similar-image algorithm

had not worked initially due to a technical glitch, which was not systematically correlated with the

likely number of similar images on the licensing site or the characteristics of the case. In order to



                                                  27
preserve as many observations as possible and to provide a more balanced number of observations

across groups, we randomly added these cases equally to the four groups that were not given image

recommendations.

   We planned to send 24,680 cases in four batches. The number of cases ranged from 726 to

728 per batch for the two control and two treatment groups without image recommendations, and

from 1,630 to 1,631 per batch for the two treatment groups with image recommendations. As

illustrated in table A1, the total number of cases that the Agency sent out was 24,090; and, thus,

there is a discrepancy of 590 cases. 575 of these cases (98 percent) had been removed from the

third and the fourth batches because the Agency changed their classification system for infringing

firms in the middle of the experiment, which made about four percent of the cases ineligible for the

experiment. We confirmed that the removed cases were statistically similar across different groups

in their characteristics and were proportional in quantity. We were not able to trace the cause for

the remaining 15 missing cases, and they appear to have come from different groups or batches

without a systematic pattern. Table A2 shows that for cases that were eventually sent out, the

groups were well-balanced.


B.4 Follow-up emails

A follow-up email was sent two weeks after the initial email, as long as there were no record of

licensing events or email correspondence. The follow-up email was exactly the same as the initial

email (that is, the interventions were consistent), except for the opening sentence, which indicated

that it was a follow-up to the previous correspondence. Recipients of the emails could send their

clarification questions, explanations for the incidences, or further inquiries to the contact email

address provided in the emails. All of the users’ emails received replies within a day or two,

following a template that was concise and friendly in tone. Importantly, the reply emails to users

were written so as not to interfere with different treatments; in particular, they made no further

recommendations of the more affordable licensing site or replacement images. There are no other

consequences of continued infringement within the scope of this experiment.
