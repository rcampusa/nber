The Persistence and Heterogeneity of Health among Older Americans

                                              ABSTRACT

We consider how age-health profiles differ by demographic characteristics such as education, race, and
ethnicity. A key feature of the analysis is the joint estimation of health and mortality to correctfor the
effect of mortality selection on observed age-health profiles. The model also allows for heterogeneity
in individual health at a point in time and the persistence of the unobserved component of health over
time. The observed component of health is based on a multidimensional index based on 27 indicators
of health. Most of the key results are shown by simulations that illustrate the range of issues that can
be addressed using the model. Differences in health by education and racial-ethnic group at age 50
persist throughout the remainder of life. Based on observed profiles, the health of whites is about
8 percentile points greater than the health of blacks at age 50 but by age 90 the gap is only 5 percentile
points. However, when corrected for mortality selection, the health of blacks is actually declining
more rapidly with age than the health of whites; the true gap widens with age. We also find that much
of the difference in age-health profiles by racial-ethnic group is accounted for by differences in the
levels of education between race-ethnic groups--from two-thirds to 85 percent for men and about half
for women. We also simulate differences in survival probabilities by level of education and health
and use these probabilities to calculate the expected present discounted value (EPDV) of an immediate
annuity with first payout at age 66 for persons by gender, level of education, and health decile. The
range of EPDVs is over two-fold for both men and women suggesting enormous potential for adverse
selection.

Section 1    Introduction
       Health is one of the most important determinants of the quality-of-life of the
elderly. Health has direct effects on well-being and life satisfaction and is a factor in
many important decisions that the elderly face, including work, retirement, housing,
living arrangements, and consumption choices more generally. A better understanding
of how health evolves is critical to understanding the vast differences in health across
levels of education, racial-ethnic groups, and other subgroups of the population. It is
difficult however to infer how health evolves from existing data on health. One problem
is that “true” health is unobserved and inferences are typically based on self-reported
measures that are known to be very imperfect indicators of true health (Kerkhofs and
Lindeboom (1995), Crossley and Kennedy (2002), Lindeboom and Doorslaer (2004),
Baker, Stabile and Deri (2004)). In addition, how the dynamic properties of health are
modeled can have important implications for estimating the true persistence of health
from one age to the next. A further complication is that the observed relationship
between age and health (however measured) is confounded by mortality selection (or
survivorship bias) which can yield substantial underestimation of the decline of health
with age.
       Our goal is to estimate how health evolves after retirement, accounting explicitly
for each of these issues. Health at retirement varies greatly across individuals and this
variation persists into older ages. Some persons experience persistently good health
and others experience persistently poor health. To investigate the source of this
variation we pay particular attention to how individual demographic characteristics such
as education and racial-ethnic group affect health-age profiles. We begin by describing
a health index previously developed in Poterba, Venti and Wise (2013) that uses
substantially more information than simple self-reported health measures. The index is
based on a wide range of questions concerning functional limitations, health conditions,
and medical care obtained in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). We also
carefully model the dynamics of the unobserved component of health that may be due
to unreported prior health conditions, health behaviors, or malnutrition that may have

                                              2
long-lasting effects on health. We allow an inter-temporal correlation structure that is
flexible enough to accommodate any degree of persistence of health over time. Finally,
we account for mortality selection. Mortality selection arises because persons in poor
health are more likely to die and leave the sample.
       We use an econometric model that jointly estimates health and mortality. We
then use the model to simulate the relationship between health at retirement and
subsequent health-age profiles and to explore how the profiles depend on health at
retirement, education, and other demographic characteristics. One advantage of the
model-based approach is that it allows us to explore relationships that would otherwise
be difficult to describe because of the small number of observations for specific groups
of interest (identified by gender, race, ethnicity or level of education for example) in
surveys such as the HRS. Another advantage is that it allows credible out-of-sample
simulation of health-age profiles. For example, if we consider persons who survive to
age 90, it is impossible in a short panel to “look back” far enough to see what their
health was in earlier years. However, our model-based approach allows us to simulate
health back to age 50.
       A consequence of mortality selection is that the average health-age profile
calculated for all persons can be a very misleading indicator of how health evolves for a
particular person. The average level of health at each age averages the health of
persons who might live one more year, two more years, etc. Figure 1-1 helps to
motivate our analytical approach. The figure distinguishes the average health of all
persons alive at each age (the observed health-age profile) from the average health of
persons identified by age of survival. The heavy blue line with round markers shows the
average health percentile (explained below) of all HRS respondents alive at each age.
This average health trajectory reflects the offsetting effects of two forces. First, average
health declines as people age. Most survey respondents report more health problems
and more functional limitations at older ages. Second, there is a selection effect in the
opposite direction—persons in better health are more likely to survive from one age to
the next. This selection effect is illustrated by the other curves in Figure 1-1, that show
the average health at prior ages of those who survived until at least age 70, age 80, and
age 90. At any given age those who will survive longer are in better health. Those who

                                              3
survived until age 90 had much better health at age 75 than those who survived until
age 80. Those who survived until age 80 had much better average health at age 62
than those who survived until age 70. Thus the average age-health profile shown by
the heavy blue line with round markers is quite different from the health-age profile of
persons who survive to a particular age. Moreover, the average profile is not typical of
persons who survive to any age. To obtain correct estimates of how health evolves
after retirement, we must account for mortality selection.

                          Several previous studies have addressed various aspects of the dynamics of
health after retirement. Most of these studies are based on self-assessed health (SAH)
which is typically reported on a five point ordinal scale ranging from poor to excellent.
The two studies most closely related to the present study are Heiss, Boersch-Supan,
Hurd, and Wise (2008) and Heiss (2011). The dynamic model of health and mortality
we use is a close variant of the model developed in these papers. Like the present
study, those analyses are based on data from the HRS, but use SAH instead of the
health index we use. The focus on Heiss (2011) is on the dynamics of SAH and
underlying true (or latent) health and he experiments with a variety of different error

                                                                     4
structures that can accommodate state dependence and unobserved heterogeneity.
The particular model that succeeds best in simulations—one that allows for a non-
constant autocorrelated latent health component—is adopted in the present study.
Several other studies—Contoyannis et al. (2004), Hernandez-Quevedo et. al. (2008)
and ,Halliday (2008)—document the observed persistence of health and focus on the
decomposition of health into components attributable to first-order state dependence
(the direct effect of last period’s health on this period’s health) and individual
heterogeneity (unobserved factors that affect health in all periods). These studies, all of
which use SAH, find that both sources play important roles. The present study uses a
related error structure that also allows for unobserved heterogeneity and a latent health
component that persists over time.
       Two other studies of health dynamics—both using SAH—have also addressed
mortality selection. Contoyannis et al. (2004) and Jones et al. (2006) account for
attrition from the sample (for which mortality selection is only partly responsible) by
using an inverse probability weighted (IPW) estimator that assumes that attrition is
independent of unobserved factors that may affect both health and mortality. Both
studies find that accounting for mortality selection using the IPW estimator has little
effect on the coefficients on various measures of socioeconomic status in an ordered
probit model of SAH.
       The only study of health dynamics that does not rely exclusively on SAH as an
indicator of health is Lange and McKee (2011). They emphasize the importance of
using multiple measures of health to construct a single index. We also use a health
index based on a large number of health measures available in the HRS, although the
measures we use differ from the subset that Lange and McKee use. We use the first
principle component based on 27 health measures and they use a factor analysis
approach using a single health factor. They also allow endogenous mortality and adopt
an error structure for the unobserved component of health that is similar to ours. They
find a high degree of persistence in health, as we do, although they observe that some
of the persistence in health is attributable to the persistence of measurement error
rather than persistence in true health. Unlike our analysis however, they do not



                                              5
investigate the role of demographic characteristics (other than age and gender) on the
evolution of health. We emphasize the role of education and racial-ethnic group.
       The remainder of the paper is in six sections. In section 2 we describe the data
used in the analysis and the health index that we use to measure health. We also
describe the distribution of health at retirement ages. In section 3 we explain the model
we use for estimation and in particular the way that mortality selection is addressed.
Model estimates are presented in section 4. Section 5 presents simulations to illustrate
several important implications of the model. We first assess the model fit and then
show how accounting for mortality selection affects the estimated age profile of health.
We then simulate educational and racial differences in health “corrected” for mortality
selection. The effect of mortality selection is shown to be quite large. We then simulate
the effect of health shocks at age 50 on health and mortality age profiles. In section 6
we simulate the evolution of health by education and racial-ethnic group. We
emphasize that much of the difference in health across racial-ethnic groups is
accounted for by differences in education, especially for men. In section 7 we simulate
differences in survival probabilities by health and the level of education and use these
estimates to show how the present discounted value (EDPV) of the payout from a fair
annuity varies by gender, health, and level of education. Section 8 is a summary of our
findings.
Section 2    Data and Descriptive Statistics
       We first discuss the data used in the analysis and then describe the health index
that is a key component of the analysis. We then show data on the variation in health at
retirement ages by education and racial-ethnic groups and then discuss in some detail
the evolution of health by level of education. Finally, we use the evolution of health for
single and married persons to provide an alternative description of mortality selection
and to highlight its quantitative importance.
       The analysis uses data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). The HRS
is a longitudinal survey that resurveys respondents every two years. The current HRS
is comprised of five entry cohorts. The original HRS cohort surveyed respondents age
51 to 61 in 1992 and the Asset and Health Dynamics of the Older Old (AHEAD) cohort
surveyed respondents age 70 and older in beginning in 1993. Subsequent cohorts

                                                6
include the War Babies (WB) cohort first surveyed at ages 51 to 56 in 1998, the
Children of Depression (CODA) cohort first surveyed at age 68 to 74 in 1998, and the
Early Baby Boomers (EBB) first surveyed at ages 51 to 56 in 2004. Respondents are
resurveyed every two years.
      The HRS sampling methods can yield some non-representative demographic
subsamples in the early years of the HRS. For example, the HRS cohort includes
households with at least one person (the “age-eligible” person) born between 1931 and
1941 and their spouses. These age-eligible persons were age 51 to 61 when first
surveyed in 1992. If an age-eligible person has a spouse, the spouse is automatically
selected even if he or she is not age-eligible. In married households the women is, on
average, younger than the man. As a result, there are more women at younger ages,
for example ages 51 to 55, in the first few waves of the HRS than in the population.
This is because women who were under the age of 51 in 1992 but were married to age-
eligible spouses will “age” into the sample in subsequent years. Thus in the second
wave of the HRS there are few men less than age 53, but a substantial number of
women. Moreover, none of these women are single (unless they were divorced,
widowed, or separated since the previous wave) so the sample of women is highly
unrepresentative of the general population. This aspect of the data is important to
understanding some features of the model fit discussed in section 4.
      The health index: One advantage of the HRS is the detailed information it
provides on health conditions. We construct a health index based on the responses to
27 health-related questions concerning self-reported functional limitations, health
conditions, and medical care usage. The index is the first principal component of these
27 indicators. The full set of questions was not asked of all respondents in the HRS
cohort in 1992 and the AHEAD cohort in 1993, however. Thus we have dropped all
data for the first wave of the HRS and AHEAD cohorts.     A more detailed description of
the index and a list of included variables are contained in Poterba, Venti and Wise
(2013). We note several important features of the index used in this paper. First, the
index used in Poterba, Venti and Wise (2013) only included data through 2008. The
index used in the present paper includes data through 2010. Second, the index used
here is based on a pooled sample that includes all respondents from all HRS cohorts in

                                            7
all years. The decision to pool was based on earlier experimentation with the index that
showed little difference between estimates for men and women and little difference
across years. The principal component loadings on the health variables were used to
predict a raw health score for each respondent. This score was converted to a
percentile index with values from 1 to 100. A person’s percentile index value shows the
person’s position relative to the health of all persons in all HRS cohorts in all years.

                  The index has several important properties for our analysis. First, it is strongly
related to mortality. Figure 2-1 illustrates this for men and women using data from the
earliest of the five HRS cohorts. These persons were age 51 to 61 in 1992 when first
surveyed and age 53 to 63 in 1994. The figures show the percent of persons in each
health decile in 1994 that were deceased by the year 2000 and the percent that were
deceased by the year 2010. The figures show that the index strongly predicts mortality.
For example, over 71.6 percent of men (58.1 percent of women) in the poorest health
decile in 1994 were deceased by 2010 but only 19.7 percent of men (10.3 percent of
women) in the top health decile were deceased by 2010. Second, the index is strongly
predictive of future morbidity as well. Figure 2-2 shows the percent of persons (of both
genders) who report future health events such a stroke, the onset of diabetes, lung
disease, and other health conditions. Persons in the poorest health decile in 1994 report
higher incidence of each condition (with the exception of cancer) by 2010.

                         Variation in health after retirement: The index can also be used to show the
variation in the health of persons near the age of retirement. Figure 2-3 shows how
health varies by level of education for members of the original HRS cohort between
1994 and 2010. This figure is similar to Figure 2-1 in Poterba, Venti and Wise (2013)
where details about how the figure was constructed are presented. The figure shows
that large differences in health by level of education persist over time even as health
declines for persons in all education groups. The slope of each line segment shows the
health trajectory for persons alive at the beginning and end of each two-year interval.
The “gaps” between line segments are an indicator of mortality selection. These gaps
are discussed below. When first observed at ages 53 to 63 in 1994, the differences in
health by education group are very large. The mean health percentile in 1994 is 72.0
for persons with a college degree and 47.6 for persons with less than a high school
degree. The key feature of the figures is that the level of health in subsequent years is
largely determined by the level of health when first observed in 1994. Over time, health
declines by approximately the same amount (in percentiles) for persons at all levels of
education. This suggests that there is little effect of education on the change in health

                                                                   10
after 1994, the first year members of this cohort were observed. Poterba, Venti and
Wise (2013) show similar figures for the AHEAD and the CODA cohorts of the HRS and
for all persons age 65+ in 1998. Although there are some differences across the
groups, the basic pattern is the same for the cohorts.
       Mortality selection: The observed age-health profile is the mean health in each
year (or at each age) for all persons who survive to each year (age). Because of
mortality selection, however, observed age-health profiles are an inaccurate
representation of how the health of persons evolves over time. Here we show how the
age-health profile is distorted by selection. In the next section we describe a model to
formally estimate and correct for mortality selection.
       As noted above, there are two distinct processes that determine observed age-
health profiles. The first is that persons become less healthy as they age. The
second—the selection effect—is that the least healthy are more likely to die and leave
the sample. To isolate the role of selection we begin with a simple example where the
first process is inoperative. Education (unlike health) does not change over time for
persons in the HRS cohort. For any individual the age profile of education is flat
(horizontal). However, the empirical age-education profile rises because of mortality
selection—persons with lower education are more likely to die. Thus, for example, if we
track married persons in the HRS cohort (age 53 to 63 in 1994) from 1994 to 2010 we
find that mean years of education is 12.55 in 1994 and 12.89 in 2010. The difference of
0.34 years is purely the result of (cumulative) mortality selection.
       We can also measure the extent of selection bias associated with each wave-to-
wave transition in the HRS. Figure 2-4 shows average years of education of persons
alive in consecutive waves in the HRS cohort between 1994 and 2010. Separate
profiles are shown for single and for married persons. Each line segment in the figure
shows the change in the education of persons alive in both the beginning year and the
end year of the interval. Each of these segments is flat because the level of education
of each person does not change over time. In this figure the observed age-education
profile is the solid line connecting the end-points of each of the line segments for
married persons. For example, the slope of the observed education profile between
1998 and 2000 is the difference between the mean education of all persons alive in

                                             11
1998 (the last point of the 1996 to 1998 segment) and the mean education of all
persons alive in 2000 (the last point of the 1998 to 2000 segment).




       Some persons alive in 1998 did not survive to 2000. These persons are included
in the 1996 to 1998 segment, but not in the 1998 to 2000 segment. Thus the education
in 1998 of those who survived until 2000 is greater than the education of all persons
who were alive in 1998, including those who did not survive until 2000. The difference
is the mortality selection effect and it is identified in the figure as the vertical height of
the gap between the end of the 1996 to 1998 segment and the beginning of the 1998 to
2000 segment. These gaps, of course, account for the upward slope of the observed
age-education profile since the true age-education profile for individuals is flat. The sum
of these gaps is the 0.34 years of education—the same selection effect reported above.
       Health, unlike education, changes over time. Figure 2-5 shows a figure using
health rather than education as the outcome variable. The height of the gaps is still a
measure of the extent of mortality selection. However, if health is the outcome variable
the segments are not flat—this reflects the decline of true health over time. For the
period 1994 to 2010 the observed change in health—reflecting mortality selection and

                                               12
the true change in health—is -15.6 percentile points (from the end year point of the
1994 to 1996 segment to the end year point of the 2008 to 2010 segment) for married
persons. This can be decomposed into a “true” decline in health of -23.1 percentile
points (the sum of the changes in slope segments) and a mortality effect of +7.5
percentile points (the sum of the gaps). The decomposition for single persons is quite
similar. Over the 16 year period the observed decline in health is -18.0 percentile
points. This is comprised of a “true” decline of -24.5 percentile points for survivors and
a selection effect of 6.4 percentile points. These results pertain to persons in the
original HRS cohort who were age 53 to 63 in 1994 and age 69 to 79 when last
observed in 2010. Similar calculations made for persons surviving to other ages show
that selection effects are larger for persons at older ages. The average wave-to-wave
selection effect is 0.93 for married persons, but this ranges from about 0.7 percentile
points for the 1994 to 1996 interval to about 3.0 percentile points over the last two-year
interval ending in 2010. Thus mortality selection is substantial at all ages and can lead
to very misleading inferences about how health evolves in old age.

Section 3 The Model
         Health: We begin with a description of the evolution of health from wave to wave.
In our framework            is the true (unobserved) health for person i in period t . We assume
that true health is a function of observed individual characteristics X it and an individual

random term            that captures the unobserved components of health and their evolution
over time:

(3-1)     hit  X it  H  Rit  H
The random component                   allows for heterogeneity in health across persons as well as
for persistence in health over time for the same person. It is specified to follow an
AR(1) process with
(3-2)    Rit   Rit 1  uit

where         is normalized to have mean zero and unit variance. The parameter 
captures the persistence of the unobserved component of health over time. In the
special case that =1 the error structure is equivalent to a random effects model and the
unobserved health component is constant over time. Noting that Rit   Rit 1  uit and

assuming that the process is stationary, then uit ~ N (0, (1   2 )) . We then interpret the

error term uit as capturing health shocks. Heiss (2011) weighs the relative merits of

alternative error structures that can be used to accommodate persistence. We assume
that the observed health index H it is equal to true health measured with error:

(3-3)     H it  hit  eit  X it  H  Rit  H  eit
We treat the random term eit as measurement error with zero mean and variance  e2 —

eit ~ N (0,  e2 ) . The total variance of H , given observed covariates X , is given by

V ( H it | X it )  Var ( Rit ) H2  Var (eit )   H2   e2 .
         Mortality: Mortality between period t  1 and period t is a function of individual
characteristics in the prior period X it 1 and true health in the prior period hit 1 . (Neither

X nor h are defined for deceased persons in the present period). We assume that
mortality (the likelihood of death) can be described by latent continuous variable mit , with


                                                            14
(3-4) mit  X it 1M  hit 1M  it

where          is an error term with zero mean and unit variance and is uncorrelated with eit

and uit , the error terms in the health equation. Substituting health hit 1 from equation

(3-1), into 3-3 yields:

            mit  X it 1M   X it 1 H  Rit 1 H  M  it
(3-4)                                        
                  X it 1 M   H M  Rit 1 H M  it
                  X it 1 M  Rit 1 M  it


where  M  M   H M and  M   H M .

Note that the total (reduced form) effect of X it 1 on mortality is given by M which can be

decomposed into a “direct” effect M and an “indirect” effect through health (  H M ) . In

summary: the health equation yields estimates of  H and  H . The mortality equation

yields estimates of  M and  M . Given estimates of  H ,  M ,  H , and  M we can recover

M   M /  H and M   M   H ( M /  H ) .
Mortality selection occurs through both                           and        . Let M it be a mortality indicator that

that takes on the value one if a person dies between periods t  1 and t , and zero
otherwise. Following the conventional probit specification, we assume that M it tales a

value of one if latent mortality mit crosses a threshold (normalized to be zero), so M it  1

if mit  0 or         > -(              +            ). The probability that person i dies between t  1

and t is then given by:
(3-6) Pr[ M it  1| X it 1 , Rit 1 ]    X it 1 M  Rit 1 M 

where            is the standard normal cumulative distribution function.

Conditional on the sequence  Ri1 ,..., RiT  , health and mortality are assumed to be

independent over time, so if latent health were observed, the likelihood contribution of
individual i would simply be
(3-7) Pi  Ri1 ,..., RiT    f( Hit | X it , Rit )  Pr[M it | X it 1 , Rit 1 ] ,
                                  t


                                                                  15
where f( H it | X it 1 , Rit ) denotes the conditional density of observed health. The fact that

respondents in the HRS are obviously alive when they enter the sample, has to be
taken into account when integrating out the latent health process since mortality has
created a more or less selected sample with respect to Rit , depending on the age and

other covariates. We follow Heiss (2011) and explicitly derive the distribution of Rit

conditional on survival to the first wave ( Si1 ) when we do our likelihood calculations.

The likelihood contribution then becomes
(3-8) Li     Pi  Ri1 ,..., RiT  f  Ri1 ,..., RiT Si1  dRi1  dRiT

This integral could simply be approximated using Monte-Carlo simulation methods or
multivariate numeric integration (Heiss and Winschel 2008). We use the sequential
deterministic integration algorithm of Heiss (2008) since it is more accurate and less
computational costly for this model class.
         Mortality selection occurs because the unobserved components of the health and
mortality equations are correlated. If the correlation is zero then there is no selection
bias. If the correlation is negative then persons with higher health (given           ) will have
lower mortality and will be less likely to leave the sample via death. The covariance
between unobserved components of the health and mortality equations (3-3 and 3-5) is:

Cov  Rit 1 H  eit 1 , Rit 1 M  vit    R2 H  M ,
The correlation between the unobserved components is:

                R2 H  M                                     H M
                                            

Section 4. Results
         Joint Estimation Results: Results from the joint estimation of equations 3-3 and
3-6 are shown in Table 4-1a for women and Table 4-1b for men. Both equations
include the same set of              covariates: 1) an age spline with breakpoints at ages 60, 70,
80 and 90, 2) a set of race-ethnicity indicators (the omitted group is white-non-
Hispanic), 3) indicator variables for the level of education attained (the omitted category

is less than a high school degree), and a variable indicating whether the respondent’s
longest tenure job was blue collar.
       Each table shows the estimated coefficients on covariates             in the health and the
mortality equations. The estimates for the mortality equation are the total effects ( M)

described above. (The total effect is decomposed into direct and indirect effects in
Tables 4-3a and 4-3b below.) The probit estimates have been converted to marginal
effects to make them easier to interpret. For each           variable we calculate
Pi       X i  
                      j  X i   and then average over all observations (by gender). The
X ij     X ij

exception to this rule is that we calculate marginal effects of the age spline variables by
averaging over observations in the relevant age interval. The probit estimate of  M has

also been converted to a marginal effect in Table 4-1.

           The estimated marginal effect of the unobserved individual random term                                  in
the health and mortality equations,  H and  M respectively, are shown at the bottom of

the tables. The effect of the unobserved health component is positive and statistically
significant in the health equation (  H ) and is negative and statistically significant in the

mortality equation (  M ).1 The estimated autocorrelation parameter (  ) is greater than

0.93 for both men and women and suggests strong persistence in the unobserved
component of health over time. The standard deviation of the measurement error in the
health equation (  e ) is about 9.4 percentile points for both men and women. The

correlations between the unobserved components of the health and mortality equation
are -0.48 for women and -0.41 for men, verifying the strong mortality selection effect.
           Health equation estimates: The effect of age on health is roughly similar for men
and women. The estimates imply that health declines between one and 2 percentile
points with each year of age. Health declines more rapidly at older ages than at
younger ages and the estimated decline is more pronounced for men than for women.
The one unexpected pattern is that the estimate for ages 60-69 is slightly lower than the
estimate for ages 50-59 for both men and women. The race-ethnicity estimates for
women suggest that African-American health is 5.7 percentile points lower than the
health of whites (among non-Hispanics). The Hispanic effect is quite small, about ½ of
a percentile point less among whites and about one percent less among non-whites.
The race-ethnicity effects for men are smaller and less consistent. The non-white effect
is -3.2 percentile points for non-Hispanics, but is negligible for Hispanics. The



    To understand the estimate of  H , recall that V ( H it | X it )  Var ( Rit ) H  Var (eit )   H   e . The
1                                                                                  2                  2        2


measurement error has mean zero and the estimated standard deviation is 9.40 for women and 9.44 for
men. The estimate of        H   is 25.53 for women and 25.86 for men. The standard error of         e   is
approximately 9.4, so a one standard deviation change in eit will change H by 9.4. The unobserved
random term R is distributed N(0,1). Thus a one standard deviation change in R (a one unit change) will
change H by Rit  H and is approximately 25. Then V ( H it | X it )   H   e =625 + 88.36 = 713.36. Thus
                                                                        2     2


87.6% of the unobserved variation in health given the covariates X is explained by unobserved health R
and 12.4% by measurement error e .

education-health gradient is large and statistically significant for both men and women.
For women, the health percentile of persons with a college degree or more is 18.2
points higher than the health percentile of persons with less than a high school degree
(the omitted category). The difference for men is 16.5 percentile points. Primary
employment on blue collar jobs is associated with lower health for both men and
women. Although statistically significant, the estimates are much smaller than the
estimated effects of education. Controlling for other covariates, the estimates for a blue
collar job are -2.5 and -1.8 percentage points for women and men respectively.
       Mortality equation estimates: The columns on the right side of Tables 4-1a and 4-
1b show the marginal effect of each X variable on the probability that a respondent dies
between the waves. These are the total (reduced form) effects from Equation 3-4. For
women, mortality increases sharply with age—by one-tenth of one percent for each year
of age between 50 and 59 and by about 2.3 percent for each year of age above 90.
The probability of death for men is greater than for women between ages 50 and 59 but
lower than the probability for women at older ages. The one anomaly for which we have
no explanation is the high (2.9 percent) estimate for men in the 60 to 69 age interval.
For both men and women, non-whites have higher mortality than whites and Hispanics
have lower mortality than whites. That Hispanics have lower income and education
than whites but live longer is known as the “Hispanic paradox” in the demographic
literature (Scommegna 2013).
       While primary employment on blue collar jobs is associated with lower health for
both men and women, the relationship to mortality is different for men and women.
Controlling for education and other covariates, blue collar employment has little effect
on mortality for women. However, a blue collar job is associated with a 1.5 percent
decline in the probability of dying for men. As with health, however, the effect of
education on mortality is much greater than the effect of a blue collar job on mortality for
both men and women. The difference in mortality of persons with less than a high
school degree and those with a college degree or more is -7.3 percent for women and -
6.5 percent for men; the effect of a blue collar job is -0.4 percent for women (and not
statistically significant) and -1.5 percent for men.

       Joint Versus Single Equation Estimates of the Health Equation: The joint
estimates of health and mortality shown above “correct’ the parameter estimates in the
health equation for mortality selection. Table 4-2 below reproduces these estimates
and also shows single-equation estimates of the health equation. The key comparison
is the estimated effect of age on health. For both men and women the estimated
decline in health with age is greater in the two-equation model than in the single-
equation counterpart. This is consistent with mortality selection leading to an empirical
health-age profile of survivors that declines less rapidly than the true decline in health
with age. The joint estimates are slightly lower than the single equation estimates for
most of the other covariates.

       The Direct and Indirect Effect of Covariates and Unobserved Health on Mortality:
The estimated coefficients in the mortality equation (  M and  M ) capture the “total”

(reduced form) effect of the covariates X and unobserved health R on mortality. Recall
that we can decompose the total effect of each of the X covariates into its direct effect
on mortality (     ) and the indirect effect through health (     ). We can also estimate
the direct and indirect effects of R on mortality ( M and  H M ). The first column of

Table 4-3a (for women) and Table 4-3b (for men) reproduces the total effects (probit
estimates converted to marginal effects) of each X variable on mortality from Table 4-1.

         For the most part each covariate has both direct and indirect effects on mortality.
Perhaps the most striking result of the decomposition is for education. The total effect
of education on mortality is quite substantial for both men and women, but the direct
effect is small; most of the effect of education on mortality is indirect (through the effect
of education on health). For women, between 77.3 and 84.4 percent of the total effect
of education on mortality is through health; for men between 64.3 and 69.7 percent is
through health. It is also striking that the lower mortality of Hispanics (the Hispanic
paradox) is almost exclusively a direct effect. The indirect effect through health is small
and not statistically significant for either men or women. As noted above, a surprising
result is that controlling for education and other covariates, blue collar employment has
little effect on mortality for women but is associated with a 1.5 percent decline in the
probability of dying for men.

Section 5 Simulations: Model Fit, Mortality Selection and Health Dynamics

         We use simulations to verify the model fit, to describe the measurement of
mortality selection, and to demonstrate the dynamic properties of health.

         The Model Fit: We perform several simulations to assess the fit of the model.
Each simulation is based on 1,000 replications for each person in the original HRS data
set. Health-age profiles for each replicated person are simulated from age 50 until
death. The race/ethnicity, education and occupation variables remain constant over

time. To simulate the unobserved components at age 50 we draw uit from its estimated

distribution with mean zero and variance (1   2 ) and draw      it from its estimated
distribution with mean zero and unit variance. As we simulate forward we make new

draws of uit and       it from their respective distributions to generate the latent process
Rit . The simulation yields a value for H it and a probability of death, Pr[Mit  1| X it , Rit ] ,
in each period. At each age persons are randomly dropped from the sample with
probability Pr[M it  1| X it , Rit ] .

       To show the model fit we have “reproduced” by simulation Figure 1-1 that shows
the average health percentile at each age based on HRS data. Figures 5-1a and 5-1b
below compare the observed health profile with the simulated profile for men and
women respectively. The figures compare both the average age-health profile (labeled
“all”) as well as the prior health profiles of persons who survived to age 70, to age 80,
and to age 90. The actual and the simulated profiles correspond very closely.
       Figures 5-2a and 5-2b compare actual and simulated mortality rates by age for
women and men respectively. The actual mortality rates come from the Social Security
period life table for 2007. Again, the two profiles correspond quite closely.
       Measuring Mortality Selection: We emphasized above the two distinct processes
that determine observed age-health profiles—the first is that persons become less
healthy as they age and the second, the selection effect, is that the least healthy are
more likely to die and leave the sample. Simulations based on our model can help to
understand the magnitude of the selection effect as well as other implications of
mortality selection. The observed age-health profile of survivors is the sum of the

effects of these two processes and is given by H it  X it  H  Rit  H  eit , where the

measurement error eit has mean zero at all ages. This profile is shown by the heavy

solid line in Figure 5-3a (women) and Figure 5-3b (men). This is the simulated value of
H it for persons who have survived to each age and is the same profile shown earlier as
the fitted lines in Figures 5-1a and 5-1b. The blue dashed profile in these figures is the

average value of the unobserved component Rit  H of the health of survivors and

measures the extent of mortality selection. The first process—the decline in health with

age—is shown by the dashed red line which is H it minus the unobserved component Rit
. This is the mortality corrected age-health profile. By age 80 the observed age-health
profile understates the decline in health by about 8.8 percentile points for women and
10.7 percentile points for men.

        By assumption Rit has mean zero at age 50 (before mortality selection begins).

This unobserved health component increases with age because persons with large

negative values of Rit are more likely to die and leave the sample. The red dashed line

shows the evolution of the observed component X it  H . Note that this description

implies that the health-age profile is corrected for selection on the unobserved

component of health, but not for selection on observed covariates X it . We also correct

for selection on observables by reweighting. Without reweighting, the simulated sample
of survivors would include (for example) proportionately more highly educated persons
at older ages because more highly educated persons are more likely to survive. To
keep the composition of the sample constant over time—thus correcting for selection on
observables—we do not update the weights during the simulation.2 It turns out that
almost all of the mortality correction is due to the unobserved component. The effect of
selection on observables is negligible—less than one percentile point at age 80 for both
men and women.
        Mortality selection also distorts estimates of health differences by age. Consider
observed health differences by level of education at each age. The solid blue line in
Figure 5-4 shows the observed difference at each age between the health percentile of
persons (averaged over gender and race) with a college degree and the health
percentile of persons without a high school degree. The figure shows that at age 50 the
average health of college graduates is over 20 percentile points higher than the average
health of otherwise identical persons without a high school degree. This gap narrows to
about 10 percent by age 90 -- suggesting that the health of less educated persons is
declining more slowly than the health of more educated persons. However, much of the
narrowing of the gap is the result of mortality selection, not changes in true health. The
less educated are more likely to die, thus at each age the effect of mortality selection is


2
  We simulate health at each age for each of 64 groups defined by race, ethnicity, education and
occupation, beginning at age 50. The simulated profiles in Figures 5-3a and 5-3b are weighted averages
(for each of the three series shown) of the 64 groups at each age. Simulated profiles corrected for
selection on unobservables can be obtained by using weights that update the initial (age 50) weights with
simulated mortality risks. Simulated profiles corrected for observables and unobservables (shown in the
figures) are obtained by using weights that are not updated.

                                                   28
greater for the less educated than for the more educated. The health difference
corrected for mortality selection is shown by the dashed line in Figure 5-a. This
difference declines modestly from 20 percent at age 50 to about 18 percent at age 90.
                  Figure 5-5 shows the age profile of the difference between the health percentile
of whites and the health percentile of African-Americans, averaged over gender and
education. Again, the solid line is the observed difference in health by age and the
dashed line is the difference corrected for mortality selection. Based on the observed
profile, the health of whites is about 8 percentile points greater than the health of blacks
at age 50. By age 90 the gap is only 5 percentile points. This narrowing of the gap
might be interpreted as evidence that black health is declining more slowly than the
health of whites. However, as the dashed line indicates, when corrected for mortality
selection, the health of blacks is declining more rapidly than health of whites. The true
gap widens with age, but mortality selection is strong enough to give the appearance of
a narrowing of the observed gap.

                          Health dynamics: The unobserved component of health is specified as the sum
of an AR(1) process and pure measurement error: Rit   Rit 1  uit where uit is an

independent shock to health each period. The estimated values of  are 0.94 and 0.93
for women and men respectively and indicate substantial persistence in health. Figures
5-6a and 5-6b show how a health shock ( uit ) that occurs in mid-life affects the level of

health and the probability of survival at older ages. Consider a white man with a high
school degree and a blue collar job. Profiles associated with three health shocks at age
50, corresponding to the 50th (solid line) and the 10th and 90th percentiles (dashed lines)
of the distribution of uit are shown. Figure 5-6a shows that a large negative health

shock at age 50 can have long-lasting effects. A shock at the 10th percentile rather than
the 90th percentile lowers health by almost 45 percentile points at age 60 and by over 16
percentile points at age 80. Figure 5-6b shows the effect of the same shocks on the
probability of survival. A person receiving a 90th percentile shock at age 50 has an 82
percent probability of living to age 74 but an otherwise identical person receiving a 10th

Section 6 Simulations: Level of Education, Racial and Ethnic Groups, and the
Persistence of Health
      We consider first how health differences at age 50 persist by level of education.
We then consider the persistence of health among groups of persons classified by level
of education and race-ethnicity. The comparisons are all based on age-health profiles
by education level and by racial-ethnic group. Figures 5-1a and 5-1b above show the fit
of the model to observed data and, in particular, to the observed data for persons
surviving until age 70, age 80, and age 90. To obtain the age-health profiles for this
section we use our model to back-cost survival profiles to age 50 for education and
race-ethnic groups.
       Education and Health: The simulated age-health profiles of men and women
with less than a high school degree and those with a college degree or more are shown
in Figures 6-1a and 6-1b for women and men respectively. These and subsequent
figures in this section pertain to persons in white collar occupations. The health of
persons who survive to age 50 is shown by the value at age 50 of the heavy solid line in
each of the panels in the figures. Within each level of education the health differences
that are evident at age 50 in the profiles for the groups that survive to 50, 70, 80, and 90
persist over the entire age range. In addition the initial health differences between the
profiles of those with less than a high school degree and of those with a college degree
or more persist throughout the age range. For example, the difference at age 50
between those with less than a high school degree who will survive until age 90 and
those with a college degree who with survive until age 90 persists until age 90, although
the gap narrows as persons in each group age. Within each level of education the
figures also show a widening in the health gap between survival profiles with age. The
widening is especially apparent for those with less than a high school degree where, for
example, the difference between the health profiles of women who survive to age 80
and women who survive to age 90 doubles from 3.6 percentile points at age 50 to 7.2
percentile points at age 70. The health of those who live longer declines less rapidly
with age.

Racial-Ethnic Group, Education, and Health: We next consider how health profiles
differ by race and ethnicity and then turn to profiles by race-ethnicity and level of
education. Figure 6-2a shows health profiles for women by racial-ethnic group. There
are substantial differences in the profiles by racial-ethnic group at age 50 and these
differences persist into old age. The highest profile is for white and non-Hispanic (with
health at age 50 between the 69th and 77th percentile for the four survival groups) and
the lowest is for non-white and Hispanic (with the profiles between the 56th and 66th
percentiles). The profile for white and Hispanic and for non-white and non- Hispanic are
quite similar and lie between the other two groups.

education, the profiles of the four racial-ethnic groups do not differ by much. This
suggests that much of the difference between the health profiles of racial-ethnic groups
is accounted for by differences in education between the racial-ethnic groups. Within
each level of education some variation between racial-ethnic groups remains, due in
large part to differences between the two white and the two non-white groups.

remaining in the health profiles for men.              Thus for men, the differences among the

        Consider first the far right panel for men. For all men who survive until age 50,
the health percentile at age 50 ranges from a high of 75.5 for the white and non-
Hispanic group to a low of 68.3 for the non-white and Hispanic group, a 7.2 percentile
point difference. For those who survive until age 70, the difference is 6.6 percentile
points and for those who survive to age 80 the difference is 6.3 percentile points. For
men with less than a high school degree the health percentile difference between the
white non-Hispanic and the non-white and Hispanics groups are 1.1, 1.6, and 2.1
percentile points respectively for those who survive to age 50, 70, and 90. For persons
with a college degree or more, the differences are 1.1, 1.3, and 1.6 percentile points
respectively for those who survive to 50, 70, and 90. Thus for each age of survival, the
health gap between the highest and lowest racial-ethnic groups (shown in the right
panel) is considerably reduced if education is controlled for. In other words, racial-
ethnic differences in the level of education account for between 67 and 84 percent of
the overall racial-ethnic health gap, depending on the level of education and the survival
group. Note also that rank ordering of the four racial-ethnic groups in some cases
differs when the level of education is controlled for, but for ease of exposition the

percentage reductions calculated above use differences between the white and non-
Hispanic and the non-white and Hispanic throughout.
       Race and ethnic differences in health are substantially greater for women than
for men as shown in the top right panel. The difference between the health percentiles
of the white and non-Hispanic and the non-white and Hispanic groups is 12.9, 12.1,
and 11.6 percentile points for the age 50, age 70, and age 90 survival groups
respectively. If we control for education, then these ranges differences are reduced by
44 to 55 percent. Again, a large proportion of the racial-ethnic difference in health is
accounted for by racial-ethnic differences in educational attainment.
       Table 6-2 shows the health percentile at age 70 for persons who survive to ages
70 and 90. Like Table 6-1, the table is divided into three panels but with only two age
survival groups in each pane.
       Without controlling for the level of education, the range of health percentiles for
women is 12.3 and 11.1 percentile points for the age 70 and age 90 survival groups
respectively. For men the ranges are only 6.6 and 5.9 percentile points respectively.
For women the health percentile ranges are reduced from 38 to 49 percent when
education is controlled for. For men, controlling for education reduces the health
percentile range across racial-ethnic groups from 66 to 77 percent.

Section 7 Health, Education, Mortality and the EDPV from a Fair Annuity

        A long-standing puzzle for economists is that very few people purchase private
annuities; most individuals only receive annuity payments from the Social Security
system or employer-provided defined benefit pension benefits. One explanation may be
that the length of the payout stream from an annuity may depend heavily on health but
the price of an annuity is independent of the potential annuitant’s health; the annuity
premium typically depends only on age and gender.3 Thus for many the health risk of a
short-lived annuity payout may offset the insurance against outliving assets that an
annuity provides. This creates the problem of adverse selection in annuity markets.
Persons with short life expectancy—and likely poor health—are unlikely to purchase
annuities at a price that is actuarially fair for the average person of the same age and
gender and will be even less likely to purchase annuities at prices that are even higher
due to adverse selection and provider costs and profit.
        We calculate the expected present discount value (EPDV) of a fair immediate life
annuity by health and level of education for men and women. The EPDV is one of two
components used in “money’s worth” calculations for annuities. The other component is
the premium paid which we do not observe. The money’s worth calculation is discussed
in Mitchell, Poterba, Warshawsky and Brown (1999). For each person we calculate the
EPDV of a $1 annuity with the first payout at age 66, using simulated survival
probabilities for men and for women by health decile at age 66 and by education level.4
These survival probabilities for men and women for those with less than a high school
education and for those with a college education or more are shown in Figures 7-1a and
7-1b for men and women respectively. Separate profiles are shown for each decile of
health at age 66 (the bottom curve is the lowest health decile). Notice that given health,

  In life insurance markets providers go to great lengths to learn about the individual’s health, often
requiring medical histories, access to medical records, and exams. In annuity markets providers have no
information on individual health. The price an individual faces for an annuity typically depends only on
age, gender and state of residence.
4
  Given our fitted model, we simulate the evolution of health and mortality starting at age 50 for an
artificial population of 100,000 individuals for each of the demographic cells. Those who survive to age
66 are divided into health deciles and followed through the rest of their lives. This allows us to calculate
remaining life expectancies and the value of annuities conditional on demographic characteristics and
initial health deciles.


                                                     40
survival probabilities vary a great deal by level of education. For example, the figure for
men shows that a survival probability of forty percent for those in the lowest health
decile occurs at about age 75 (marked by the dashed blue lines). For men with a
college degree or more a forty percent survival probability occurs at about age 80. A
survival probability of eighty percent for men in the top health decile and with less than a
high school degree occurs at about age 80 (the solid blue lines). The same survival
probability for men with a college education or more occurs at about age 84. A similar
pattern is evident in Figure 7-1b for women.

            The EPDV calculation uses survival probabilities like these for each of four
education levels and assumes a 3 percent discount rate. Table 7-1 shows these
EPDVs by gender, level of education and health decile at age 66. The EPDV ranges
from $7.75 for men with less than a high school degree and in the lowest health decile

                                                             41
to $17.54 for men with a college degree or more an in the top health decile, a difference
of more than two-fold (2.26). For women the EPDV ranges from $8.26 to $18.97. This
suggests that potential annuitants will have vastly different valuations of the same
annuity simply based on health at age 66. Since all persons of the same age and
gender will face the same annuity premium, the scope for adverse selection is
enormous.

Section 8    Summary
       Health at retirement varies enormously among individuals and this variation
persists into older ages. Our goal is to understand the source and implications of the
variation. To understand how health evolves we need to address two related issues.
One is that “true” health is unobserved and is typically proxied by an empirical measure
of health--most studies use self-assessed health status. We use a health index based
on a broad range of health indicators. In either case empirical measures of health are
imprecise proxies for “true” health. Thus given measured health, there remain
unobserved differences in health. If this unobserved component of health is large, then
understanding the dynamic properties of this component is crucial to the understanding
of the evolution of “true” health. The second issue is the mortality selection that arises
because healthier persons are more likely to survive to older ages. A well-known
consequence of mortality selection is that health-age profiles (calculated from the
average health of survivors at each age) do not indicate how the health of an individual


                                                 42
(or a subset of individuals) evolves. In particular, observed health-age profiles of
survivors substantially underestimate the true decline in health with age.
       A central component of our analysis is the development and estimation of a
model that addresses each of these issues. The key feature of the model is joint
estimation of health and mortality. An important input to the model is the health index
developed by Poterba, Venti, and Wise (2013) that uses substantially more information
than a simple self-reported health measure. The index is based on a wide range of
questions concerning functional limitations, health conditions, and medical care usage
obtained in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). The model assumes that “true”
health is the sum of measured health (the index) and an unobserved health component
that is allowed to persist over time. The model yields estimates of the relationship
between a set of covariates (age, race, ethnic group, education, and blue collar
employment) and health and mortality. Estimates are obtained separately for men and
women.
       A comparison between estimates from the joint health-mortality model and
estimates from a conventional single equation health model shows that mortality
selection is important. The estimated effect of most of the covariates on health is larger
in the joint health-mortality model. In particular, the estimated effect of education is
quite large. Controlling for other covariates, the estimated difference between the
health percentile of persons with a college degree or more and those with less than a
high school degree is 18.2 percentage points for women and 16.5 percentage points for
men. Primary employment on blue collar jobs is associated with lower health for both
men and women but the effects are much smaller than the education effects. The
health percentile of whites is estimated to be 5 to 6 percentile points higher than that of
non-whites. The Hispanic effect is small and not statistically significant.
       Each covariate can affect mortality in two ways: either directly or indirectly
through its effect on health. The total effect of each covariate is the sum of the direct
and indirect effects. Again, the most striking result is the decomposition into direct and
indirect effects for education. The total effect of education on mortality is substantial for
both men and women, but most of the effect of education on mortality is through the
effect of education on health (that is, education has a strong effect on health and health

                                             43
has a strong effect on mortality). For women, between 77.3 and 84.4 percent of the
total effect of education on mortality is through health, depending on the education level;
for men between 64.3 and 69.7 percent is through health. The estimated effect of blue
collar employment on mortality is perhaps surprising. Controlling for education and
other covariates, blue collar employment has little effect on mortality for women but is
associated with a 1.5 percent decline in the probability of dying for men.
       Most of the key results are shown by simulations that illustrate the range of
issues that can be addressed using the model. The first simulations verify the model fit,
describe the measurement of mortality selection, and demonstrate the dynamic
properties of health.   The model fits actual HRS health and actual mortality data (life
tables) extremely well. Simulations are also used to demonstrate the magnitude of
mortality selection. For example, based on observed profiles, the health of whites is
about 8 percentile points greater than the health of blacks at age 50 but by age 90 the
gap is only 5 percentile points. This narrowing of the gap might be interpreted as
evidence that black health is declining more slowly with age than the health of whites.
However, when corrected for mortality selection, the health of blacks is actually
declining more rapidly with age than the health of whites; the true gap widens with age.
Simulations also demonstrate how a health shock that occurs in mid-life affects the level
of health and the probability of survival at older ages. To illustrate, we consider a white
male with a high school degree and a blue collar job with health at the lowest 10th health
percentile at age 50 and a similar person at the 90th health percentile at age 50. The
person at the 90th percentile of health at age 50 has a probability of survival to age 74 of
almost 82 percent but an otherwise identical person at the 10th percentile at age 50 has
a 45 percent probability of living to age 74.
       The second set of simulations show the interaction between education and
racial-ethnic group on the one hand, and the evolution of health and survival
probabilities on the other. We begin with simulations of the age-health profiles by level
of education. These simulations emphasize the strong persistence in health differences
by level of education over the entire age range between age 50 and age 90. We also
consider age-health profiles by level of education within racial-ethnic groups. We find
that much of the difference in age-health profiles by racial-ethnic group is accounted for

                                                44
by differences in the levels of education between racial-ethnic groups. This is especially
true for men, with two-thirds to 85 percent of the difference accounted for by differences
in education. For women approximately half is accounted for by differences in
education.
       Finally, we simulate the differences in survival probabilities by level of education
and use these probabilities to illustrate the large variation in the expected present
discounted value (EPDV) of a fair annuity. We calculate the EPDV of an immediate
annuity with first payout at age 66 for persons by gender, level of education, and health
decile at age 66. The range of EPDVs is striking for both men and women. The EPDV
of an immediate annuity for persons in the top health decile with a college degree or
more is more than double the EPDV for persons in the lowest health decile with less
than a high school. Because all persons of the same age and gender face the same
annuity premium, this suggests the scope for adverse selection is enormous.
       This paper has developed a joint model of health and mortality to estimate how
health evolves after retirement. One key feature is that the model captures the dynamic
properties of the unobserved component of health. Another feature is that it allows us
to “correct” observed age-health profiles for the effect of mortality selection. The
methodology used here is also applicable to other economic outcomes where the age
profile is affected by mortality selection. In future work we plan to extend the model to
examine the role of mortality selection in age-wealth profiles.
