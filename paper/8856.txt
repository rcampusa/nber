Who Panics During Panics?
Evidence from a Nineteenth Century Savings Bank

                                            ABSTRACT

       Using records of the bank accounts of individual depositors, this paper provides a detailed
microeconomic analysis of two nineteenth century banking panics. The panics of 1854 and 1857 were
not characterized by an immediate mass panic of depositors and had important time dimensions. We
examine depositor behavior using a hazard model. Contagion was the key factor in 1854 but it was not
strong enough to create more than a local panic. In contrast, the panic of 1857 began with runs by
businessmen and banking sophisticates followed by less informed depositors. Uninformed contagion may
have been present, but the evidence suggests that this panic was driven by informational shocks in the
face of asymmetric information about the true condition of bank portfolios.

   Contagion is greatly feared in today’s financial system. The possibility that

the collapse of a country’s banking system or equity market can set off an

economic crisis is a grave concern for policy makers. To find the appropriate

safeguards and remedies, it is thus important to understand the underlying

causes of contagion.    In this paper, we use a unique data set on individual

depositors to examine the most traditional form of contagion, banking panics in

mid-nineteenth century America, for evidence on which models best explain

panics in an era of light regulation and no deposit insurance.

      In the large literature on banking panics (see Gorton and Winton, 2001),

there are two general classes of models that have been used to explain why

depositors panic. Models following the seminal paper of Diamond and Dybvig

(1983) view bank runs as ignited by random events that induce each depositor to

run because they believe that other depositors will run on the bank and force it

into a costly liquidation. The fear of being last, when depositors are served

sequentially, drives the run. Panics here are produced by the spread of runs

from one bank to another. Kauffman (1994) terms these panics, where a run on

one bank spreads to otherwise sound banks to be the result of “non-

informational” contagion.   In contrast, models based on asymmetric information

(Gorton, 1985; Chari and Jagannathan, 1988; Jacklin and Battacharya, 1988;

Calomiris and Schweikart, 1991; and Calomiris and Gorton, 1992) see runs as

beginning when some depositors observe negative information about the value of

bank assets and withdraw their deposits.        Unable to perfectly discriminate

between sound and unsound banks and observing a wave of withdrawals, other




                                         2
depositors follow suit, leading to runs on multiple banks.1 Given that panics of

this character are initiated by identifiable shocks, Kauffman terms them

“informational” contagion.

       Although there have been empirical studies of nineteenth century

American panics, these focus at the aggregate level on the number of bank

closings and they find some support for both models. We use the records of

individual depositors of the Emigrant Savings Industrial Bank (EISB), which was

subject to serious runs in 1854 and 1857, to examine the causes of banking

panics using a hazard model. These two episodes provide a natural experiment,

as the panics were the results of different shocks. The panic of 1854 was local

and started with the news of a single bank’s insolvency, while the panic of 1857

was brought about by a system-wide shock that affected the whole financial

sector. The microeconomic evidence reveals that the runs on the EISB do not fit

a simple stylized picture.

       In neither 1854 nor 1857 did depositors respond to a signal which led

them to crowd into banks all at once. Instead, panics lasted a few weeks building

and sometimes ebbing in intensity, and only a fraction of all accounts were

closed. Our survival analysis of the accounts supports savvy contemporaries’

observations.      The run on the EISB during the panic of 1854 was by

predominantly less wealthy, less experienced, and less sophisticated—

“uninformed”---depositors. The “random” event of another savings bank failure

ignites runs on the EISB and other savings banks even though there was no

1
 Calomiris and Kahn (1991) see panics as a monitoring device where depositors are induced to
engage in costly monitoring. The sequential payment of depositors at the window serves as a



                                              3
evidence that they were insolvent. In earlier work, Kelly and Ó Gráda (2000)

have shown that the run followed networks within the Irish community, providing

a test of social contagion. As such, the 1854 run followed the pattern described

by Diamond and Dybvig. However, the banks were not overwhelmed, and by

steadfastly paying their customers, the panic died away.                   In contrast, the panic

of 1857 began as a run by the more wealthy experienced and sophisticated

depositors---the “informed”---who observed the declining value of many bank

portfolios, and then ran. Watching these depositors, others eventually joined

them at the tellers’ windows, making 1857 look more like a panic generated by

asymmetric information.            The banking system was overwhelmed and only a

general suspension of payments prevented a total collapse. Overall, while there

is evidence for pure contagion a la Diamond-Dybvig, the general shock in the

presence of informational asymmetries appears to be of more importance

because of its severity.



                 1. Banking Panics in Nineteenth Century America

    The nineteenth and early twentieth century American banking system was

subject to banking panics that led first to the creation of the Federal Reserve

System in 1913 and later to the establishment of the Federal Deposit Insurance

Corporation in 1933. However, while panics may have troubled the public and

policy makers, the definition of what constitutes a panic remained fluid. Often the

term banking panic has been used to identify an event where banks fail in the

midst of a recession or stock market crash. The result has been substantial


constraint that efficiently rewards those who arrive and withdraw their funds first.

                                                  4
differences in the number of panics, as counted by different authors. Looking at

the period 1890 – 1910, Sprague (1910) emphasized three crises (1890, 1893

and 1907) while his contemporary Kemmerer (1910) found six major panics

(1890, 1893, 1899, 1901, 1903, and 1907) plus fifteen minor panics. Modern

authors (e.g. Friedman and Schwartz, 1963; Miron, 1986) also differ on what

episodes constituted banking panics.

   Calomiris and Gorton (1991) have defined a banking panic as an event

involving a significant number of banks are involved.     A run on a single bank

does not constitute a panic, though a panic may involve some but not all banks in

the system.    Furthermore, depositors must suddenly demand redemption for

cash, so protracted withdrawals are ruled out.           The volume of desired

redemptions must be sufficiently large to require banks to suspend convertibility

or act collectively to avoid suspension at the rate of one dollar of debt for one

dollar of cash. In the case of the latter, late nineteenth clearing houses acted to

increased liquidity by accepting member bank assets and issuing clearing house

loan certificates. Table 1 reports Calomiris and Gorton’s list of banking panics

that conform to their definition. During the National Banking Era 1864-1914,

there were four widespread suspensions of convertibility (1873, 1893, 1907,

1914) and six times when clearing houses issued loan certificates (1873, 1884,

1890, 1893, 1907, and 1914). By their definition, one event we consider, 1857,

is a panic, but 1854 is not because it was a local New York phenomenon.

Nevertheless, it is valuable to examine 1854 is well worth examing because it




                                        5
meets their definition at the local level with          many banks experiencing rapid

withdrawals.

Source: Calomiris and Gorton (1991). For the late nineteenth century, Sprague (1910) identified
August 1890, May 1893 and October 1907 as panics. Kemmerer (1910) declared that major
panics occurred in September 1890, May 1893, December 1899, May 1901, March 1903, and
October 1907 with an additional 15 panics between 1893 and 1908.

   Disagreeing about the definition of panics, researchers have also argued

about the origins of panics. It has long been noted that panics tended to occur at

times when the agricultural sector’s demand for money was at a peak in spring

and especially autumn.         The stress this imposed on the banking system is

generally regarded to have been amplified by the structure of reserve

requirements under the National Banking System and later the Federal Reserve,

and the pre-Fed inelastic supply of banknotes. Thus, Friedman and Schwartz

(1963), Miron (1986), and others have argued that panics arose when a shock hit

an already seasonally tight money market.




                                              6
   In the search for some shift in the economy that could induce panics, Gorton

(1988) regressed the deposit to currency ratio on the interest rate and other

panic indicator variables and found that there was no structure change in the

relationship between panic and non-panic periods. He concluded that bank runs

were “systematic” events triggered by changing views of deposit risk rather than

by special events attendant to each panic.           Surveying the effects of

macroeconomic variables on panics, Calomiris and Gorton (1991) concluded that

general macroeconomic disturbances were responsible. They found that during

the National Banking era panics occurred when depositors realized that there

had been an adverse shock but did not know the precise extent or incidence of

the shock among banks. In contrast Donaldson (1992) looked at the interest rate

as an indicator of panic and in weekly data found panic period behavior was

different from non-panic periods.    Unable to predict the exact panic dates,

Donaldson concluded that panics were random draws from a set of possible

events, as suggested by the Diamond and Dybvig (1983) model.          In contrast to

these studies,   this paper finds evidence for both models of panics in the

behavior of the depositors of the Emigrant Industrial Savings Bank.



                  2. The Emigrant Industrial Savings Bank

   Formed to promote thrift among Irish immigrants, the Emigrant Industrial

Savings Bank was chartered as a mutual savings bank in April 1850. The EISB

was an outgrowth of the Irish Emigrant Society, which had been founded by Irish

immigrants in 1840 and had built up a considerable bill business in sending




                                        7
emigrant remittances back to Ireland during the 1840s.       The bank began to

accept deposits at its offices on Chambers Street in Manhattan on September

30, 1850.

       The EISB was the eighth mutual savings bank in New York to be

chartered. The first, the Bank for Savings, was established in 1819. The 1850s

was a period of fairly rapid bank formation, and another eleven savings banks

were chartered during the decade (Olmstead, 1976). The rapid growth of the

EISB’s and New York City mutual savings banks’ accounts and deposits are

shown in Table 2.      However, the leading depository institutions were the

commercial banks. In 1856, there were 56 commercial banks in New York City.

Their individual deposits totalled $66.1 million, and they had issued $8.2 million

in banknotes and held another $20.3 million in deposits of other banks (New York

State, Assembly Document No. 5, 1858). In the same year, the sixteen savings

banks had 132,917 accounts with $28.2 million.       Although the savings banks

were smaller, their depositors were more representative of the general population

of the city, as commercial banks catered primarily to the business community in

this period.

       The EISB’s 4,291 accounts containing $1 million in deposits made it the

seventh largest savings bank in 1856. There were also 23 commercial banks

with individual deposits that exceeded the holdings at the EISB. Thus, the EISB

was a mid-sized institution. It was one of the most accessible savings banks in

New York City in the 1850s, open 42 hours per week when some savings banks

offered only 6 hours (Olmstead, 1976). The size of the EISB’s accounts was fairly




                                        8
typical of savings banks. In 1855, the average deposit account at the EISB had

$224, while the Bowery Savings Bank had $212, the Greenwich Savings Bank

$280, the Bank for Savings $164, and the Seaman’s Savings Bank, $313. The

average for all American savings banks was $196 (Olmstead, 1976). Savings

banks tended to discourage large accounts through discriminatory interest rate

policies. Thus the EISB paid 6 percent on accounts under $500 and 5 percent

on accounts over $500.2 Nevertheless, the bank had many prosperous clients

whose accounts exceeded $500. Some depositors held multiple accounts in one

or more banks to gain higher interest.3 Quite apart from philanthropic bias toward

small savers, bank trustees harbored a distrust of their more prosperous

customers, whom they associated with pressure to make risky investments and

with making heavy withdrawals during panics. Evidence of such behavior was

given by the president of the Bank for Savings, Philip Hone whose numbers

imply that the average size of withdrawals greatly exceeded the average balance

per account in the Panic of 1837 (Olmstead, 1976; Nevins, 1969).

 More established mutual savings banks tended to offer 5 percent up to a maximum balance of
$500 or $1000 and 4 percent thereafter, while newer ones followed the EISB’s pattern of 5 and 6
percent (Olmstead, 1976, p. 37-8).

      The average deposit of $224 in 1855 represented a substantial

accumulation. Goldin and Margo (1992) study of wages paid to civilians by the

U.S. Army is the most comprehensive source of information of wages in the mid-

nineteenth century. They found that the average daily wage for laborers was

$1.08, while artisans were paid $1.43 and clerks $2.35. Wages seem to have

been little different in New York City in 1850.      Lebergott (1964) reported that

unskilled workers received $0.90 per day, carpenters $1.38, and female

domestics $1.05 in addition to room and board.              While depositors held a

significant fraction of annual income in their accounts, not all were accumulating

nest eggs. In about one-third of accounts opened in the bank’s early years the

last withdrawal was smaller than the original deposit, while in another tenth or so

the sum withdrawn was the same as that deposited.           Most accounts were held




                                         10
for a year or two, though some customers who closed their accounts re-opened

them later. The pattern of EISB account holder behavior replicates Alter, Goldin,

and Rotella’s finding's for accounts opened at the Philadelphia Saving Fund

Society in 1850 as “relatively large in size, brief in duration, and inactive” (Alter,

Goldin, and Rotella, 1994, p. 764).

       Dividends—interest on accounts—were credited and compounded on

January 1 and July 1, although they were not paid until the middle of the month.

Deposits of less than $5 received no interest nor did fractions of a dollar. Six

months’ interest was paid on all funds deposited six months prior to January 1 or

July 1, and three months’ interest was paid on all sums deposited after January 1

or July 1 and before October 1 or April 1.        In response, deposits in savings

banks peaked in March, June, September, and December and were low in

January and July (Olmstead, 1976).

       Although its origins were philanthropic, the bank conducted its lending in a

business-like manner.       Its charter limited its investments to invest in state and

municipal bonds, call loans and mortgages. Mortgage loans were permitted for

a maximum of half the value of the collateral. The interest rate on its mortgages

was 7 percent, a limit set by the state usury law.           In 1853, New York granted

savings banks the power to make call loans, loans to brokers collateralized by

stocks and bonds (Olmstead, 1976). The EISB was the first mutual savings bank

to be granted this power in its charter in 1850, and it was a regular lender to

brokers.4 The bank kept relatively little cash on hand in the 1850s. In the crisis

in 1857, the bank held approximately 2.5 percent of its assets in cash.

Afterwards, it tended to keep 5 percent in cash, reaching 7 percent when the Civil

War neared. The EISB preferred to maintain its liquidity with its loans on call

(briefly mixed in 1860-1861 with U.S. securities) that averaged about 15 percent

of its portfolio.   For most of this period, it held very little cash was on hand,

relying instead on liquid funds held in commercial banks for safekeeping, where

they earned interest.

       Most mutual savings banks began with little capital. The trustees, keenly

aware of the need to build up capital to protect depositors achieved this through

the surplus funds.       However, the state legislature apparently regarded the

accumulation of surplus funds by mutuals with suspicion.                    When Albany

threatened to confiscate their surplus funds, some savings banks sent lobbyists

to defeat the proposals (Olmstead, 1976). This threat may thus have kept capital

and capital to asset ratio for the EISB.5 The last column suggests that the bank

built up capital during stable periods, only to see it drop in financial crises.



                                    3. The Panic of 1854

    The panic of 1854 began with news of the failure of the Knickerbocker

Savings Bank, which sparked a run on the other savings banks in the city. The

Knickerbocker’s demise was due to the failure of the bank of issue of the same

name, with which it was closely linked and where a quarter of its deposits were

held. It was the only savings bank to fail in the antebellum era. When its affairs

were finally wound up, the bank paid its depositors 86.5 percent on the dollar

(Olmstead, 1976, p. 142). Other savings banks and banks in the city were

solvent and did not fail during or immediately after the panic.

        The Knickerbocker Savings Bank was apparently manipulated by its

trustees who were also directors of the Knickerbocker Bank. The savings banks’

portfolio was surprisingly weak. The real estate securing its mortgages were

overvalued, and notes held by the savings bank and collateralized by the stock of

the commercial bank were almost a total loss. Little wonder that a report by

special investigator Emerson W. Keyes found that the Knickerbocker “was in fact

little more than a side issue of the bank of discount” (cited in Olmstead, 1976:

142-3).

        The run started on 12 December 1854 on the news that the Knickerbocker

 Surplus is imputed as the difference between total assets and total deposits, and the capital to

Bank had not produced a weekly statement for the New York Clearing House.

On the 13th several of the savings banks were forced to pay out “freely”, and on

the following day the Bank for Savings sent $200,000 of their government paper

to Washington for redemption. The news reduced the demand for deposits, and

the Tribune confidently predicted that “a week’s experience” would satisfy even

the most gullible account holders that all was well with the savings banks. On

Monday December 18, the same paper reported that the “senseless” run on the

savings banks had “measurably subsided”, and that “a few days will probably see

the end of it.”

       The consensus in the press was that the banks were solvent and the run

on the savings banks was by uninformed depositors. The city’s newspapers

were unanimous in denouncing the folly of those participating in the run, and

repeatedly urged that the other savings banks were sound. The New York Post

deemed the run on the Bank for Savings “one of the most senseless on record”

and reminded those contemplating withdrawal that they stood to lose the half-

year’s interest they would earn if they waited until the end of the month. The

Tribune explained that “most of the depositors in these institutions [were] easily

excited by rumors, and incapable of discriminating between a perfectly safe

institution like the Chambers Street, Bowery, Greenwich, etc. and such bogus

affairs as the Eighth Avenue concern.” The Tribune declared that the Bank for

Savings had assets of the “highest character” and mortgages “on the choicest

property in this city.”     The Times predicted that the run, which “could have

scarcely have been more uselessly directed so far as savings depositors are

                                              14
concerned ... will soon expend itself.”6

    The Emigrant was not mentioned in these accounts, but it certainly was not

immune from the panic. Between December 11 and December 30, 234 account

holders (about 7 percent of all account holders) closed their accounts.                     No

developments specific to the EISB could have provoked the increased closure of

accounts.     There was no change in the real estate market, and the EISB’s

mortgages were well collateralized.           The only likely source of a shock would

have been from the bond market, as about 25 percent of its assets were held in

state and municipal bonds. Yet, there was little change in the relevant bond

prices between September and December 1854. Prices of New York municipals,

accounting for 90 per cent of the bonds were stable, while Missouri bonds rose.

  A run on the Savings Bank of Baltimore was similarly described as the product of “mischevious
rumors” among depositors that the bank had speculated in Baltimore and Ohio Railroad stock.
Depositors withdrew $160,000 and sold savings books at discount. The run abated when wealthy
businessmen pledged to back the bank (Payne and Davis, 1956, pp. 88-89).

   As seen in Table 2, the panic appears to have slowed down the bank’s rapid

growth since its founding in 1851. The number of accounts and the total deposits

are scarcely higher at the end of 1855 than a year earlier. A more detailed view

of how the panic affected the bank can be seen in Figures 1 to 3. Besides

highlighting the early growth of the EISB and the crises that beset it, they show a

high degree of seasonality in the bank’s business. For example, drafts were



                                              16
subject to much more seasonality than deposits, with two major peaks in January

and July. The striking bi-annual peaks in withdrawals are a reflection of a form of

“coupon-clipping”: a significant number of depositors regularly withdrew interest

payments due without touching the principal.

the number of drafts made on the bank. In December the number of drafts rose

to a new peak of 868. The spike seems to reflect the fact that some depositors

did not empty their accounts but chose to lower their balances. The net loss of

funds in Figure 3 was $25,000 for December, a notable decline in a month when

the bank ordinarily gained funds. The usual post-dividend payment decline in

January and February brought the total net loss to $39,000 or about 5 percent of

its deposits.

                                4. The Panic of 1857

   Although the panic of 1857 was precipitated by the failure of the Ohio Life and

Trust Company, the proximate cause of the panic was the collapse of the market

for speculative western land and railroad securities. This collapse was linked to

the political uncertainty over whether Kansas and Nebraska would become slave

states (Calomiris and Schweikart, 1991). The uncertainty hurt the new Western

railroads, which connected eastern markets with new areas of settlement. In the

spring of 1857, railroads were market favorites; but by late summer, prices fell,

devastating institutions like Ohio Life.

   Closed on August 24, Ohio Life was not an insurance company but a large

bank, whose New York branch took deposits and made margin loans. As the

transfer agent for the state of Ohio, it was a major financial institution in that state

(Van Vleck, 1943).       Moreover, few New York banks could match Ohio Life's

capital of $2 million.    Its failure prompted a drop in the stock market and a

tightening of credit by the banks in New York and other Eastern cities. The

reduction of bank loans to brokers and dealers forced some into bankruptcy,

dumping more securities on the market. At the same time, the rise in bank risk

prompted some noteholders and depositors in New York State to convert their

bank notes and deposits into specie. Country banks began to demand

redemption from city banks. Finding their gold reserves in decline, the city banks

refused to rollover brokers’ debts, forcing more into bankruptcy, depressing bond

prices further.




                                           19
    Between August 22 and September 26, the Clearing House banks---almost all

commercial banks in New York City---saw their deposits fall from $64.2 to $56.9

million and their banknotes from $8.7 to $7.8 million.8 Although their specie

dipped temporarily in the interim, it rose from $10.1 to $13.3 million, managed

largely by the contraction of loans from $120.1 to $107.8 million (Van Vleck,

1943).    While a seasonal contraction was typical, these events in 1857 were

more severe (Temin, 1975). Initially, the public retained some confidence in New

York banks, but it was waning elsewhere. Widespread rejection of notes by

banks created a demand for specie. The panic began when a run on the banks

in Philadelphia led to a partial suspension of specie payments on September 25

and a complete suspension on September 26. Bank runs in Chicago and

elsewhere followed.

    No sooner did news of the suspension in Philadelphia arrived in New York

than depositors began to withdraw deposits. Thus, the New York panic was

initiated on September 26. Attempting to stem the tide of withdrawals, thirteen

New York bank presidents declared that they would not suspend on September

28. But the public turned a deaf ear to their statement.            Banks around the

country began to suspend, drawing down deposits in New York. On October 9,

there were heavy runs on several banks. Deposits in New York banks fell to

$49.7 million and specie dropped to $11.5 million. On the same day the Erie,

Michigan Central, and Illinois Central railroad failed to meet their obligations.

Bank runs continued to drain specie, forcing all banks except the Chemical Bank

to suspend payments on October 14. By that evening of October 14, banks

throughout the country had suspended (Van Vleck, 1943). Deposits and specie

were at their nadir of $42.7 million and $7.8 million at the end of the week,

October 17. The markets began a quick recovery after the suspension, with

stock prices rising quickly. Specie payment was resumed two months later on

December 14.

   According to the newspapers, the panic began with businessmen running on

the banks, suggesting that runs were initiated by more informed depositors. The

New York Herald (October 11 and 13, 1857) declared that “the laboring classes

have shown their wisdom in not being needlessly frightened and the savings

institutions have not been compelled to meet any extraordinary demand from

their depositors.” Early on only the Bowery Savings Bank was hit with a run the

day after the Bowery Bank failed---many depositors “supposed the Bowery Bank

was the Bowery Savings Bank, altogether two entirely distinct establishments.”

As the panic spread, there were runs on other savings banks, and the

newspapers implied that the less informed laboring classes led these runs. The

offices were jammed full with people, waiting the whole day as clerks attempted

to meet the demand for withdrawals.

   The savings banks, and perhaps the EISB in particular received support from

the Catholic Church. Priests reassured their congregations by example. In the

sample described in the next section, there was one bishop and twenty-six

priests with accounts in the bank at the beginning of October 1857. Only six

priests closed their accounts, but they resided upstate, on Long Island, in New




                                      21
Jersey and one in Brooklyn. Their accounts were relatively modest, suggesting

most were personal funds. The Irish American (October 17, 1857) stated “We

understand that in some of the Catholic churches in Brooklyn on Sunday last, the

pastors assured such of their flocks as had deposits in Savings Banks that they

need not be alarmed about them, as these institutions were perfectly safe.” And

the paper then commented: “These institutions are conducted on principles

entirely different from those of banks of issue. The capital of the New York

Savings Banks is generally invested at interest in State and United States stocks,

and mortgages on improved real estate, well secured, and can always be

realized dollar for dollar, provided no extraordinary demands are made on the

Banks by depositors.”

   Figure 1 shows the October 1857 spike in closed accounts that reached 635,

representing twelve percent of the approximately 5400 accounts. The number of

new accounts opened also fell in October and November.           In Figure 2, the

number of drafts rose to 1733, peaking again in January 1858. Meanwhile the

number of deposits made fell below 500.      Similarly, dollar outflows in Figure 3

reached a new peak of $168,000 in October 1857, with deposit inflows remaining

very low for two months. The net outflow of funds from September to November

totaled $144,000, or over 10 percent of total deposits.

   Was the solvency of the EISB in question in 1857? Over 35 percent of the

bank's portfolio were mortgages on New York, mostly New York City, real estate.

As the crisis of 1857 did not concern New York real estate values, these assets

were presumably not in question, especially given that maximum mortgage was




                                        22
only half the value of the property. Between 40 and 45 percent of the bank’s

portfolio was in state and municipal bonds.              In June 1857, the bank held

$647,000 in bonds, of which $364,000 were New York City, Rochester and Troy

bonds. The remaining, $283,000 were bonds of Missouri, Tennessee, North

Carolina, Ohio, Virginia, Kentucky, and Georgia (EISB, Finance Committee).

The bank held no railroad bonds, where the fall in prices was most dramatic.

Valuing the bond portfolio of the EISB is difficult because the securities market

was quite thin. Some bonds, like New York municipals, were not traded for

months at a time.       Furthermore, there is no information on the prices at which

bonds were acquired.         Nevertheless, it appears that the value of the EISB

portfolio fell considerably.    Between August 3 and October 12/13, just before the

banking suspension, its value of the portfolio decreased somewhere by between

11 and 14 percent.9 However, the suspension of payments by the commercial

banks on October 14 not only halted the banking panic, it also buoyed the

market.     Between October 12/14 and the end of the month, the value of the

bank’s portfolio increased by somewhere between 3 and 7 percent. By the end

of November it was up 5 to 16 percent.

    As seen in Table 3, the EISB had a surplus of $69,000 and could have

sustained a 5 percent decline in the value of its assets. The main cause of

concern were not the mortgages where there was no immediate changes, but in

the bond market. Given that the bond portfolio had a book value of $694,000,

an 11 to 14 percent decline in its value would have just wiped out the bank’s

9
  If all New York municipals as much as New York City bonds, the change is 11 percent. If they
fell as much as New York State bonds, the decline was 14 percent. The New York Times and the



                                              23
capital.   It is highly unlikely that the public knew the exact composition of the

EISB’s assets, much less its bond portfolio, but lacking this specific information

the size of the drop in the market did in fact threaten the bank. With asymmetric

information, depositors could have reasonably run on the panic in the days

before the October 14 suspension, even though its position was quickly improved

afterwards. The collapse did some damage to the capital accounts as New York

State and City bonds were sold between the end of September and October,

presumably with some loss as reflected in Table 3.

   To manage the contraction of deposits, the Finance Committee of the bank

cut the bank’s call loans. The margin on these loans was usually 20 percent and

sometimes not even 10 percent, a danger in a volatile market. Just before the

onset of the run, EISB president Robert Dillon obtained a unanimous resolution

from the Finance Committee that:

       In view of the probability that the drafts upon the bank will exceed
       the amount of deposits to the full sum of the stock loans. Resolved:
       The Comptroller is directed in all cases of such loans upon which
       there is now a margin to demand payment, this day, of the amount
       due and not paid tomorrow, that he sell the securities the next day
       (EISB, Finance Committee, Minutes, October 12, 1857).


Call loans that had stood at a high of $281,000 in July 1857, drifting down to

$237,000 by September were slashed to $150,000 in October.                          The net

withdrawal of $111,000 in October was covered by the demand of repayment of

$87,000 of call loans, a drop in cash of $13,000 and the sale of some bonds.

   The 1857 crisis had a different character than the panic of 1854.                     A

nationwide, rather than a local panic, it imparted a shock to the whole financial

system. Banks holding investments directly in the affected investments or having

given credit to investors in securities would have experienced a sharp decline in

their net worth, prompting runs. The better-informed depositors were alarmed by

events in Philadelphia and elsewhere. In contemporary accounts, they began to

withdraw their deposits before less informed bank customers.



                5. Individual Behavior during Banking Panics

   The records of the EISB’s depositors present an embarrassment of riches.

Already in early 1854, over 6,000 accounts had been opened, and by the

beginning of 1857, an additional 7,000 accounts had been created. The bank’s

massive account ledgers have preserved every transaction: every deposit,

dividend and withdrawal. The EISB's test books contain the names, addresses,

and occupations of account holders.            Usually, they also provide data on

nationality, spouses and children, relatives abroad, and the date of arrival in New

York. Written down in the sometimes clear and sometimes unclear hand of the

clerks, these two sources yield a profile of each account holder.

   These data provide a unique opportunity to study individual behavior during

banking panics.    They also present a challenge in the identification of panic

behavior. The traditional image of a banking run is of a long line of all customers

waiting impatiently to close their accounts.    Yet, the runs on the EISB during the

panics of 1854 and 1857 do not conform to this standard picture. Although they

generated lines of anxious depositors, not all accounts were closed.

Furthermore, it appears that the funds flowed out of the bank by an increased




                                         25
number of drafts, suggesting that some individuals drew down on their accounts

but did not close them. In December 1854, drafts rise but they do not peak as do

account closings; the seasonal withdrawal peaks of July 1854 and January 1855

are higher.     In the October 1857 panic, the peak in drafts is higher than July

1857, but it is at the same level as the following January.

        While they may not be a perfect measure of a run, closed accounts

appear to capture much of the panicking activity.             In December 1854, the total

gross outflow of funds totaled $58,000.               The 325 account closings had an

average final balance of $127, implying that they produced an outflow of

$41,275.      For October 1857, the 635 closing accounts had an average final

balance of $168, thus accounting for $106,680 of the $169,000 outflow from the

bank. Similarly in April 1861, closings appear to account for $104,100 of the

$179,000 of outflow.10

        An econometric analysis of the outflow of funds confirms the importance of

account closings.       Augmented Dickey-Fuller unit root tests on closings (CL),

drafts (DR), and outflows (OUT) indicated that these variables were difference

but not level stationary.11 The variables were first differenced and outflows was

regressed on closings and drafts with an AR(6) to account for the seasonality:


(1)      D(OUT) = -0.217 + 0.114D(CL) + 0.065D(DR) + 0.171AR(6)
              (-0.15) (6.67)       (15.1)       (1.96)

   In the absence of data on deposit accounts for 1861, the estimated outflow was found by using
the average of the last balance for 1854 and 1857, although this is probably an underestimate
given the growth in the size of accounts.




                                               26
where the adjusted R-squared was 0.865.                 On average, for the whole period,

each individual closing caused an outflow of $114, while each draft averaged

$65. The coefficient on drafts is more tightly estimated, as the series is less

volatile, as seen in Figures 1 and 2. In ordinary times, the greater swings in

drafts compared to closings led them to account for about half of the changes in

outflows. However, in crisis times, the volume of closings dominated, and as

seen in the evidence about for the panic months, closings accounted for close to

70 percent of the outflows of funds.

     To examine who panicked we analyze closed accounts during the panics of

1854 and 1857, using the data from the account ledgers and test books to

construct profiles of the depositors. Depositors opened accounts for a variety of

motives, with the period of holding an account open varying considerably from a

month to many years. Closure of an account during a panic represented an

abnormally early termination. We use survival analysis to examine the factors

determining the closure of an account. To capture panic behavior, we have

drawn information on the accounts closed during the panics of 1854 and 1857.

The panic of 1854 is defined as having occurred between December 11 and 30.

During this time, 240 accounts were closed. Our data includes the 218 panic

closures for which there was complete data in 1854. Similarly we have 337 panic

closures in 1857, where the panic of 1857 is defined as having happened

between September 28 and October 13. Our control groups consist of a sample

of 485 accounts opened before 1854 and 404 accounts opened after 1856.

11
  The ADF tests on twelve lags for the levels of closings, drafts and outflows were –2.19, -1.07, -
1.32 and for first differences were -4.30, -4.00, -4.18, where the hypothesis of a unit root being



                                                27
Obviously some accounts would have been closed during these periods even if

there had not been a panic, however the number of closures was abnormally

high. To identify the characteristics of individuals who panicked—that is closed

their accounts—between these dates, we have collected data on depositors for

two control groups. The first is a one-in-ten sample of all accounts opened from

the date of the creation of the bank in 1850 to December 31, 1854. It includes

individuals who closed their accounts before the panic and afterwards to capture

“ordinary,” non-panic behavior.          The second control group includes similar

depositors who opened their accounts in 1856 and 1857. Our sample appears to

capture the diversity of account behavior, including representative short- and

long-lived accounts.

   Table 4 provides a summary of most of the basic characteristics of “panicked”

depositors and the control groups. For 1854, the share of men and women in

both groups is similar, but in 1857, the proportions of men and women panicking

differed substantially, with far more women closing their accounts.            Married

individuals and people with one or more children seem to have been at a slightly

higher risk of panic.

   We used a three-way occupational classification of unskilled workers, semi-

skilled workers, and professionals.          The first and last categories were tightly

defined. Individuals identified as unskilled were domestics, servants, laborers,

washerwomen, drivers, porters, factory worker, seamstresses, cartmen, and

waiters. The two occupations that dominated this category were laborers and

domestics. Professionals were gentlemen, land agents, saloonkeepers, lawyers,


rejected at the 1 percent level had a critical value of –3.47.

middle category embraced smiths, coopers, mechanics, farmers, tailors,

ironworkers, masons and clerks. Although a washerwoman or porter might have

eavesdropped on a knowledgeable employer, we consider that the more skilled

the worker, the more likely he or she would be informed of the banking situation

and the less likely to panic. For both men and women, unskilled workers

represented a much higher proportion of depositors closing accounts in the

panics of 1854 and 1857.

   For the foreign born, those in the control group were resident in the United

States for more years on average during both panics. A longer familiarity with the

country may have made more informed depositors. The time in the U.S. is higher

in the later period reflecting the fact that there had been a tidal wave of

immigrants from Ireland in the late 1840s and early 1850s. In terms of nativity,

the Irish, a relatively poor group in New York, were the dominant group of

depositors; and they constituted a higher proportion of the panickers. The

counties of origin were also given for the Irish immigrants, and they were

classified according to the four provinces of Ulster, Connacht, Leinster, and

Munster, roughly the northeast, northwest, southwest, and southeast of the

country. The regions of Leinster and Connacht were the poorer regions. If the

Irish typically represented the poorest and hence least informed, then we would

expect that they would be most likely to panic; and this would be most

pronounced for those from the poorest regions.      In both panics there is some

evidence of this effect in Table 4.



                                       30
   In terms of residence, this summary table shows no easily discernable

patterns at this relatively high level of aggregation, although the regression

analysis shows some districts being especially affected by the panic. By every

measure of banking activity, those closing their accounts in 1854 were markedly

different. They had smaller first deposits, closing balances, total deposits and

fewer deposits and withdrawals. However, the variation was very large as seen

in the standard deviations. Likewise, the large standard deviations in 1857, do

not allow us to say that there were distinct differences between accounts closed

during the panic and others.

   Figures 4 and 5 display the number of accounts closed daily in the panics of

1854 and 1857.      The six-month windows for each panic show their time

dimensions, using the accounts closed in the sample described in Table 4. In

1854, the dramatic collapse of the Knickerbocker prompted a run on the other

savings banks, including the EISB, as seen in Figure 4. However, the continued

and steady payments to depositors allayed depositor fears and gradually the run

tapered off and halted.   In 1857, the number of closed accounts jumps up, but

remains relatively steady though higher until the big run begins on October 10 on

the Bowery Savings Bank, sparking runs on more savings banks. The effects on

the EISB are seen in Figure 5. Closings were then almost entirely halted by the

suspension of payments on October 14.

                            The key question we wish to investigate is what were the characteristics of

                     those depositors who terminated their accounts during the panics compared to

                     those who did not. To analyze the factors affecting the duration of an account,

                     we employ a proportional hazard model with an assumed Weibull distribution, as

                     the data contains observations with both very short and very long durations and

                     there may be some duration dependence (Kiefer, 1988).                        Almost all of our

                     observations represent completed episodes, as information was recorded as late

                     as 1869, resulting in very little right hand censoring.

                            Table 5 presents the estimates for the panicking individuals and the control

group for 1854 described above in three specifications. Banking variables were

important for determining who panicked. The most highly correlated variables

are the amount first deposited, the closing balance and the cumulative deposits.

As this correlation created significant multicollinearity, only the results for the

cumulative deposits are reported, although very similar results were obtained

using alternatively, the first deposit and closing balance. Reflecting wealth and

banking experience, higher cumulative deposits significantly reduced the hazard

of closure, indicating that wealthier, more experienced depositors were less likely

to panic. The magnitude of the effect was the same for all models for both

panics. The total number of transactions over the life of the account captured


                                                                                  33
account activity and banking experience.12 This banking experience reduced the

hazard of closure substantially.

     Banking variables were added to reflect the behavior of the depositors to the

payment of dividends—interest on accounts.                       Closing an account before

dividends were paid could have resulted in a loss of the interest. Funds

deposited before July 1 would earn six months interest by December 31 and

funds deposited after July 1 but before October 1 would earn three months

interest by the end of the year. Dummy variables for opening an account, which

was usually the largest deposit, after July 1 and after October 1 for 1854 and

after July for 1857, were included to identify when depositors would not be at risk

of losing interest. In Table 5, those who did not stand to lose interest 3 or 6

months interest had a surprisingly higher probability of closing their accounts in

the panic.

     The commercial paper rate can be regarded as an indicator of general

economic or financial stress. Typically, the rate had high seasonal and cyclical

component and soared in panics. As the dividends paid on accounts was fixed,

a low commercial paper rate could cause funds to flow into the bank and a high

one could induce funds to depart.                   Closures were quite sensitive to the

commercial paper rate in the month of closure, with higher rates raising the

hazard of closure. Gender appears to have played no role as women appeared

no more likely than men to panic in either panic. Nor did the number of children




12
  Average annual transactions did not capture activity very accurately, as some accounts were
open very briefly for one deposit and then closed, giving the impression of a high rate of activity.

            seem to matter. However, married individuals appear to have been more likely to

            panic, perhaps reflecting extra concern over protection of the family’s nest egg.

                  The effects of occupation on the hazard of closure are less sharp. Unskilled

            workers showed no increased proclivity to close or maintain an account in the


                                                              35
panic of 1854, but professionals had a lower propensity to panic.           Given the

difficulty of accurately classifying many jobs, it may not be surprising that the

unskilled variable is not significant.

   In contrast, the length of residence in the U.S. for the foreign born was

significant. The longer a depositor was in the country, the more familiar he or

she would have been with its customs. In addition, we know from studies of

immigrants (Ferrie, 1994) that years in U.S. could be a proxy for income or

wealth. Each year of residence lowered the hazard of closure in the panic by

four percent.

   Nativity was clearly important. Separating depositors into Irish and non-Irish,

revealed that the Irish had more than a one and half times higher hazard of

closure in 1854, reflecting, we hypothesize, higher poverty and lack of human

capital. This conjecture appears to be borne out further when dummy variables

are used for provinces of origin. All four Irish provinces increase the hazard of

closure significantly compared to non-Irish, but they vary considerably in effect.

Their effects are, in fact ordered, in accordance to what we know (Ó Gráda,

1994) to be the relative income and wealth of the provinces. Coming from the

poorest provinces of Connacht and Munster, increased the hazard of closure

nearly 2 ½ and 3 ½ times, while a depositor from Ulster had a hazard only 59

percent higher, with weaker significance.

   Lastly, we sought to see if geography played a role, if distance mattered or if

there   were    any    concentrations    of    panickers.   To   identify   depositors

geographically, we used the grid pattern of a contemporary New York City Street




                                          36
and Avenue Guide to group addresses. Most of the depositors and population

were concentrated below 14th Street; and in 1854, 64 percent of depositors we

examined were in lower Manhattan. Depositors living in lower Manhattan were

divided according to the grid from section 3C to 6D, which was assigned a

dummy variable, leaving the rest of Manhattan and beyond with a zero.         While

these variables had weak joint significance, there was no indication of increased

hazard of panicking by individual district.

   In the regressions, there is no strong evidence for duration dependence. In

both the more extended specifications, the estimated parameter, p, is

insignificantly different from one indicating that there was no duration

dependence. One caveat for these results concerns the composition of the

control group. In the control group, 205 depositors closed their accounts before

the panic of 1854, while another 161 lasted until after the panic but before the

crisis in 1857. Eight of these depositors closed in that panic and another 118

kept their accounts. If these accounts had special characteristics reflecting their

longevity, their inclusion might be inappropriate. However, their exclusion had no

effect on the results.

   Table 6 reports the three specifications for the Panic of 1857, using the

accounts closed in the panic and the control group, described in Table 4. The

banking variables and the commercial paper rate all affect the probability of

closure similar to 1854, except that the impact of the July variable is lessened, as

might be expected, by the smaller potential loss of interest. Gender, marriage,

children, and location have similar effects. However, while being unskilled again




                                          37
            had no effect, professionals had a high propensity to panic.                           While the

            significance of this variable is low, it is distinctively different from 1854.                The

            nativity factors also appear to be much less important. Being Irish, coming from

            a particular province or years in the U.S. did not affect the probability of panicking

            in 1857, in marked contrast to 1854.

      Estimated separately, it is difficult to compare the relative effects of the

variables in 1854 and 1857. Furthermore, all the contemporary accounts strong

suggest that there was a time dimension in the panic of 1857, being led by

business men and the wealthy who closely followed the panics in other cities.

The New York newspapers were full of information on the situation in

Philadelphia, where the legislature delayed and labored over the potential terms

of a suspension of payments (New York Herald, October 9, 1857) In New York

City in 1857, the commercial banks, whose clientele was primarily businessmen

and professionals at this time, were first to be subjected to a run. The savings

banks, with their much more diversified depositor base, including many middle

class and worker class depositors, were first hit some days later. Moreover, the

panic hit the commercial banks much harder than savings banks, losing 25

percent of deposits compared to just over 10 percent.13 There is reason to

believe it was not pure contagion. The suspension of the Bowery Bank on

October 9, threatened the liquidity of the Bowery Savings Bank which had

$50,000 of its reserves in the commercial bank’s vaults, and a run on the savings

bank ensued (New York Herald October 11, 1857). Given the fierce pressure on

other commercial banks in which savings banks held cash, the run against

savings banks seems less unreasoned.

      Tables 7 and 8 report estimates of the combined panicking and non-panicking

depositors for 1854 and 1857 where the panics are treated as the same

abnormal termination of accounts. Here, the objective is to search out the

     differences in depositor behavior between the panics and any time

 dimensions.      In Table 7, each variable is used, plus an interaction variable to

 identify the effect of that variable for 1854, and an interaction variable of the

 variable times a time trend for the number of days into the panic when the

 account was closed. In Table 8, similar interaction variables were included for

 1857. While the cumulative deposits variable was similar in both tables, the


                                            40
results for the total transactions in 1857 suggest that a high number of

transactions increased the likelihood of panicking in 1857, but this may have

decreased over the course of the panic. In 1854, professionals were less likely

to panic, but their probability of closing their account increased as the panic wore

on. The opposite was true in 1857 when being a professional in 1857 increased

the probability of closing one’s account with the effect declining over the course

of the panic. Being Irish increased the probability of panicking in 1854, but

decreased it in 1857.

   These differences between the two years thus provide some evidence for the

contrasting nature of the two panics. The more sophisticated and more informed

depositors were more likely to panic in 1857 than in 1854.          Furthermore, it

appears that they led the panic. The poorer and less sophisticated joined in the

runs, but it may not have been pure contagion given the declining value of their

bond portfolios and the potential loss of reserves held in the vaults of weakened

commercial banks.

                                   Conclusion

     This paper provides the a detailed microeconomic description of banking

 panics.    What emerges are some features which stand at variance with the

 stylized facts typical of some models of banking panics.   Banking panics were

 not characterized by an immediate mass panic of depositors, and account



                                          42
closings were a modest fraction of all accounts.    Although depositor behavior

clearly changed quite rapidly, there were time dimensions to the panics. Account

closings rise quickly, with distinct jumps in the number per day, often apparently

influenced by news. The heterogeneous behavior of depositors allows us to see

that there were elements of contagion and responses to dramatic news events.

However, while contagion seems to have been present, it does not appear to be

strong enough to drive the panic onwards in 1854, the one panic most likely to

have been driven by pure uninformed contagion.       The panic of 1857 appears

more likely to have been led by business leaders and banking sophisticates

followed by less informed depositors. Uninformed contagion may be present, but

the evidence suggests that the run on the banks was driven by informational

shocks in the face of asymmetric information about the true condition of bank

portfolios.
