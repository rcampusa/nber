Economies respond differently to aggregate shocks that reduce output. While some countries rapidly recover

their pre-crisis trend, others stagnate. Recent studies provide empirical support for a link between aggregate

growth and plant dynamics through its effect on productivity: the entry and exit of firms and the reallocation

of resources from less to more efficient firms explain a relevant part of transitional productivity dynamics.

In this paper we use a stochastic general equilibrium model with heterogeneous firms to study the effect on

aggregate short-run growth of policies that distort the process of birth, growth and death of firms, as well as

the reallocation of resources across economic units. Our findings show that indeed policies that alter plant

dynamics can explain slow recoveries. We also find that output losses associated to delayed recoveries are

large.

1. Introduction

        Why do some countries recover with relative ease from negative shocks while others
suffer considerably? Exogenous shocks like the deterioration in terms of trade, the reduction in
foreign capital flows, and the rise in international interest rates are common to many developing
countries. Although these shocks initially produce a similar fall in economic activity, the recovery
paths in their aftermath differ markedly across countries. This is, for instance, what Bergoeing et
al. (2002) find when they compare the experiences of Mexico and Chile in the 1980s. Being
affected by similar shocks in the onset of the 1980s debt crisis, Chile was able to recover and
“find” a decade that turned out to be lost for Mexico and most of Latin America. Bergoeing et al.
argue that a key element in Chile’s ability to recover was a bankruptcy law that facilitated the
retrenchment of weak firms and creation of stronger companies.

        Recovery processes are intrinsically costly, as they require significant amounts of
resource reallocation. Depending on the type and intensity of shocks, some firms and sectors in
the economy contract while others expand. Labor and capital resources are freed by declining
firms in order to be used by growing ones, but not without difficulty. Resource reallocation
implies adjustment, and this is costly whether it means the adoption of new technologies and
more capital utilization by expanding firms or the shredding of labor and capital, even to the point
of disappearance, by weakening firms. Without this costly process, however, economies would
be unable to resume full economic activity in the aftermath of shocks.

        The main hypothesis of this paper is that slow and costly recoveries are the result of
impediments to the natural process of resource reallocation. Some of these impediments are
inherent to the adjustment process and, thus, can be considered as natural transaction costs (see
Caballero and Hammour 1998a). However, these impediments can also result from government
policy interventions, such as excessive labor protection, directed credit to inefficient sectors,
entry barriers to the establishment of new plants and firms, and burdensome bankruptcy laws. By
reducing the extent of restructuring, these obstacles alter the recovery path that follows aggregate
shocks, inducing the stagnation of economic activity during long periods of time.

        Recent studies have underscored the connection between rigidities and recovery. Prescott
(2002) provides a comprehensive analysis of this link, making clear that this is an important issue
not only for developing countries but also for developed economies. The U.S. depression of the
1930s had many causes, but it is now clear that policy distortions exacerbated the slowdown. For
instance, Cole and Ohanian (1999) argue that labor market regulations stalled the recovery
process in the aftermath of the stock market crash.

         More recently, Germany and Japan, the second and third largest economies in the world,
have experienced their worst recessions since the end of World War II. Germany’s GDP growth
rate has been half as that in the rest of Europe over the last ten years, with the costs of
reunification playing only a limited role in the country’s stagnation. As Broadbent, Schumacher,
and Schels (2004) argue, the subsidized interest rates prevalent in Germany in the 1990s led to
overinvestment and low capital returns. After the European Commissioned dictated in 2001 that
public guarantees for state banks should be eliminated, the interest rates paid by German firms
started to rise, which prompted the need for massive firm restructuring. However, the process has
been slow and painful mostly due to Germany’s sclerotic labor markets and, as result, the
country’s economy has been stagnant in the first years of this decade. Japan’s experience has
been worse. Its economy has barely grown in the last ten years due to a combination of overly



                                                                                                  2
conservative monetary policy and mounting debts by Japanese firms. As Hoshi and Kashyap
(2004), Hayashi and Prescott (2002), and Caballero, Hoshi, and Kashyap (2003) argue, it is not
firms’ debt what explains their inability to recover but the support that Japanese banks have given
to grossly underperforming firms (or “zombies”, as they have come to be known). The life
support given by mostly insolvent Japanese banks to “zombie” firms can only be explained by a
regulatory regime that allows public recapitalization of weak banks and provides overly generous
deposit and even creditor and shareholder insurance. Only the shredding of underperforming
firms could free the financial and other resources needed by profitable firms to grow and lead the
recovery of Japan’s economy.

        Beyond these country-case examples, in Section 2 of the paper we present some cross-
country evidence that there is a negative relationship between the burden of the regulatory
environment and the economy’s ability to recover from shocks. In a sample of 76 countries with
average data for the 1990s, we find that countries that impose heavier restrictions on product and
factor markets (i.e., firm entry, financial transactions, international trade, bankruptcy procedures,
bureaucratic red tape, taxation, and labor markets) suffer from more severe --deep and prolonged-
- recessions. This evidence serves mostly as motivation for the theoretical analysis that is the
focus of the study.

        This paper analyzes how policy-induced rigidities can impair the economy’s ability to
absorb and accommodate shocks, producing a more painful and protracted recovery. This is a
macroeconomic issue, but it can be properly analyzed only from a microeconomic standpoint.
The reason is that policy-induced rigidities affect the dynamics of creation, growth, and
destruction of investment projects and firms in a heterogeneous, idiosyncratic manner, even if the
shocks are common. Depending on each firm’s capital intensity, level of technology, and specific
shocks, policy-induced distortions become relevant for some firms and less so for others in the
face of common adverse conditions. It is this heterogeneity in firms’ responses to shocks what
allows us to discern the mechanisms through which rigidities operate.

         In order to model the link between slow recoveries and rigidities, we extend the work of
Campbell (1998) to allow for policy-induced obstacles to restructuring. Specifically, we develop
a dynamic general equilibrium model of heterogeneous plants subject to aggregate and
idiosyncratic shocks and rigidities. We model these rigidities as subsidies and taxes that change
the relative cost of firm creation, expansion, and survival, thus altering the natural rate of factor
reallocation. We then submit the modeled economy to aggregate shocks and compare the
recovery path of a distorted economy to that of a fully flexible one.

         Ours is a vintage capital model, where different types of capital embody different levels
of technology. As the technological frontier expands, capital that represents less advanced
technologies will tend to be scrapped. Its salvage value can then be used to produce new capital
that embodies the leading-edge technology. In this context, the economy's equilibrium path is
characterized by an ongoing process of resource reallocation. When an exogenous rigidity is
introduced, such as a production subsidy to incumbent firms, the natural process of entry and exit
is muted, reducing the amount of firm restructuring. In this example, the subsidy allows
inefficient plants --which would have otherwise exited-- to stay longer in business, and prevents
new and more technologically advanced plants to appear. This promotes an inefficient allocation
of resources and pushes the economy inside its production possibilities frontier. We believe these
explanations for the lack of recovery and growth apply to a wide range of actual economic
experiences.




                                                                                                   3
         After presenting the model, we simulate two situations representing particular cases of
impediments to reallocation with the purpose of showing how they may affect the economy’s
recovery path. In the first numerical exercise, we compare economies that start off with different
levels of a production subsidy to incumbent firms. We expose these economies to the same
aggregate shock and then compare their recovery paths. Under our benchmark calibration, we
find that an undistorted economy that faces a (one-period) transitory aggregate shock equivalent
to 5% of steady-state per capita GDP loses about 13% of its pre-shock output and completes
restructuring in a period of one quarter. However, in the presence of a similar shock, an economy
that starts off with a 5% (10%) subsidy to incumbents loses 14.2% (14.3%) of initial output with
a restructuring period of 9 (10) quarters.

         In our second exercise, the distortion is a policy response to the aggregate shock. When
an exogenous recession hits the economy, jobs are lost and production units are scrapped. To
reduce the distress associated to these losses, the government intervenes subsidizing incumbents
one period after the shock hits the economy. This intervention is transitory and phased out
gradually, lasting about 3 quarters in the simulation. In this case, an economy that initially
imposes a 3% (6%) subsidy to incumbents loses about 24% (36%) of GDP in present value terms
with a recovery period that lasts 29 (37) periods. The differences in recovery paths with respect to
the fully flexible economy are remarkable, particularly given that we assume that shocks are
short-lived and that there is a single distortion present.

         Our work builds on the firm heterogeneity models pioneered by Jovanovic (1982) and
further extended by Hopenhayn (1992), Ericson and Pakes (1995), and Campbell (1998). This
paper complements the analysis started by Caballero and Hammour (1998a). In a series of papers,
Caballero and Hammour develop a model of inefficient creative destruction, in which
transactional difficulties hamper the process of reallocation. They find that in these economies the
processes of firm creation and destruction are decoupled and their rates are inefficiently low. Our
analysis differs Caballero and Hammour’s in that in our model rigidities are the result of direct
policy interventions. Moreover, we focus on the creation and destruction margins, not attempting
to explain the “scrambling” of production units according to their level of efficiency. Our work
also complements the studies that analyze the level effects of policy distortions in the context of
firm dynamics. Hopenhayn and Rogerson (1993) build a model of firm heterogeneity to study the
effects of a tax on layoffs. They find large employment and welfare effects on the economy’s
stationary equilibrium. Similarly, Restuccia and Rogerson (2003) develop a model of firm
heterogeneity to show that policies that distort the relative prices faced by individual firms can
result in large productivity losses. They use the model to help explain the large differences in
aggregate output per capita across countries. Our model is complementary to these analyses
because, rather than focusing on levels in the steady state, we compare the trajectories of recovery
from shocks as represented by transitional dynamics.

        Finally, our work is also related to the job reallocation and plant dynamics literature.
Davis, Haltiwanger and Schuh (1996) and others have extensively documented the international
evidence on job reallocation. At any given time, and even within the same industry, jobs are
created and destroyed, existing plants expand and contract, new plants start up, and old plants
shut down. Given that developing countries face larger shocks, thus requiring higher levels of
restructuring than industrialized economies, we should then observe higher rates of reallocation in
developing economies. However, the facts documented in the literature show surprisingly similar
rates of job reallocation across countries. One reading of this evidence is that some developing
economies face severe obstacles, whether structural or policy-induced, to reshuffle resources
across production units. Caballero, Engel and Micco (2003) reach a similar conclusion after



                                                                                                  4
comparing the degree of labor market inflexibility in several Latin American, finding for instance
that Mexico faces more rigidities than Chile.

        The paper is organized as follows. The following section provides some cross-country
empirical support for a link between the regulatory environment and the severity of recessions. In
Section 3 we present a model with heterogeneous plants and policy distortions. We explain the
mechanics of the model and describe its equilibrium solution. In Section 4 we calibrate and
simulate our model economy to quantify the impact of policy distortions on slow recoveries.
Section 5 concludes.


2. Some Empirical Evidence

        Our goal is to understand why some countries suffer to recover from temporary
negative shocks. To this macroeconomic question, we postulate a microeconomic answer
related to the negative effect that distortionary government-imposed regulations have on
firm dynamics. That is, an excessive regulatory environment can weaken the process of
destruction of inefficient investment projects and the adoption of improved technologies.
Given the crucial role that regulations play in our explanation, a necessary first-step is to
examine whether the regulatory environment is in practice related to the severity of
recessions. Here we illustrate the relevance of this relationship from a cross-country
perspective.

        The regulatory environment affects the entry, growth, and exit of firms and
investment projects. According to this criterion we can identify and attempt to measure
the most relevant aspects of the regulatory regime. Using a variety of cross-country
sources, we collected comparable data on the following types of government-imposed
regulations in each country for the 1990s: financial restrictions, trade barriers, firm entry
costs, inefficient bankruptcy procedures, bureaucratic red tape, tax burden, and labor
regulations.1 Given that our purpose here is to illustrate the regulatory regime’s overall,
reduced-form effect, we combine these regulation measures into a single index.
Specifically, we first standardize the indicators to range between 0 and 1 --where a higher
number indicates a heavier burden of the corresponding regulation--, and then we average
them out to obtain a single index. Our sample consists of 76 countries, representing all
major regions of the world. To get a sense for the prevalence of regulations across
regions, Figure 1 presents the median of the regulatory index for various groups of
countries. We can discern three levels of regulatory burden. Sub-Saharan Africa (AFR),
the Middle East and North Africa (MNA), Latin America (LAC), and South Asia (SAS)
have the highest level of regulatory burden. East Asia and Pacific (EAP) is in the middle
of the range, and industrialized countries (INL) show the lowest level of overall
regulations.2

 We should note that this pattern is not homogeneous across types of regulations. For instance,
contrary to the overall index, industrialized countries have the highest burden of taxation.


                                                                                                5
        The dependent variable in our analysis is the severity of recessions. There is no
standard measure in the literature for this concept, but here we propose a simple
indicator. It captures the extent of downward output deviations from trend for each
country during a given period. We first obtain output-gap series by detrending each
country’s (log) of per-capita GDP, using annual data for the period 1960-2000. The
detrending procedure is conducted using the band-pass filter of Baxter and King (1999)
on a country-by-country basis. We then identify and select only output gaps below trend.
Finally, the severity-of-recessions indicator for each country results from adding up its
recessionary gaps during the period 1990-2000.

        The scatter plot in Figure 2 represents the simple relationship between the
regulation index and the severity of recessions. Confirming our priors, stronger
regulations are related to more severe recessions, with a correlation coefficient of 0.36.
A more formal evaluation of the connection between our variables of interest should take
into account the additional determinants of the severity of recessions. In particular, it is
necessary to control for key shocks that can affect the economy and its downward cycles.
In particular, we consider the possibility that the severity of recessions is not only related
to regulations but also to the volatility of the terms of trade, the volatility of domestic
price inflation, and the degree of real exchange rate overvaluation. The first column of
Table 1 presents the OLS regression results. The estimated coefficient on the regulation
index is positive and statistically significant.

        The OLS estimation results do not control for the possibility that the regulatory
burden be endogenously determined, along with the severity of recessions. Given that we
are interested in the effect from regulations to recessions, we use an instrumental variable
procedure to isolate the impact of exogenous changes in the regulation index. We select
the instrumental variables from the recent literature on the causes of regulations (see
Botero et al. 2003 and Bolaky and Freund 2004). They are the initial level of per capita
GDP and variables that indicate legal origin (British, French, German, Nordic) and
degree of Western influence in the country. The IV regression results are presented in the
second column of Table 1. Hansen’s J-test of over-identifying restrictions cannot reject
the null hypothesis that the instruments are not correlated with the regression residual.
Moreover, the instruments have a large explanatory power over the regulatory index
(R2=0.74). Together, these results indicate that the instruments are valid and relevant.
Interestingly, the IV estimated coefficient on the regulation index is quite close to its
OLS counterpart in terms of sign, size, and statistical significance.

        We can use the IV results to gauge a sense for the economic significance of the
effect of regulations on the severity of recessions. A simple exercise is to measure the
impact of reducing the regulation index from the heaviest to the least regulated regions.
In particular, consider reducing the regulation index from that of a typical or median
country in Africa, Middle East, Latin America, and South Asia (0.51) to that of the
median in developed countries (0.28). Using the IV point estimate for the coefficient on
the regulation index (0.1), this reduction in the regulatory burden leads to lessening the
severity of recessions by 2.3 percentage points, which represents almost 30% of the
typical loss due to recessions in developing countries.



                                                                                            6
3. A Theory of Plant Selection

        We develop a general equilibrium model of heterogeneous production units or
“plants”, vintage capital, and common and idiosyncratic shocks, based on Hopenhayn
(1992) and Campbell (1998). Assume that there exists a distribution of plants
characterized by different levels of productivity. In each period, plant managers decide
whether to exit or stay in business. If a plant stays, the manager must decide how much
labor to hire. If the plant exits, it is worth a sell-off value. New technologies are
developed every period. Plants face three types of productivity shocks: an aggregate
shock common to all plants, an idiosyncratic (plant-specific) shock, and an innovation to
the leading-edge production technology.

        In this context, the economy is characterized by an ongoing process of plant entry
and exit, with the corresponding job creation and destruction. Plants exit if aggregate
economic prospects loom negative. They may also exit if their current technology
becomes obsolete and, by selling their capital off, owners gain access to the leading-edge
technology –Schumpeter’s process of creative destruction. However, exiting is costly as
capital loses some of its value in the process. These investment irreversibilities, as
modeled by Caballero and Engel (1999), combined with idiosyncratic uncertainty,
generate an equilibrium solution where plant owners rationally delay their exit decisions.

        Our model extends Campbell’s (1998) analysis in three dimensions. First, by
fully characterizing plant level dynamics, we consider starting and closing plants, as well
as incumbents. This allows us to look not only at plant entry and exit but also at labor
creation and destruction resulting from continuing plants.

         Second, we consider both aggregate and idiosyncratic productivity shocks. Within
this setting, plants can become more productive over time for two reasons: either they are
all exposed to better methods of production or some receive a good realization of
productivity improvement while others do not. The distinction is relevant since these
non-mutually exclusive ways of increasing productivity have different implications. In
particular, while aggregate productivity changes are unbounded and do not necessarily
entail substantial worker displacement, the increase in efficiency resulting from specific
shocks is bounded by the production possibilities frontier and may involve significant
reallocation of inputs across firms. Moreover, while the former predicts a negative
correlation between entry and exit of plants (and corresponding labor creation and
destruction), the latter implies positive comovement between them.

        Finally, we extend Campbell’s model to allow for exogenously imposed rigidities.
In particular, we study the effect of policies that alter firms’ decisions to leave or stay in
the market. In our benchmark simulations, markets are fully flexible. Thus policies that
alter the equilibrium reduce welfare. In particular, policies that subsidize incumbents
reduce the reallocation of resources that naturally follows a recession, delaying recovery.
Governments are willing to impose such policies to reduce the volatility and short run



                                                                                            7
social and political costs associated to recessions. Our simulation results below are
consistent with this fact: as the reallocation process is muted, incumbent protection
reduces short run output losses at the cost of a slow recovery.

         In order to better relate our model to the existing micro dynamics literature, we
refer to production units as “plants”. We should make clear, however, that we do not
provide a theory of the firm or the plant. In our model the size of the firm as a collection
of production units is indeterminate, and, therefore, the modeled entry-exit dynamics can
occur either within or across actual firms or plants. Nevertheless, to the extent that firm
or plant activities tend to consist of interrelated production units (or investment projects),
we expect that there is considerable correlation between production dynamics in the
model and plant dynamics in reality. Moreover, we conjecture that the magnitude of
entry and exit implicit in the model is an upper bound of those in reality. We come back
to this point when we discuss the parameterization of the model.

        The gap between the definition of production units in the model and in the data
implies that our model abstracts from reality in other dimensions that are also relevant for
the specification of parameters as well as for the interpretation of our results. On the one
hand, only new plants invest. In the data investment is carried out by both new and old
plants. On the other hand, plants may adopt new technologies without actually closing.

        In what follows we describe our model in detail.

       The model economy: The economy is populated by a continuum of
heterogeneous plants. A plant needs labor (n) and capital (k) for production of the unique
good, which can be used for consumption or investment. This unique production good is
the numeraire.

Each plant's technology is given by

                                                             1 −α

                                               t  e t kt 


where λt is the aggregate productivity shock common to all establishments and θt is the
idiosyncratic productivity shock. The aggregate productivity shock follows an AR(1)
process described by

                            λt +1 = ρ λ λt + ε tλ+1, ε tλ+1 ~ N 0, σ λ2 
                                                                          

N(⋅) is the normal distribution, 0 ≤ ρλ ≤ 1, and ε tλ is i.i.d.

        Each type of capital embodies different levels of technology. Since technologies
are characterized by constant returns to scale, we can restrict the size of all plants to be
equal to one unit of capital. Thus, capital goods are identified with plants so that
investing one unit of the aggregate good yields a unit mass of plants.


                                                                                            8

where θ t is the endogenous cut-off level of productivity that determines the exit decision
of plants. Units of the production goods not consumed -- which are made up of
investment and part of last period’s scrapped capital --, are transformed into new units of
capital embodied with the leading edge technology. That is, the initial productivity level
                                                                                             (
of a plant born in period t is a random variable with a normal distribution θt +1 ~ N z t , σ 2 ,)
where zt is the index of embodied technology that represents the leading edge production
process. This random variable follows a random walk with a positive drift µz according to

                                                                                (
                                       zt +1 = µ z + zt + ε tz+1, ε tz+1 ~ N 0, σ z2 .   )
This drift is the only source of long-run aggregate growth in our economy.

        Capital that is not scrapped receives an idiosyncratic shock to its productivity
level before next period production process starts, according to

                                                                         (
                                  θ t +1 = θ t + ε tθ+1 , ε tθ+1 ~ N 0, σ θ2    )
        This idiosyncratic shock has zero mean and thus, it does not affect the economy´s
long-run growth rate. The random walk property of the stochastic process ensures that the
differences in average productivity across units of capital persist over time. Thus, at any
t, the units of capital with more advanced technology have a lower probability of shutting
down.

       Summarizing, there are three sources of uncertainty: First, an idiosyncratic
productivity shock, eθt , that determines the plant level decisions of incumbents. This


                                                                                                 9
shock does not alter the aggregate equilibrium allocation. Second, an idiosyncratic
productivity shock, εtz , that governs the economy wide growth. Notice that plants, as
they decide to stay or leave, choose between the following distributions:

                                                          (
                                             θ t +1 ~ N θ t , σ θ2   )
                                                          (
                                              θt +1 ~ N z t , σ 2    )
        Finally, an aggregate shock, etλ , that introduces aggregate uncertainty, moving
transitorily the economy´s production possibility frontier.

        Plants last one period. At the beginning of the period, firms decide production and
hiring. The wage rate in period t is ωt , and the beginning and end of period prices of a
plant with productivity θt are qt0 (θ t ) and q1t (θ t ) , respectively. Within this setting, given
the number of units of capital with productivity θt, kt (θ t ) , the employment assigned to
each plant is given by

                                            nt (θt ) = N tα eθ t / K t



       After production, firms decide which plants should be scrapped and which ones
should be maintained in business. Firms sell their production and salvaged capital to the
consumer and to a construction firm that produces capital embodying the leading edge
technology.

        Capital evolves according to the law of motion

        Since asset prices equal discounted expected dividend streams, increases in the
level of productivity raise these prices; and since the scrap value of a plant is independent
of its productivity, only plants with productivity level below the threshold θ t exit the
market. The marginal plant, that is, the one with productivity level θ t , has a market value
given by the scrap value. The following equation states this condition.

                                                       s = q1t (θ t )

      Finally, the purchasing price of a unit of capital is determined not only by its
marginal productivity but also by the price at which the capital left after depreciation may


                                                                                                10
be sold at the end of the period. Thus, for each θt, the purchase and sale decisions of
capital units must be characterized by the zero profit condition:

where 1{⋅} is an indicator function that equals one if its argument is true and zero
otherwise. This condition restricts the beginning of period price to be the return from
using the capital plus the price at which it can be sold at the end of the period.

        There is a construction firm whose sole purpose is to incorporate the leading edge
technology into the goods produced by the firm. A construction firm which buys I tc units
of the aggregate good from the producer incorporates the leading edge technology at zero
cost, and then sells it to consumers at the end of the period at a price per unit q1i
                                                                                   t . Profit
maximization requires the price of the construction project to be equal to the cost of
inputs. That is,

                                                      q1t i = 1 .

        Government subsidies - or taxes -, τt , follow an AR(1) process as the one
described for the aggregate productivity shock, λt. We consider policies that allow plants
to stay longer in the market than they would have without government intervention. We
represent them by a subsidy to incumbents that increases the end of period price of an old
plant. The government´s budget constraint is guaranteed to be satisfied by imposing a
lump-sum transfer to consumers.

        The remainder of the model is standard. There is a continuum of identical
infinitely lived consumers who own labor and equity. Their preferences are given by


                                        ∞                             

where ct and 1 - nt are consumption and leisure respectively, and β ∈ (0,1) is the
subjective time discount factor. Every period consumers have a time endowment equal to
1. Following Hansen (1985) and Rogerson (1988), we assume that consumers can work a
fixed number of hours or none at all. To avoid non-convexities, consumers are assumed
to trade employment lotteries. As a consequence, nt is interpreted as the fraction of the
population that works.

4. A Numerical Evaluation

       We simulate the transitional path that follows aggregate productivity shocks. We
study slow recoveries resulting from distortions that alter plants dynamics. Although
these distortions may take various forms, we model a specific policy that subsidizes
incumbents. Plants that would have exited after the shock stay longer in the market when
the subsidy is positive. To approximate actual experiences we simulate equilibria for a
range of policy values.


Solution method

        To solve for the numerical equilibria we use a three-step strategy. First, we
compute the non-stochastic steady state values for the model variables. Second, we
linearize the system of equations that characterize the solution around the long-run values
of the variables. Third, we apply the method of undetermined coefficients described in
Christiano (1998). To solve the model we scale the variables by the long-run growth rate
such that they converge to a steady state. Then, a mapping takes the solution from the
scaled objects solved for in the computations to the unscaled objects of interest.

Parameter values

       We can separate the parameters in three types, given by the following vectors:
aggregate parameters {β, δ , γ , µz, α, s, σ λ, ρ λ } ; plant specific parameters {σ , σ θ } ; and
policy parameters {τ , σ τ , ρτ } .

       The aggregate parameters are calibrated as in a representative firm economy. A
period is one quarter. Long-run growth is given by µz(1-α)/α, which also represents the
growth rate of income per capita since population is stationary. Thus, to have an annual
trend growth rate of 2%, and given α equal to 0.6 – a standard value in the literature-, we
use µz equal to 0.52%. The marginal utility of leisure, γ, determines the fraction of
available time allocated to labor. We chose γ consistently with N equal to 0.35. The



                                                                                               13
irreversibility s is fixed in 0.9. The remaining aggregate parameters, β, α, and δ, are
chosen as in the standard growth literature.

        Plant specific parameters are taken from Campbell (1998). There are two reasons
to do so. First, long series of plant level data are generally not available for a large
sample of countries. Second, we see our economies as equal in all respect but policy. We
use the United States as our undistorted long-run benchmark.

        Campbell (1998) sets parameter values to match the moments of plant dynamics
using data from the Annual Survey of Manufactures of the U.S. Department of Census.
Although we refer to production units as plants in our model, investment projects provide
a better description of them. Thus, an entry or an exit in the model might occur within an
actual plant, and thus might not be captured by actual data. In this sense, our model
naturally generates much more dynamics than that observed in the data. Nevertheless, our
parameterization underestimates the true variance of investment projects, as we match
our model's moments using plant level data. Had we used the variability of entry and exit
of projects across and within plants, our results would have assigned a much larger role to
reallocation and restructuring as a source of transitional growth.

        Policy parameters are also complicated to calibrate since comparable series for
plant level distortions are typically not available across countries. Thus, we approximate
different actual experiences by simulating transitional growth using a wide range of
policy values. These distortions are intended to capture different regulations that reduce
competition, raise the costs of firm formation and slow down technological adoption.
They may also represent other impediments to the natural process of reallocation across
firms such as financial markets imperfections. In general, any policy that affects current
and expected productivity, interfering with the natural process of birth, growth, and death
of firms, will have a detrimental effect on aggregate growth. For instance, as the cost of
entering and exiting the economy changes, the distribution of firms is altered: too many
inefficient firms remain in the market and too few efficient firms enter the market. As a
result, both the reshuffling of resources from less to more efficient firms and the adoption
of the leading edge technology are impeded. Our choices for the level of the subsidy
yield a government size between 18.2% and 23.7% in steady state. These figures are at
ranges within the lower bound of the distribution of actual government shares in GDP
(OECD 2003).

       Finally, the remaining parameters, σλ, ρλ, στ and ρτ, are picked along with our
simulation exercises; i.e., they are used to fix the size and persistence of the shocks
imposed on our simulated economies. Table 2 summarizes our parameter choices.


Simulating transitional growth

       Our benchmark equilibrium is given by an economy without distortions that faces
an exogenous 5% reduction in its aggregate productivity level (i.e., σλ=-0.05). This shock




                                                                                         14
has no persistence (i.e., ρλ=0), and thus it lasts only one period. We make the latter
assumption to abstract from the intertemporal effects of the shock.

        Figure 3 shows the impulse responses for four key macroeconomic elements of
the benchmark equilibrium: output, consumption, investment and hours worked. We see
that, as expected, a negative aggregate shock to productivity reduces all of them. These
impulse responses are consistent with those observed in a representative firm economy. A
model with plant heterogeneity introduces and additional margin by allowing entry and
exit and reshuffling of resources across existing plants. These reallocation effects are
relevant for aggregate productivity dynamics. Figures 4 and 5 show impulse responses
for the cut-off level of productivity that determines endogenous exit decisions, and job
creation and destruction rates, respectively. A one period reduction in the level of
aggregate productivity increases the cut-off level of productivity since it forces relatively
inefficient plants to exit. Moreover, job creation falls and job destruction increases. The
aggregate labor response is the net result of these two margins of adjustment.

        To study differences in recovery paths we analyze two particular cases of
impediments to reallocation that might shed light on actual differences in recovery paths.
In the first numerical exercise, we compare economies that start-off with different levels
of a production subsidy to incumbent firms. We then expose these economies to the same
5% aggregate shock, and compare their recovery paths to their own trend. The second
exercise simulates an economy with no distortions that imposes a transitory subsidy to
incumbents a period after the aggregate shock occurs. When the exogenous recession hits
the economy, jobs are lost and production units are scrapped. To reduce the distress
associated to these losses, the government intervenes subsidizing incumbents one period
after the shock hits the economy. This policy is short lived, as it follows an AR(1) with
autocorrelation coefficient of 0.66; that is, it lasts about 3 quarters.3

        Figure 6 shows the recovery path for our first exercise. The trend has been
normalized to one in both economies. Initially, the economy that protects incumbents
experiments a smaller fall in output. This is precisely why this type of policies are
typically implemented: to reduce volatility. Over time, however, the protected economy
experiments a slow recovery. The results are similar in the second exercise. Figure 7
shows the recovery path in this case. As before, the economy that subsidizes existing
plants experiences stagnating growth and recovers its pre crisis output trend level much
later.

        To measure the differences in the recovery paths of the undistorted and distorted
economies, we provide two types of indicators. The first type relates to the size of output
losses, whereas the second to the time that output takes to recover its long-run trend.

        To construct the first indicator (from now on, the loss), we start by normalizing
the path of output and its trend in such a way that all economies start off with the same
level of output; that is, GDP per capita and its trend at time t = 0 are all equal to 1. We do
3
  Our exercise is highly stylized since the endogeneous policy response is more likely to happen
in reality when aggregate shocks are persistent.


                                                                                             15
this to account for the fact that distorted economies have lower output in steady state. Let
Yτt represent the actual GDP of the economy with distortion at level τ in period t, and let
YTτt be its trend. Thus, the loss is the present value of output deviations from its trend as
a fraction of pre-shock output:


                                                  T
                                                     t τ      τ
                                                  ∑ β (Yt − YTt )
                                                 t =0
                                                           Y0τ

       We use two sets of recovery length indicators. The first one measures the time it
takes the economy to recover its trend after the economy is struck by the exogenous
aggregate shock. The second indicator is the fraction of the loss that is realized in a given
number of quarters.

        Table 3 reports these indicators for the simulated economies. The fully flexible
economy loses a significant fraction of its pre-crisis GDP over the recovery path: 13.1%
in present value terms. The economy does not recover instantaneously because there exist
technological rigidities – a scrap value below 1, and a lag between investment decisions
and its availability for production. These rigidities imply that the loss of output is larger
than the actual shock. If the economy is already distorted when the shock strikes, the loss
increases to slightly over 14%. This difference, about a 1% of pre-crisis GDP, is totally
due to reduced reallocation, and thus to lower aggregate TFP growth. Recall that we
measure the loss after normalizing the path of output, so the loss does not incorporate the
fact that the distorted economy is poorer in steady-state. This additional loss is large. The
measured losses associated to the subsidy that is given right after the crisis starts are
much larger (first line of the second panel.) Their larger size is due to the fact that the tax
puts the economy below its trend for a long period of time (see Figure 7).

        The second measure shows that the undistorted economy quickly recovers its
output trend: it takes only 1 quarter to reduce the gap to less than one fifth of a one
percent4. The subsidized economies take 9 and 10 quarters, respectively. The length of
the recovery period increases substantially when the government subsidizes firms right
after the crisis has started, with catch-up periods that rise over 30 quarters. Thus the
policy intervention reduces volatility and firm destruction, at the cost of a long period of
stagnation.

        Our final measure, the fraction of the loss that is realized in 1, 5, 10, 20 and 30
quarters, is reported at the bottom of each panel. Most of the loss is quickly realized in
the fully flexible economy, with over 84% of it happening within the first period.
Subsidized economies spread these losses over time, with 68% to 72% realized within the
first quarter. Only after 10 quarters all three simulated economies behave similarly,
having realized about 95% of the loss. Once again, the differences with the economy that
is intervened during the crisis are striking: only 30% to 46% of the loss is realized within

4
    The size of this lag depends crucially on our one quarter time-to-build assumption.


                                                                                            16
the first quarter, spreading the recovery path over a much longer period of time. The
economy takes about 30 quarters to realize 95% of the loss, i.e., 5 years more than the
undistorted economy.

       Our results show that the costs associated to incumbent protection are substantial,
both in terms of lost output and recovery length. These costs are much larger whenever
the economy is distorted along the recovery path, because within a short period of time,
the economy faces two shocks: the exogenous aggregate shock and the policy response to
the shock. If the government lets the economy adjust on its own, the initial fall in output
is much sharper, but concentrated over a significantly shorter period of time.


5. Conclusions

       In this paper we have linked microeconomic rigidities to aggregate transitional
growth. By subsidizing incumbents, we have altered the reallocation process, a key
source of aggregate efficiency. As plants that would have exited the economy stay longer
in the market, aggregate efficiency lowers and growth stagnates. As a result, economies
experience slow recoveries and large output losses.

        Our findings are consistent with observed recovery paths. The evidence on plant
dynamics across countries is also consistent with our findings. Developing and developed
economies show surprisingly similar rates of job reallocation, although output volatility is
markedly higher in poor countries. This high volatililty suggests the need for higher
restructuring. Thus the evidence is consistent with sluggish restructuring in developing
countries, perhaps as a result of institutional impediments to resource mobility across
production units. Governments are willing to impose these rigidities to reduce the
deepness of recessions and the associated short run social and political costs. However,
reduced volatility comes at the cost of stagnation and increased output losses in the long
run.

        Finally, our results suggest further research on other growth-related issues.
Market oriented reforms have been ubiquitously undertaken during the last two decades.
However, most reforms are implemented sequentially, so when one reform is undertaken
other obstacles to reallocation stay in place. Our results suggest that the benefits from
liberalizing international trade or from privatizing publicly owned firms will be largely
reduced if impediments to plant dynamics are not eliminated simultaneously.

                                                 business is financial corruption in the form of demands for
