                                           ABSTRACT

Using CPS data from 1979-2009 we examine how cyclical downturns and industry-specific demand
shocks affect wage differentials between white non-Hispanic males and women, Hispanics and African-
Americans. Women’s and Hispanics’ relative earnings are harmed by negative shocks, while the earnings
disadvantage of African-Americans may drop with negative shocks. Negative shocks also appear
to increase the earnings disadvantage of bad-looking workers. A theory of job search suggests two
opposite-signed mechanisms that affect these wage differentials. It suggests greater absolute effects
among job-movers, which is verified using the longitudinal component of the CPS.

I. Introduction and History

         For nearly 50 years the measurement of wage differentials between racial and

ethnic groups, and between genders, has been a mainstay of empirical labor economics.

Nearly all of the empirical work has implicitly been grounded in Becker’s (1957) taste-

based approach; and almost the entire oeuvre has either measured cross-section

differentials or considered trends in these “discriminatory” differences. Relative to the

attention paid to cross-section differences and trends in wage effects, remarkably little

attention has been paid to how these differentials vary with the extent of labor-market

tightness. The issue was mentioned only in passing in the first Handbook survey (Cain,

1986) and was not even alluded to in the sequel Handbook survey (Altonji and Blank,

1999).

         A few studies from the 1970s and 1980s did attempt to measure the cyclicality of

discriminatory wage differentials (Ashenfelter, 1970; Freeman, 1973; O’Neill, 1985),

analyzing aggregate time series of the ratio of annual earnings of disadvantaged

compared to other workers. Measured cyclical movements in ratios of earnings per hour

could arise from two distinct mechanisms: changes over the cycle in the characteristics of

the workers in each group (composition effects) and changes over the cycle in pure wage

discrimination. The authors recognized this and pointed to both mechanisms as reasons

for expecting cyclicality in measured discriminatory wage gaps. Discussions of

composition effects pointed to the greater “vulnerability” of women and minorities to

cycle-related job loss, but also noted the tendency for women and minorities to be

employed in more stable, albeit lower-wage, industries. Both O’Neill and Freeman

concluded that composition effects led to a counter-cyclical movement in measured




                                                                                        1
discriminatory wage differentials. Freeman and Ashenfelter offered reasons for

suspecting that true wage discrimination would also be counter-cyclical, with Ashenfelter

referring to an apparently common argument of the time that the perceived cost to

employers of discriminating was higher in tight labor markets. But neither found

empirical evidence of cyclical movements pure wage discrimination.

        Since the mid-1990s, despite the continuing volatility of aggregate and local labor

markets, including the recent turmoil caused by the Great Recession, almost no attention

has been given to relationship between labor market tightness and discriminatory wage

differentials. Numerous studies have used the CPS and other individual level data sets to

study longer-term movements in discriminatory wage differentials, but this literature has

been concerned with secular trends, with almost no mention made of the possible

cyclicality of such differentials.1

        In this study we remedy this neglect. In the next section we document the paths of

wage differentials by gender (female/male), ethnicity (Hispanic/non-Hispanic) and race

(black/white), using the Current Population Survey Merged Outgoing Rotation Groups

(CPS-MORG) from 1979 through 2009. This is a sufficiently long period to cover four

(or five, if one considers the early 1980s recessions as distinct) aggregate cycles. Since

the CPS-MORG files provide individual level data with industry and geographic

identifiers, we can measure more accurately the labor market environment facing each

worker; and the longitudinal component of the CPS-MORG data allows us to go a long

way toward distinguishing changes in measured wage differentials due to changes in pure

wage discrimination from those due to composition effects.

exception to this generalization, although in a very specific context.


                                                                                                 2
       We find that the male-female wage gap is counter-cyclical, that is, the wage

disadvantage faced by women grows when and where unemployment is temporarily

higher. This does not appear to be due to a composition effect, but rather to changes in

pure wage discrimination. The same is true of the wage disadvantage faced by Hispanics.

The measured discriminatory gap for African- Americans, on the other hand, is pro-

cyclical, but this is partly the result of composition effects. In Section III we offer

suggestive evidence of the counter-cyclicality of still another possibly discriminatory

wage differential, one based on looks.

       Section IV sets out a search-theoretic model of discrimination to aid in

interpreting the evidence. We show that a standard random search model with employer

discrimination implies a cost to employers of indulging discriminatory tastes that varies

pro-cyclically, thus providing a formal version of the argument cited by Ashenfelter and

others; but the model also points to other ways that discriminatory wage differentials

might be affected by a changing unemployment to vacancy ratio. The implication of this

model that economic fluctuations will change discriminatory wage differentials through

their impact on the wage changes experienced by job-changers is supported in the data.

II. Data and Evidence—Current Population Survey, 1979-2009

   A. Basic Estimates


       Throughout this section we use the Current Population Survey Merged Outgoing

Rotation Groups beginning 1979, the first year for which they are available. We proxy

wages by reported usual weekly earnings, but we adjust weekly earnings by including a

quadratic in usual weekly hours among the independent variables. We create indicator




                                                                                         3
variables M for female, Hispanic or African-American.2 In addition, throughout we

adjust wages by holding constant for a wide range of CPS covariates, X, including a

vector of indicators of educational attainment, a quadratic in potential experience, and

indicators of marital status, metropolitan location, veteran status and private/public sector

employment. The samples are restricted to wage and salary workers—the self-employed

are excluded, as are members of the armed forces.

        For each year we calculate the unemployment rate U in each state and use that as

the cyclical indicator. We thus estimate:

        Wist = α1Mist + α2Ust + α3MistUst + βXist + νs + τt + εist ,                          (1)

where i denotes an individual, s a state and t a year, and W is the logarithm of weekly

earnings. The νs and τt are state and year fixed effects respectively. While we initially

estimate (1) without either of these vectors, and then include only the state fixed effects

or only the year fixed effects, to save space the tables shown below report results from

regressions that include both vectors. Separate equations are estimated with M

representing females, Hispanics and African-Americans, so that the estimate of α1 + α3U

denotes the wage differential relative to all other workers. The coefficients on U listed in

the Table treat unemployment as a fraction of the labor force.

        When we estimate (1) with the vector of state fixed effects we are implicitly

focusing on temporary variations in the tightness of state labor markets.                           This

specification accounts for the possibility that in certain states unemployment may be

above or below the national average in most or all years (although Marston, 1985,

suggests not). Such long-term differences are arguably related to wage differences (e.g.,

For the later years, when the CPS offers a large variety of racial characteristics, we code as African-
American only those who listed that as their sole racial identification.


                                                                                                      4
Hall, 1970, but going back to Smith, 1776) and may also be correlated, coincidentally or

not, with interstate differences in general attitudes towards various minorities. When we

estimate (1) including the vector of year fixed effects, we are implicitly abstracting from

aggregate cycles. Adding both state and year fixed effects to the regression reduces the

precision in our estimates of the impact of changes in unemployment on discriminatory

wage differentials, but alleviates any bias caused by a correlation between secular

changes in the natural rate of unemployment and secular changes in attitudes towards

women and minorities.

       Table 1 contains the main results of the estimated equations that include the

“minority” indicators.     For the race/ethnicity categories we present the parameter

estimates for the indicator in an equation estimated over the entire sample, and then

separately for males and females in each case. We show only the main effect of the

indicator, the main effect of the state unemployment rate, and their interactions—the

parameters αj—as the estimates of the β are standard.3

       Consider first the results for women. With a mean state unemployment rate of

0.0601 over this period, the wage disadvantage of women, other things equal, averages

about 11 percent. The interaction term is significantly negative—as the unemployment

rate increases the wage disadvantage facing women increases. This effect does not

depend on our inclusion of the state and year fixed effects: The interaction term is

negative and statistically significant even without either one or both of these. Clearly,

measured discrimination against females generally is counter-cyclical.




3
Throughout the estimates are based on equations with observations weighted by the CPS sampling
weights.


                                                                                            5
       Considering next the results in Columns (2)-(4) for Hispanics, we see that

generally the wage disadvantage is around 16 percent, greater for Hispanic males, less for

female Hispanics. The pattern of the Hispanic wage disadvantage is weakly counter-

cyclical, because it is composed of a significantly counter-cyclical effect among Hispanic

men, and a statistically insignificant pro-cyclical effect among Hispanic women. Unlike

women generally, these effects do depend upon whether the vectors of state and year

fixed effects are included in the estimates. When these are excluded the interaction terms

for Hispanics generally, and for Hispanic women, are positive and statistically

significant, with most of the change resulting from the exclusion of the state fixed effects.

Because of the concentration of Hispanics in a few, high-unemployment states, we

believe that excluding the vector of state indicators is incorrect.

       The final three columns of Table 1 present the results for all African-Americans

and for African-American men and women separately. The wage disadvantage overall

averages about 10 percent, somewhat more among men. More important, the interaction

terms are positive and statistically significant for the whole sample and among men and

women separately. The results among African-American women are unchanged whether

we include the vector of state fixed effects, the vector of year fixed effects, or neither. If

these vectors are excluded, however, the interactions for the entire sample, and the

sample of men only, remain positive but lose their statistical significance.

       The impacts of a typical recession vary sharply across the gender/race/ethnic

groups, with the biggest effect among women. For them an increase of 4.7 percentage-

points in average unemployment (which occurred in the Great Recession) increases their

wage disadvantage by nearly 5 percentage points; among Hispanics the effect is tiny—an




                                                                                            6
increase in their wage disadvantage of less than 1 percentage point, while among African-

Americans this severe a recession reduces their wage disadvantage by about 1.5

percentage points.

       B. Extensions


            The samples include many workers who may be insulated from cyclical shocks.

The wages of junior and less educated workers may be more responsive to changes in

labor-market conditions than those of their seniors and of workers with greater

educational attainment.4 Since wages of these workers are more responsive, perhaps the

responsiveness of the discriminatory wage differentials among them, those more likely to

be newly hired or to face a seniority-based layoff, is greater too. To examine this

possibility we restrict the samples to workers who have not completed a college

education and who have five or fewer years of potential labor-market experience. The

results of the estimates based on these restricted samples are presented in Table 2 in the

same format as in Table 1.

            The results for women in Table 2 are qualitatively identical to those in Table 1.

For this restricted sample of younger and less educated women, the female wage

disadvantage increases with rises in unemployment.5 The estimates of the interaction

terms among Hispanics do, however, change compared to those for the entire sample,

becoming more positive (a smaller wage disadvantage with rising unemployment).

Indeed, for this inexperienced group of workers there is no evidence of any statistically

significant cyclical variation in the wage disadvantage of Hispanics. Among African-

 The result is unchanged when we delete the vector of state fixed effects, the vector of year fixed effects, or
both.


                                                                                                             7
Americans the wage disadvantage in this restricted sample varies more negatively with

rising unemployment than in the entire sample, so that there is essentially no cyclicality

in it. The absence of any cyclical variation among African-Americans generally is

comprised of a statistically insignificant negative relationship among men, and a

significant positive relationship among women.

       The results thus far have been based on samples covering thirty-one years. Given

the documented changes in the labor markets for members of all three “minorities,”

perhaps the extent of cyclical variation in their wages over this period changed too. To

examine this possibility we first divide the entire sample period into two parts, 1980-92

and 1993-2009 (each thus comprising two aggregate business cycles) and re-estimate the

equations over the entire sample and the samples of men and women.

       The estimates over these two sub-periods are shown in Table 3. Among women

the results in the earlier sub-period are the same as before—apparently increasing

discrimination as unemployment increases; but in the later sub-period the results reverse,

with apparent discrimination falling as unemployment increases. Among Hispanics the

estimates are consistent with those in Table 1, and perhaps even stronger, showing that

for the entire group and among men and women separately, the wage disadvantage

increases as unemployment increases. Lastly, among African-Americans the estimates

suggest a roughly similar conclusion as those for the entire sample—that the wage

disadvantage declines when the unemployment rate rises.

       The cyclicality of wage differentials measured in the regressions reported thus far

could arise from both cyclicality in pure wage discrimination and from unemployment-

related changes in the unobservable characteristics of the sample of employed workers—




                                                                                        8
a composition effect in the unobservables. The short longitudinal structure of the CPS-

MORG, in which many households are interviewed twice at a one-year interval, allows

us to examine the co-movement of unemployment rates and discriminatory wage

differentials in a group of workers of constant composition, thus eliminating even these

composition effects. This analysis thus controls for possible interactions between a wide

range of unobservable individual characteristics with the unemployment rate.

            Table 4 presents the results of regressions in which the sample is restricted to

observations that had positive earnings in both months 4 and 8 (one year apart) of their

participation in the CPS and which include person fixed effects, so that state fixed effects

are implicit in the estimation.6 We present estimates for the entire sample period and then

separately for the two sub-periods. Essentially we difference (1) so that the dependent

variable is the change in log-earnings, and the only independent variables are M, the

change in the state unemployment rate, their interaction, and linear terms in experience

and current and year-lagged weekly hours.

            The results for women are unambiguous—for the whole sample and the two sub-

periods the wage disadvantage of women grows when and where unemployment is

temporarily higher, just as it did in the cross sections. Thus, the positive relationship

between the unemployment rate and the wage disadvantage faced by women would seem

to be the result of cyclical movements in pure wage discrimination. Table 4 even shows

that the apparent reversal of sign of the relationship between unemployment and the

male-female wage gap during the latter half of our sample period was due to a change in

the impact of unobservable, unemployment-related composition effects on the measured

    This arises because of the household basis of the CPS.



                                                                                          9
gap rather than a change in the cyclicality of wage discrimination. This observation

would seem to be consistent with Mulligan and Rubinstein’s (2008) finding that the

nature of selection into the female labor force changed between the 1970s and the 1990s.

       The estimates also show that the relatively weak positive relationship between

unemployment and the wage disadvantage facing Hispanics in the cross-section becomes

considerably stronger when composition effects arising from unobservables are removed.

Hispanic workers who keep their jobs as unemployment rises implicitly have increasingly

more desirable unobservable characteristics than do non-Hispanic workers who keep their

jobs. The positive co-movement of the relative wages of African-Americans and

unemployment that we saw in Table 1 diminishes in magnitude and becomes

insignificant when measured in this sample with unchanging unobservable composition.

       While we have carefully accounted for labor-market-wide effects, treating states

as labor markets, we have ignored the job-specific impacts of changes in demand. The

question is whether, given the state’s labor market, the impact of job-specific shocks

mirrors that of a labor-market-wide shock. To examine this we respecify (1) as:

       Wist = α1Mist + α2Ust + α3MistUst + α4ΔHit + α5ΔHitMist + α6ΔHitUst +

       + α7ΔHitMistUst+βXist + + νs + τt + εist ,                                    (2)

where ΔHit is the percentage change in total person-hours worked in the CPS industry

between years t-1 and t.

       We present estimates of the αj in (2) in Table 5 for equations with the seven

specifications of the indicator M. As before, unemployment is treated as fractional, as is

ΔHit. The estimates are trimmed to remove industry/year observations in which the

calculations from the CPS implied an absolute annual change in total person-hours




                                                                                       10
exceeding 50 percent.             This amounts to deleting 2.3 percent of the industry-year

observations, but only 0.1 percent of the individuals in the 1980-2009 samples (as the

extreme fluctuations in industry person-hours are due to small sample sizes in the

particular industries).7

            First, although not shown in the table, the estimates of ∂2W/∂M∂U at the average

ΔH differ only very slightly from the estimates in Table 1 (not surprisingly, given the

lack of correlation between state unemployment rates and annual changes in economy-

wide industry hours worked).                  Thus accounting for industry-specific changes in

employment does not alter the conclusion that the female and Hispanic wage

disadvantages rise as unemployment rises, and the African-American wage disadvantage

falls.

            To answer whether industry-specific shocks affect gender/racial/ethnic wage

differentials in the same way as market-wide shocks, we focus on the estimates of

∂2W/∂M∂ΔH at the average U, shown at the bottom of Table 5. In most cases the sign of

this estimate is opposite that of the interaction term shown in Table 1. Thus among

women we observe the same negative effect on wage differentials of declines in industry

demand that we observed for cyclical labor-market rises in unemployment in Table 1—as

ΔH is more negative, women’s wages fall relative to men’s. Among African-Americans

the same positive effect is observed—as ΔH drops, African-Americans’ wages rise

relatively. The opposite is true for Hispanics: Unusually large drops in industry demand

decrease the relative wages of Hispanics, just as did cyclical increases in unemployment.

A fair conclusion is that the effects of industry-specific are the same as those of cyclical,

market-wide shocks.

    We spliced the series using the overlapping industry definitions in the 2002 CPS.


                                                                                           11
III. Another “Discriminatory” Dimension—Looks

       There is by now a wide array of studies demonstrating that, other things equal,

worse-looking workers of both sexes earn less than their better-looking peers, both

generally and within a wide array of occupations (summarized in Hamermesh, 2011,

Chapters 3 and 4). As another illustration of the cyclical variation in “discriminatory”

wage differences, we can combine evidence from two studies of the earnings of attorneys

to examine cyclicality in the pay penalty for bad looks. In Biddle and Hamermesh (1998)

we examined twelve cohorts of graduates from a prestigious law school whose earnings

were observed one year, five years and fifteen years post-graduation. The estimated

effects of a one-standard deviation improvement in attorneys’ looks are reproduced in

Table 6. The cohorts of attorneys who entered the labor market for lawyers between

1972 and 1977 faced a growing and significant beauty premium (and ugliness penalty) as

their careers progressed. The earnings of attorneys in the cohorts that graduated between

1982 and 1987 were unaffected by differences in their looks, at least early in their

careers.

       Figure 1 reproduces Rosen’s (1992) graphical description of lifetime earnings

forecasts facing entrants into this labor market at each year of graduation, 1967-1987.

We can compare the earnings that could have been expected by those attorneys who

graduated in the early to mid-1970s to those who graduated in the early to mid-1980s.

Clearly, real and relative earnings were higher in the latter period; and Rosen (1992)

demonstrates that this difference arose from the tighter labor market for attorneys.

Comparing these findings to the results in Table 6 suggests that the impact of looks on

earnings—and the “discriminatory” disadvantage in pay of bad-looking workers—was




                                                                                      12
smaller in the tighter legal labor market of the 1980s than in the looser legal market of the

1970s. The findings for this occupational labor market are similar to those for female and

Hispanic workers, but opposite that for African-American workers.

IV. Modeling Discrimination over the Cycle

       The previous sections have presented compelling evidence that discriminatory

wage gaps are related to labor market tightness, a relationship that shows up even in

analyses of co-movements of wage and unemployment over a year in samples of

unchanging composition. In this section we outline an equilibrium search model intended

to provide some insights into why pure wage discrimination might be related to labor

market tightness, a model that builds on the work of Black (1995) and Rosén (2003). It

contains two types of workers, one of which is subject to employer discrimination in the

labor market. The model explores the intuition that the rising ratio of job seekers to

vacancies during a recession might give employers more scope to indulge discriminatory

tastes, while bringing to light other ways that cyclical fluctuations affect discriminatory

wage differentials. We present enough of the model to make clear the key mechanisms;

an appendix available from the authors contains a complete characterization of the

equilibrium.

       There are two types of worker, type A and type B. Type A workers are favored

and account for a fraction λ of job seekers. Workers search randomly across vacancies

offered by employers. Each potential vacancy is associated with a value of the

discrimination coefficient c, which is distributed across vacancies over a range from zero

to cmax. A vacancy’s discrimination coefficient manifests itself as a tax on the employer




                                                                                          13
who hires a type B worker into the vacancy, but it may influence the wage paid to a type

A worker hired into that vacancy.

        Equations (2) and (3) express the value to a worker of type i of being unemployed

(Ui) versus being employed in a position with discrimination coefficient c (Wi(c)).

rUi = θzi[E(Wi(c) )– Ui], i = A, B                                                    (3)

rWi(c) = wi(c) + s[Ui – Wi(c)]                                                        (4)

In (3) r is the discount rate, θ is the rate at which workers receive job offers, zi is the

probability that the employer will be willing to hire the worker of type i, and E(Wi(c) ) is

the expected value, for worker type i, of being employed, where the expectation is taken

over the distribution of c. In (4) s is an exogenous separation rate, and wi(c) the wage

earned by a type i worker at a job with a discrimination coefficient of c.

        Equations (5) and (6) give the value to the employer of a vacancy and a filled job

as functions of the job’s discrimination coefficient, c.

rV(c) = -k + φy(c)[E(Ji(c) – V(c)]                                                    (5)

rJi(c) = x – wi(c) – ci + s[rV(c) – Ji(c)], i = A, B                                  (6)

In (5) k is the cost of keeping a vacancy open for a period, φ is the rate at which workers

arrive at employers, and y(c) is the probability that the randomly arriving worker will be

acceptable to the employer, which depends on the vacancy’s c value. The expectation in (5)

is taken over the distribution of worker types. In (6) x is the value of a worker’s product,

assumed the same for all workers in all jobs, and ci is equal to zero if a type A worker is

hired, and equal to the vacancy’s discrimination coefficient if a type B worker is hired.

        Because it costs to keep a vacancy open, and there is a foregone surplus from a

filled job, the employer offering a vacancy with a non-zero c faces a tradeoff. Hiring a




                                                                                            14
type B worker has a psychic cost, c, which for some vacancies will be greater than the

equilibrium wage discount for type B workers; but turning the worker away and waiting

for a type A worker to apply generates a cost in terms of k and forgone x that is

proportional to the waiting time.

       Following common practice, we assume that, when a worker meets an employer

in the search process, the wage is determined by a Nash bargaining process, which gives

the worker a share β of the surplus. The potential surplus for an i worker and a c vacancy

is (Wi(c) – Ui) + (Ji(c) – V(c)). Replacing Wi(c) and Ji(c) in this expression with (4) and

(6) yields a wage equation for a type-i worker in a c vacancy:

wi(c) = β(x – ci – rV(c)) + (1 – β)rUi                                                (7)

       Equations (5)-(7) can be used to derive two possible values for a c-vacancy. Let

VAB represent the value of the vacancy if the employer is willing to fill it with either type

of worker, and VA stand for the value of the vacancy if the employer hires only A type

workers. Then:

rVAB(c) = {-k(r+s) + (1 – β)φ[x – (1 – λ)c – λrUA – (1 – λ)rUB]}/(r+s+(1 – β)φ)      (8a)

rVA(c) = {-k(r+s) + (1 – β)φλ[x – rUA]}/(r+s+(1 – β)φλ)       .                      (8b)

Whether a vacancy is segregated or integrated depends on which of these values is

higher, and that depends on the value of c. Setting (8a) equal to (8b) gives a cutoff value

c*, such that vacancies for which c>c* will be filled only with A workers:

c* = {[(r+s)(k+x) + (1 – β)φλ rUA]/[r+s+(1 – β)φλ]} – rUB                            (9)

A higher c* means less discrimination. A higher cost of waiting (k) or a higher value of

production (x) leads to less discrimination, since the cost of discriminating is waiting for

the next worker to come along if a B worker is denied the job.




                                                                                            15
        Let H(c*) be the probability that c<c*, so that zB, the probability that a vacancy

found by a type B worker will be filled by him, is H(c*), while zA = 1. Then (3) and (4)

and the wage equation (7) yield expressions for the value of search for each type of

worker:

rUA = [θβE(x – rV(c))]/(r+s+θβ)                                                              (10a)

rUB = [θβE(x – c – rV(c)|c<c*)H(c*)]/(r+s+θβH(c*)) ,                                         (10b)

where the expectations are over the distribution of c. These equations can be used to

show that UA > UB, which, given the wage equation (7), implies that in equilibrium the B

worker receives a lower wage than the A worker at any employer willing to hire both

types.8 Also, as VAB is declining in c, wages for both A and B workers fall as c increases

up to c*, at which point there is no wage for B workers and the A wage remains constant.

        The arrival rate of workers φ, which is one factor determining the cost to

employers of discrimination, depends on the processes governing the number of

searching workers and the number of vacancies offered. Letting the total number of

workers equal 1, a fraction α of whom are type A, and letting the number unemployed for

type A and type B workers be uA and uB, the change over time in the number unemployed

can be written as duA = s(α – uA) – θuA          and duB = s((1 – α) – uB) – θH(c*)uB . In a

steady state unemployment is constant, so that the steady-state rates of unemployment are

given by:

uA = αs/(s+θ)                                                                                (11a)

uB = (1 – α)s/(s+θH(c*)) .                                                                   (11b)


8
As in Black (1995) and Rosén (2003), the value of search (U) is lower in equilibrium among type B
workers, because they have a longer expected search time before finding a vacancy that will fill. This
weakens their bargaining position when they do find an employer, so they end up with a lower wage.



                                                                                                   16
Group-specific unemployment rates can be found by dividing (11a) and (11b) by α and (1

– α), respectively, leading to the unsurprising result that the unemployment rate for B

type workers will always be higher than the unemployment rate for A type workers. Also,

λ, the share of unemployed workers who are Type A, will always be lower than α, the

share of type A workers in the economy.

        To endogenize the number of vacancies, assume that there are M potential

vacancies that will become actual vacancies if their value is greater than zero. In order to

have an equilibrium in which discriminators can survive long-run entry, we follow Black

(1995) by assuming differences in entrepreneurial ability that are attached to potential

employers. Entrepreneurial ability is represented by a fixed cost that is incurred if a

vacancy is opened (and persists whether it is filled or not). We represent this cost by the

parameter ε, assumed to be distributed uniformly across vacancies on the interval 0 to Rε,

independent of the discrimination coefficient c, which is also assumed to be distributed

uniformly across potential vacancies. The fixed cost parameter appears as a term

subtracted from the value equations (7a) and (7b).

        Potential vacancies will become actual vacancies if:

εj < rVAB(cj, c*) if cj < c*                                                        (12)

εj < rVA( c*)    if cj > c* ,

where j indexes vacancies, each of which has an ε value and a c value. The value of

vacancy equations are function of c* because the value of search Ui, which affects the

value of a vacancy, is a function of c*. The value of a vacancy is a direct function of c

only for employers who integrate. This means that in equilibrium, the number of

vacancies will be:




                                                                                           17
                    c*


v =M/(cmaxRε){∫ rVAB(c,c*)dc + (cmax – c)rVA(c)} .                                    (13)
                0



       With equations for the number of vacancies and the number of unemployed

workers we can characterize the arrival rates θ and φ. As is common in the literature, we

assume a matching function m(uA+uB, v) that describes the number of meetings between

searching workers and vacancies that will occur in a period. The number is increasing in

both vacancies and (because search is random) the total number unemployed. Adding the

conventional assumption that the matching function exhibits constant returns to scale

allows the rate at which a searching worker meets a vacancy to be written as:

θ = m(uA + uB, v)/ (uA + uB) = m(1, v/(uA + uB)) ,                                    (14)

while the rate at which employers see workers showing up at vacancies is:

φ = m(uA + uB, v)/ v = m((uA + uB)/v , 1)      .                                      (15)

       In the context of this model, we represent macroeconomic fluctuations as changes

in the value of x, the value to the firm of a workers’ output. It is possible to differentiate

the equilibrium value of the wage gap with respect to changes in x, but this leads to a

complex and non-transparent expression with an ambiguous sign. The model can,

however, be used to think through the step-by-step impact of a recession on employers,

workers, and market-level variables, thus providing some insight into the sources of this

ambiguity and their possible correspondence to real world phenomena.

       As discussed above, one cost to discriminating is the opportunity cost of the

longer expected wait until an acceptable worker arrives, and this cost falls with a fall in

the value of output. Employers who might not discriminate when the value of output is




                                                                                             18
high will do so when it is low. Thus the model captures the idea that discrimination will

be more costly in a tighter labor market. A greater proportion of discriminating

employers in the labor market lowers the bargaining power of type B workers relative to

type A workers, increasing the wage gap.

       Another immediate impact of a drop in x, however, serves to increase the

bargaining power of type B workers. Other things equal, the fall in the value of workers’

product lowers the perceived value of both filled jobs and vacancies, causing some

vacancies and jobs to be eliminated. But the model suggests that jobs and vacancies that

are closed to type B workers are more likely to disappear. The existence of differing

entrepreneurial ability means that there are marginal positions at every level of c, and

these are the positions (filled or vacant) that disappear when a recession lowers x. There

are, however, more infra-marginal positions at lower values of c. Therefore when x falls

the proportion of positions that disappears is greater at higher values of c. This tends to

lower the share of type-A only vacancies, raising the value of search for type B workers,

and thus raising their bargaining power and wages relative to those of A workers.

        Figure 2 depicts the nature of the equilibrium and illustrates the two initial and

countervailing effects of a recession. On the axes are ε and c, so that potential vacancies

are distributed uniformly over the quadrant. The line labeled V(c) = 0 shows the dividing

line between combinations of c and ε for which vacancies have positive utility (below the

line) and those for which they have negative utility. Positive utility vacancies with c>c*

hire only majority (A) workers; because V(c) declines in c up to c*, some AB (integrated)

vacancies yield a higher surplus than any segregated vacancy. The first impact of a

recession is to lower the value of a vacancy (the shift from V(c) to V(c)’ in the figure) in




                                                                                         19
a way that lowers the level of c*, decreasing the share of positions potentially open to

type B workers, and increasing the wage gap. However, as the figure also shows, the

proportion of segregated positions that disappears is larger than the proportion of

integrated positions that disappear, as a consequences of the fact that there are more

infra-marginal positions at values of c below c*.

       As positions disappear, the rate at which workers arrive at employers rises, but the

rate at which workers find new vacancies drops. As noted above, the higher arrival rate of

workers at vacancies lowers the cost of discriminating, because a faster arrival of the next

worker means less foregone output when a type B worker is turned away. This lowers the

cutoff value of c*, which in turn lowers the value of search for type B workers relative to

type A workers. A similar effect results from disproportionately more type A than type B

workers losing jobs, raising the share of type A workers among the searchers and

lowering the expected waiting time for the next type A applicant for firms who turn away

type B workers. The lower arrival rate of job offers to workers lowers the value of search

for both type A and type B workers, which lowers the wage of both types; but it lowers

the value of search more for type A workers. This decreases the wage gap, but is a rather

subtle, non-intuitive effect, as are the impacts of the many of the subsequent equilibrating

reactions of the model’s variables to the initial events set in motion by a fall in x.

       Although our model leaves open the question of whether discriminatory wage

differentials are pro-cyclical or counter-cyclical, it does identify several distinct

mechanisms     through    which     business-cycle    fluctuations   could    plausibly   alter

discriminatory wage differentials. These include cycle-induced changes in the costs and

benefits of discrimination in hiring and changes in the mix of discriminators vs. non-




                                                                                            20
discriminators in the labor market caused by entry or exit. In addition, our argument

about the process by which cyclical fluctuations in the value of output move wages

towards new equilibrium values suggests that changes in discriminatory wage

differentials associated with aggregate fluctuations will be due to the impact of these

fluctuations on changes in the relative wages received by advantaged vs. disadvantaged

workers who leave one job and search for another, as opposed to their impact on wages

paid to workers continuing in the same job. Indeed, there is no mechanism in the model

through which wages change for workers who do not change employers.

V. Job-Movers vs. Job Stayers

       The short longitudinal structure of the CPS allows us to compare cyclical changes

in gender/racial/ethnic wage differentials between job-movers and job-stayers, thus

providing a test of the model’s implication that changes in unemployment affect wage

gaps through their impact on the wage changes experienced by job changers. The CPS

does not identify employers, so we assume that workers who list the same small industry

of employment in interviews in years t-1 and t are job-stayers, while those who list

different industries are job-movers. Given evidence of substantial reporting error in the

self-classification of industry affiliation (Freeman, 1984), our test will thus underestimate

the differences in effects between job-stayers and job-movers, since some job-stayers are

mistakenly classified as job-movers. Finally, with losses of perhaps 1/3 of the CPS

observations due to an inability to match across the pair of years, and other observations

dropped because individuals enter or leave employment, the sample sizes here are smaller

than those used in the cross-section analyses in Section III, but, of course, the same as in

the analyses reflected in Table 4.




                                                                                          21
       To save space, in Table 7 we present only estimates of the interaction terms

∂2ΔW/∂M∂U and their standard errors from the equations for job-stayers and –movers,

along with what is essentially the triple difference [∂2ΔW/∂M∂U]MOVER –

[∂2ΔW/∂M∂U]STAYER . The evidence in the table supports the model’s predictions. The

relationship between labor-market tightness and the wage disadvantage facing women is

greater in the sample of job-movers than in the sample of job-stayers. Among all

Hispanics and Hispanic men the negative impact of the cycle is also more pronounced

among job-movers; the opposite is true among Hispanic women, but none of these

differences is statistically significant. Remembering from Table 1 that the wage

disadvantage of African-Americans drops significantly when unemployment rises, the

results here suggest that this is due to the behavior of wage changes among job-movers:

Among African-Americans generally, and both men and women, the wage disadvantage

becomes smaller among job-movers as unemployment rises, but varies insignificantly

statistically among job-stayers.

       Not all the differences between job-movers and job-stayers are statistically

significant; but except for Hispanic females the mover-stayer differences demonstrate

that the cyclicality that we observed in the cross section (rising wage disadvantages with

unemployment among women and Hispanics, falling among African-Americans) occurs

especially through the wage changes experienced by job-movers. Remembering that our

method of distinguishing job-movers and stayers necessarily blurs the distinction between

them, these results seem fairly convincing. They suggest that it is through wage-setting

as new implicit contracts are entered into that the market effects of discrimination




                                                                                       22
become felt. Short-run increases in unemployment have less effect on wage differentials

within jobs.

VI. Conclusion and Implications

       We have documented the existence of a relationship between discriminatory wage

differentials and labor market tightness, as measured by either state unemployment rates

or industry-based measures of shifts in labor demand. The evidence that a tighter labor

market leads to a smaller discriminatory wage gap is strongest and most robust when

comparing male and female wages, but the wage disadvantage facing Hispanics also

seems to increase with unemployment. We find some evidence of a negative relationship

between unemployment and the African-American-white wage gap.

       We stress that our findings reflect only changes in pure wage discrimination, as

we have abstracted from changes in composition. They say nothing about the differential

incidence of job loss by gender, ethnicity or race as unemployment rises. However, the

relationships that we uncover do not seem to be due to changes in the characteristics,

either observable or unobservable, of employed workers that are associated with changes

in unemployment rates.

       We develop a search-theoretic model of wage discrimination driven by employer

preferences to explore possible causes for these findings. In the model, the cost to the

employer of discriminating rises with the tightness of the labor market, which lowers the

proportion of discriminators in the market; but recession leads to disproportionately

greater exit by discriminating firms, so that the net effect on the amount of discrimination

in the labor market and the tightness of the labor market is ambiguous.




                                                                                         23
       In the search model, changes in discriminatory wage differences must come

through the wage changes experienced by workers who change jobs, as it includes no

mechanism through which employers change the wages paid to continuing employees.

We do find that the relationship between changes in the unemployment rate and changes

in discriminatory wage differentials is stronger in samples of workers who did change

jobs than in samples of job-stayers. “Discriminatory” wage disadvantages, rising with

unemployment among women and Hispanics, falling among African-Americans, are

observed disproportionally in the wage changes experienced by job-movers. The next

step in re-opening this long-neglected area of study might be to use more detailed sets of

data to infer the differential roles of the mechanisms indicated in our model that generate

cyclical changes in pure wage discrimination and infer why the net effects differ among

the groups we have studied.
