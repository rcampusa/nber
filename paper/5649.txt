        A central feature of the litigation process that affects case outcomes is the selection of cases

for litigation. In this study, we present a theoretical framework for understanding the operation of

this suit selection process and its relationship to the underlying distribution of potential claims and

claimants. We implement the model empirically by assuming that individuals vary more in their


litigiousness (inverse costs of litigation) than do corporations.   This assumption, coupled with the

case selection process we present, yields clear predictions on trial rates as a function of whether the

plaintiff and defendant were individuals or corporations. The model also yields a prediction on the

plaintiff’s win rate in lawsuits as a function of the plaintiff’s identity, Our empirical analysis, using

data on over 200,000 federal civil litigations, yields results that are generally consistent with the

theory. Lawsuits where the plaintiff is an individual are found to have higher trial rates and lower

plaintiff win rates.

1. Introduction


    A rich literature        covers many aspects of suit, settlement,              and trial of civil cases. 1 Yet

almost none of the literature             investigates    the influence    of the process       by which plaintiffs

decide   whether       to file suit on subsequent         events such as trial rates and case outcomes,2

This neglect of the first stage in the suit-settlement-trial               sequence is problematical         because

any complete       model of the post-filing          process ultimately    must take account of the pre-filing

selection   mechanism.        This study demonstrates             the importance      of that mechanism.

    W’e argue that the process through which potential                    claims either result or do not result

in lawsuits has important             influences on expected       trial rates and suit outcomes.       ;Ve present

a framework        for analyzing       this suit selection process,     and we develop specific implications

for trial rates and plaintiff           win rates.     Then we examine       data on over 200,000 ci~-il suits

filed in federal courts between            1986 and 1994, and we find results that are fully consistent

with the implications        of the model and establish the need to account for pre-filing selection

processes    in explaining      post-filing      case outcomes.

    \Ve begin       with a startling        but empirically       sound premise:       people    are not litigious.

Studies of medical malpractice             victims and general household           surveys reveal a surprisingly

nonlitigious      society.   For example,        fewer than ten percent of malpractice           and products     lia-

bility victims initiate legal action (Danzon,               1985; Report     of the Harvard Medical         Practice

   2 Priest & Klein’s ( 1984) analysis of the selection of cases for litigation analyzed which of the lawsuits
filed eventuate in trials, and they derived some clear predictions      regarding case outcomes.   The central
prediction in the limiting cases is that c=es for trial will be selected such that the plaintiff and defendant
win rates will each be 0,5 in tried cases regardless of the average underlying merits of of the overall set of
suits filed. LValdfogel ( 1995) extends this analysis and shows that there can be systematic deviations from
the Priest-Klein   result, Eisenberg (1990) shows that such deviations exist.

substantially      in how costly      they find litigation        and that only those individuals               with low

costs of litigation     file a lawsuit when they feel they have been wronged                        or harmed.     These

costs are interpreted       broadly.      and they include         not only pecuniary            costs and costs due

to risk aversion      but also the psychological          and emotional          costs of confrontation.          Litiga-

tion is confrontational.      emotionally       draining,      uncertain,     and a distraction         from daily life.

Litigation      requires retaining     m agent to manage one’s affairs through                      a complex     system

incomprehensible        to most laymen.         It is almost always an extraordinmy                  event in the lives

of the parties.     N’ot surprisingly,     most people dislike litigation              and avoid engaging in it even

when there is reason to do so.

    In this context,     it is clear that case selection.        the process through which potential               claims

are translated     into lawsuits, depends not only on the monetary                      expected    value of the claim

but also on the non-pecuniary             costs of litigation      (the inverse of the taste for litigiousness)

of the potential      claimant.      The central theme of our analysis is that cases are selected for

suit systematically      on the basis of the tastes for litigiousness                   of the plaintiffs so that the

set of plaintiffs in actual lawsuits are a random draw of neither the general population                               nor

the population       of potential     claims.    Plaintiffs    me drawn from those individuals                  with the

highest taste for litigation         (lowest costs of litigation)       conditional        on the expected       value of

the claim.

    In the next section,      we discuss from a theoretical              perspective        how this selection        from

the lower tail of the plaintiff’s         cost distribution        can have important            implications     for the

out comes of litigation.     Specifically,      we show that, for a fairly general class of distributions

of litigation    costs, increasing       the dispersion       of litigation    costs among potential            plaintiffs

results in a lower average litigation           costs among plaintiffs who actually                  file lawsuits.    It-e

then argue that a property           of any reasonable         model of the litigation          process   is that lower

litigati~il costs will imply higher trial rates. On this basis, we conclude                      that cases filed from

pools of potential      plaintiffs    with greater dispersion          in the distribution          of their litigation

costs will have a higher trial rates. \Ve further argue that reasonable models of the litigation

for other tort victims (He;sler et al,, 1991).
process     will have the property       that plaintiffs       with lower litigation       costs will be willing to

file cases in which they have a smaller probability                   of prevailing    at trial.       Thus, we also

conclude     that cases filed from POOISof potential               plaintiffs   with greater dispersion           in the

distribution     of their litigation    costs will have lower plaintiff win rates.

    lVe implement         our model empirically       using the reasonable       assumption      that the distribu-

tion of litigation       costs for individuals     h= more variation than the distribution                of litigation

costs for corporations.         Individuals    are relatively free to “indulge”        their tastes for litigation

either by refraining        from filing suit where they have a strong case or by filing suit where

they do not have a strong            case.    In contrast,      corporations     me relatively         constrained        by

market forces and adhere more closely                 to the goal of profit maximization.                Corporations

can afford neither to avoid lawsuits that are expected                   to be profitable     nor pursue lawsuits

that are not expected         to be profitable.     Given the greater spread in the distribution                 of indi-

viduals’    litigation    costs, we expect       that cases where the plaintiff is an individual               (relative

to cases where the plaintiff is a corporation)                 to have both a higher trial rate md               a lower

plaintiff win rate.

    Our empirical         analysis   relies on data gathered         from the .~dministrative            Office of the

United States Courts          that contains      information     on federal court case filings and outcomes

including    information      on the identity of the parties (individuals            or corporations).          First \ve

examine      variation     in trial rates by the identity        of the parties.     .Next we examine           how the

time it takes to resolve cases by non-trial            means (drop or settlement)            and the time it takes

to reach trial verdicts        are related to the identity         of the parties.    Finally, we examine            ho~v

plaintiff win rates (both         overall and at trial) are related to the identity of the parties,


2. Theoretical           Framework

    In our view, any plausible model of the litigation process has several properties                           that are

relevant here. First and other things equal. a potential                  claimant will be more likely to file

a lawsuit if the costs of litigation          are low. This follows directly from the presumption                    ~hat

only cases with positive         expected     value to the plaintiff are filed,4 Second,           conditional       on a

claim: e.g., a desire for justice for a perceived wrong.

where litigation      costs me lower. potential         claimants        will be more likely to file claims in

which they have a lower probability            of prevailing.     ‘The intuition for each of these properties

is clear: lower costs of disputing         will lead to more disputes.        Jve build on these observations

in the context      of a simple general framework            to derive our empirical      implications    without

relying on a specific       model of the negotiation          process.

      Consider    the decision of a potential       plaintiff regarding      whether or not to file a lawsuit,

LVithout being specific about the information                structure or timing of the negotiation       process,

the suit has some expected          value to the plaintiff,        Vp,as    a function   of the likelihood      that

the defendant       would    be found      liable at trial ( T), the expected         damages     that would      be

awarded at trial conditional        on a finding of liability (D),          and the costs to the plaintiff and

defendant      ( C’P and C’~ respectively)     of litigation.     The potential     plaintiff will file a lawsuit

if and only if     Vp~ O.
      Nfore   formally,   the expected     value of filing a suit is5

                                                     D,Cp,cd),

The condition       for filing then is




The key properties         of the model      of litigation    are that    Vp is   monotonically    decreasing     in

C’P and monotonically         increasing    in n. The first property         implies that the condition      for a

potential     plaintiff to file a lawsuit can be expressed          as the plaintiff’s    litigation   costs being

less than some threshold        value, C;,     where C; is a function         of r, D, and cd:

This simply expresses         the reasonable       view that the set of lawsuits me selected             from the

lower tail of the distribution       plaintiffs’   costs. other things equal.         It seems reasonable      that

the threshold        cost level will be positively         related to the likelihood       of liability   (~) and the

stakes of the case (D)           so that plaintiffs       with lower litigation        costs will be more likely to

file low r and low ~          cases.    It may be that CP is increasing           in    D, and   this would at least

partially- offset the attractiveness           of high-stakes     cases to potential       plaintiffs.

      Define the distribution          of litigation    costs among potential         plaintiffs as


(4)                                                    Cp=p+uz.

where Z is a random            variable    with mem        zero and variance      one.     The mean of litigation

costs is p, and this may depend               on the size of the case (iT and D).           The parameter      a, is a

scale parameter        which determines        the variance of the litigation cost distribution            (a2 ). This

parameter,        which controls       the dispersion     of plaintiffs” litigation     costs in the population     of

potential       claims without     Meeting      the mean, will play a central role in our analysis.

      The expected       value of litigation      costs conditional      on a case being filed is


(5)                           E(cp/cp< c;)=p+aE(zlP+~z                         < c;)
                                                       =P+uE(ZIZ < (C;–p)/o)
                                                       =p+rYE(ZIZ < Z*),

where


(6)                                               z“=(c; –p)/u

and is the threshold          value expressed          in terms of Z.     Note that this conditional         mean is

less than the mean of the unconditional                 distribution    (p) of costs, so that average litiga~ion

costs among         suits filed ue      lower than average litigation         costs in the set of all potential

claims.

      The central characteristic          of negotiation     models that we rely on is that lower litigation

costs among         filed cases lead to “more trials .6 Based on equations                  5 and 6, this suggests

  6 We use      the conditional  mean (E(CP ICP < C; )) as an obvious measure of the location of the conditional
distribution     of costs, [t is possible to develop theories of the litigation process where low cost cases are
more likely     to go to trial but where the mean of the Iit]gation costs distribution  would not be a sufficient
statistic for    these purposes.
that     the    trial     rate is inversely      related     to the filing threshold,           Z“.    But it is difficult     to

determine         how case and plaintiff              characteristics       affect the filing threshold.       The effects of

the probability            of liability    (m) and the Aue          of darnages (~)        are ambiguous      because,     while

higher probability             of winning      and higher stakes both increase C’;, they also like]Y increase

mean litigation            costs (p).

       lVe can say quite a bit more about the effect of the scale parameter,                           o, on the conditional

mean of litigation             costs.     The derivative       of the conditional         mem     of the cost distribution

with respect            to a is

                             aE(cplcp<          c;)                               8E(ZIZ< Z“)zx

ditional       mean.       However,       the sign of the second put             of the second        term, Z“,    depends     on

whether        the threshold        ~alue of costs ( C’; ) is above or below the mea                    of the cost distribu-

tion (~).

       If the threshold        cost value is at or above the mean of the unconditional                     cost distribution

( C’; ~ v), then Z“ is non-negative                     and an increase in the scale (and, hence, variance j of

the litigation          cost distribution      leads unambiguously             to a reduction     in the conditional      mean

of litigation       costs.     However,       given the premise we started ‘with in the introduction.                        that

people     are not litigious         (so that the rate of filing of lawsuits is generally                 quite low relative

to the pool         of claimable          incidents)     it seems unreasonable            that the threshold         plaint iff ’s

litigation      cost due          is greater than the unconditional               mean.     If the cost distribution       were

s}’mmetric,        then a threshold          above the mean would yield a suit rate greater than 0.5. This

does not accord            with existing      evidence.

      The more reasonable                 case is where C;          < p so that Z* is negative.            Here, if the cost

distribution        is symmetric.          the fact that the threshold is below the mean yields a suit rate

less than 0,5.            But the effect of scale on the conditional                 mean is ambiguous            in this case.

Both terms in equation                7 are negative so that the sign of their difference is indeterminate.

Fortunately,            there is a reasonable         restriction       on the distribution     of Z that is sufficient for

                                                                    6
the needed           result (that an increase in a reduces               the conditional       mean of litigation      costs)

and that is satisfied              by many common            distributions.      Rewrite      equation    7 by subtracting

and adding           Z*.   On rearrangement             of terms, this yields

The first term in brackets is negative by construction.                         A sufficient condition      for the second

term in brackets to be negative is that the density function                         of Z be log-concave.7        Examples

of distributions           satisfying    this condition      are the normal, uniform,           beta, and extreme-value

distributions.          Since Z* is negative           when C; < p, log-concavity             of the distribution     of Z is
                       aE(cp/c’p<c”)
sufficient for                au              <0.

        The conclusion          we draw from this discussion is that. under fairly general conditions,                     an

increase in the scale of the unconditional                   distribution      of plaintiffs” litigation costs results in

a reduction          in average plaintiffs’ litigation costs among lawsuits filed. IVe can operationalize

this by considering              two groups         of potential   litigants who have the same mean litigation

costs but whose             cost distributions          have different   scale parameters,         and, hence.      different

variances.        These two groups seem equally litigious on average, but this is misleading.                            The

process        of selection      of lawsuits from these two pools of potential                  litigants yields pools of

actual litigants           that differ in important          ways. Specifically,      those litigants drawn from the

high-variance          distribution       will have lower litigation          costs, on average, than those litigants

drawn from from the low-wiance                        distribution.

        The central testable implication                of this analysis is that plaintiffs drawn from the high-

variance        distribution       will be more likely to push their cases to a trial verdict (higher                    trial

rate ). This follows directly from the lower average cost of litigation                          among plaintiffs drawn

from the high-vaziance                distribution.

        .4 s,:;ond    testable     implication       is that plaintiffs drawn from the high-variance                distribu-

tion will be less likely to win their lawsuits, either at trial or through a pre-trial settlement.


  7 .% distribution  of some random variable ?( is log concave if the density j satisfies the condition that
~(~zI +(1 – A)z2) ~ [j(zl)]A [j(z2)]l -A. In other words. the logarithm of the density function must be a
concave function.   Heckman and Honore ( 1990) derive the specific result for log-concave distributions used

The heuristic argument            for this is that. where average        litigation costs me lower (as they are

in cases drawn from a pool of potential                plaintiffs with a high variance in the cost distribu-

tion),    lower quality      (lower iT) cases will meet the criterion           for filing ( C’P < C; (r,         D,Cd)).
>Iore formally.         we can write the criterion         for case filing in terms of the probability                        of

liability   as




conditional      on the value of CP, which is known to the potential pltintiff.                     This expression           is

derived     directly     from equation     2, noting that      Vpis   monotonically       incre~ing        in m, AS long

as CP is unrelated          to ir, the threshold       value of the liability        probability,     n“, is positively

related     to C’P.8 Thus,        where plaintiffs’     litigation    costs are lower (as they are for cases

filed from a pool of plaintiffs with a high-variance                 in their cost distribution),         the minimum

threshold     for ~ is lower and the average quality of cases filed will be lower. The result will

be lower plaintiff win rates.

    While     this prediction        on plaintiff    win rates refer to the win rate among                     all lawsuits

filed,   a natural       extension   is to plaintiff    win rates at trial.          While    the selection        process

that yields trials from the pool of lawsuits is surely not rmdom,                        it seems reasonable           that.

since plaintiffs with lower costs of litigation            are more likely to push their cases to trial, the

average quality (from the plaintiff’s           point of view) of tried cases drawn from the “low-cost’-

pool of plaintiffs        will be lower.    The result will be lower plaintiff win rates at trial.                       JVe

examine      both      overall pltintiff   win rates and pltintiff        win rates at trial in our empirical

analysis.

    Defendants         can also be thought          of as being drawn from the same two groups                       as the

plaintiffs, but, because defendants           do not decide for themselves whether or not they will be

involved    in litigation,      there is only a weaker selection          effect of defendants’          characteristics

on case outcomes. g In fact, the definition               of the plaintiff in a lawsuit is the party to the

dispute     who made        the decision    to file a claim.     It is interesting       that most models            of the

  8 Actually, r need not be unrelated to CP, A weaker condition is that CP cannot increase too rapidly
with decre~es   in r. The intuition is that weaker cases will be attractive for low-cost litigants to file as
long as weaker cases do not cost too much more COIltigate,


 9 There are at least two senses in which defendants        do affect the decision    regarding   litigation   involvement,

litigation     process stint with the set of filed c~es                    and ignore the plaintiff’s       decision to file.

Thus. it is not surprising            that the labeling of the parties as plaintiff and defendant                      in most

of these models        is arbitrary          and of no real substance.           Our analysis stands in contrast               to

this. The potential            plaintiff’s    decision    to file a lawsuit has important             implications     for the

characteristics       of the parties to lawsuits that afFect outcomes                     in important       ways.


3.   Proposed         Empirical         Tests      of the      Selection      Model

     JVe propose       tests    of the two predictions           of our selection model (recapitulated                here):

Prediction       J: Trial rates (the fraction               of filed cases that are tried to a verdict)                will be

     positively     related to the variation in the distribution                  of plaintiffs’     litigation    costs in the

     population       of potential       claims.

Prediction       2: Plaintiff win rates will be inversely related to the variation in the distribution

     of plaintiffs’    litigation      costs in the population             of potential   claims.

     A more general prediction                follows from the fact, noted earlier, that, once a lawsuit is

filed, the roles that the parties play in the process are symmetric.                               In contrast,    during the

initial selection     process potential          plaintiffs are making decisions regarding                 suit. filing based

on their own litigation            costs probably        without    good information         about the litigation         costs

of the potential       defendants.           Thus, cases filed represent closer to random                   draws from the

distribution       of defendants’        litigation      costs but a strongly         selected     set of draws from the

plaintiff’s     distribution       of litigation      costs.    Absent      the initial selection       process,    we would

expect     that the identity         of the defendant          to have the same effect on case outcomes                 as the

identity      of the plaintiff.      Evidence       to the contrary,         that the effect of the identities          of the

parties on case outcomes              differs by role, would suggest that the initial selection process is

important.        This results in a third prediction:

Prediction       $: The effect on c=e              outcomes      of the identity of the plaintiff will differ from

     the effect on case outcomes               of the identity of the defendant           only if systematic         selection

     of potential     claims for litigation           is important.

First, potential defendant’s    behavior with regard to the issues (e. g., should they comply with the terms of
a contract)   will affect how likely it is that they are the target of a lawsuit. Second, potential defendant’s
behavior in pre-litigation   discussions and/or negotiations WI1l affect how likely it IS that they are the target
of a lawsuit (Farber and White, 1994). But neither of these is as direct as the plaintiff’s decision regarding
case filing,
    The key to our empirical            tests is the identification        of sets of lawsuits that were derived

from distributions           with different    degrees of variation        in plaintiff and defendat           litigation

costs.     kVe argue that whether        the parties to a suit are individuals              or corporations     provides

just the kind of separating           information     we need.

    Our working          assumption      is that corporations          face relatively      more market        discipline

than do individuals            in their decisions      regarding       litigation     and are not able to deviate

substantially       from profit-maximizing           behavior      in their role as potential           plaintiffs   when

evaluating      whether       or not to file a lawsuit.     Thus, the litigation           costs of corporations        are

largely composed            of the pecuniary     costs associated      with litigation:      attorney’s    fees and the

value of time associated           with undertaking      litigation.     There is relatively less scope for non-

pecuniary      factors      such as tastes for or against confrontation                 or litigation   to play a role,

This means        that corporations       are relatively     likely to file suit where the expected                  dollar

payoff is positive       and are relatively       likely not to file suit where the expected               dollar payoff

is negative.

    Individuals      face a different set of constraints.          Individuals        me not income or profit max-

imizers.     Individuals       are utility maximizers,      and it is reasonable            to assume that there is

substantial      variation     across individuals     with regard to their non-pecuniary                tastes for con-

frontation      and litigation.      These tastes can be interpreted                as contributing     both positi~el~-

or negatively      to the costs of litigation.       Individuals    are free, within limits, to make decisions

regarding      litigation    that take account of these tastes. The relative lack of market discipline

on individuals      means that miation           in tastes for litigation       across individuals      can contribute

strongly     to the overall variation         in costs of litigation for individuals.          In contrast,    \ariation

in tastes for litigation         across corporations       (or their managers)            can contribute       only in a

limited way to the overall variation in costs of litigation                  for corporations.        Thus, the overall

variation    in costs of litigation     is expected     to be larger for individuals           thm for corporations,

    J\-e do not want to overstate             our claim regarding        the constraints       faced by corporations

relative    to individuals.       Individuals     as potential     plaintiffs    me free to avoid any litigation

they choose, and this can include claims with high expected                          values. But it may well be the

case that individuals           are not completely      free to pursue low expected              value claims.       They

could well be liquidity          constrained    in paying for legal representation,            md representation         is


                                                           10
not    likely to be easily obtainable         on a contingency           basis for low expected              value claims. 10

In addition,     not all corporations       are run at arms length strictly for the pecunimy                       benefit of

shareholders.      There are many Closely-held           corporations            that are managed by their owners

and whose resources            can be used to maximize              the utility (as opposed          to dollar value) of

their owners.      Thus, some corporations           will behave more like individuals                  in their dealings

with the legal system.              The force of our assumption              is that on ave~age individuals                 are

more likely than corporations              to consider      non-pecuniary          factors     when making         decisions

regarding     litigation.     and this shows up as more variation                  in the distribution          of litigation

costs for individuals         than in the distribution           of litigation    costs for corporations.

      It is important       to emphasize     that individuals’        ability to exercise their tastes regarding

litigation    does not necessarily        mean that individuals           are more litigious than corporations.

AS noted      above,    there is evidence      that most individuals              with valid claims do not pursue

these claims ( Danzon,          1985; Report     of the Harvard YIedical Practice                 Study, 1990; Hensler

et al., 1991).     This is consistent        with most individuals               having tastes regarding           litigation

that contribute        positively     to total litigation    costs.      Our primary           theoretical     concern      and

our empirical      implications       stem from differences            in the variation         in costs and not from

differences    in the level of costs.

      lVe can restate        our two specific     testable       predictions       in terms of the identity           of the

plaintiff:

Prediction     1: Trial rates will be higher for cases where the plaintiff is an individual                                than

      in cases where the plaintiff is a corporation.

Prediction     2: Plaintiff win rates will be lower for cases where the plaintiff is an individual.

The    third prediction,        that it is only     (or. more modestly,              largely)     through       selection    of

cases for litigation        that case outcomes       will be affected            differently    by the identity       of the

plainti~ :han by the identity of the defendmt,                   does not require the assumption                of a specific

difference    between       individuals   and corporations.




 10 One result of this could be lower quality representation  for low expected               value claims.    We discuss    this
below when considering alternative interpretations   of our results.

of the t-nited         States Courts.        ~~hen a civil case terminates             in federal district court,       the

court clerk files a form with the .~dministrative                       Office containing      information     about    the

case (.Admin.          Office of the L-S. Courts,              1985). 11 The form includes           data regarding     the

subject      matter and jurisdictional             basis of the case, the dates of filing and termination,              the

     Federal jurisdiction            for many cases filed in federd               court is not based on federal law,

Plaintiffs     with a state law course of action                 involving     more than $50.000 may file suit in

federal     court    if the plaintiff       and the defendant          are from different         states .12 These cases

are said to be diversity              cases because        federal    jurisdiction     is based on the diversity             of

citizenship      between      the parties.          In federal    court   cases based on diversity           jurisdiction,

the Administrative           Office has, since 1986, tracked whether                   the plaintiffs   and defendants

are individuals          or corporations.        13 This information           is not collected     in cases other     than

diversity     cases,     Thus, because           this information      is crucial to our analysis,       we restrict our

analysis to diversity         cases.

     The available         data shape the categories             of cases in our sample.          Since all of the cases

in the sample are diversity              cases, large classes of cases do not appear in the sample.                     For

example,      there are no civil rights, patent. or antitrust cases. These cases may be brought in

federal court because they are based on federal law, regardless of the amount in controversy.

     The case categories             comprising      diversity    litigation    are the common        law areas of tort.

                                                                 12
because       only a very small fraction      of personal     injury c=es     have corporate          plaintiffs.    For

this reason,      it is our view that the experiment              of comparing         case outcomes     by identitY

of plaintiff makes little sense in personal           injury cases. 14 JVe       dSo     exclude    a small number

of RICO        cases and a minor     class of diversity       cases classified as “other”.           The rem~ning

sample includes       218.120 cases.

    Since our      data end with the close of the 1994 federal government                     fiscal year, we have

no data on case progress         after September       30, 1994. Thus, any cases not resolved by that

date are censored        in the sense that their outcomes              are not observed.             Of the 218,120

cases filed between      July 1986 and September             1994, 196,441 were resolved and 21,679 were

not resolved      in time for the resolution       to be recorded       in our data.        This is an important

statistical    problem   in the analysis of trial rates and outcomes               because     cases that proceed

to trial are likely to take substantially           longer to resolve than cases that are dropped                     or

settled without      a trial verdict.     Thus. tried cases will be censored             disproportionately.

    Table 1 shows the number             of cases in our sample filed in each calendar                year. 15 There

has been some drop-off          in the number      of diversity      cases since 1986.        Table 1 also shows

the fraction     of cases pending       as of September      30, 1994 by year of filing. Overall. about               10

percent    of cases in our sample are censored,           and it is clear that cases filed more recently

are much more likely to be censored.

    That      this censoring   is an important       problem       is apparent     from the tabulation           of the

fraction      of cases tried by year of filing contained             in the last column            of table 1,      This

fraction   is computed      as the fraction    of resolved cases where there was a trial verdict.                   The

trial rate computed       this way falls dramatically         with the year of filing.         It is doubtful       that

this represents     a real decline in trial rates. It is almost surely an artifact of the decline in

time until the censoring       date with year of filing and the concomitant                 lack of time for cases

that will ultimately      be tried to reach a trial verdict.

 15 The number of cases      filed in 1986 is about half of the number in the immediately      succeeding ~ears
because we have no data     on cases filed prior to July 1, 1986. Similarly, the number of c~es filed in 1994 is
about 3/4 the number of     cases filed in the immediately   preceding years because we have no data on cases
filed after September 30,    1994,



                                                        13
    One approach       to the censoring          problem    would be to use only cases filed at sufficient

temporal      remove   from the censoring          date so that the censoring          problem      would be mini-

mal.    However,    the overall trial rate is only 3.58 percent             (though      this this is a somewhat

downward       biased estimate given the censoring).             Even a small amount of censoring is likely

to seriously    affect estimates of the trial rate. Thus, the fact that 4.5 percent of cases filed

in 1991 are unresolved        make even this year unsuitable             for the analysis of trial rates. One

would have to limit the analysis to 1986-1990                   to be reasonably      sure that censoring          would

not be a significant        problem.     While     the simple tabulations      presented        in this section       use

data for the entire 1986-94 time period               and do not account           for the censoring,      the multi-

variate statistical    analyses presented         in succeeding     sections address this problem in several

ways that we describe         below.

    IVhile measuring        the trial rate is straightforward,           determining         or even defining       who

wins is not. The data are fairly limited on this question,                 and we defie        a party as winning

if a judgement      was entered        for that party.      There    are at least three problems             with this

measure.      First, just because      a judgement     was entered for a pmticular            party does not mean

that the party, in fact, “won”.         For example,       a plaintiff who files suit expecting         a substantial

damage      award may settle for or receive a very small damage                     award.     This case would be

recored     as a judgement     for the plaintiff,     and we call this a plaintiff win. But the plaintiff

might perceive      this as a loss.      Second,     the party for whom a judgement                is entered      is not

coded     in the majority     (74.4 percent)       of the cases resolved without          a trial verdict.         These

are largely    cases that are dropped          or settled without       having a formal judgment                entered

in court.     We proceed     ignoring    this missing data problem,          and the implicit          assumption      is

that the cases for which judgement               is not available are not systematically            different in the

relevant dimensions        from those for which data on judgement                  is available.   This is less of a

problem     for cases resolved      with a trial verdict,        where only 9.4 percent         of judgments          are

missing.     Finally, judgement        is sometimes    entered for both parties (in about               5 percent      of

the cases for which we have data),            It is not clear who won in these cases, and we proceed

as if these are missing as well. 16

 lb We return to the issue of judgement      for both parties    when presenting    the multivariate    analysis   of win
rates.




                                                           14
    Thedata       record the broad legal category               ofeach     case. Table 21iststhese               categories and

shows I ) the number of cases in each category                      in OUr sample, ~) the number of uncensored

cases in each category,          3 ) the rate at which uncensored               cases in each category             are resolved

at trial, 4 ) the rate at which uncensored                  cases in each category              are won by the plaintiffs,

and 5 ) the rate at which uncensored                  cases ending in trial judgments                are won by plaintiffs.

By far the largest category             of cases is “other          contract      actions”.      .%dditionally,      insurance.

foreclosure,     and negotiable         instruments         are large case categories.             There is a substantial

difference     in raw trial rates across categories             with the highest trial rates in product                 liability

torts and property           damage,     product      liability and the lowest trial rates in foreclosure                       and

negotiable      instruments.       Plaintiff win rates vary substantially                 across case categories,              from

a low of 28 percent          in product        liability   torts to a high of 99 percent              in foreclosure          cases.

Plaintiff win rates at trial differ less across categories,                 but there are no extreme values. The

highest plaintiff win rate is 69.4 percent in negotiable                       instruments,        and the lowest plaintiff

win rate is 43.8 percent              in “property         damage     - product      liability”.      The smaller spread

in win rates at trial relative               to win rates among all lawsuits filed reflects the systematic

process of selection         of cases for trial.

    Table      3 presents     preliminary        evidence     based on simple cross-tabulations                    of how the

identity of the plaintiff is related to case outcomes.                     ~-bile     this analysis does not account

for the censoring           problem,     the results are clear and consistent                    with our expectations.

The trial rate is significantly               higher among       cases with individual              plaintiffs    than among

cases with corporate           plaintiffs.     The trial rates for the two groups                  are 0.0412 and 0.0304

respectively,     and the p-value             of the difference        is < 0.00001.          The overall         plaintiff     win

rate is substantially         lower mong          cases with individual            plaintiffs    than among         cases with

corporate      plaintiffs    (0.608    vs.    0.836, p-~’alue < 0.00001).             The plaintiff win rate at trial

is also significantly        (p-due      < 0.00001)        lower for cases with individud                plaintiffs,    but the

difference     is much smaller (0.586 vs. 0.648).

    Table 3 also presents preliminary                evidence       on how the identity of the plaintiff is related

to trial outcomes       controlling      for the identity of the defendant.               These tabulations            are agtin

consistent     with both predictions            of the theoretical       model:     1) Controlling       for the identity of

the defendant,      trial rates are higher where the plaintiff is an individual                        (p-value     < .000001)


                                                               15
and ~) controlling        for the identity       of the defendant,         pl~ntifi      win rates at trial are lower

where the pltintiff        is an individual      (p-nlue     < .000001 ).l T

     O\-erall. the specific evidence on how case outcomes                  vary with the identity of the plaintiff

is consistent     with the case selection framework                we developed       coupled      with the assumptlon

that individuals        are more variable in their litigation            costs than are corporations.

    Tabulations         of case outcomes        broken down by the identity                of the defendant        are also

presented      in table 3. There are significant            differences     here as well. with lower trial rates

and higher plaintiff         win rates mong         cases with individual             defend~ts.         Our theoretical

framework       was silent on how these outcomes                   might be related to the identity              of the de-

fendmt,      but it is interesting       that individual      litigants seem to fare worse (have lower win

rates) than do corporate           litigants,   regardless       of their particular       role.    When    corporations

sue individuals,        the plaintiff wins over 90 percent of the time.                   In contrast,     when individ-

uals sue corporations,         the plaintiff wins only 50 percent              of the time. When           the identities

are the same ( individud-individual              or corporation-corporation)              the plaintiff wins about 75

percent      of tne time.    Ylore generally,      the tabulations        suggest that differences          in outcomes

by identity of the defendant            are of roughly     the same magnitude             as those by identity of the

plaintiff.    Thus, the general test for plaintiff selection of cases for litigation,                    outlined    in the

previous      section   ( Prediction    3), shows no evidence          of this selection.

    Finally, it is interesting         that there is an inverse monotonic                relationship    across the four

plaintiff/defendant         types between       trial rates and plaintiff         win rates:       high trial rates are

associated      with low plaintiff       win rates. 18 This is a natural                 consequence       of systematic

selection     of potential    claims for litigation        on the basis of plaintiffs costs.             Lower plaintiff

costs imply higher trial rates md lower plaintiff win rates,


 17 The p-values reported here are derived from Pearson x z ~tatlstlcs from pairs of two-by-two               tables for
each hy. ~thesis.      For example,    for the first prediction,    there is a two-by-two   table of plaintiff identity
(plaintiti or individual)     by trial (trial or no trial) for each of the two types of defendants (plaintiff or
individual.    The test statistic is derived by summing the y2 statistic for each table, and the resulting statistic
1s distributed    a.s X2 with two degrees of freedom.        .A1l individual tw~by-two    tables deviate significantly
from independence       at conventional    levels with the exception of the plaintiff win rate by plaintiff t>-pe for
individual defendants (pvalue        = 0, 177).


 18 Note that this requires no specific     assumption     about    how the litigation    costs of individuals   differ from
those of corporations,

.5. Trial Rates           – Probit        Analysis

     In this section we present estimates of probit models of the probability                            of trial control-

ling for case category.           ;Ve address the censoring            problem     from several perspectives.           First,

we augment           the probit       model estimated        over the set of resolved       (uncensored)        cases with

a set of dummy            variables      for filing year in order to account            for the fact that cases that

go to trial take longer so that resolt~ed cases filed later (closer to the censoring                             date) will

appear to have lower trial rates, Second,                  we estimate the probit model using only data for

resolved       ~ses filed in 1990 or earlier.          Only a small fraction          of cases this old are censored

(see table 1). Finally, we present estimates of a two-equation                         probit model estimated            using

data on all cases. censored or not. of the joint probability                       of trial ad    censoring     in order to

derive consistent         estimates       of the effect of plaintiff and defendant             type on the probability

of trial,

     The basic vector          of vmiables      in both equations            includes a constant     and a set of three

dummy        variables     for party identity        (plaintiff     individual,    defendant     individual,    both indi-

vidual).       Thus,    the base category         consists of cases where both             parties are corporations.

and the key parameter                 of interest is the dummy              variable for cases where the plaintiff           is

an individual.         ~~-e also estimate      a “full” specification          where we add fourteen dummy               vari-

ables for the fifteen case categories              to each vector in order to control for differences                   across

categories      in trial rates.

     The first two columns of table 4 contain estimates of the two specifications                              for a simple

probit     model of the probability            of trial using data on the 196441 cases filed between                     1986

and 1994 that were resolved                 by September       30, 1994.        In order to account     crudely     for the

censoring      at this date,          these specifications        include    a set of dummy       variables    for ~-ear of

filing.     lVhere     case category       is not controlled        for (column      1), the estimates        suggest     that

cases with individual           plaintiffs     me significantly        more likely to go to trial than are cases

with corporate          plaintiffs,     Given an average probability              of trial of about 0.05, the probit

coefficients    multiplied      by 0.5 can be interpreted            approximately      as the proportional        effect of

the relevant variable on the probability                of trial. Thus, the estimates suggest that individual

plaintiffs are about 6.5 percent more likely to take cases to trial than are corporate                           plaintiffs.

Seemingly       offsetting    this, the estimates in column             1 suggest that individual        defendants        are

                                                               17
about 6.5 percent less likely to go to trial than are corporate                   defenduts.       Given the finding

that the coefficients      on the plaintiff-individual          and defendant-individual           dummies     sum to

zero and the finding that the coefficient           on the ‘both-individual          dummy is not significmtly

different from zero. cases where both parties are individuals                     and cases where both parties

are corporations       are equally      likely to go to trial.       These results are consistent            with the

simple tabulations        in table 3.

central prediction,       that cases where plaintiffs           are individuals     are more likely to go trial.

continues      to be supported    by the evidence,        though the marginal effect on the probability

falls to five percent.     However, the identity of the defendant             no longer has a significmt          effect

on the trial rate.       This pattern       of results, that the identity of the plaintiff matters                while

that of the defendant        does not, is consistent           with the generrd prediction          of the selection

model,      that the effect of the identity       of the plaintiff on case outcomes             will differ from the

effect of the identity of the defendant.

    Given the substantial        amount of censoring           in the data, we next reestimated            the model

using data only on the 132086 cases filed in 1990 or earlier and resolved by September                               30.

1994.    The censoring      problem       is much smaller in these data because                these cases have all

had at least four years to be resolved.            Table 1 contains censoring             rates by year of filing. -+

summary       is that the censoring       rate for cases filed in 1990 or earlier is 0.46 percent compared

with 24.7 percent        for cases filed after 1990. Estimates            of the two probit specifications           for

the restricted     sample are contained        in columns 3 and 4 of table 4, The results are virtually

identical    to those for the full sample.          This suggests that, while there is obviously                  much

censoring      in the full sample, it does not appear to bias the results.

    Finally,    we estimated     a structural      bivariate     probit   model     that jointly     determines     the

trial and censoring      probabilities.      .A key to identification      of the trial equation       in the face of

the censoring      is to find variables      that tiect    the censoring       process but are not related to


19 The improvement in the likelihood function when case categories               are controlled    for is dramatic and
significant. This is not surprising   given the sharp differences     in trial rates across c=       categories that we
found in table 2.

the probability          of trial.20 A natural variable                that fits this description          is the potential           time

available for case resolution.                    This is the number of days between the date the suit was filed

and the censoring            date (September              30, 1994).        In the analysis that follows              we include an

unrestricted       cubic function           of the potential          time in the vector of variables in the Censoring

equation.21

     Columns       5 and 6 of table 4 contains                       estimates       of the key parameters            of the model

for the two different             specifications.        22 We present only the estimates                      of the trial equa-

tion,   but the estimates               of the censoring         equation         show clemly        that potential         time is a

powerful      determinant          of the probability           of censoring,         with longer potential           time yielding

substantially       reduced        censoring         probabilities.         As before,     the case category          dummies          are

significant      determinants          of outcomes,        with the log-likelihood            improving       dramatically        when

the case category           dummy           variables      are included,          Not surprisingly,        the estimated          value

of the correlation          between         the errors in the trial ad                censoring     equation     is strongly        posi-

tive, suggesting         that cases that are more likely to go to trial for unobservable                                  reasons are

also more likely to be censored.                      Despite this endogenous             censoring     process,      the estimates

from the bivariate           probit model            with regard to trial rates and party identity                     are virtually

identical     to those from the univariate                   probit        models:     cases with individual           plaintiffs      are

about 9 percent           more likely to go to trial and the identity of the defendmt                                 does not have

a significant      effect on the trial rate.

     Overall,     the evidence            on trial rates is clear and show evidence                        consistent        with      the

selection process we outlined.                     Cases with individual          plaintiffs ae more likely to go to trial.

In combination           with this, our finding             that the identity of the defendant                   is not related to

trial rates is consistent              with our general test of the selection process:                      Controlling       for case

21 We also experimented       with a set of dummy variables for the year of c=e. tiling. This did not yield
nearly as good a fit a.s the cubic function (using a log-likelihood criterion). The results with regard to the
party-identity variables were not affected by the particular me~ure of potential time used.

6. Time        to Resolution:            A Competing       Risk Approach

       our   finding,     that cases with individual       plaintiffs are more likely to go to trial. raises

some interesting          questions      regarding   how the time to reach a settlement          and the time to

reach a trial verdict         are related to party identity. 23 lVhile our theory is silent with regard

to actual time. this is an important             question given the long processing         time of cases implicit

in the censoring          rates in table 1. 24 ZVe investigate      this in the context      of a competing     risk

model where settlement             and trial are competing        ‘-risks” for case resolution.

       LVe choose       a particularly     simple specification    where the two durations        are assumed to

be jointly     log-normal.       We specify


(lo)                                             lnD31 = .Yl,jl    + fl~,


and


(11)                                             lnDti = .~*,,3z + 621,


where lnD31 and lnDtl are the log times to settlement                    and trial respectivel~,    -~ is a vector

of case/claimant          characteristics     and ,31 and 32 are parameter       vectors.    we assume that the

error terms (the e’s) have a bivariate               normal distribution.

       In the competing         risk model it is important        to keep track of what is known about           the

two durations           in each of the three configurations          of the data (censored,        set tied, tried).

l~-here the case outcome              is censored,    we know that both durations           were longer than the

potential      time (the time between            the filing data and September         30, 1994).     Denote    this

potential      time as     Dp,.Thus,        we know that lnDs, > Dpi and lnDt, > Dp,. where                 there is

 23 The ~ettlement ~lme ~efer~to the’ time from c~e filing to resolution without at trial verdict. ~[any
““settled”cases are dropped without any payment to the plaintiff or are dismissed by the court. The trial
time is the time from from case filing to resolution through a trial verdict.

24 Some simple statistics on mean time to resolution for cases filed in 1990 or earlier (in order to minimize
the censoring problem) are that mean time to a settlement is 328 days (se. = 0.688) while mean time to
a trial verdict is 643 days (se. = 3.57). The median times to resolution are 207 and 509 days respectively.

there is a trial judgement          at D,, we know that lnDt,              = D, and that          lnD3i> Di.These
relationships     are used in conjunction       with the assumption             of joint normality       of the errors in

equations     10 and 11 to derive the appropriate              likelihood       function.      .~n interesting      feature

of the competing          risk approach     is that it naturally         takes account         of the potential        time

available    to resolve a case in computing         the probability            of censoring.

    Table 5 contains maximum-likelihood                estimates of the key parameters of the competing

risk model for the two specifications          of the X vectors used in the probit models.                    .As before.

the first, in columns         (1) and (2),    includes     only the basic wiables,                ad     the second.      in

columns      ( 3 ) and (4) is the full model including         dummy        variables for case category             as well.

N’ot surprisingly,        the controls    for case category          account     for a significant      fraction     of the

variation    in the model (p-value        from a likelihood          ratio test <0.00001).        Thus, we focus the

discussion     on the results in columns        (3) and (4) for the model including                 the case category

controls.

    The settlement         time is not significantly     related to the identity of the plaintiff.             However.

settlement     time is more strongly        related to the identity of the defendant.                  Settlement      time

is about     9 percent     shorter where the defendant          is an individual.25            The time until a trial

verdict tried is strongly        related to the identity of the plaintiff.             This duration        is about 30

percent lower where the plaintiff is an individual.              Time until a trial verdict is insignificantly

positively    related to the identity of the defendant.                These results are fully consistent              \\ith

the probit     results.    The 30 percent      shorter time until a trial verdict yields the predicted

higher trial rate in cases with individual             plaintiffs.

    The estimates         also show that cases individual             defendants     settle about 9 percent           more

quickly.     Given that times to trial verdict are so much longer than times until settlement.

this relatively    small difference       does not yield significant             differences    in trial rates by the

identit’” of the defendant.

    Finally, note that unobservable           factors that affect time to settlement                   and trial verdict

(the e’s in equations         10 and 11) are strongly           negatively        correlated     (~ =     –0.89).      One

 25 Given that the dependent  variable is log duration. the coefficient on a dummy variables can be in-
terpreted approximately as the proportional   effecc (as long as the coefficient is less than about 0.25 in
absolute value).
plausible     interpretation       of this result is that cases that are not likely to settle (have long

settlement      durations ) go to trial relatively           quickly.    similarly     Cases that are not likely to

go to trial (have long times to a trial verdict)                settle relatively      quickly.

    The central insight gained from these estimates                      is that the source of the higher trial

rate in cases with individual             plaintiffs   is that trials happen          much more quickly       and not

that settlement       is delayed.


7. Plaintiff       Win    Rates


    Finally,     we analyze        plaintiff   win rates.     \Ve analyze      data on who wins at trial only

for the set of cases for which information                  the party for whom a judgement                was entered

was recorded.        lye noted       above that there is a substantial               amount   of missing data. and

we attempt        no statistical     correction    for the selection      process that might yields the set of

cases with observed         judgments.         26 On this basis, we present simple probit                  analyses   of

the probability       that a judgement          is entered for the plaintiff for the set of cases that were

tried to a verdict and for which a winner was recorded.                      .As before, we treat the censoring

problem      in this analysis informally.           }l-e take two approaches.            First, we include     a set of

dummy       variables    for year of filing.       Second.     we reestimated the model over the subset of

suits filed no later than 1990 (where the censoring                     problem      is minimal).

    Judgments         were entered for both parties in a small fraction                    (5 percent)    of the cases.

These observations         were not included           in our analysis of plaintiff win rates because             theJ-

represent      a clear win for neither party.             \Te did investigate        this further using an ordered

probit    model     where judgement            for both    parties   was considered        intermediate     between    a

judgement       for the defendmt          and a judgement        for the plaintiff.        These estimates     are not

presented      here, but there are substantively             identical   to the simple probit estimates          of the

probability     of a judgement         for the plaintiff that we do present.

 26 We do not present results of some standard techniques for potential bias introduced           by the missing
data because we lack a convincing instrument that is correlated with the probability       that data are missing
but is not correlated with who wins at trial. Such an analys)s would rely entirely on the functional form
of the probability   functions or on unsupported      excluslon restrictions. Simple tabulations   show that the
missing data rate does not differ substantially      with the identity of the plalntiff and defendant with one
exception:  judgments      are less likely to be missing for cases where corporations    sue individuals than in
the other three categories (60 percent vs. 77 percent).
    Table 6 contains estimates              of the probit models for the probability             that a judgement            is

entered for the plaintiff.           The estimates        in column      1 are for the basic specification         of the

model.       The estimates         in column       2 are for a model        that includes     case category     controls

as well.     Since the model         that includes       the additional      controls fits significantly      better    (p-

value < 0.00001 ) than the model                    without    these controls,       we focus   on the estimates         in

column       2. These estimates          show that individual           plaintiffs   are significantly     less likely to

win a judgement          ( about     25 percentage       points less likely at the mean) than are corporate

plaintiffs    (p-value     < 0.0001). The estimates                also show that individual             defendants     are

significantly    less likely to win a judgement               (about    15 percent less likely at the mean) than

are corporate     defendants         (p-value      < 0.0001).

    While     we do not expect           that censoring       is a direct problem       in estimating       the determi-

nants of who wins, we also reestimated                   the model using only cases filed in 1990 or earlier

years, as before.        These estimates           are contained       in columns    ~

on the results in column            4 that control for case category,           we find results that are virtually

identical    to those we found using all years.

    These     results are consistent             with the specific prediction        of the theoretical      framework

that the selection        process     generates      a set cases where individual         plaintiffs have lower \vin

rates than do corporate            plaintiffs.    It is striking that we also find that individual           defendants

have lower win rates than do corporate                 defendants.       Our specific theory of the case selection

process was silent on this issue, but the general test of selection that we outlined suggested

that, to the extent        that selection          of cases for litigation     is import~t,      the identity     of the

plaintiff would have a different effect on win rates than the identity of the defendant,                               our

evidence     is mixed on this point.         The coefficients      on the individual-plaintiff      variable and t he

individual-defendant         variable      me significantly      different in absolute        value from each other

(p-value     < 0.0001),     but the qualitative          nature of the results suggests           that, regardless       of

the role they play, individuals            fare worse in litigation         than do corporations,

   Finally, we repeated            the analysis of the probability          of plaintiff wins using only the cases

that were decided        by a trial verdict.         These estimates are contained          in columns      5-8 of table

6. This analysis of win rates at trial shows smaller and relatively                           imprecisely     estimated

effects of party identity           on the probability        of plaintiff win.       This is not surprising       given
the sm~l        number    of c~es    decided    at trial.       But the qualitative       nature of the results is

similar to that found with the large sample.                    using the estimates       in column       6 (all years,

controlling     for case case categories),       individuals       are less likely (about       4 percent)   to prevail

at trial whether they are plaintiffs or defendmts,                  but the effect does not differ significantly

in absolute      value by role.      The estimates       for the cases filed in 1986-90 (column                8 ) based

on an even smaller sample,              do not show a statistically          significut     effect of the identity

of the plaintiff     on the pltintiff      win rate at trial.        However,      individual     defendants    remain

significantly     less likely to prevail at trial.

    In summary,       our analysis of plaintiff win rates, both overall and at trial, is consistent

with the specific implications          of our case selection framework.             Individual     plaintiffs are less

likely to win a judgement           than are corporate       plaintiffs.   lvith    regard to the general test of

the case selection       model,   based on whether the identity of the pltintiff                has different effects

on win rates than the identity             of the defendant,        while individuals     are less likely to win a

judgement       regardless of the role they play, we do find that the effect is somewhat                        smaller

for defendants      than for plaintiffs.


8. Alternative           Explanations


    tVhile we highlight        variation    in the distribution       of litigiousness    in ou      analysis of trial

rates and trial outcomes,           we recognize        that other factors         can be as important         or even

more important        in explaining      litigation    patterns.     For example,      several other factors        also

predict differences       in plaintiff/defendant        success rates at trial. Such factors as asymmetric

stakes to plaintiffs       and defendmts        ( \Valdfogel,      1995 ), the have ud           have-not    status of

plaintiffs and defendats          (Galanter,    1974), differing information           available to plaintiffs and

defendants      (Daugherty     & Reingaum,            1993; Hay, 1995; Hylton,        1993; Spier, 1992), agencj

problems      ( .Miller, 1987), and differing quality of legal representation              (Schwab       & Eisenberg.

1988 ) are possible       bases for explaining        the pattern of plaintiff trial success rates.

    Our model’s       predictions      about   both trial rates and success rates in litigation                 as they

relate to the identity       of both    plaintiffs     and defendants      helps to separate its implications

from factors emphasized           in other models.       Some factors generate no clear prediction               about

trial rates.     For example,       consider    the possibility       that individual      plaintiffs’    low success

                                                           24
rates in cases pursued          to judgment      are a consequence       of the fact that individuals            obtain

weaker counsel than corporations.              But this theory supplies no clear guidmce               with respect

to trial rates.     If weak lawyers push individual             plaintiffs to a trial judgement         it might be

reasonable       to expect    weak lawyers       to push individual       defendants         to a trial judgement.

But our evidence          ( table 4) suggests that cases with individual           defendants      are less likely to

be tried.      On the other hand, if the lower win rate of individuals                   is due to lower quality

counsel,     individual     defendants      also should have lower win rates at trial.             Our evidence        is

consistent      with this.

    The fact that litigation          rates show significant     correlation    largely with individual           plain-

tiff status.    and not with individual         defendant      status. suggests that something              more than

weaker Iawyering          for individuals    is going on. Differing litigiousness            is a possible explana-

tion. but the fact that plaintiffs make the key initial decision regarding                       whether or not to

file suit suggests that the theory of selection             we present in this study is a sensible overall

explanation.

    To the extent that individual            plaintiffs are relatively more likely to have attorneys                rep-

resenting      them who are ptid on a contingency              basis as opposed       to an hourly basis. there

might be an agency           explanation     for differences    in outcomes      ( YIiller, 1987).27        Since trials

require disproportionately            more resources    than the pre-trial phase, attorneys                 being com-

pensated       on contingency        would be more likely to recommend             settlement      \vhile attorneys

being paid by the hour would be more likely to push cases to trial.                            This would suggest

that individual      plaintiffs, being disproportionately         represented      by attorneys      paid on a con-

tingency     basis, would have lower trial rates than corporate                plaintiffs.    This is precisely      the

opposite     of what our selection         theory predicts and what we found in the data.

    The have ad           have-not    explanation   also forecasts either different litigation              rates than

those observed       or provides      only ambiguous      predictions.     If individual       plaintiffs     are have-

nots relative     to corporations,       their trial rates may be expected             to be lower, not higher.

than corporate       plaintiffs.     This is because   the have-nets,     by definition,        have more limited

other   hand,     corporate      defendants,      knowing       of the limited    resources      of their individual

plaintiff    adversaries,     may press cases to trial precisely           to drain plaintiffs of their limited

resources.      ~l-ithout    a model,      it is difficult    to sort out the net effect of these contrasting

tendencies      on trial rates.


9. Summary           and Concluding             Remarks


    Empirical      analysis of the selection of cases for litigation            is difficult because only a small

fraction     of the vast set of potential           claims result in the filing of a lawsuit.                .ind    those

potential     claims that do not result in lawsuits                not only are not observed,             they are not

even enumerated.        Yet the process through which cases are selected for litigation cannot be

ignored because it yields a set of lawsuits and plaintiffs that is far from a random selection

either of potential         claims or, perhaps        more to the point.        of potential     claimants.         In this

study, we developed           a theoretical     frmework       that provides     the conceptual         ‘-lever”’ needed

to analyze the selection process empirically                 despite the absence of information           on potential

claims not filed. \Ve use this framework               to investigate   how the selection process afFeccs the

characteristics     of the claimants          in suits filed in relation    to the underlying           distribution     of

potential     claimants.      We also use this framework            further investigate      the progress of these

suits through      the litigation    process.

    JVe implemented          the model empirically           by assuming that individuals        ~=ry more in their

litigiousness     ( inverse costs of litigation)        than do corporations.        This assumption,             coupled

with the case selection          process    we derived theoretically,       J’ielded clear predictions            on trial

rates and win rates as a function             of whether the plaintiff and defendant            were individuals        or

corporations.      Our empirical        analysis, using data on over 200,000 federal civil litigations.

yields results that are strongly              consistent     with the theory,     Lawsuits      where the plaintiff

is an individual      are found      to have higher trial rates than lawsuits where the plaintiff                        is

a corporation.       Consistent     with this, there is also e~-idence that individual                    plaintiffs file

weaker cases than corporate             plaintiffs in that individual      plaintiffs win rates are lower.

    \Iore generally,        the evidence      strongly suggests that trial rates are substantially                affected

by the identity of the plaintiff but not by the identity of the defendant.                     This is evidence that
the selection     of claims for litigation,      which is made by potential        plaintiffs, is an important

phenomenon.

    Overall,     our empirical     evidence     is consistent   with the view that potential          claims are

selected     for litigation    based on the litigiousness        of the potential     plaintiff    and that this

selection    process has important          implications   for patterns of case outcomes.         These findings

should      open new areas of exploration.           For exmple.      large differences     in claiming     rates.

such as the difference        in claiming     rates between     automobile     accident   cases and other tort

cases ( Hensler et al.. 1991 ), might be based on differences                in the distribution    of litigation

costs.   To the extent that this is the case, our conception           of the case selection process could

prove very useful in understanding            differences in the pattern of case outcomes.         For example,

there is substantial     variation in plaintiffs’     trial success rate across tort categories       ( Clermont

& Eisenberg,       1992).     Some of this variation       may be linked to unobserved             differences   in

litigation    cost distributions    that have an effect through the case selection process,              Linking

our findings     about      the influence    of the selection    of cases for filing to outcomes         in other

classes of cases seems like fertile ground for future research.
