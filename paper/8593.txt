                                               ABSTRACT


        Although economists cite potential gains from induced innovation as an advantage of using
market-based mechanisms to protect the environment, counts of patents related to flue gas desulfurization
units (“scrubbers”) peaked before trading of sulfur dioxide (SO2) permits began. This paper uses plant
level data to study the effect of these patents on pollution control. I find that requiring plants constructed
before 1990 to install scrubbers created incentives for innovation that would lower the costs of operating
scrubbers. There is little evidence that the new patents created before 1990 improved the ability of
scrubbers to more effectively control pollution. However, patents granted during the 1990s, when
market-based mechanisms were in place, do serve to improve the removal efficiency of scrubbers.

           Economists cite potential gains from induced innovation as one of the advantages of

using market-based mechanisms over command and control (CAC) policies to protect the

environment. Several theoretical papers, such as Milliman and Prince (1989, 1992) and Magat

(1978) have demonstrated the advantages of market-based mechanisms for inducing

technological innovation. Recent empirical work, such as Popp (2001), Newell et al. (1999),

Jaffe and Palmer (1997), and Lanjouw and Mody (1996), demonstrates that environmental

innovation does indeed respond to incentives such as prices or regulation. However, there is no

empirical work containing a direct comparison of innovation between a command and control

and market-based policy regime. Using data on coal-fired electric utilities from before and after

passage of the 1990 Clean Air Act, this paper attempts to fill that gap.

           One of the most prominent examples of a market-based environmental policy is the

trading of sulfur dioxide (SO2) allowances created by the 1990 Clean Air Act (CAA). In this

paper, I combine data on steam-electric power plants provided by the Energy Information

Administration (EIA) with data on patents granted in the United States to look at innovations in

pollution control for power plants before and after the 1990 CAA. Contrary to theoretical

predictions, patent counts related to SO2 pollution control technologies, such as smokestack

scrubbers, are higher before the 1990 CAA. In this paper, I argue that this empirical fact is not

inconsistent with the theoretical prediction that market-based environmental regulations induce

more innovation. Rather, I show that the change to a market-based policy in 1990 did not

necessarily lead to more innovation, as measured by patent counts, but did lead to more

environmentally-friendly innovation, as measured by the effect of the new innovations on air

quality.
Pollution Control Innovations and the Clean Air Act of 1990                                      2

       Before the CAA of 1990, plants were required to use the best available technology for

pollution control, which was often a scrubber. As a result, there were incentives for innovation

that would lower the costs of installing and operating scrubbers. However, there would be little

incentive for innovations to improve the efficiency of the scrubbers’ ability to actually remove

pollutants. Theoretical models of induced innovation and environmental policy typically do not

distinguish between these two types of innovation. Matching patent data with data from the EIA

on installation costs, operating costs, and removal efficiencies of the scrubbers, this paper looks

for changes in the types of innovation that were taking place before and after the Clean Air Act

of 1990. I show that patents granted before 1990 had no effect on removal efficiency, but did

lower the operating cost of scrubbers. In contrast, patents granted during the 1990s not only

lowered operating costs, but also increased the removal efficiency of scrubbers. Thus, although

the level of innovation did not change upon the introduction of the market-based permit trading

policy, the nature of innovation did.

       Previous empirical work on pollution control technologies for coal-fired electric utilities

includes Bellas (1998) and Carlson et al. (2000). Looking at scrubbers installed by 1992, Bellas

finds no significant evidence of technological change in abatement technology. In contrast,

Carlson et al. find that about 20%, or $50, of the change in marginal abatement costs that have

occurred from 1985 to 1995 can be attributed to technological change. Since Bellas sample

includes few scrubbers installed after passage of the 1990 CAA, and none installed after trading

in SO2 permits began, the results of these two papers are consistent with economic theory, which

predicts that market based policies induce more technological change. However, the results are

inconsistent with the observation that pollution control patents and R&D activity is highest

during the early 1980s. One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that both papers simply
Pollution Control Innovations and the Clean Air Act of 1990                                            3

use a time trend to represent technological change. The use of a time trend may not accurately

reflect changes in technology, as there are variations in patenting and R&D efforts over time. By

using patent data, I can more accurately model the progress of innovation that may have occurred

in scrubber technology. In particular, I use the patents to observe changes in the types of

research done in each policy era. Furthermore, by using data through 1997, I am able to compare

changes in technological progress before and after passage of the 1990 Clean Air Act.



I. History of Environmental Regulations Facing Utilities1

           Before the 1990 Clean Air Act established the sulfur dioxide permit market, electric

utilities faced command and control regulations that focused on pollution control technology.

Regulation of sulfur dioxide emissions began with the 1970 Clean Air Act, which listed SO2 as

one of six criteria pollutants. The 1970 Clean Air Act required the EPA to establish “national

ambient air quality standards” (NAAQS) for such pollutants at levels that would ensure the

public health and welfare. Once the NAAQS were set by the EPA, states were to develop a plan,

known as a “state implementation plan” (SIP) for attaining the required standards. Although the

EPA has the authority to review a state’s SIP, each state was given freedom to choose how it

would attain the emissions goals required by the NAAQS (Martineau et al, 1997).

           The criteria used by the EPA to evaluate SIPs were technology-based. Because Congress

was concerned that retrofitting older sources of pollution would be costly, they instead instructed

the EPA to require that new sources meet more stringent pollution control standards. The EPA

listed 61 sources that contribute significantly to air pollution, and required these sources to

satisfy “new source performance standards” (NSPS). Among these sources were fossil fuel fired

    Table 1 provides a summary of the key regulations facing coal-fired steam-electric power plants.
Pollution Control Innovations and the Clean Air Act of 1990                                                             4

steam boilers for which construction began after August 17, 1971, which were covered under

NSPS Subpart D (NSPSD). NSPSD required that newly constructed utilities, or existing units

undergoing modification or reconstruction, meet minimum emission standards. The standards

were to be set based on the best technology that had been “adequately demonstrated.” Since

NSPSD was set at the national level, it was an exception to the rule that states were given

freedom to implement individual SIPs.                However, regulations in the SIPs that were more

stringent than NSPSD took precedent, so that the national NSPSD standards can be seen as

minimum standards to be met (Ellerman et al. 1997). The Act required NSPS standards to be

reviewed every four years (Brownell & Zeugin 1991).

         NSPS Subpart Da (NSPSDa) of the 1977 Clean Air Act, which covers boilers for which

construction commenced after September 18, 1978, clarified the national standards for sulfur

dioxide and added an additional technology requirement for electric utilities. Most importantly,

the 1977 amendments required that most new coal-burning plants use flue gas desulfurization

units (FGD units, or “scrubbers”) to remove 90% of SO2 emissions from their exhaust.2 The

intent of the requirement was to protect the jobs of miners in states with high-sulfur coal by

making it less likely that utilities would meet the Clean Air Act’s emission requirements by

switching to low-sulfur coal. (Brownell and Zeugin 1991).

         The 1977 amendments also added new technology-based standards. First, major new

sources of pollution required “prevention of significant deterioration” (PSD) permits. The list of

major new sources includes fossil-fueled fired steam electric plants or boilers totaling more than

250 million BTU/HR heat (Brownell & Zeugin 1991). To receive a PSD permit, the applicant



2
 Specifically, plants needed to either achieve emission rates less than 1.2 lbs SO2/million Btu heat input and reduce
90 percent of their pre-treated emissions (a 90% removal efficiency) or achieve emission rates less than 0.6 lbs
SO2/million Btu heat input and achieve 70% removal efficiency.
Pollution Control Innovations and the Clean Air Act of 1990                                    5

must show that the “best available control technology” (BACT) will be used for each pollutant

emitted. Finally, the EPA set more stringent guidelines for air quality control regions that were

not in attainment of the NAAQS. SIPs for nonattainment areas required permits for new or

modified pollution sources. At a minimum, the permit program must require that these sources

install pollution control equipment designed to achieve the “lowest achievable emission rate”

(LAER). Furthermore, existing sources in nonattainment areas could be required to install

“reasonably available control technology” (RACT) (Brownell & Zeugin 1991).

       Unfortunately, the concept of best available control technology was not well-defined by

the EPA. The 1977 CAA stated that BACT limits would be determined on a case-by-case basis.

Determination of the BACT should consider energy, environmental, and economic impacts.

However, the relative weight assigned to each factor was to be determined by individual states.

The burden of the BACT analysis was placed on the permit applicant. To demonstrate that the

chosen technology was the BACT, the applicant had to show that alternative technologies with

more stringent pollution control would cause “unreasonable adverse energy, environmental, or

economic impacts.” (U.S. EPA 1978) For example, a slightly more stringent control technology

could be ruled out if the economic or energy costs of the technology are significantly greater.

Economic impacts considered could include investment costs, operations and maintenance costs,

and annualized costs of operations and maintenance plus depreciation. In addition, applicants

could consider impacts on the local economy. For example, if a region suffered from high

unemployment, a more stringent control technology could be ruled out if it would lead to a loss

of jobs (U.S. EPA 1978).

       In 1987, EPA guidelines on BACT changed to focus on the most stringent control

available. The 1987 guidelines, known as “the Potter memorandum,” instituted a top-down
Pollution Control Innovations and the Clean Air Act of 1990                                                6

approach to BACT analysis. Applicants must begin by determining the most stringent control

technology available.            That technology could only be ruled out if it can be shown to be

technically or economically infeasible. If it was ruled out, the applicant was to proceed to the

next most stringent control technology, and so on, until a technology that could not be ruled out

is found (Brownell & Zeugin 1991). The top-down approach made the BACT requirement

similar to the “lowest achievable emission rate” (LAER) requirements for new sources in non-

attainment areas. A LAER technology must be at least as stringent as any technology in use in

any state. The costs of such technology could be considered, but only if the costs were so high

that they would prohibit the new source from operating at all (Brownell & Zeugin, 19991).

            The 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act (1990 CAA) changed the regulation of

electric utilities’ SO2 emissions from a command and control approach to a market-based

approach. It also changed the focus from state-based implementation plans to one aggregate

national emissions limit to be met. The 1990 amendments repealed the requirement that 90% of

SO2 emissions at coal-burning plants be scrubbed. Instead, Title IV of the 1990 CAA introduced

tradable SO2 emissions allowances. Starting in 1995, Phase I utilities3 were required to have

permits for each ton of SO2 emitted. In Phase I, allowances were allocated to allow each

affected utility to emit 2.5 lbs/mmBtu per year.                        Firms that were not able to meet this

requirement could emit more if they purchased additional permits from a plant that was able to

reduce emissions by more than the required amount. Total allowances equaled 8.7 million tons.

For comparison, these plants emitted 9.3 tons of SO2 in 1985 (Ellerman et al., 1997). Firms

could receive additional allowances if they installed “qualifying control technologies” that

reduce a plant’s SO2 emissions by at least 90 percent. (Martineau & Novello 1997)



3
    Phase I utilities include the 263 dirtiest utilities, based on 1985 emissions levels.
Pollution Control Innovations and the Clean Air Act of 1990                                                           7

         Because plants were no longer required to install scrubbers, they could choose the most

cost effective methods to reduce emissions. Ellerman et al. (1997) estimate that 45.1% of

reductions in 1995 came from SO2 scrubbing, with the remaining 54.9% coming from switching

to other fuels, such as low sulfur coal.

         Phase II of Title IV begins in the year 2000. Phase II expands the permit trading program

by including most existing or new plants. Over 2000 plants are now included. Aggregate annual

emissions are limited to 8.95 million tons – roughly 50% of 1980 emissions levels (Ellerman et

al. 1997).



II. Innovation levels before and after the 1990 CAA

         A large body of environmental economic literature has demonstrated the benefits that

market-based mechanisms have for inducing research and development (R&D) on

environmentally friendly technologies.             These models universally predict that market based

environmental policies will induce more innovation than command and control policies.

However, each of these papers focuses only on the overall level of innovation.

         In this paper, I use patent data to look for changes in the nature of the R&D performed.

Even though the best available control technology policy of NSPSD and NSPSDa provides no

incentives for firms to develop scrubbers that exceed the removal efficiency requirements, there

were incentives to perform research designed to reduce the costs of these scrubbers.4 Since firms

were required to install scrubbers, such research would reduce the costs of compliance with the

BACT regulations.



4
  Not only is there no reward for exceeding the standard, if regulators respond to technological advances by
increasing the standard (the ratchet effect), there may actually be a disincentive to develop new technologies. The
ratchet effect hypothesis is not explored in this paper.
Pollution Control Innovations and the Clean Air Act of 1990                                      8

       Cost-reducing innovations would still be beneficial in a permit trading market. Permit

markets work by taking advantage of differences in marginal abatement costs across firms.

Thus, firms that could lower their marginal abatement costs would benefit by being able to sell

pollution allowances to firms with higher marginal abatement costs. However, firms could also

have additional permits to sell if they used pollution abatement technology that removed more

pollution.     Thus, there are incentives for innovation to increase the removal efficiency of

scrubbers in the market-based policy regime. This additional incentive suggests the following

two hypotheses to be tested in the empirical work that follows:

       1) Innovation under the command and control regime should have focused on lowering

             costs, rather than increasing efficiency.

       2) Innovation after passage of the 1990 CAA may focus on either lowering operating

             costs or increasing removal efficiency.

       I begin by looking at the level of innovative activity in sulfur dioxide pollution control.

To measure the level of innovative activity, I use U.S. patents related to sulfur dioxide pollution

control. To identify such patents, I use the classification and subclassification assigned to each

patent by the U.S. Patent Office. These classifications describe the type of invention represented

by the patent. I began by identifying classifications that were related to SO2 pollution control.

These are shown in Table 2. Then, using data available on Lexis/Nexis, I identified all patents in

these classifications from 1900 to 1997.         In addition, using data from a set of CD-ROMs

produced by MicroPatent, I obtained additional details on pollution control patents granted since

1975, including the application date and country of origin.

       The use of patent data to measure innovative activity offers several advantages. The

biggest advantage of patent data is that, unlike other data on inventive activity, such as R&D
Pollution Control Innovations and the Clean Air Act of 1990                                                            9

expenditures, patent data is available in highly disaggregated forms.                          General data on air

pollution expenditures in the U.S. are available since 1972. However, it is not possible to tell

how much of this R&D effort went towards SO2 pollution control. Furthermore, using patent

data allows me to construct a longer time series, as historical patent data is available since 1793.

         Nonetheless, when working with patent data, it is important to be aware of its limitations.

The existing literature on the benefits and drawbacks of using patent data is quite large.5 An

important concern is that the quality of individual patents varies widely. Some inventions are

extremely valuable, whereas others are of almost no commercial value. This is partly a result of

the random nature of the inventive process. Accordingly, the results of this paper are best

interpreted as the effect of an “average” patent, rather than any specific invention.

         Another potential pitfall is that the propensity to patent new inventions may have

changed over time. If this is the case, using patents rather than R&D to measure innovative

activity misstates the returns to R&D. Historically, the ratio of patents to R&D expenditures has

fallen in the United States (as well as in other industrialized nations). Some researchers, most

notably Evenson (1991), consider the falling ratio to be evidence of diminishing returns to

R&D.6 The intuition is that, as researchers continue to search for new ideas, it gets harder and

harder to find something yet to be discovered. Similarly, Kortum and Lerner (1998) argue that a

recent upswing in patenting activity in the United States is due to the increasing fertility of new

research opportunities. Other researchers, most notably Griliches (1989), claim that research

opportunities have not declined. Griliches argues that the fall in the patent-to-R&D ratio is due to

changes in the willingness of inventors to patent new inventions. An exogenous fall in the

5
  Griliches (1990) provides a useful survey.
6
  Here, diminishing returns to research refers to the expected return on the inputs to the research process, not the
returns to the output. The notion that there are increasing returns to the output of knowledge, usually attributed to the
public good nature of knowledge, is by no means compromised by claiming that the inputs to research experience
Pollution Control Innovations and the Clean Air Act of 1990                                                              10

willingness to patent – caused, for example by changes in patent laws that affect the benefits of

holding a patent – would result in a falling patent-to-R&D ratio even if the productivity of

research spending remained the same.

         Acknowledging these concerns, a first look at the data suggests that the 1990 CAA had

little effect on innovative activity. Figure 1 shows an index of the percentage of successful

patent applications related to SO2 control per year, as well as an index of air pollution R&D

expenditures, taken from the U.S Department of Commerce (1994). Only patents granted to U.S.

applicants are considered, as these would be the inventors most influenced by changes in

American environmental regulations. Application data is available for patents granted since

1975. Patents are sorted by their year of application because several researchers have found that

patent applications are highly correlated with levels of R&D expenditures. Thus, the year of the

patent application is a good proxy for when the R&D occurred (Griliches 1990). Since a patent

application is only made public when a patent is granted, the data have been scaled up to account

for patents applied for but not yet granted.7 I use a percentage of successful applications, rather

than a raw count, to adjust for changes in patenting activity due to growth in the economy and

changes in the propensity of inventors to file for patent protection.8 Note that both general air

pollution R&D expenditures and SO2 pollution control patents fall over time. In addition, there

is no upswing in innovative activity after passage of the Clean Air Act in 1990.9


diminishing returns. Diminishing returns to research simply implies that it becomes more and more difficult to
develop new inventions as time progresses.
7
  To scale the data, I first find the distribution of the lag between application and grant for all patents granted in the
U.S. Using this distribution, the percentage of patents remaining to be granted after 1997 was calculated for each
application year and added to the data.
8
  That is, if the propensity to patent has fallen because of exogenous changes to patent law, both the numerator and
the denominator of the percentage will be equally affected.
9
  One additional concern is that, if there are diminishing returns to R&D, patenting activity could be falling even
though inventors perceive other incentives to perform R&D, such as environmental policy, to be greater. To check
this, I used regression analysis on policy variables and a time trend to account for diminishing returns. The results
showed no significant increase to inventive activity after passage of the Clean Air Act, although the fit of the
regressions is poor. Results of these regressions are available from the author on request.

III. Did Pollution Control Innovations Control Pollution?

           The patent data presents a puzzle. Although economic theory predicts that market-based

environmental policies should induce innovation, there is less innovation on scrubbers after the

1990 CAA. It is possible that there are other mitigating factors that discouraged R&D. For

example, permit prices were lower than initially predicted. Early predictions were that permits

would sell for $250-$350 per ton during Phase I, and over $500 per ton during Phase II.

However, actual prices fell quickly, approaching, and sometimes even falling below, $100 per

ton (Joskow et al. 1998). Since one of the benefits of developing a more efficient pollution

control technology is that it enables plants to sell permits to other plants with less effective

technology, decreases in the price of pollution permits would lower the incentive to do R&D.

           More importantly, the 1990 CAA allowed utilities more flexibility to control SO2

emissions. Other researchers have noted that, as a result of falling prices, many utilities shifted

to low sulfur coal during the early 1990’s.10 Prices for low-sulfur coal fell dramatically during

the late 1980s and early 1990s due to deregulation of railroads, which lowered the shipping costs

of low-sulfur coal.11 Thus, these utilities would be able to meet their emissions reduction targets

without needing to invest in new technologies. In contrast, before the 1990 CAA, new utilities

were required to install a scrubber with a minimum 90% removal efficiency. Although there was

no reward for improving the removal efficiency of the scrubber (that is, the percentage of sulfur

dioxide that the scrubber removes from smokestack emissions), there was incentive for

innovations that lowered costs of scrubbers, as such innovations lowered the cost of complying

with the regulation.

10
     See, for example, Ellerman et al.(1997) or Carlson et al. (2000).
Pollution Control Innovations and the Clean Air Act of 1990                                                       12

        In this section, I test the hypothesis that incentives for the type of innovation changed

after passage of the 1990 CAA.             I ask whether the innovations that occurred in scrubber

technology had an effect on the removal efficiency of the scrubbers – that is, did the innovations

actually help to improve pollution control. I also check to see whether this effect is constant over

time, or whether effect of new innovations changed after passage of the 1990 CAA.

        Data on the plants included in this section comes from the Steam-Electric Plant Operation

and Design Report (FORM EIA-767). This report contains data from an annual survey of all

U.S. power plants with a total existing or planned steam-electric generator nameplate rating of at

least 10 megawatts (MW). Results of these surveys are available from the Energy Information

Administration for the years 1985 to l997. The survey includes comprehensive data on electric

power plants, including the fuels burned, their operating and capital expenditures, environmental

regulations that they are under, and their pollution control activities. Of particular interest for

this paper is data on the flue gas desulfurization unit (FGD unit, or scrubber) used by coal-

burning plants.

        The data set includes 193 plants that use coal as their primary fuel and have an FGD unit.

For each of these units, the data set contains, among other things, the year the scrubber went on

line, the removal efficiency of the scrubber, the operating and maintenance costs of the scrubber,

and the costs of installing the scrubber. Of these, scrubbers with efficiency ratings less than or

equal to 50 percent were removed from the data set, as such scrubbers, which were still being

installed as late as 1994, do not represent the latest in technological advances. Also, to insure

that the data on pollution control regulations from Form 767 is consistent with the regulations

faced by the plants when the scrubber was installed, I delete observations for which the current


11
  Most low-sulfur coal comes from the remote areas of the western U.S., and is thus not located near many power
plants.
Pollution Control Innovations and the Clean Air Act of 1990                                                            13

regulations took affect more than three years after the scrubber went online.12 This leaves 180

FGD units for analysis.

         Table 3 lists the variables used in this section and their descriptive statistics.13 The

variables in the last section of the table represent regulations faced by the plants when the

scrubber went on-line. Note that each type of regulation is faced by only a subset of the plants,

as the regulations may be imposed by federal, state, or local authorities.14 NSPSD and NSPSDa

are dummy variables equal to one if the plant is covered by each of these federal regulatory

regimes. CAA90 is a dummy variable equal to one for plants that went on-line in the 1990s.

The no policy dummy covers those plants for which construction commenced before August 17,

1971, and are thus not affected by any of these three federal clean air policy regimes.

         In addition, Figure 2 plots the average removal efficiency of new scrubbers per year, as

well as a three-year moving average.                  The figure is divided into three policy regimes,

corresponding with the 1970 CAA, the 1977 CAA, and the 1990 CAA. Note that the average

removal efficiency rises during the NSPSD period before leveling off during NSPSDa. This is

the period in which newly constructed coal-fired plants were required to install FGD units with

90% removal efficiency ratings.15 During the NSPSDa period, there was little incentive to install

a scrubber with a removal efficiency rating exceeding 90%. However, the average once again

increases after passage of the 1990 CAA. Particularly striking is that the moving average in the

NSPSDa era is nearly flat. One the desired removal efficiency is met, there is little incentive for

plants to exceed the standard. In contrast, the moving average steadily increases after passage of

the 1990 CAA, suggesting that technological innovation plays an important role in this era.

        Table 4 provides additional data on the scrubbers installed in each policy regime. The

top table shows the number of scrubbers of varying removal efficiencies installed under each

policy regime, and the second shows the percentage of scrubbers of varying removal efficiencies

installed under each regime. No policy represents scrubbers for which construction commenced

before August 17, 1971, and CAA90 represents plants that went online in 1990 or later, and were

not subject to either NSPSD or NSPSDa regulations. Note that 44% of FGD units installed under

NSPSDa exactly met the 90% removal efficiency standard. Only 17% exceeded the standard.

Of the 16 plants that installed scrubbers with removal efficiency ratings below 90%, 14 had SO2

emission rates less than 0.6 lbs per million Btu heat input, and thus only required to install

scrubbers with 70% removal efficiency ratings. Only 2 plants appear to be in violation of the

NSPSDa requirements.           Converesely, during the CAA90 era, 73% of scrubbers installed

achieved removal efficiencies of at least 95%.

        My goal is to see how the knowledge embodied in SO2 pollution control patents affected

the removal efficiency of scrubbers. For this, I first construct a stock of pollution control

knowledge. I begin with a count of all patents related to SO2 pollution control from 1900 to

1997. To construct the stock of knowledge, I use a rate of decay, represented by β1, to capture

the obsolescence of older patents. Over time, the knowledge embodied in a patent becomes

obsolete, as new and better inventions take its place. In addition, it takes time for the knowledge

embodied in a new patent to spread throughout the economy. A new patent represents invention,

the first step in technological change. Before it can have an effect on the economy, the new

invention represented by a patent must be developed for commercial use.                                      This stage of

development is known as innovation.                    By measuring the effect of knowledge on removal

efficiency, I am measuring the results of this commercialization, rather than simply the benefits

of discovery of the new invention. Thus, the stock of knowledge also includes a rate of diffusion,

β2, to capture delays in the flow of knowledge. Defining s as the number of years before the

current year, the stock of knowledge at time t is written as:

                                             ∞
(1)                                 K t = ∑ e − β1 ( s ) (1 − e − β 2 ( s +1) ) PATt − s .
                                            s =0


The rate of diffusion is multiplied by s+1 so that diffusion is not constrained to be zero in the

current period. To test whether there is a change in the type of research done after passage of the

1990 CAA, I also create a second knowledge stock that includes only patents granted in or after

1990:

                                                 ∞
(2)                                 K t90 = ∑ e − β1 ( s ) (1 − e − β 2 ( s +1) ) PATt − s * dum90 t − s ,
                                              s =0


where dum90 is a dummy variable equal to one if year t-s ≥ 1990. Thus, Kt90 picks up any

additional effect that patents granted since 1990 have compared to patents granted prior to 1990.

         To illustrate the effect of various rates of decay and diffusion, Figure 3 shows the weight

placed on each patent x years after its grant date. The decay rate is constant across each row, and

the rate of diffusion is constant down each column. Note that patents have a more immediate

impact when the rates of decay and diffusion are high. Figure 4 shows the actual stocks over

time for various rates of decay and diffusion. Panel A varies the rate of decay, and panel B

varies the rate of diffusion.




date, the average is slightly below 90%.
Pollution Control Innovations and the Clean Air Act of 1990                                                              16


         Because in any given year, units going online are affected by different policy regimes, I

use regression analysis to control for other factors influencing the decision to install a scrubber

with a given removal efficiency rating. I include the stock of knowledge as an explanatory

variable in a regression of the removal efficiency of FGD units. In addition, I include dummy

variables for the federal SO2 policy regime affecting the unit,16 and variables representing any

emissions limits in place at the time the unit went on line, such as the maximum rate of SO2

emissions allowed, and on the price of low sulfur coal.17 Because the knowledge stock is likely

correlated with policies in place at the time the scrubber went online, I use a two-stage

estimation strategy.        First, for any year t in which a scrubber was installed, I regress the

knowledge stock on policy and price variables that influence the evolution of technology.18

These results give me predicted values for the knowledge stocks, KiP and KiP90, for each year

from 1972-1997.

         I use the predicted values of the knowledge stock in the following regression. Defining

REMEFF as the removal efficiency of the FGD unit, POLICY as a vector of policy variables, D

is a vector of dummy variable equal to one when a specific policy affects plant i, PLSC as the

price of low sulfur coal in the year the scrubber went on line, and d as a dummy variable equal to

one for years greater than or equal to 1990, I estimate the following equation:

(3)                         REMEFFi = α + βKiP + γ.KiP90 + χPLSC + ηPOLICYi ϕD.POLICYi+ εi,t

For each observation, I use the predicted value of knowledge for the year in which the scrubber

was installed.

16
   The dummy variables represent the four regimes in Table 3, plus an additional dummy for plants covered by
NSPSDa that only need to install a scrubber with 70% removal efficiency. The excluded dummy variable in the
regressions is CAA90.
17
   Because each type of limit is only in force for a subset of the plants, for each regulation type I also include for
dummy variables equal to one when a plant is affected by the regulation.
Pollution Control Innovations and the Clean Air Act of 1990                                                           17


         To estimate the model, I first create a predicted knowledge stock for a given value of β1

and β2. Once the knowledge stock has been created, equation (3) is linear in parameters.19 The

results are corrected for autocorrelation.20

         Table 5 presents results of the regression for a decay rate of 0.1 and a rate of diffusion of

0.25.21 As expected, variables affecting low sulfur coal, which can serve as a substitute for

scrubbing, have positive effects. More efficient scrubbers are installed when the price of low

sulfur coal is high, or when the design specifications of the scrubber call for greater sulfur

content in the coal. Plants facing regulations on the sulfur content of coal also install more

efficient scrubbers.22 In addition, the presence of additional SO2 emissions limits leads to the

installation of more efficient scrubbers, but efficiency does not increase as the magnitude of the

regulation increases. Similarly, minimum efficiency standards for scrubbers also lead to less

efficient removal efficiencies, suggesting that these regulations do not keep up with changing

technology – even though more efficient scrubbers are available, utilities choose not to install


18
   I regress the knowledge stock on a constant, two dummy variables stating whether NSPSD or NSPSDa are in
effect, the real price of low sulfur coal, current and lagged prices of SO2 permits, and a time trend. For the post-90
knowledge stock, the NSPSD and NSPSDa dummy variables are omitted.
19
   It is possible to estimate the rates of decay and diffusion by performing this estimation for a range of β 1 and β 2
and minimizing a generalized method of moments (GMM) criterion. For this example, the optimal decay rate is
0.49, and the optimal rate of diffusion is 0.32. Unfortunately, this estimation strategy suffers from two drawbacks.
First, the minimization assumes that the effect of knowledge is accurately captured by changes in removal
efficiency, rather than by other variables. As the following results show, this is not the case. Second, the resulting
standard errors are unreliable. Computing the standard errors from the GMM estimation requires a derivative of the
error term with respect to each of the parameters of the model. If β 1 and β 2 are treated as endogenous parameters to
be estimated, the matrix needed to compute the covariance matrix is highly collinear and cannot be inverted. As a
result, the standard errors presented in the paper do not account for the randomness of the rates of decay and
diffusion, and thus should be treated as upper bounds.
20
   Correcting for autocorrelation should help to address changes that occur in the propensity to patent over time. For
example, if the falling patent-R&D ratio is due to a decrease in the propensity to patent, newer patents should be
more valuable, as they represent more R&D effort. Thus, the error associated with knowledge should increase over
time. In fact, the results suggest that this is not a concern, as the Durbin-Watson statistic for the regression is 1.90.
21
   These rates are consistent with others used in the R&D literature. For example, discussing the literature on an
appropriate lag structure for R&D capital, Griliches (1995) notes that previous studies suggest a structure peaking
between three and five years. The rates of decay and diffusion used in this paper provide a lag peaking after four
years.
22
   To evaluate the effects of the policy variables, it is necessary to look at both the dummy variables and slope
coefficients. I evaluate the slope coefficients at the mean levels for the variables.
Pollution Control Innovations and the Clean Air Act of 1990                                      18


more efficient scrubbers because such scrubbers are not necessary to comply with the regulations

they face. Also, note that each of the pre-CAA90 policy regimes led to the installation of less

efficient scrubbers. For example, controlling for other factors, scrubbers installed by plants

under NSPSDa were 2.8% less efficient than scrubbers installed in the CAA90 era, and plants

that only faced the 70% removal efficiency requirement installed scrubbers that were an

additional 1.8% less efficient. In each case, the effect is statistically significant.

        My particular interest is to observe the effect of the knowledge stock on removal

efficiency. As expected, before the CAA90 policy era, knowledge had no effect on removal

efficiency. The coefficient is just 0.001, and is statistically insignificant. However, patents

granted in or after 1990 do have a significant effect on removal efficiency. Also, as Table 6

shows, this result does not change much as the rates of decay and diffusion are allowed to vary.

For any given decay rate, higher rates of diffusion lower the magnitudes of the coefficients. For

any given rate of diffusion, the coefficients, as well as the impact of each patent, increase as the

decay rate increases. However, as we will see below, the magnitude of the effect depends not

just on the coefficients on knowledge, but also on the rates of decay and diffusion assumed.

        To more clearly illustrate the magnitude of the effect of new knowledge, Table 7 shows

the effect of a new patent on removal efficiency, using the ten percent decay rate and 25 percent

rate of diffusion. The marginal effect of a new patent is simply the knowledge coefficient from

equation (3), multiplied by the appropriate rate of decay and diffusion. The table shows the

impact of a patent four years after it is granted, since, for the rates of decay and diffusion used,

that is the year in which a patent has its maximum impact. The table is divided into three
Pollution Control Innovations and the Clean Air Act of 1990                                                          19


periods, representing the three Clean Air Acts.23 As noted before, a new patent granted from the

two command and control eras has almost no effect on removal efficiency, increasing it by just

0.0003% after four years. However, the effect of patents granted in the 1990s is significant. A

new patent from the SO2 permit trading era increases removal efficiency by 0.024% after four

years. To understand the full magnitude of the knowledge created in each era, the last column of

Table 7 multiplies the gain per patent by the average number of patents granted per year in each

era. During the CCAA90 regime, the knowledge created each year increased removal efficiency

by 1.58%.

         Although choosing rates of decay and diffusion so that the value of a patent peaks after

four years is consistent with other findings in the R&D literature, a potential concern is that such

rates are inappropriate here. Since there were little policy incentives to install higher efficiency

scrubbers during the NSPSD and NSPSDa eras, it is possible that the inventions completed

during that time would have increased removal efficiency, but simply weren’t installed because

they weren’t needed – that is, these new innovations simply hadn’t diffused yet. To check this,

Table 8 repeats the results of Table 7 for a decay rate of 0.05 and a rate of diffusion of 0.01. By

using slower rates of decay and diffusion, a new patent would have its greatest impact 17 years

after its initial grant. Thus, patents from the late 1970s, when scrubber patenting activity peaked,

would have a maximum effect in the mid 1990s, when permit trading began. Even when the

knowledge stock weights are changed so that patents from the 1970s have their greatest impact

in the 1990s, these patents have almost no effect on removal efficiency. In addition, the patents

from the 1990s still do have a significant effect, even though, using the lower rates of decay and

diffusion, they have not yet had the chance to diffuse completely.

23
  Because the patent data is sorted by year of grant, and it takes, on average, two years for a patent application to be
granted, the starting date for patents from each era is two years after passage of the respective Clean Air Act, so that
Pollution Control Innovations and the Clean Air Act of 1990                                                             20


         Finally, Table 9 shows how the value of a post-1990 patent varies as the rates of decay

and diffusion vary. To allow for variations in the diffusion of knowledge, panel A presents

efficiency gains one year after a patent is granted, and panel B presents efficiency gains that

occur four years after the patent is granted.24                 Although the estimated coefficients fall as

diffusion rates increase, the increases in removal efficiency, while still small, are higher with

larger rates of diffusion, as the knowledge embodied in each patent is transmitted more quickly.

IV.      Did Pollution Control Innovations Lower Costs?

         Although regulations requiring the installation of scrubbers do not provide incentives to

increase the removal efficiency of scrubbers, they do provide incentives for innovation that

lowers costs. By lowering the cost of utilizing the best available control technology, such

innovation would lower the cost of compliance with BACT regulations without adversely

affecting future regulatory burdens placed on the firm.

         To test the hypothesis that scrubber innovations before 1990 lowered the costs of

operating scrubbers, I once again use data from the Steam-Electric Plant Operation and Design

Report (FORM EIA-767). In addition to the variables used in the previous section, this report

contains detailed information on the operating costs of FGD units, as well as characteristics of

the units that may affect the costs of operation.25 Table 10 presents the variables chosen for

analysis in this section, along with descriptive statistics.26




it includes patents induced by changes in the relevant regulations.
24
   This table only presents results for the pre-1990 era. Changing the assumed rates affects the level of the effect,
but does not change the relative results between eras.
25
   Operating and maintenance costs are in 1982 dollars, and deflated using the producer price index for electric
utilities.
26
   The choice of variables concerning scrubber characteristics follows Bellas (1998).
Pollution Control Innovations and the Clean Air Act of 1990                                                            21


         Constructing the stocks of knowledge in the same way as in section IV, I regress the real

operating and maintenance (O&M) costs of scrubber units on characteristics of the scrubbers.27

Because knowledge will be correlated with the various characteristics of the scrubbers, I once

again use an instrumental variables approach, regressing the knowledge stock on policy and price

variables that influence the evolution of technology.28 These results give me predicted values for

the knowledge stock for each year from 1972-1997, which I use as an independent variable in the

O&M cost regressions. Proceeding as before, I first present results using a decay rate (β1) of 0.1,

and a rate of diffusion (β2) equal to 0.25.29

         Define OMi,t as the operating and maintenance cost of scrubber i in year t, KiP as the

predicted knowledge in the year that the scrubber was installed, d as a dummy variable equal to

one if the scrubber was installed since 1990, Zi as a vector of scrubber characteristics that do not

vary across time, such as plant location, and Xi,t as a vector of scrubber characteristics that do

vary over time. The model estimated is:

(4)                        OMi.t = α + βKiP + γ.KiP90 + χΖi + ηXi,t + wi,t

Because the key variables of interest do not vary over time, I use a random effects specification

of the error term, so that wi,t = εi,t + ui.

         Table 11 presents the regression results. Note that the knowledge stock has a significant

negative effect on operating costs in all eras, and the effect is somewhat larger during the 1990s.




27
   Similar results are obtained using the capital cost of scrubbers, except that the magnitude of the savings before
CAA90 is smaller, suggesting that plants were willing to accept larger upfront capital costs in exchange for lower
O&M costs. However, the capital expenditure data is not available for every unit, and is less reliable due to
reporting differences across plants. Thus, I only report the results for O&M costs in the paper.
28
   I regress the knowledge stock on a constant, two dummy variables stating whether NSPSD or NSPSDa are in
effect, the real price of low sulfur coal, current and lagged prices of SO2 permits, and a time trend.
29
   Autocorrelation does not appear to be a problem, as the Durbin-Watson statistic is 1.9.
Pollution Control Innovations and the Clean Air Act of 1990                                                          22


The signs of other variables are as expected.30 Table 12 presents sensitivity analysis of the

knowledge coefficients to the rates of decay and diffusion. For any given decay rate, the

coefficients fall as diffusion increases, and for any given rate of diffusion, the coefficients rise as

the decay rate rises.       Also, for low decay rates, knowledge has less impact on operating costs

after passage of the 1990 Clean Air Act.

         Table 13 presents the average operating cost savings resulting from a new pre-1990

patent. As before, panel A presents savings after one year, and panel B presents savings after

four years. For the ten percent decay rate and 25 percent diffusion rate, the average patent saves

a firm $4,077 after four years. This figure rises to $6,445 for patents granted in the 1990s. For

comparison, average O&M costs throughout the sample period are $3.05 million per year. In

general, the savings occurring after one year increase as the rate of diffusion increases.

However, for the highest rates of diffusion, the impact of knowledge is almost immediate, so the

highest savings after four years are for patents with mid-range rates of decay and diffusion.

         To put these numbers into perspective, it is interesting to consider the social value of a

new patent, in terms of O&M cost savings. If we assume a 30 year lifespan for a new FGD unit

and a 7% discount rate, the present value of cost savings from a new pre-1990 patent over the

life of the unit is $34,883. There are 174 firms included in the regression sample. If each firm,

on average, experiences these savings, the present value of total savings for the industry are

$6.07 million. For comparison, about $1.5 million of R&D are spent for each patent granted in




30
  I interact the age of the unit and the percent of time the FGD is in service because I assume these two variables are
related, as older units are more likely to break down. Without this interaction, the effect of age on operating costs is
positive, which would imply that individual units become cheaper to run as they age.

the United States.31 Thus, as would be expected, given the positive externalities that result from

research and development, the social returns to these patents are quite high.



V. Conclusions

        This paper began with a puzzle: despite theoretical evidence that market-based

environmental policies should increase innovation, the number of patents related to sulfur

dioxide pollution control fell after passage of the 1990 Clean Air Act, which instituted a market

for tradable SO2 permits. By combining data on flue gas desulfurization units with this patent

data, I find that, although the level of innovative activity fell after passage of the 1990 Clean Air

Act, the nature of innovative activity changed. Prior to 1990, most new plants were required to

install a scrubber with a 90% removal efficiency rating. As a result, there were no incentives for

R&D that would increase the ability of scrubbers to control pollution. However, there were

incentives to perform R&D to lower the costs of operating these scrubbers, and thus lower the

costs of complying with the regulation. In contrast, the SO2 permit market established by the

1990 Clean Air Act provided incentives to install scrubbers with higher removal efficiencies, and

thus led to more R&D designed to improve the removal efficiency of scrubbers.

        Analysis of the results suggests a couple of key points. First, it is important to note that

command and control regulations do provide incentives for R&D. However, the nature of the

R&D changes. In particular, the research preformed under the command and control regime did

not result in a cleaner environment, but just in lower compliance costs for utilities. Although

these lower costs are clearly valuable, unless the cost savings are passed on to consumers in the



31
  This figure represents $121,015 million of R&D spending from non-government sources in 1996, divided by
79,276 patents granted to U.S. non-government entities in 1998. The two-year lag allows time for the patents from
the R&D to go through the patenting process.

form of lower rates for electricity, these are rents captured by the firms.32 In comparison, the

benefits of cleaner air resulting from more efficient scrubbers affect society as a whole. Second,

the results raise the question of whether the resources devoted to such R&D could have been put

to more productive uses. That is, do command and control policies not only not encourage

productive R&D, but also lead to wasteful R&D spending to avoid the costs of regulation?

Finally, the results show that trends in patent or R&D data are not sufficient to monitor micro-

level trends in innovative activity. Information on the uses of new innovations is also important.

In particular, although the level of innovative activity related to scrubbers did not increase after

passage of the 1990 Clean Air Act, the types of innovative activity did change, so that innovation

after institution of market-based policies was more beneficial to the environment.




32
 Whether the rents are captured by the utilities themselves or the firms that produce the scrubbers depends on how
much market power the producers of new scrubbers have.
