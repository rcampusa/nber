        The question of who should provide education is nowhere more pressing than in developing countries.

While the academic controversy over school providers and school vouchers has raged most intensely in the

US, private schools account for only about 11% of US enrollment (USDOE, 1998). Moreover, over half of

American parents report that they are very satisfied with the public schools their children attend. In the

developing world, in contrast, private enrollment as a proportion of total enrollment is 2-3 times higher than

that in industrialized nations (James, 1993). Problems with public schools are usually more severe in low-

income countries, since the quality and integrity of public-sector service-delivery is highly correlated with

income levels (Rauch and Evans, 2000). In Indian schools, for example, a recent study found that one-third

of headmasters were absent at the time of the researchers' visit (PROBE Team, 1999), while in Kenya,

Glewwe, Kremer, and Moulin (2000) found that teachers were absent 28% of the time. The view that private

schools function better than public schools in the developing world has prompted calls for governments in

poor countries to experiment with demand-side financing programs such as vouchers (e.g, Psacharopolous,

Tan, and Jimenez, 1986).

        This paper presents evidence on the impact of one of the largest school voucher programs to date, the

Programa de Ampliaci√≥n de Cobertura de la Educaci√≥n Secundaria (PACES), a Colombian program which

provided over 125,000 pupils with vouchers covering somewhat more than half the cost of private secondary

school. Vouchers could be renewed as long as students maintained satisfactory academic performance. Since

many vouchers were awarded by lottery, we use a quasi-experimental research design comparing educational

and other outcomes of lottery winners and losers. Subject to a variety of caveats, the resulting estimates

provide evidence on program effects similar to those arising from a randomized trial. As far as we know, ours

is the first study of a private school voucher program in a developing country to take advantage of randomized

treatment.1

 US studies in this mold include Green, Peterson, and Du (1996) and Rouse (1998), who evaluated a voucher lottery
in Milwaukee. Rouse‚Äôs estimates, which control for attrition, show modest increases in math scores among voucher
recipients. Other US studies include Howell et al (2000), Myers et al (2000) and Bettinger (2001a), who evaluate
various private scholarship programs. Also related is McEwan and Carnoy (1999), who report differences-in-
differences estimates of spillover effects from a large-scale voucher program in Chile. Bellow and King (1993)
assess a smaller program in Bangladesh. The literature on public/private comparisons in the US is extensive. Two
recent studies are Evans and Schwab (1995) and Neal (1997). Cox and Jimenez (1991) compare public and private
        Our research strategy was to survey lottery winners and losers from three applicant cohorts. The

results from this survey show no significant enrollment differences between lottery losers and winners three

years after application, with most pupils in both the winner and loser groups still in school. But lottery

winners were 15 percentage points more likely to attend private schools rather than public schools. Moreover,

lottery winners had completed an additional .1 years of school and were about 10 percentage points more

likely than losers to have completed 8th grade, primarily because they repeated fewer grades. Although high

rates of grade repetition are a widely recognized problem in Latin America (see, e.g., Jacoby, 1994; and

Psacharopoulos and Velez, 1993), reduced repetition need not indicate greater learning. We therefore

administered achievement tests to a subset of the pupils surveyed. The test results suggest that, on average,

lottery winners scored about .2 standard deviations higher than losers, a large but only marginally significant

difference. The effect on girls is larger and more precisely estimated than the effect on boys.

        In addition to increased educational attainment and academic achievement, there is also some

evidence that the voucher program affected non-educational outcomes. In particular, lottery winners were

less likely to be married or cohabiting and worked about 1.2 fewer hours per week (again, mostly a difference

for girls). Both of these results suggest an increased focus on schooling among winners.

        While comparisons between winners and losers provide a simple strategy for assessing program

impact, our survey indicates that only about 90% of lottery winners had ever used the voucher or any other

type of scholarship, while 24% of losers received scholarships from other sources. It therefore seems

reasonable to think of lottery win/loss status as an instrument for scholarship receipt in a two-stage least

squares (2SLS) set-up. There is a strong first-stage here, though the relationship between voucher status and

scholarship use is not deterministic. Instrumenting for scholarship use with lottery win/loss status suggests

that scholarship use generated effects on grade completion and test scores that are roughly 50% larger than




schools in Colombia and Tanzania, and Jimenez, Lockheed, and Paqueo (1991) summarize comparisons in five
countries. See also the Patrinos and Ariasingham (1997) survey of demand-side financing in poor countries.
Glewwe, Kremer, and Moulin (2000) and Behrman, Sengupta, and Todd (2000) use randomization to examine other
educational interventions in developing countries.

the reduced form effect of winning the lottery.

          The last part of the paper presents a fiscal and cost-benefit analysis of the voucher program. Most

lottery winners would have attended private school anyway, at least for a few years, and therefore reduced

their educational expenditure in response to the program. On the other hand, voucher winners who were

induced to switch from public to private schools greatly increased their educational expenditure, since the

voucher covered only about half the cost of private school. On balance, winners‚Äô gross school fees exceeded

those of losers by about 70% of the amount they received from the voucher. This increase comes from the

discrete jump in fees for those who switched from public to private schools, and from the fact that winners

who would have gone to private school anyway spent more on school fees, possibly because they went to

better schools. Moreover, lottery winners worked less, so that, on balance, households winning the lottery

actually devoted more resources to education than the voucher face value. We also estimate that the voucher

program cost the government about $24 more per winner than the cost of creating a public school placement.

These costs to participants and the government are likely to have been outweighed by the benefits of the

voucher to participants -- in the form of the economic return to increased educational attainment and test

scores.

          The paper is organized as follows. Section I provides background on education in Colombia and

describes the PACES program in more detail. Section II discusses data and presents descriptive statistics from

our survey. Section III discusses the effect of the program on school choice and basic educational outcomes.

Section IV reports the effect of winning a voucher on test scores and non-education outcomes. Section V

discusses the use of lottery win/loss status as an instrument to identify the causal effect of receiving a

scholarship. Finally, Section VI looks at the effect of the program on household and government expenditure,

and compares program costs with the benefits to participants.

                                                 I. Background

        The Colombian government established the PACES program in late 1991 as part of a wider

decentralization effort and in an attempt to expand private provision of public services (King et al, 1997).

The program, which was partly funded by the World Bank, was also motivated as an effort to quickly expand

school capacity and to raise secondary school enrollment rates (King, Orazem, and Wolgemuth, 1998).2

Although 89% of Colombia‚Äôs primary-school age children were enrolled in 1993, only 75% of the eligible

population was enrolled in secondary schools. Among children of eligible age in the poorest quintile of the

population, 78% were enrolled in primary school, but only 55% were enrolled in secondary school (Sanchez

and Mendez, 1995; note that secondary school covers grades 6-11 in Colombia.)

        The PACES program targeted low-income families by offering vouchers only to children residing in

neighborhoods classified as falling into the two lowest socioeconomic strata (out of 6 possible strata).

Applicants had to submit a utility bill to establish residential location and voucher eligibility. A second

important feature of program targeting was that vouchers were offered only to children attending public

primary schools. This restriction further excluded upper-income households since almost half of children

from the richest income quintile attended private primary schools. Studies by Morales-Cobo (1993) and

Ribero and Tenjo (1997) suggests that the targeting was largely effective in Bogota.

        PACES vouchers were worth only about US$190 at the time of our survey. The maximum voucher

value was set initially to correspond to the average tuition of low-to-middle cost private schools in Colombia‚Äôs

three largest cities. Schools charging less than the vouchers‚Äô face value received only their usual tuition.

PACES vouchers became less generous over time because they did not keep up with inflation, and hence

recipients had to supplement vouchers with additional payments to cover school fees. Our survey data show

 PACES was launched in November 1991 with advertisements in print and on radio soliciting applicants in
participating cities (Calderon, 1996). A World Bank (1993) report on Colombian secondary schools notes that most
schools operated 2 or 3 shifts and that some towns have little room for additional pupils in spite of projected
enrollment growth. Other problems mentioned in the report include poor primary-school preparation, weak school
management, lack of teacher preparedness, lack of textbooks, and shortages of other supplemental materials. The
early 1990s was a general period of reform and liberalization in Colombia; see, for example, Kugler (1999).

                                                        4
matriculation and monthly fees for private schools attended by voucher applicants in 1998 averaged about

$340. By way of comparison, the average annual per-pupil public expenditure in Colombia‚Äôs public

secondary school system in 1995 was just over $350 (DNP, 1999), and public school parents in our sample

typically had to pay tuition or fees of roughly $58. Per capita GNP in Colombia is now around $2,280 (World

Bank, 1999).

        To qualify for a voucher, applicants must have been entering the Colombian secondary school cycle

which begins with grade 6, and be aged 15 or under. They must also have been admitted to a participating

secondary school (i.e., one that would accept the voucher).3 Participating schools had to be located in

participating towns, which included all of Colombia‚Äôs largest cities. Just under half of private schools in the

10 largest cities accepted vouchers in 1993.

        Participating schools tended to serve lower-income pupils, and to have lower tuition than non-

participating private schools. Schools with a vocational curriculum were also over-represented among those

in the program. Initially, vouchers were good at both for-profit and non-profit schools, but after 1996, for-

profit schools were excluded.4 The number of vouchers in use in any one year peaked at roughly 90,000 in

1994 and 1995. There were approximately 3.1 million secondary school pupils in Colombia in 1995, 37%

of whom attended private schools. In Bogota, roughly 58% of 567,000 secondary school pupils attended

private school.

        Test score comparisons reported by King et al (1997) show achievement levels in participating private

schools were very close to those in public schools, though significantly below achievement levels in non-

participating private schools. Similarly, pupil-teacher ratios and facilities were similar in public and

participating private schools, while non-participating private schools had lower pupil-teacher ratios and the

 Problems were reported with low-quality schools created to exploit the vouchers. But Calderon (1996) notes that
even before the non-profit restriction was imposed, only 15% of Bogota‚Äôs voucher students attended such
institutions.

                                                         5
best facilities. Clearly, then, relatively elite private schools opted-out of the PACES program. One reason

for this may have been a reluctance to interact with the bureaucracy in the Colombian Institute for Education,

Credit and Training Abroad (ICETEX), a government agency that ran the program. Moreover, vouchers were

insufficient to cover much of the tuition at more expensive schools, and some school managers probably

viewed the prospect of an influx of pupils from low-income backgrounds as undesirable. On the other hand,

many private schools in Colombia serving low-income populations apparently welcomed the PACES program.

        Voucher recipients were eligible for automatic renewal through eleventh grade, when Colombian high

school ends, provided the recipient‚Äôs academic performance warranted promotion to the next grade. Students

failing a grade were supposed to be dropped from the PACES program. Figures from Calderon (1996) show

that, on average, 77% of recipients renewed their vouchers, and estimates from our data are similar. By way

of comparison, the national high school promotion rate was about 70%. Students who transferred from one

participating private school to another could, in principle, transfer the voucher to the new school. In practice,

however, our survey suggests many students who transferred schools after winning lost their vouchers.

        Cities and towns used lotteries to allocate vouchers when demand exceeded supply. Municipal

governments paid 20% of the voucher cost, while the central government paid 80%. Each municipality

decided how many vouchers to fund, subject to a maximum allocated to towns by the central government.

This allocation was determined by estimating the shortfall between primary school enrollment and the

available space in public secondary schools. Voucher award rates therefore varied considerably by city and

year, depending on the ratio of applicants to available vouchers. Regional ICETEX offices worked with

individual municipalities to determine the number of vouchers to be funded, to check school requirements for

participation, and to monitor implementation of the program. The Bogota ICETEX office provided software

and instructions to regional offices for the purposes of random selection of applicants in cases of over-

subscription. We obtained copies of lists of lottery winners and losers from ICETEX offices.5

 In a few cities, the local ICETEX office assigned vouchers based on pupils‚Äô primary school performance instead of
randomly.

A. Descriptive Statistics

         Beginning in the summer of 1998, we interviewed roughly 1,600 PACES applicants, stratifying to

obtain approximately equal numbers of winners and losers. Interviewing was limited to the 1995 and 1997

applicant cohorts from Bogota and the 1993 applicant cohort from Jamundi, a suburb of Cali. These years

and cities were chosen for a combination of scientific and practical reasons. The largest and longest-running

voucher program was in Bogota, and our survey team is based there. Cali is Colombia's second largest city

and therefore also important, but almost no Cali applicants had phones, so we concentrated on a suburb,

Jamundi. Telephones were used for the majority of interviews, primarily to reduce costs, but also because

of interviewer safety and logistical considerations. In principle, the lottery was random within localities and

conditional on whether households have access to a telephone (even if it is a neighbor‚Äôs phone). The results

should therefore yield internally valid estimates of the causal effect of the program on voucher applicants with

access to a telephone in surveyed cities. Over 80% of applicants had access to a phone, and in the Bogota

1995 cohort, 88% had access to a phone.

         Table 1 reports descriptive statistics for the sampling frame, attempted contacts and completed

interviews.6 There were 6,156 applicants in the three applicant cohorts of interest. We attempted to interview

almost 3,000 applicants, obtaining an overall response rate of 54% and a response rate of almost 61% for the

1997 Bogota lottery. The higher response rate in the most recent lottery is not surprising since contact

information for 1997 applicants is more recent. Interviews were completed with 55% of lottery winners and

53% of lottery losers. Although this response rate is far from ideal, the fact that winners and losers were

almost equally likely to be interviewed is encouraging because the question of sample selection bias turns on

whether voucher status is correlated with response probabilities (see, e.g., Angrist, 1997). Because response

probabilities are virtually uncorrelated with voucher status, there should be little bias from our failure to

interview all applicants.7

         The typical applicant was about 13 years old at the time of application, while average age on the

survey date varied from 13 for 1997 applicants to 17 for 1993 applicants. About half of the applicants were

male. Roughly 85% of applicants were still in school, enrolled in grades ranging from 6th for the 1997 cohort

to 8th or 9th for the 1993 cohort. The descriptive statistics also show that almost 90% of the applicants we

interviewed started 6th grade in private school. This reflects the fact that eligibility for PACES vouchers was

conditional on admission to a participating private school. Thus, most lottery losers went to private school

anyway, at least for one year. On the other hand, only 63% of applicants were still in private school as of the

survey date.



B. Personal Characteristics and Voucher Status

         There is little evidence of any association between win/loss status and the individual characteristics

measured in our data from Bogota, although winners and losers are less comparable in the 1993 Jamundi

cohort. This can be seen in Table 2, which reports means and differences by win/loss status for all applicants

in the study population, for sampled applicants, and for the sample of completed surveys. The sampling

process began with lists showing applicant ID numbers, names, addresses, and phone numbers, separately for

winners and losers. To obtain demographic characteristics for all applicants, whether surveyed or not, we

imputed applicant age using ID numbers (which incorporate birthdays). We note, however, that our strategy

of imputing ages is subject to error since 13% of applicants have invalid ID numbers.8 We excluded


7
 The vast majority of non-responders were people we could not reach by telephone, either because they had moved or
because the telephone number we had no longer worked. Roughly 3% of families contacted refused to answer. The
only significant difference in response rates by win/loss status is for the Jamundi cohort. In what follows, we present
results for the Bogota 1995 cohort and the combined cohorts separately. Complete follow-up is the holy grail of
education research. Even careful evaluation studies using randomized and quasi-randomized designs (e.g., Rouse,
1998; Krueger and Whitmore, 2001) are based on samples with substantial loss to follow-up. Similarly, Howell et al
(2000) report follow-up rates similar to ours for US voucher trials in three cities.
8
  Plausible IDs have 11 digits, the first 6 of which record birth dates. Correct ID numbers satisfy an equation
involving a control digit and the other 10 digits. Random deviations, say, because of incomplete recording,
transposition of digits, or errors in a single digit, fail to satisfy this algorithm with very high probability. The check
formula is as follows. Let the jth digit be dj, for j=1,10 and d11 be the control digit. Let {cj; j=1,11} be the sequence

                                                             8
observations in which the applicant was younger than 9 or older than 25. In practice, this restriction affected

few observations. A second variable from the applicant record is gender. We used first names to assign sex

for about 80% of the applicants. A final variable from the applicant record is a dummy for whether the record

included a phone number.

        Winners and losers have similar telephone access, age, and sex mix in the 1995 and 1997 Bogota data.

As a further check on randomness, we compared win rates by school in those schools with more than 20

applicants to city averages in the Bogota data from 1995. No school had a win rate that differed significantly

from the city average. In the Jamundi-93 sample, however, there are significant differences in average age

and gender by win/loss status. Because the differences between winners and losers in the Jamundi lottery may

indicate non-random assignment of vouchers, and because the 1997 Bogota cohort is too recent for a good

reading on some outcomes, we present results from the Bogota-95 sample separately from the results for the

pooled sample including all three cohorts.



                       III. Impact on Scholarship Use, School Choice, and Schooling

        Our estimates of lottery effects are based on the following regression model:

                          yic = XiNŒ≤0 + Œ±0Zi + Œ¥c + Œµic,                                                      (1)

where yic is the dependent variable for child i from application cohort c (defined by city and year); Xi

represents a vector of individual and survey characteristics like age, sex, and whether the survey was

telephone or in-person; Zi is an indicator for whether child i won the voucher lottery; and Œ¥c is a cohort effect.

The coefficient of interest is Œ±0. We estimate (1) using three sets of control variables: ‚Äúno controls‚Äù, i.e.,

excluding the Xi variables; ‚Äúbasic controls‚Äù including the Xi variables; and ‚Äúbasic plus barrio controls‚Äù which

includes the Xi variables plus 19 neighborhood dummies in the Bogota-95 sample.

A. Effects on Scholarship Use and School Choice

        We begin with a simple analysis of the effect of winning the lottery on private school scholarship

receipt and the choice between public and private school. The most immediate effect of the lottery was to

increase the likelihood of receiving a private school scholarship. This can be seen in the first row of Table

3, which shows that at the time of our survey, voucher winners were 51 percentage points more likely than

losers to have been using some kind of scholarship. Not all winners were using their PACES vouchers in the

survey year. This is because 15% of winners were not in school at all, and another 16% were in public

schools, and therefore ineligible for scholarships. Some lottery winners also lost their voucher after repeating

a grade (7%), while 5% switched to non-participating private schools or failed to complete the paperwork for

a transfer. Others attended schools that stopped accepting vouchers or lost their vouchers for unreported

reasons. Just as not all winners were using a scholarship, some losers obtained scholarships from programs

other than PACES and one loser was awarded a PACES voucher after re-applying the following year.

        At the time of the survey, enrollment rates were .83 for losers and .85 for winners in the Bogota-95

sample, an insignificant difference. The estimates in Table 3 also show that most PACES applicants entered

6th grade in a private secondary school, and most finished 6th grade whether or not they won a voucher. But

lottery winners were 6-7 percentage points more likely than losers to have begun 6th grade in private school,

and 15-16 percentage points more likely to be in private school at the time of our survey. The effect of

winning the PACES lottery on the probability of private school attendance was even larger in 7th grade,

probably because losers were more likely to have left private school by then.

        These results suggest the decision between public and private school was sensitive to variation in the

price of private school induced by the program, while the decision whether to attend school was not.9 This

is consistent with a model in which those households most willing and able to pay for education attend private

school; a middle group attends public school; and those least willing or able to pay do not attend at all. In this


9
 We can convert the private-school enrollment effects to an elasticity as follows. PACES vouchers reduced the
marginal cost of private school attendance by about 50%, while vouchers increased private school enrollment in 7th
grade by about 17%. The implied elasticity of private enrollment with respect to marginal cost is therefore .34.

                                                        10
case, no one is on the private school/no school margin, and so small subsidies to private education do not

directly increase overall enrollment.10 Since many public schools in Colombia were turning away applicants

due to overcrowding, PACES is likely to have opened up places in public school for other pupils by reducing

public-school queuing.



B. Effects on Schooling

        Lottery winners completed more schooling than losers, and were less likely to repeat grades. For

example, lottery losers had completed 7.5 years of schooling at the time of our survey, but winners in the 1995

Bogota sample completed an additional .12-.16 years (.8 years in the full sample). As noted earlier, there was

no statistically significant effect on enrollment. The effect on years of schooling and the lack of an effect on

enrollment is primarily the result of a reduced probability of grade repetition for winners. This is reflected

in a sharp increase in the likelihood lottery winners had finished 8th grade as of the survey date, with a smaller

impact on 7th grade completion. In the Bogota-95 sample, over 20% of losers had repeated a grade since

beginning 6th grade, and almost 20% repeated 6th grade. But the probability of grade repetition was reduced

by 5-6 percentage points for lottery winners.

        The estimates of Œ±0 change little as the list of control variables changes, a result to be expected since

the voucher lottery was random. The estimation results are also similar in the Bogota-95 and full samples,

and are largely invariant to the inclusion of neighborhood effects. Estimates and standard errors for the

Bogota 1995 sample also change little in models with school effects.

        Separate results by sex, reported in Table 4, show moderately larger effects on educational attainment

for girls, though the pattern of sex differences in the effects on private school enrollment are not clear cut.

Results for the Bogota-95 sample show male lottery winners with an insignificant 0.12 more years of

schooling while female lottery winners obtained 0.14 years more of schooling, a statistically significant effect.


10
  PACES subsidies were initially large enough to cover the entire cost of private school, and may have shifted
recipients from no school to private school when the program started. However, the voucher value was later eroded
by inflation.

                                                       11
Differences by sex are more pronounced in the full sample, with an insignificant 0.06 more years of schooling

for boys, and a statistically significant 0.12 more years of schooling for girls. It should also be noted that

while effects for boys are almost entirely due to grade repetition, the effects for girls appear to come from both

reduced grade repetition and additional time spent in school.11

         The greater probability of 8th grade completion and lower repetition rates for lottery winners seem like

desirable outcomes. In fact, high rates of grade repetition in Latin America are widely seen as symptomatic

of poorly functioning public schools.12 But the interpretation of these effects is complicated by the fact that

pupils who failed a grade were supposed to forfeit PACES vouchers. Private schools may therefore have had

an incentive to promote pupils with vouchers even if their performance did not meet normal promotional

standards. To explore this possibility, we look at effects on test scores and non-educational outcomes in the

next section.



                           IV. Effects on Test Scores and Non-Education Outcomes

A. Effects on Test Scores

         We tested children from the 1995 applicant cohort in three Bogota neighborhoods.                           These

neighborhoods were chosen because they had relatively large numbers of winners and losers, and because of

the availability of suitable testing sites. The tests were administered in 1999, approximately one year after

our household survey. The test sample was drawn from applicants for whom we had survey data. Participants

were solicited by telephone, followed by hand delivery of letters describing the purpose of the test and inviting

pupils to be tested. Those who failed to appear on the test day were invited again for a second testing, except

at the last sitting. To encourage participation, refreshments were provided at each site, and each test

concluded with the raffle of a bicycle and other prizes. Pupils were also given 5 or 10 thousand pesos (US


11
  There is little evidence that the effect of winning the voucher varied with applicants' socioeconomic strata of
residence or parents‚Äô education. However, estimates for subgroups are imprecise.
12
 For example, Psacharopolous and Velez (1993) and Harbison and Hanushek (1992) use repetition rates as a
measure of school quality in Colombia and Brazil.

                                                          12
$3.23 or $6.45) to cover travel costs.         The invitation letter noted the offer of refreshments, travel

reimbursement, and raffle. See the data appendix for additional details on the testing set-up.

        Our evaluation used La Prueba de Realizacion, a grade-specific multiple-choice achievement test for

native Spanish speakers, published by Riverside. We administered only the mathematics, reading, and writing

subtests, each taking about 30 minutes. This test was chosen because Colombian educators participated in

test development and the test had been used previously in Colombia (Cole et al, 1993). An appendix table

compares test results from the Hispanic-American test-norming populations for grades 9 and 10 with the

results from our test. Colombian 9th graders scored lower than American pupils in mathematics, but they had

reading skills slightly better than American 10th graders. The average Colombian writing score was close to

the average score for American 10th graders.



The Test Sample

        The pupils invited to be tested were not a random sample, but they have characteristics similar to

those in the full Bogota 1995 sample. This can be seen in the first two columns of Table 5, which describe

the characteristics of all 1,176 Bogota 1995 applicants surveyed, and the 473 applicants invited for testing.

Of those invited, 283 were tested, a response rate of 60%. Those tested were younger, and came from a poorer

background as measured by father‚Äôs education and wages, than the no-shows. Importantly, however, there

is no significant relationship between the probability of being tested and voucher status. Also encouraging

is the fact that, conditional on taking the test, there is little evidence of differences in personal characteristics

between winners and losers. Differences by voucher status are reported in column 5 of Table 5.



Test results

        Table 6 reports estimates of the effect of winning the voucher lottery on test scores. Columns 1 and




                                                        13
2 of Table 6 show results from models with and without covariates.13 Columns 3 and 4 present the results of

estimating a single voucher coefficient for stacked subject results, in models with a pupil random effect. That

is, we estimated:

                  yis = XiNŒ≤0 + Œ±0Zi + Œ¥i + Œµis,                                                                    (2)

where yis is pupil i‚Äôs score in subject s, and Œ¥i is a random effect used to adjust standard errors for the fact that

there is likely to be within-pupil correlation across subjects. Note that test score results are reported in

standard deviation units.

         Lottery winners scored just over .2 standard deviations more than lottery losers, though this difference

is (not surprisingly, given the small test sample) only marginally significant. According to US norms for La

Prueba, 2/10 of a standard deviation is roughly the score gain associated with one additional school year (Cole

et al, 1993). This effect should probably therefore be seen as large, in view of the fact that subjects were

tested three years after applying to the program. Lottery winners also scored higher on all subtests, though

the only significant difference is for reading scores (t=1.8). The results for the stacked subjects, reported in

columns 3 and 4, also show marginally significantly higher scores for lottery winners, with the largest effects

for models that stack math and reading scores only.

         Models estimated separately for boys and girls generate larger and more precise effects for girls than

boys. For example, the estimated effect on total points for girls, reported in column 2 of Panel B for models

with covariates, is .26 (s.e.=.12). The corresponding estimate for boys, reported in Panel C, is .17 (s.e.=.18).

The finding of a stronger effect on girls echoes some of the survey results.

         Earlier we noted that the fact that lottery winners were less likely to repeat grades may have been due

to a reduction in promotion standards for lottery winners, as well as any increased learning or change in school

quality. Further evidence that the grade repetition results are not due solely to schools' lowering the bar for

promotion of winners is provided by comparing the test scores of winners and losers who were promoted.


13
  The results in column 1 and 3 are from models that include site dummies only. The results in columns 2 and 4 are
from models that include controls for age, sex, parents‚Äô schooling, strata of residence, type of interview, and survey
form.

                                                          14
To see this, suppose that both test scores and grade promotion depend on underlying learning, but the program

itself had no effect on achievement. This scenario can be shown to imply that if promotion standards are

relaxed for winners, then average test scores for lottery winners who are promoted should be lower than

average test scores for lottery losers who are promoted.14 In practice, the composite test scores of winners

who were promoted are about .14 standard deviations greater than the scores of promoted losers, although

the difference is not significant.



B. Other Outcomes

        Table 7 reports estimates of the effect of winning the lottery on non-educational outcomes.

Approximately 1.6% of lottery losers from Bogota were married or living with a companion, a low proportion

consistent with the fact that the average age of survey respondents was about 15. Since this outcome is rare,

we estimated probit models as well as linear probability models.

        Both probit marginal effects and OLS estimates suggest that marriage and cohabitation were reduced

for lottery winners, a marginally significant effect. There is also some evidence from the pooled sample that

lottery winners were less likely to be working than losers, with the largest effects in Bogota. There is also

a significant difference in hours worked. In particular, lottery winners worked 1.2 fewer hours per week than

losers. This effect is larger and more precisely estimated for girls. The reduction in work may be due to

income effects for the household, the greater time demands of private school relative to public school, or

increased incentives for lottery winners to spend time studying so as to avoid failing a grade and losing the

PACES voucher.




14
  Suppose schools promote if a random variable x is greater than a cutoff c, which takes on two values, cW for
winners and cL for losers. Suppose cW < cL, but test scores, T, and the variable x are unaffected by winning the
lottery. Then the expected test score for lottery losers who are promoted is E(T| x > cL). The expected score for
winners will be a weighted average of this and E(T| cW < x < cL). Average scores for promoted losers will therefore
exceed average scores for promoted winners as long as E(T| x) is increasing in x.

                                                         15
                         V. Instrumental Variables Estimates of Scholarship Effects

        The analysis so far focuses on reduced form effects of winning the lottery. In the discussion of Table

3, however, we noted that some lottery losers were awarded other scholarships, while some winners failed

to use or retain their PACES scholarships. This section reports 2SLS estimates of the effect of ever receiving

any scholarship using voucher win/loss status as an instrumental variable (IV). While only 6% of lottery

losers used a scholarship at the time of the survey, 24% had used a scholarship at some point. In contrast,

90% of winners used a scholarship at some time. The 2SLS estimates based on this difference are necessarily

larger than the reduced form effects of winning the lottery since winning the lottery is only imperfectly

correlated with receiving a scholarship.

        The assumption that a scholarship use dummy satisfies an exclusion restriction in an instrumental

variables (IV) setup motivates 2SLS estimation of the equation:

                 yi = XiNŒ≤1 + Œ±1si + Œæi,                                                                    (3)

where si is a dummy for scholarship use, and Xi is the vector of ‚Äúbasic controls‚Äù used in previous tables. The

associated first-stage relationship using Zi as an instrument is

                 si = XiNŒ≥ + œÄZi + Œ∑i,                                                                      (4)

The estimate of œÄ is about .66 (s.e.=.021), so the second-stage estimates can be expected to be about 50%

larger than the corresponding reduced form estimates. The interpretation of Œ±1 in this case is as an

approximate effect of treatment on the subset of scholarship users who would not have used a scholarship

without PACES (Imbens and Angrist, 1994).

        The 2SLS estimate of the effect of scholarship use on highest grade completed is about .2 in the

Bogota-95 sample and .13 in the full sample. These estimates are reported in Table 8. 2SLS estimates of

voucher effects on the probability of finishing eighth grade are 13-15 percentage points, nearly a 25% increase

in completion rates. This is large by the standards of the literature on the enrollment effects of financial aid

for college (see, e.g., Fuller, Manski, and Wise, 1982; Kane, 1995), though we know of no comparable results

for subsidies to private secondary schools. Another interesting result is the 2SLS estimate of the effect on


                                                      16
test scores, .29, somewhat smaller than the corresponding OLS estimate. The 2SLS estimates are likely to

be more useful for predicting the impact of scholarship programs on new scholarship recipients than are the

reduced form effects, which are diluted by take-up rates less than one and the availability of alternative

financing.



                          VI. Impact on Household and Government Expenditure

        This section discusses the impact of the program on household and government budgets. We begin

by showing that approximately 70% of voucher funds flowed to education, with the remainder going to

educational spending that households would have made without the voucher. Taking into account the

reduction in work by lottery winners suggests that winning the lottery induced households to devote more net

resources to education. The higher fees paid by voucher winners are due primarily to winners‚Äô greater

likelihood of attending private school. However, there is also some evidence that applicants who would have

attended private schools anyway traded up to more expensive private schools in response to winning the

voucher. Since the voucher did not reduce the cost of private school at the margin, this result weighs against

the simplest models of education as human capital investment without credit constraints. The results in

section B suggest that it cost the government about $24 more per lottery winner to provide school places

through PACES than through the public system. Finally, section C aggregates the impact on households,

schools, and the government budget, arguing that the total social costs of providing additional school places

through the PACES voucher system were small, and therefore dwarfed by the benefits of the program to

participants. The analysis in this section uses data for the 1995 Bogota applicant cohort only.



A. Impact on Household Educational Expenditure

        Three years after the 1995 lottery in Bogota, about 55% of winners and 5% of losers were still

receiving scholarships (a result from Table 3 repeated in the first row of Table 9 for the sample of

observations with usable fee data). As noted earlier, 53% of losers were still in private school in the survey


                                                     17
year, with an increase of about 15% for winners.

        Among applicants to the Bogota 95 lottery, winners received an average of $74 more in scholarship

aid than losers, result reported in the fourth row of Table 9. Conditional on receiving a scholarship,

scholarship amounts were similar for winners and losers, at roughly $200. The estimates in Table 9 also show

gross matriculation and tuition fees were $52 greater for lottery winners than losers. Thus, the 1998 voucher

expenditures of $74 per winner caused an increase of $52 in gross fees for winners, about 70% of the extra

amount received by winners on average. The remaining $22 of voucher funds presumably increased non-

educational expenditures by lottery winners.15

        Aside from paying for school fees, households bear the opportunity cost of the effort students devote

to education. The estimates for non-educational outcomes in Table 7 suggest lottery winners spent 1.2 fewer

hours working each week. According to our survey data, the average hourly wage was 71 cents.16 Assuming

that students work 48 weeks per year, this reduction corresponds to an opportunity cost of 1.2 x $.71 x 48

weeks, approximately $41. Combining the increase of $52 in expenditures on fees and the $41 of lost

earnings, we estimate that PACES lottery winners devoted $93 more to education than losers in the survey

year, or 126% of the $74 in extra scholarship assistance they received.



Disaggregating Effects on Fees

        While winning households spent about $52 more on school fees, on average, this average conceals

important heterogeneity. Since vouchers covered only part of the cost of private school, families with children

who were induced to switch to private school increased their educational expenditure sharply. However, most

of the applicants who lost the lottery started private school in 6th grade anyway, and over half were still in



15
  The estimated displacement of private expenditure is even lower when a more comprehensive expenditure measure
is used. Lottery winners report an estimated $84 more in comprehensive scholarship assistance (i.e., including
expenditure on uniforms and textbooks) and an extra $74 more in comprehensive educational expenditure.
16
 Conditional on working, the average daily wage in our sample is $5.71. We estimate the hourly wage assuming a 7-
hour work day.

                                                       18
private school in the survey year. So most vouchers were received by applicants who would have attended

private school without the vouchers.

        Simple models of education as human capital investment with perfect credit markets suggest that since

PACES vouchers were worth only $190 per year, while most private schools cost over $300 per year, vouchers

were infra-marginal. In other words, vouchers were not large enough to have caused households to increase

educational spending by choosing a more expensive private school.17 On the other hand, winning the voucher

could have led households to choose more expensive private schools if educational spending is limited by

credit constraints or if education has consumption value as well as investment value.

        In a non-causal, purely accounting sense, the $52 of increased expenditure by winners on school fees

can be decomposed into the effects of increased private school enrollment, and a switch to more expensive

private schools by winners. Let Z be a dummy for lottery win/loss status as before, except we now drop i

subscripts to simplify notation. Also, let R denote type of school attended (1 for private, 0 for public) and let

F denote education expenditure. Gross school fees conditional on lottery win/loss status (i.e, fees paid by

pupils without subtracting voucher amounts) are equal to

                 E[F| Z] = E[F| Z, R=1]P[R=1| Z] + E[F| Z, R=0]P[R=0| Z].

The overall change in fees is a linear combination of changes in public/private enrollment and changes in fees

charged by school type. We can simplify the fee contrast between winners and losers using the fact that public

school fees changed little and overall school enrollment was also affected little, so that P[R=1| Z=1]-P[R=1|

Z=0] .-{P[R=0| Z=1]-P[R=0| Z=0]}. Then we have the accounting relationship:

        E[F| Z=1]-E[F| Z=0]

        = {E[F| Z=1, R=1]-E[F| Z=1, R=0]}{P[R=1| Z=1]-P[R=1| Z=0]}

                          + P[R=1| Z=0]{E[F| Z=1, R=1]-E[F| Z=0, R=1]}.                                           (5)

In words, the overall fee increase is caused by the private-public fee difference for winners, times private-

 To see this, note that if education is pure human capital investment, people choose schools so that a school costing
one dollar more generates exactly one more dollar of present discounted earnings. For people who would in any case
have attended a school costing more than $190, the voucher does not affect this first order condition.

school enrollment effects of the program, plus the win/loss contrast in fees for private-school pupils.18 The

right hand side components of (5) are as follows:

         P[R=1| Z=1]-P[R=1| Z=0] = .15

         E[F| Z=1, R=1]-E[F| Z=1, R=0] = 343-58=285

         E[F| Z=1, R=1]-E[F| Z=0, R=1] = 11

         P[R=1| Z=0] = .53.

This implies a total effect of $49, which is less than $52 because of the approximation used to simplify (5),

with $43 due to school switching. Thus, in an accounting sense, the bulk of the change in household

expenditure can be attributed to increased private school enrollment. However, for reasons discussed below,

this decomposition provides an incomplete picture of the causal effect of the program on the fee distribution.

         Causal effects on fees for families who would have sent their children to private school anyway are

difficult to measure since we do not know who these families are. Simply comparing fees by win/loss status

conditional on private school attendance (the second term in (5), above) leads to a biased estimate that is

almost certainly too low. To see this, let F0 be the public or private fee a pupil would pay if he or she loses

the lottery and let F1 be the public or private fee he or she would pay if he or she wins, and let R0 and R1

denote private school attendance if a pupil loses or wins the lottery respectively. Similarly, let f0 be the private

school fee a pupil would pay if he or she loses the lottery and let f1 be the private school fee a pupil would

pay if he or she wins. Thus f0 = F0√óR0 and f1 = F1√óR1. We imagine that these variables are defined for every

pupil, though in practice, we can only observe F0 , R0, and f0 for losers and F1, R1, and f1 for winners. E[f1 -

f0| f0>0] is the effect on fees for those who would attend private school even if they were to lose the lottery.

The observed contrast in fees for private school pupils can be written as follows

         E[F| Z=1, R=1]-E[F| Z=0, R=1] = E[f1 - f0| f0>0] + {E[f1| f1>0] - E[f1| f0>0]}                         (6)



18
  Without simplification the comparison is
         E[F| Z=1]-E[F| Z=0]
         = P[R=1| Z=0]{E[F| Z=1, R=1]-E[F| Z=0, R=1]} + E[F| Z=1, R=1]{P[R=1| Z=1]-P[R=1| Z=0]}
         + P[R=0| Z=0]{E[F| Z=1, R=0]-E[F| Z=0, R=0]} + E[F| Z=1, R=0]{P[R=0| Z=1]-P[R=0| Z=0]}.

                                                        20
The term in curly brackets comes from selection bias in the conditional-on-positive contrast. Under mild

assumptions, this term is negative.19 Assuming, as seems likely, that f1$f0, the left hand side therefore is a

lower bound on the causal effect, E[f1 - f0| f0>0].

         The parameter E[f1 - f0| f0>0] is not identified without further assumptions (see, e.g., Chamberlain,

1986), though the previous discussion suggests we can treat the observed contrast in fees for private school

students as a lower bound. Under mild assumptions, we can obtain a reasonably tight upper bound on this

and a related family of parameters: E[f1 - f0| f0>m0(Œ∏)] where m0(Œ∏) is the Œ∏-quantile of the losers‚Äô fee

distribution. By choosing m0(Œ∏)=0, we bound E[f1 - f0| f0>0], while picking points at higher quantiles, we

measure the effect on those who would have spent more on private schooling in the absence of the lottery.

For example, we can bound the effect of winning the lottery on private school fees for those who would have

spent more than the voucher amount ($190) on private school fees in the absence of the lottery. This result

is stated formally below:



Proposition. Suppose that F1 $ F0. Let m0(Œ∏) be the Œ∏ quantile of the distribution F for losers, with m1(Œ∏)

defined similarly for winners. Then

         E[f1-f0| f0>m0(Œ∏)] #{E[F| Z=1, F>m1(Œ∏)] - E[F| Z=0, F>m0(Œ∏)]}/P[R=1| Z=0, F>m0(Œ∏)].                      (6)



Proof. Define FM = F01(F0 # m0(Œ∏)) + F01(F0 >m0(Œ∏), R0=0) + F11(F0 >m0(Œ∏), R0=1). Note that FM = F1 for
households above the quantile who would have attended private schools anyway. Otherwise, FM = F0. So F1
$ FM $ F0. Let pŒ∏ = P[R0=1| F0>m0(Œ∏)]. Then




19
  This is easy to show in a model where f1=h(f0) for any increasing transformation. More generally, winners who
attend private school only if they win probably attend cheaper private schools than those who attend regardless in a
variety of plausible models. Suppose, for example, that school quality complements ability and higher quality
schools are more expensive. Then low-ability children attend public schools if they lose the lottery and attend cheap
private schools if they win the lottery, while high-ability children attend expensive private schools whether or not
they win a voucher. Alternatively, consider a model with credit constraints in which the poor attend public school;
the rich attend private school; and the very rich attend expensive private schools. Then lottery winners who would
have attended public school if they lost the lottery will attend cheaper schools than lottery winners who would have
attended private school even if they lost.

                                                         21
        E[FM | F0 > m0(Œ∏)] - E[F0 | F0 >m0(Œ∏)]
        = {pŒ∏E[F1 | F0 > m0(Œ∏), R0=1] + (1 - pŒ∏)E[F0 | F0 > m0(Œ∏), R0=0]} - E[F0 | F0 > m0(Œ∏)].
Note that
        E[F0 | F0 > m0(Œ∏)] = pŒ∏E[F0 | F0 > m0(Œ∏), R0=1] + (1 - pŒ∏)E[F0 | F0 > m0(Œ∏), R0=0].
Therefore,
        E[FM | F0 > m0(Œ∏)] - E[F0 | F0 >m0(Œ∏)] = pŒ∏E[F1 - F0 | F0 > m0(Œ∏), R0=1].
Since f0=R0F0, this implies
        {E[FM | F0 > m0(Œ∏)] - E[F0 | F0 >m0(Œ∏)}/ pŒ∏ = E[f1-f0 | f0> m0(Œ∏)],
which is the quantity we seek to bound. Also, since F1$FM$F0 for all applicants, E[F1 | F1 > m1(Œ∏)] $ E[F1 |
F0 > m0(Œ∏)] $ E[FM | F0 > m0(Œ∏)], and we have
        E[F1 | F1 > m1(Œ∏)] - E[F0 | F0 > m0(Œ∏)] $ E[FM | F0 > m0(Œ∏)] - E[F0 | F0 > m0(Œ∏)].
By randomization, E[F1 | F1 > m1(Œ∏)] = E[F| Z=1, F>m1(Œ∏)] and E[F0 | F0 > m0(Œ∏)] = E[F| Z=0, F>m0(Œ∏)] and
pŒ∏ = P[R=1| Z=0, F>m0(Œ∏)], which implies (6) and completes the proof.



        To see why the upper bound works in the case where Œ∏=0, note that E(FM-F0) is the average difference

between winners‚Äô and losers‚Äô fees due to households who would have attended private schools in any case

trading up to more expensive private schools. This is less than the observed difference in total fee payments

by win/loss status, E(F1-F0). The econometric intuition for this result is that in parametric sample selection

models, controlling for the probability of sample selection eliminates selection bias. Comparing winners and

losers at the same quantiles equalizes the ‚Äúprobability of selection‚Äù if F1 = h(F0) for some monotone

increasing transformation, h(). In fact, with no public school fees, the bound is exact when F1 = h(F0). More

generally, dividing by P[R=1| Z=0, F>m0(Œ∏)] corrects for the fact that some of those with positive fees were

attending public school, and the bound applies even without a deterministic link between F0 and F1.

        Estimates of (6) are reported in Table 10, along with a lower bound using the biased comparison for

quantiles analogous to (6), i.e., E[F| Z=1,R=1]F>m0(Œ∏)]-E[F| Z=0,R=1]F>m0(Œ∏)]. As noted earlier, this is a

plausible lower bound because of negative selection bias. Note also that any reasonable behavioral model

would predict that a family that spent less than the voucher amount on private school without a voucher would

spend more after the voucher. We therefore focus on bounding effects that are conditional on paying pre-



                                                      22
voucher fees equal to at least the voucher amount, roughly $190.

        Among losers paying at least $190 in fees, the average fee was $371. Almost all of these pupils were

in private school (in fact, some reports of public school fees above $190 are probably in error; others refer

to a handful of elite public schools that charge significant fees). The lower bound on E[f1-f0| f0>190] is about

$3, but the upper bound is $38. The voucher amount of $190 is the .52 quantile of the fee distribution. Above

this amount, the bounds are tighter. The estimated upper bounds above .6 range from $31 to $48, while the

lower bounds range from $9 to $28. The lower bound estimates are not significantly different from zero at

the 5% level. In some cases, however, the lower bounds are close to a 10% significance level, while the

upper bounds allow for effects on the order of 10% of fee costs and 20% of the voucher value. Thus, it seems

likely that winners in the upper half of the fee distribution spent 5-10% more on private schools than they

otherwise would have. This implies that the marginal propensity to spend voucher income on more expensive

private schools was non-trivial, counter to a simple model of human capital investment without credit

constraints.



Price discrimination by private schools

        Another potential source of increased expenditure on fees by winners is price discrimination. There

is little evidence that private schools discriminated by charging more to applicants with PACES scholarships.

The easiest way for schools to price discriminate was to offer scholarships to those less likely to be able to

afford education at the full price, i.e., applicants without PACES vouchers. In practice, however, we found

little evidence of price discrimination. Our survey indicates that roughly 6% of losers in private school

received a school scholarship, while 3% of winners in private school received a school scholarship. This is

a small and insignificant difference. Per lottery winner, i.e., without conditioning on attending private school,

the difference is only about 1%.




                                                       23
B. Impact on the Government Budget

        The PACES program was established in part to expand secondary school enrollment without using

the public system. We estimate that the program increased public educational expenditure by about $24 per

lottery winner, relative to the cost of accommodating these pupils in public school. As discussed in Section

III, winners were no more likely than losers to attend school, but the program probably did expand overall

school enrollment by freeing up places in public schools as lottery winners transferred to private schools.

        To see where the $24 figure comes from, note that the probability of attending public school, reported

in Table 9, fell by 0.14 for lottery winners. The average per-pupil cost of a secondary school slot was about

$350, excluding implicit rental for school facilities. In the short run, the marginal cost of public school slots

may differ from the average cost, but in the long run, it seems reasonable to assume marginal and average

costs will be similar. Assuming the marginal cost of providing public school places equals the average cost,

adding school spaces through PACES reduced long-run expenditure on public schools by 14% of $350 or

roughly $50 per winner, so the extra public educational expenditure per lottery winner is about $74 (to pupils)

- $50 (in reduced public school costs) = $24. Moreover, allowing the marginal cost to differ from average

cost by $100 either way still leads to voucher program costs in the 10-40 dollar range.



C. Overall Cost and Benefits

        The extra society-wide educational resource cost per lottery winner differs from the roughly $24 of

extra public education expenditure, since households used part of the voucher funds to offset education costs

they would have incurred privately, and households lost income from their children‚Äôs work. The average

lottery winner received $74 more than the average loser in scholarship assistance, but spent only $52 more

on gross school fees. Lottery winners earned $41 less than losers through work. Winning households‚Äô net

resource contribution was therefore $52 (additional school fees) + $41 (reduced earnings) - $74 (voucher)

= $19. This implies that the society-wide additional educational resource cost per lottery winner was

approximately $24 (government) + $19 (households) = $43.



                                                       24
        The comparison of costs and benefits should take account of the fact that three years of costs were

incurred prior to our survey. The total cost of the program can therefore be estimated by multiplying the

annual resource cost times the roughly 3 years winners received vouchers, for a total of about 3√ó24 = $72 in

additional public educational expenditure and 3√ó$43=$129 in total societal resource cost. Actual costs are

probably somewhat higher, however, since voucher take-up rates declined over time, with 88% of winners

having ever used a voucher, and only 49% using it in the survey year. Multiplying costs by 88%/49% for the

first and second years yields an upper bound on the three-year cost of the program of about $195 using the

$43/year figure for social costs.

        These costs are very likely small relative to the benefits for participants. Although lottery winners

gave up current earnings, they completed an additional .12-.16 grades and scored approximately .2 standard

deviations higher on tests. Among US Hispanic students who took the same test, the difference in test scores

between 7th and 8th graders, or between 8th and 9th graders, was also about .2 standard deviations, so the

achievement gain from winning the lottery may be as large as that associated with a full year of schooling.

Our estimates using a recent Colombian labor force survey show returns to schooling of about 10%. If the

gain from the program is only the economic return to an additional 0.12 years of schooling, the program raised

winners‚Äô wages by 1.2% per year, whereas if it is equal to that from a full year of schooling it raised wages

by 10%. Annual earnings of parents in our sample were about $2,400 per worker, and PACES applicants

should be able to earn more, since the average parent had only 5.9 years of education while the average

applicant had already completed 7.5 years and was still in school at the time of our survey. We therefore

assume the expected earnings of applicants are $3000. Thus, PACES seems very likely to raise lottery

winners‚Äô wages by $36 per year, and might raise wages by as much as $300 per year if higher test scores have

a grade-equivalent payoff. Discounted over applicants working lives, these benefits easily outweigh the social

costs of the voucher program, which are probably no more than $195.

        A more complete cost-benefit analysis would take into account the program‚Äôs effects on non-

participants. Pupils left behind in public schools may have been hurt by the departure of motivated classmates



                                                     25
for private schools, or alternatively, public schools may have responded positively to increased competition,

a possibility considered by Hoxby (2000) and Bettinger (2001b). Such general equilibrium effects cannot be

assessed by comparing lottery winners and losers. But since the partial equilibrium cost-benefit analysis is

clear-cut, and since only 15% of winners moved from public to private schools, any negative external effects

on non-participants would have to have been extraordinarily large to outweigh program benefits.



                                      VII. Summary and Conclusions

        Colombia‚Äôs PACES program provides an unusual opportunity to assess the effect of demand-side

education financing in a Latin American country where private schools educate a substantial fraction of

pupils. The PACES program is of special interest because many vouchers were assigned by lottery, so

program effects can be reliably assessed. Our results suggest that lottery winners benefitted from higher

educational attainment, primarily as a consequence of reduced grade repetition, as well as from higher test

scores and a lower probability of teen cohabitation or employment. Most of the results suggest PACES

vouchers had a stronger effect on the education of girls than on the education of boys.

        PACES vouchers affected outcomes through a number of channels. First, lottery winners were more

likely to have attended participating private schools, and these schools may be better than public schools.

Moreover, because voucher recipients who failed a grade risked losing vouchers, lottery winners had an

incentive to devote more effort to school. Finally, vouchers may have allowed some households who would

have chosen private schools in any case to attend more expensive private schools. The net effect is such that

the benefit of voucher awards were more than enough to offset the costs. In work in progress, we are

assessing longer term consequences of voucher receipt, and hope to be able to document effects on secondary

school completion rates. An implication of our findings to date is that demand-side programs like PACES

can be a cost-effective way to increase educational attainment and academic achievement, at least in countries

like Colombia with a weak public school infrastructure and a well-developed private education sector.

                                             DATA APPENDIX

1. Surveys

        The sampling frame for the surveys were the lists of PACES winners and losers obtained from

ICETEX offices. We selected applicants at random from these lists. Those with phones were interviewed

first. Applicants were called up to 9 times total and 3 times/day to obtain an interview, with numbers of

contacts similar for winners and losers. In general, we interviewed parents or guardians and not the applicants

themselves. Some interviewing was conducted in person; household interviews are distinguished by the

inclusion of a dummy in the estimation. We developed a pilot survey that was used to test questions and

interviewing strategies. The pilot survey ultimately differed little from the main survey so pilot responses are

included in the data set analyzed here and indicated by a survey-form dummy included in the analyses.

        Interviewers were college students attending Javierna University De Colombia, in Bogota. The

interviewers were selected and trained by one of us (Bloom). Responsibility for interviewing later passed to

two of the most experienced interviewers. Surveys were checked and coded by the interviewers, but

interviewers did not code their own interviews. Responses were also checked by a research assistant in

Boston. We tried to blind interviewers to the win/loss status of respondents for as long as possible, and had

each interviewer collect data from applicants in both groups.



2. Testing

        There were four test dates. On the first, we tested applicants from Suba; on the second, we tested

Suba no-shows; on the third date, we tested applicants from La Candelaria and downtown areas nearby.

Finally, on the last date we tested third-date no-shows, plus applicants from the Ciudad Bolivar neighborhood

and surrounding areas.

        Sample sizes and response rates were as follows. 473 applicants were invited for testing, 283 (60%)

were tested. Response rates at individual test sites were as follows: 77 Suba applicants were invited, 50

(65%) were tested on dates 1 or 2, one subject did not do the math test; 109 Candalaria applicants were



                                                      27
invited, 83 (76%) were tested on dates 3 or 4; 287 Ciudad Bolivar applicants were invited and one showed

up uninvited, 150 (52%) were tested on date 4. Response rates were higher at the first two sites because no-

shows had more than one opportunity to be tested. Test score means and pupil characteristics were similar

across sites. Site-specific treatment effects were not significantly different from zero.

        Scores are reported in the tables as the standardized (mean zero, standard deviation 1) number right.

The standardization uses means and standard deviations in sample of test takers. The appendix table presents

a comparison of our test scores with those for the La Prueba norming population.

     Notes: Standard deviations are reported in parentheses in columns 1 and 4. Robust standard errors are
     reported in parentheses in all other columns. Sample sizes differ from other tables because of missing
     fee data. The sample sizes differ slightly across rows because of missing data for ‚ÄúCurrently Using
     Scholarship from the Private School‚Äù and the outcomes with the more comprehensive fee measure.
     The regression estimates in columns 3 and 6 are from models that include controls for whether
     applicant has phone, age, type of survey and instrument, strata of residence, and month of interview.

Notes: Estimates are for Bogota 1995 applicants only. Bounds are conditional on fee payments
exceeding the indicated dollar cutoffs. Standard deviations are reported in parentheses in columns 2-4.
Standard errors are reported in parentheses in columns 5 and 6. The upper bound above a given
percentile is computed in a two-step process. First, we estimate the difference between winners‚Äô and
losers‚Äô matriculation fees conditional on being greater than the given quantile in their respective
distributions. Second, we divide this difference by the probability that losers above the given
percentile attend private school. The lower is computed by taking the differences between winners‚Äô
and losers‚Äô fees conditional on private school attendance and conditional on being greater than the
cutoff. See text and appendix for further details.

Notes:

The US-Norming population included 8851 students in grades K-12 from all states. Ninety-
five percent of the students were from Arizona, California, Colorado, Illinois, New Mexico, or
Texas. The Colombia-PACES results are based on 283 applicants to the 1995 Bogota lottery,
tested between June and November of 1999.
