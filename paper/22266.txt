                                         ABSTRACT

We present a model of credit cycles arising from diagnostic expectations – a belief formation
mechanism based on Kahneman and Tversky’s (1972) representativeness heuristic. In this
formulation, when forming their beliefs agents overweight future outcomes that have become
more likely in light of incoming data. The model reconciles extrapolation and neglect of risk in a
unified framework. Diagnostic expectations are forward looking, and as such are immune to the
Lucas critique and nest rational expectations as a special case. In our model of credit cycles,
credit spreads are excessively volatile, over-react to news, and are subject to predictable
reversals. These dynamics can account for several features of credit cycles and macroeconomic
volatility.

1.Introduction

       The financial crisis of 2008-2009 revived economists’ and policymakers’ interest

in the relationship between credit expansion and subsequent financial and economic

busts. According to an old argument (e.g., Minsky 1977), investor optimism brings

about the expansion of credit and investment, and leads to a crisis when such optimism

abates. Stein (2014) echoes this view by arguing that policy-makers should be mindful

of credit market frothiness and consider countering it through policy. In this paper, we

develop a behavioral model of credit cycles with micro-founded expectations, which

yields the Minsky narrative but is also consistent with a great deal of evidence.

       Recent empirical research has developed a number of credit cycle facts.

Schularick and Taylor (2012) demonstrate, using a sample of 14 developed countries

between 1870 and 2008, that rapid credit expansions forecast declines in real activity.

Jorda, Schularick, and Taylor (2013) further find that more credit-intensive expansions

are followed by deeper recessions. Mian, Sufi, and Verner (2015) show that the growth

of household debt predicts economic slowdowns. Baron and Xiong (2014) establish in

a sample of 20 developed countries that bank credit expansion predicts increased crash

risk in both bank stocks and equity markets more broadly. And Fahlenbrach, Prilmeier,

and Stulz (2016) find, in a cross-section of U.S. banks, that fast loan growth predicts

poor loan performance and low bank returns in the future.

       Parallel findings emerge from the examination of credit market conditions.

Greenwood and Hanson (2013) show that credit quality of corporate debt issuers

deteriorates during credit booms, and that high share of risky loans in the total

forecasts low, and even negative, corporate bond returns. Gilchrist and Zakrajsek

(2012) and Krishnamurthy and Muir (2015) relatedly establish that eventual credit

tightening correctly anticipates the coming recession.          Lopez-Salido, Stein, and

                                            2
Zakrajsek (hereafter LSZ 2015) find that low credit spreads predict both a rise in credit

spreads and low economic growth afterwards. They stress predictable mean reversion

in credit market conditions 2. We show further that survey forecasts of future credit

spreads are excessively optimistic when these spreads are low, and that both errors and

revisions in forecasts are predictable.           This evidence is inconsistent with rational

expectations, and suggests a need for a behavioral approach to modeling credit cycles.

        In this paper, we propose a psychological model of investor expectations and

credit cycles that accounts for the evidence described above, and articulates in a fully

dynamic setup the phenomenon of credit market overheating. It implies that in a boom

investors are excessively optimistic and systematically become more pessimistic in the

future, leading to a crisis even without deteriorating fundamentals. The model unifies

the phenomena of extrapolation (Cagan 1956, Cutler et al. 1990, DeLong et al. 1990,

Barberis and Shleifer 2003, Greenwood and Shleifer 2014, Barberis et al. 2015a, b,

Gennaioli, Ma, and Shleifer 2015) and the neglect of risk (Gennaioli, Shleifer, and Vishny

2012, Coval, Pan, and Stafford 2014, Arnold, Schuette, and Wagner 2015). Critically,

households in our model are forward looking, and recognize policy shifts. As such, the

model is not vulnerable to the Lucas critique. Indeed, for any data generating process,

rational expectations emerge a special case of our model.

        Our principal contribution is to write down a psychologically-founded model of

beliefs and their evolution in light of new data. 3 The model we propose is taken from a

very different context and adapted to macroeconomic problems, rather than just


2 An older literature on financial asset prices and economic activity includes Bernanke (1990), Friedman
and Kuttner (1992), and Stock and Watson (2003), among others.
3 Many models of beliefs in finance are motivated by psychological evidence, but often use specifications

specialized to financial markets (e.g., Muth 1961, Barberis, Shleifer, and Vishny 1998, Rabin and Vayanos
2010, Fuster, Laibson, and Mendel 2010, Hirshleifer et al 2015, Greenwood and Hanson 2015, Barberis et
al. 2015a,b). Fuster et al (2010) review evidence from lab and field settings documenting deviations
from rational expectations.

designed to match credit cycle facts. It is portable in the sense of Rabin (2013). Our

model of belief evolution is based on Gennaioli and Shleifer’s (2010) formalization of

Kahneman and Tversky’s (KT 1972, TK 1983) representativeness heuristic describing

how people judge probabilities. According to KT, people estimate types with a given

attribute to be excessively common in a population when that attribute is

representative or diagnostic for these types, meaning that it occurs more frequently

among these types than in the relevant reference class. For instance, beliefs about the

Irish exaggerate the share of red haired people among them because red hair is much

more common among the Irish than in the average national group, even though the true

share of red-haired Irish is small. Similarly, after seeing a patient test positive on a

medical test for a disease doctors overestimate the likelihood that he has it because

being sick is representative of testing positive, even when it remains unlikely despite a

positive test (Casscells et al. 1978). Our formalization of representativeness accounts

for several well-documented judgment biases, such as the conjunction and disjunction

fallacies and base rate neglect. It also delivers a model of stereotypes consistent with

empirical evidence (Bordalo, Coffman, Gennaioli, and Shleifer (BCGS) 2016).

       This formalization of representativeness can be naturally applied to modeling

expectations.        Analogously to the medical test example, agents focus on, and thus

overweight in their beliefs, the future states whose likelihood increases the most in light

of current news relative to what they know already. Just as doctors overestimate the

probability of sickness after a positive test result, agents overestimate the probability of

a good (bad) future state when the current news is good (bad). Following TK (1983)’s

description     of    the   representativeness       heuristic   as   overweighting   diagnostic

information, we refer to such beliefs as diagnostic expectations.



                                                 4
       This approach has significant implications. For example, a path of improving

news leads to excess optimism, and a path of deteriorating news to excess pessimism,

even when these paths lead to the same fundamentals.         There is a kernel of truth in

assessments: revisions respond to news, but excessively. When change slows down, the

agent no longer extrapolates. This in itself leads to a reversal. Excessively volatile

expectations drive cyclical fluctuations in both financial and economic activity.

       We construct a neoclassical macroeconomic model in which the only non-

standard feature is expectations. In particular, we do not include financial or any other

frictions. The model accounts for many empirical findings, some of which also obtain

under rational expectations, but some do not. In our model:

   1) In response to good news about the economy, credit spreads decline, credit

       expands, the share of high risk debt rises, and investment and output grow.

   2) Following this period of narrow credit spreads, these spreads predictably rise on

       average, credit and the share of high risk debt decline, while investment and

       output decline as well. Larger spikes in spreads predict lower GDP growth.

   3) Credit spreads are too volatile relative to fundamentals and their changes are

       predictable in a way that parallels the cycles described in points 1) and 2).

   4) Investors commit predictable forecast errors and forecast revisions. Bond

       returns are also predictable in a way that parallels points 1) and 2).

Prediction 1) can obtain under rational expectations, and the same is true about

prediction 2) provided fundamentals are mean reverting. Predictions 3) and 4), in

contrast, critically depend on our model of diagnostic expectations.

       Our paper is related to four strands of research. First, the prevailing approach to

understanding the link between financial markets and the real economy is financial

frictions, which focus on the transmission of an adverse shock through a leveraged

                                            5
economy (Bernanke and Gertler 1989, Kiyotaki and Moore 1997) 4. The adverse shock

in such models is either a drop in fundamentals, or a “financial shock” consisting of the

tightening of collateral constraints or an increase in required returns. These models do

not usually explain the sources of “financial shocks”. As importantly, because they

assume rational expectations, these models do not explain predictable negative or low

abnormal returns on debt in over-heated markets or systematic errors in expectations.

Our model explains both sudden market collapses and abnormal returns.

        Second, our paper relates to the growing body of research on extrapolative

expectations in financial markets. Barberis, Shleifer, and Vishny (1998) were the first

to connect representativeness and extrapolation, but did not have a micro-founded

model of representativeness. Our contribution is to provide such as micro-foundation

of expectation formation, and to use it to simultaneously account for extrapolation and

the closely related phenomenon of the neglect of risk in a unified framework.

        Third, our paper is related to recent work on limited attention (e.g., Sims 2003,

Gabaix 2014).        In general, these models predict sluggish expectations and under-

reaction to information, consistent with empirical evidence for inflation in particular

(Coibion and Gorodnichenko 2012, 2015). Also related is research on momentum and

slow reaction to information in financial markets (Jegadeesh and Titman 1993, and

Stein 1999, Bouchard et al. 2016). Our model most naturally delivers over-reaction to

information, although we discuss briefly how the two approaches can be unified.

        Finally, our paper continues the small literature on behavioral credit cycles,

initiated by Minsky (1977) but with very few models available so far. Gennaioli,

Shleifer, and Vishny (2012) present an early formulation, focusing on the neglect of risk.



4 Some papers add to financial frictions Keynesian elementd, such as the zero lower bound on interest
rates or aggregate demand effects (e.g., Eggertson and Krugman 2012, Rognlie et al. 2015).

                                                   6
Gennaioli, Shleifer, and Vishny (2015) sketch a model of credit cycles exhibiting both

under-reaction and over-reaction based on the BCGS (2016) model of stereotypes. Jin

(2015) models extrapolation in credit markets. Greenwood, Hanson, and Jin (2016)

present a model of extrapolation of default rates which also delivers many of the credit

cycle facts. Our contribution is to unify several theories, as well as a good deal of

evidence on credit cycles and credit spreads, in a micro-founded model of beliefs.

        In section 2, we present some evidence that both errors in forecasts of credit

spreads, and revisions in these forecasts, can be predicted from information available at

the time initial forecasts are made.            Section 3 introduces diagnostic expectations,

describes how they evolve, and relates our formulation to extrapolation and neglect of

risk.   Section 4 presents our model of credit cycles, and examines some initial

implications of diagnostic expectations. Section 5 develops the predictions of the model

for the behavior of credit spreads, expectations about credit spreads, and the link

between credit spreads and economic activity.               Section 6 concludes.        An Appendix

discusses some alternative specifications of the diagnostic expectations model.



2. Some Evidence on Expectations and Credit Spreads

        We start by offering some motivating evidence on analysts’ expectations of the

Baa bond – Treasury credit spread. Both here and in our theory we focus on the credit

spread, a commonly used indicator of credit market conditions (Greenwood and Hanson

2013). We do not have enough data to test rational expectations, but can illustrate how

the analysis of credit cycles can be deepened with expectations data, and to establish

some facts that a model of expectations formation should account for 5.



5 One may worry that Blue Chip professional forecasts are distorted for signaling or entertainment
reasons since participants are not anonymous. However, these forecasts tend to be very similar to the

                                                   7
        We use data from Blue Chip Financial Forecasts, a monthly survey of around 40

panelists’ forecasts of various interest rates for the current quarter and for each of 6

quarters ahead. We average forecasts over four quarters ahead to obtain 12-month

forecasts; we then construct consensus forecasts by averaging expectations across

analysts. We use data from the March, June, September, and December publications. We

construct implied forecasts of the Baa spread as the difference between the forecasts of

the Baa corporate bond yield and of the 10Y Treasury yield. We also construct a spread

using the 5Y Treasury yield. Forecasts of Baa yields start in 1999Q1 and end in 2014Q4,

which is thus the period we focus on.



2.1 Predictability in Forecast Errors

        Under the joint assumptions of rational expectations and knowledge of the data

generating process, analysts’ forecast error should be unpredictable from past

information. Figure 1 plots, over time, the current spread against the error in the

forecast of the future spread. The data suggest predictability: when the current spread

is low, the expected spread is too low (forecast errors are systematically positive).

Likewise, when the current spread is high, the expected spread is too high. The 1999-

2000 and 2005-2008 periods witness low spreads and excessive optimism, the early

2000s and the recent crisis witness high spreads and excess pessimism.

        Table 1 reports an econometric test of predictability. Column 1 estimates an

AR(1) process for the Baa-10Y spread, column 2 regresses analysts’ forecast on the

current spread, column 3 regresses the future forecast error on the current spread.

Columns 4, 5 and 6 repeat the analysis using the 5Y treasury yield.



anonymous forecasts collected by the Philadelphia Fed Survey of Private Forecasters. Moreover, unlike in
the case of stock analysts, there is no unconditional bias in the Blue Chip forecasts we study here.

            (Actual Forecast Error=Actual-Forecast, Newey West t-statistics in brackets)

       Table 1 confirms the message of Figure 1. In column 3, the higher the current

spread, the higher is the forecast relative to the realization. This may occur because

analysts see excessive persistence in current conditions: in Column 1 the estimated

persistence of the actual Baa-10Y spread is about 0.4, but in column 2 forecasts follow

the current spread with a coefficient of about 0.6, and similarly for the Baa-5Y spread.



2.2 Tests of Expectations’ Revisions

       The above results may be consistent with rationality if the assumed AR(1) model

is misspecified, and spreads are also influenced by an unobservable but persistent

shock. In this case, after receiving good news fully rational analysts become optimistic


                                                 9
about the unobservable shock. Forecasts can then overshoot because good news might

instead be due to the transitory shock. To address this possibility, we examine analysts’

forecast revisions. Under rational inference these revisions should be unpredictable.

       Figure 2 plots the current spread against the future forecast revision, defined as

the difference between the forecast for the spread in quarter t + 4 made in quarter t + 3

and the current (quarter t) forecast of the same spread. The evidence again suggests

predictability: when the current spread is low, forecasts are subsequently revised

upwards, when the current spread is high, forecasts are revised downward.




       Table 2 shows that this predictability is statistically robust.

       This evidence is difficult to reconcile with rational expectations, even allowing

for model misspecification. It instead suggests that analysts’ forecasts follow a boom

bust pattern. During booming bond markets (low spreads), expectations are too

optimistic and systematically revert in the future, creating the seeds for a cooling of

bond markets. Although we cannot draw sharp conclusions due to small sample size,

the extrapolative dynamics of forecasts that we document here are in line with other

studies, such as with Greenwood and Hanson’s (2013) evidence of systematic reversal

in bond spreads, as well as with the extrapolative nature of CFO’s expectations about

their company’s earnings growth (Gennaioli et al. 2015). In the next section we present

a model that accounts for these dynamics of beliefs as a consequence of Kahneman and

Tversky’s representativeness heuristic.



3. Diagnostic Expectations

3.1 A Formal Model of Representativeness

       We build our model of expectations from first principles, starting with research

on heuristics and biases in human decision-making. One of Kahneman and Tversky’s

most universal heuristics is representativeness, which they define as follows: “an

attribute is representative of a class if it is very diagnostic; that is, the relative frequency

of this attribute is much higher in that class than in the relevant reference class (TK

1983).” KT argue that individuals often assess likelihood by representativeness, thus

estimating types or attributes as being likely when they are instead representative, and

present a great deal of experimental evidence to support this claim. Gennaioli and

Shleifer (2010) build a model in which judgment biases arise because decision makers

overweight events that are representative precisely in the sense of KT’s definition. To



                                              11
motivate our model of diagnostic expectations, we summarize some of this work as well

as a related application to stereotype formation by Bordalo et al. (BCGS 2016).

        A decision maker judges the distribution of a trait 𝑇 in a group 𝐺. The true

distribution of the trait is ℎ(𝑇 = 𝑡|𝐺). GS (2010) formally define the representativeness

of the trait 𝑇 = 𝑡 for group 𝐺 to be:

                                             ℎ(𝑇 = 𝑡|𝐺)
                                                          ,
                                            ℎ(𝑇 = 𝑡| − 𝐺)

where – 𝐺 is a relevant comparison group. As in KT’s quote, a trait is more

representative if it is relatively more frequent in 𝐺 than in – 𝐺. GS (2010) assume that

representative types are easier to recall. Due to limited working memory, the agent

overweighs these types in his assessment. Crucially, in this model beliefs about a group

𝐺 are context dependent, namely they depend on features of the comparison group – 𝐺.

        To illustrate, consider an individual assessing the distribution of hair color

among the Irish. The trait 𝑇 is hair color, the conditioning group 𝐺 is the Irish. The

comparison group – 𝐺 is the world at large. The true relevant distributions are: 6

                       𝑇 = 𝑟𝑒𝑑        𝑇 = 𝑏𝑙𝑜𝑛𝑑/𝑙𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡 𝑏𝑟𝑜𝑤𝑛                   𝑇 = 𝑑𝑎𝑟𝑘

        The most representative hair color for the Irish is red because it is associated

with the highest likelihood ratio among hair colors:

                                𝑃𝑟(𝑟𝑒𝑑 ℎ𝑎𝑖𝑟|𝐼𝑟𝑖𝑠ℎ)   10%
                                                   =     = 10.
                               𝑃𝑟(𝑟𝑒𝑑 ℎ𝑎𝑖𝑟|𝑊𝑜𝑟𝑙𝑑)     1%

Our model thus predicts that assessments exaggerate the frequency of red haired Irish.

                                                   12
After hearing the news “Irish”, the representative red-haired type quickly comes to

mind and its likelihood is inflated. It is not that blond or dark haired types are not

considered, but the agent discounts their probability because these types are less

available when thinking about the Irish.

        This example also illustrates context dependence of beliefs. It is the paucity of

red haired people in the “rest of the world” that renders red hair so distinctive for the

Irish. The judgment bias would be smaller if the share of red haired people in the rest of

the world were to rise, or equivalently if the agent was primed to think about the Irish

in the context of a more similar group (e.g., – 𝐺 = 𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑡𝑠). BCGS (2016) show that this

model explains many empirical features of stereotypes, including evidence that they

contain a “kernel of truth” (Judd and Park 1993) as well as their context dependence.

        Consider next base rate neglect, another well documented bias in information

processing. A doctor must assess the health of a patient in light of a positive medical

test. Here 𝑇 = {ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑙𝑡ℎ𝑦, 𝑠𝑖𝑐𝑘}, 𝐺 is patients who tested positive, while – 𝐺 is untested

patients. Being sick is representative of a patient who tested positive provided:

              Pr(𝑇 = 𝑠𝑖𝑐𝑘|𝐺 = 𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒)   Pr(𝑇 = ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑙𝑡ℎ𝑦|𝐺 = 𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒)
                                        >
             Pr(𝑇 = 𝑠𝑖𝑐𝑘|−𝐺 = 𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑑) Pr(𝑇 = ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑙𝑡ℎ𝑦|−𝐺 = 𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑑)

        This condition is always satisfied provided the test is minimally informative, in

the sense that a positive test raises the likelihood of having the disease. After a positive

test, the “sick” type jumps to mind and the doctor inflates its probability. Consistent

with the evidence collected by Casscells et al. (1978), physicians may greatly inflate the

probability of diseases that are very rare, committing a form of base rate neglect. 7 A

significant literature in psychology explores this finding, and the mechanism above

7 Casscells et al (1978) asked physicians: “If a test to detect a disease whose prevalence is 1/1000 has a
false positive rate of 5 per cent, what is the chance that a person found to have a positive result actually
has the disease, assuming that you know nothing about the person's symptoms or signs?” While the
correct answer is about 2%, they found an average response of 56% and a modal answer of 95%.

captures TK’s (1974) verbal account of base rate neglect.

       The general mechanism in both examples is that representativeness causes the

agent to inflate the likelihood of types whose objective probability rises the most in 𝐺

relative to the reference context – 𝐺. This is “red hair” in the Irish example, and “sick” in

the medical example. In both cases, representativeness causes diagnostic information to

be overweighed and beliefs to depend on context −𝐺.

       In GS (2010) and BCGS (2016) we show that this model of the

representativeness heuristic offers a unified account of widely documented judgment

biases, of key features of social stereotypes, and of context dependent beliefs. The same

logic can be naturally applied to studying the evolution of beliefs in macroeconomics.



3.2 Diagnostic Expectations

       We next extend our model to belief formation about aggregate economic

conditions. Time is discrete 𝑡 = 0,1, … The state of the economy at 𝑡 is captured by a

random variable Ω𝑡 ∈ ℝ, whose realization is denoted by 𝜔𝑡 . This random variable

follows the AR(1) process 𝜔𝑡 = 𝑏𝜔𝑡−1 + 𝜖𝑡 , with 𝜖𝑡 ↝ 𝑁(0, 𝜎 2 ), 𝑏 ∈ [0,1]. The model is

easily generalized to richer AR(N)-normal processes.

       When forming a forecast the agent assesses the distribution of a future state, say

Ω𝑡+1 , entailed by current conditions Ω𝑡 = 𝜔𝑡 . This is similar to the medical test example,

where the doctor assesses the health of the patient conditional on a positive test

outcome. Pursuing the analogy, the agent must predict future prospects Ω𝑡+1 in a group

𝐺 ≡ {Ω𝑡 = 𝜔𝑡 } that summarizes current conditions.

       The rational agent solves this problem by using the true conditional distribution

ℎ(Ω𝑡+1 = 𝜔𝑡+1 |Ω𝑡 = 𝜔𝑡 ). The agent judging by representativeness has this true

distribution in the back of his mind, but selectively retrieves and thus overweighs the

                                             14
likelihood of future states 𝜔𝑡+1 that are representative or diagnostic of 𝐺 ≡ {Ω𝑡 = 𝜔𝑡 }

relative to the background context – 𝐺. But what is −𝐺 here?

        In the Irish example, representativeness assesses 𝐺 = 𝐼𝑟𝑖𝑠ℎ against – 𝐺 = Rest of

the world. In the medical test example, the information 𝐺 = 𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡 is assessed

against its absence – 𝐺 = 𝑁𝑜𝑡 𝑡𝑎𝑘𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡, so that context captures absence of new

information. Here we adopt this dynamic perspective by taking context at time 𝑡 to

reflect only information held at 𝑡 − 1. Specifically, we take context to be the state

prevailing if there is no news. Formally, under the assumed AR(1), we take context to

be −𝐺 ≡ {Ω𝑡 = 𝑏𝜔𝑡−1 }. A future state 𝜔𝑡+1 is thus more representative at 𝑡 if it is more

likely under the realized state 𝐺 ≡ {Ω𝑡 = 𝜔𝑡 } than under the reference state capturing

past information −𝐺 ≡ {Ω𝑡 = 𝑏𝜔𝑡−1 }. Representativeness of 𝜔𝑡+1 is then given by:

                                        ℎ(Ω𝑡+1 = 𝜔𝑡+1 |Ω𝑡 = 𝜔𝑡 )
                                                                   .                               (3)
                                       ℎ(Ω𝑡+1 = 𝜔𝑡+1 |Ω𝑡 = 𝑏𝜔𝑡−1 )

The most representative state is the one exhibiting the largest increase in its likelihood

based on recent news. Definition (3) captures two psychologically relevant features:

first, in the absence of news, the true distribution ℎ(Ω𝑡+1 = 𝜔𝑡+1 |𝐺) coincides with the

reference     distribution ℎ(Ω𝑡+1 = 𝜔𝑡+1 |−𝐺) so             that    no     state    is   particularly

representative. Second, good (bad) news render states in the right tail strictly more

(less) representative. 8 There are other ways of specifying the comparison group – 𝐺: it

could be slow moving – including more remote recollections – or it may be specified in

terms of diagnostic expectations. In the Appendix, we discuss these cases.



8These properties would not hold if context was defined as the past state −𝐺 ≡ {Ω𝑡−1 = 𝜔𝑡−1 }, making
this otherwise similar specification much less tractable. In particular, the distributions ℎ(Ω𝑡+1 =
𝜔𝑡+1 |Ω𝑡 = 𝜔𝑡 ) and ℎ(Ω𝑡+1 = 𝜔𝑡+1 |Ω𝑡−1 = 𝜔𝑡−1 ) have         different   variances,   so    measuring
representativeness relative to the past state would distort not only the mean, but also the variance, of
ℎ(Ω𝑡+1 = 𝜔𝑡+1 |Ω𝑡 = 𝜔𝑡 ), even in the absence of news. The representation obtained in (4) below – and
the tractability it entails – extends to several classes of distributions, including lognormal and
exponential.

                                                  15
        The psychology of diagnostic expectations works as follows. After seeing current

news Ω𝑡 = 𝜔𝑡 , the most representative future states immediately come to mind.

Memory limits then imply that the agent over samples representative states from the

true distribution ℎ(Ω𝑡+1 = 𝜔𝑡+1 |Ω𝑡 = 𝜔𝑡 ) , which is stored in memory. As a

consequence, beliefs inflate the probability of more representative states and deflate

the probability of less representative states. In light of Equation (3), we formalize

overweighting of representative states “as if” the agent uses the distorted density:

                                                                                            𝜃
                                                        ℎ(Ω𝑡+1 = 𝜔𝑡+1 |Ω𝑡 = 𝜔𝑡 )    1
        ℎ𝑡𝜃 (𝜔𝑡+1 )   = ℎ(Ω𝑡+1   = 𝜔𝑡+1 |Ω𝑡 = 𝜔𝑡 ) ∙ �                            �   ,
                                                      ℎ�Ω𝑡+1 = 𝜔𝑡+1 �|Ω𝑡 = 𝑏𝜔𝑡−1 � 𝑍

where the normalizing constant 𝑍 ensures that ℎ𝑡𝜃 (𝜔𝑡+1 ) integrates to one, and

𝜃 ∈ (0, +∞) measures the severity of judging by representativeness. When 𝜃 = 0, the

agent has no memory limits and he appropriately uses all information, forming rational

expectations. When 𝜃 > 0, memory is limited and the agent does not fully correct for

the fact that some states are less available. Thus, the distribution ℎ𝑡𝜃 (𝜔𝑡+1 ) inflates the

likelihood of representative states and deflates the likelihood of non-representative

ones. Because they overweight the most representative, or diagnostic, future outcomes,

we call the expectations formed in light of ℎ𝑡𝜃 (𝜔𝑡+1 ) diagnostic.

        Parameter 𝜃 captures the limits of working memory. In what follows we take 𝜃

to be fixed. In principle, however, memory can also depend on the agent’s deliberate

effort and attention. This possibility may cause 𝜃 to vary across situations. 9

        In this formulation, news do not just alter the objective likelihood of certain

states. They also change the extent to which the agent focuses on them. An event that

increases the likelihood of a future state 𝜔𝑡+1 also makes it more representative, so

9 Another possibility is that the distortions caused by may arise – and be particularly strong – when the
agent does not know the true data generating process and data are very noisy. It is possible to extend our
formalization to learning problems of this sort, but here we use a simpler formulation to illustrate the
implications of representativeness more starkly.

                                                   16
ℎ𝑡𝜃 (𝜔𝑡+1 ) overshoots. The reverse occurs when the likelihood of 𝜔𝑡+1 decreases. If the

likelihood ratio in (2’) is monotone increasing, “rationally” good news cause the agent to

overweight high future states, and to underweight low future states (the converse is

true if news are bad). In this sense, good news cause neglect of downside risk.


Proposition 1 When the process for 𝜔𝑡 is AR(1) with normal (0, 𝜎 2 ) shocks, the

diagnostic distribution ℎ𝑡𝜃 (𝜔𝑡+1 ) is also normal, with variance 𝜎 2 and mean:

                       𝔼𝜃𝑡 (𝜔𝑡+1 ) = 𝔼𝑡 (𝜔𝑡+1 ) + 𝜃[𝔼𝑡 (𝜔𝑡+1 ) − 𝔼𝑡−1 (𝜔𝑡+1 )].            (4)


       Diagnostic expectations are represented by a linear combination of the rational

expectations of 𝜔𝑡+1 held 𝑡 and at 𝑡 − 1. It is not that decision-makers compute rational

expectations and combine them according to Proposition 1. Rather, oversampling

representative future states yields the linear combination in (4). This formula reflects a

“kernel of truth” logic: diagnostic expectations differ from rational expectations by a

shift in the direction of the information received at 𝑡, given by [𝔼𝑡 (𝜔𝑡+1 ) − 𝔼𝑡−1 (𝜔𝑡+1 )].




                             Figure 3: Neglect of risk and Extrapolation




                                                17
        Figure 3 illustrates the entailed neglect of risk. After good news, the diagnostic

distribution of 𝜔𝑡+1 is a right shift of the objective distribution. Due to the monotone

increasing and unbounded likelihood ratio of normal densities, good news cause under-

estimation of probabilities in the left tail (the shaded area). In fact, neglect of risk and

extrapolation are connected by the same psychological mechanism. For the AR(1)

process as 𝜔𝑡 = 𝑏𝜔𝑡−1 + 𝜖𝑡 , with persistence parameter 𝑏, Equation (4) becomes:

                 𝔼𝜃𝑡 (𝜔𝑡+1 ) − 𝜔𝑡 = [𝔼𝑡 (𝜔𝑡+1 ) − 𝜔𝑡 ] + 𝑏 ∙ 𝜃 ∙ [𝜔𝑡 − 𝔼𝑡−1 (𝜔𝑡 )],

namely the current shock 𝜔𝑡 − 𝔼𝑡−1 (𝜔𝑡 ) is extrapolated into the future, but only if the

data are serially correlated, 𝑏 > 0. Diagnostic expectations exaggerate the role of new

information, consistent with Kahneman’s (2011) view that “our mind has a useful

capability to focus spontaneously on whatever is odd, different, or unusual.”

        Because diagnostic expectations are forward looking, they address the Lucas

critique. 10 Since diagnostic expectations distort the true distribution ℎ𝑡 (𝜔𝑡+1 ), they

respond to policy shifts that affect ℎ𝑡 (𝜔𝑡+1 ).           The diagnostic distribution ℎ𝑡𝜃 (𝜔𝑡+1 )

incorporates changes in the objective frequency (as do rational expectations) but also

changes in representativeness.           Thus, if the government commits to inflating the

economy, inflation expectations will also react upwards. 11

        It is straightforward to extend diagnostic expectations to longer term forecasts.


Corollary 1 When the process for 𝜔𝑡 is AR(1) with normal (0, 𝜎 2 ) shocks, the diagnostic

expectations for 𝜔𝑡+𝑇 is given by:



10 The Lucas critique holds that mechanical models of expectations cannot be used for policy evaluation

because expectation formation in such models does not respond to changes in policy. Indeed, empirical
estimates of adaptive expectations processes revealed parameter instability to policy change. This
instability led researchers to prefer rational expectations, which account for regime shifts.
11 Muth (1961) generalizes rational expectations to allow for systematic errors in expectations. His

formula is precisely of the linear form of Equation (4): relative to rationality, expectations distort the
effect of recent news. Muth’s formulation naturally follows from the psychology of representativeness.


                                                   18
                        𝔼𝜃𝑡 (𝜔𝑡+𝑇 ) = 𝔼𝑡 (𝜔𝑡+𝑇 ) + 𝜃[𝔼𝑡 (𝜔𝑡+𝑇 ) − 𝔼𝑡−1 (𝜔𝑡+𝑇 )],        (5)

Furthermore, we have that 𝔼𝜃𝑡 (𝜔𝑡+𝑇 ) = 𝔼𝜃𝑡 �𝔼𝜃𝑡 ′ (𝜔𝑡+𝑇 )� for any 𝑡 < 𝑡 ′ < 𝑡 + 𝑇.


Longer term forecasts can also be represented as a linear combination of past and

present rational expectations. Furthermore, diagnostic expectations obey the law of

iterated expectations with respect to the distorted expectations 𝔼𝜃𝑡 , so that forecast

revisions are unpredictable from the vantage point of the decision maker.

       However, forecast revisions are predictable using the true probability measure,

because errors in expectations correct on average in the future. Using (4) we find:

                               𝔼𝑡−1 �𝔼𝜃𝑡 (𝜔𝑡+𝑇 )� = 𝔼𝑡−1 (𝜔𝑡+𝑇 ),

which is the rational forecast.     On average, diagnostic expectations revert to rational

expectations because in our model the distortion of expectations is a linear function of

news, and the average news is zero by definition. Even if expectations are inflated at

𝑡 − 1, they return to rationality on average at 𝑡. As we show in Section 5, this behavior

allows us to account for the empirical findings in Section 2.



4. A Model of Credit Cycles

       We next introduce diagnostic expectations into a simple macroeconomic model

and show that the psychology of representativeness generates excess volatility in

expectations about credit spreads, over-heating and over-cooling of credit markets, as

well as predictable reversals in credit spreads and economic activity that are consistent

with the evidence of Section 2, as well as with many other features of credit cycles.



4.1. Production




                                              19
       A measure 1 of atomistic firms uses capital to produce output. Productivity at 𝑡

depends on the state 𝜔𝑡 , but to a different extent for different firms. A firm is identified

by its risk 𝜌 ∈ ℝ. Firms with higher 𝜌 are less likely to be productive in any state 𝜔𝑡 . If

a firm 𝜌 enters period 𝑡 with invested capital 𝑘, its current output is given by:

                                                𝑘𝛼   𝑖𝑓    𝜔𝑡 ≥ 𝜌
                              𝑦(𝑘|𝜔𝑡 , 𝜌) = �                     ,                      (6)
                                                0    𝑖𝑓    𝜔𝑡 < 𝜌

where 𝛼 ∈ (0,1). The firm produces only if it is sufficiently safe, 𝜌 < 𝜔𝑡 . The safest

firms, for which 𝜌 = −∞, produce 𝑘 𝛼 in every state of the world. The higher is 𝜌, the

better the state 𝜔𝑡 needs to be for the firm to pay off. At the same capital 𝑘, two firms

produce the same output if they are both active, namely if 𝜔𝑡 ≥ 𝜌 for both firms.

       A firm’s riskiness is common knowledge and it is distributed across firms with

density 𝑓(𝜌). Capital for production at 𝑡 + 1 must be installed at 𝑡, before 𝜔𝑡+1 is

known. Capital fully depreciates after usage. At time 𝑡 each firm 𝜌 demands funds from

a competitive financial market to finance its investment. The firm issues risky debt that

promises a contractual interest rate 𝑟𝑡+1 (𝜌).            Debt is repaid only if the firm is

productive: if at 𝑡 the firm borrows 𝑘𝑡+1 (𝜌) at the interest rate 𝑟𝑡+1 (𝜌), next period it

produces and repays 𝑟𝑡+1 (𝜌)𝑘𝑡+1 (𝜌) provided 𝜔𝑡+1 ≥ 𝜌, and defaults otherwise.

       Because there are no agency problems and each firm’s output has a binary

outcome, the model does not distinguish between debt and equity issued by the firm.

Both contracts are contingent on the same outcome and promise the same rate of

return. For concreteness, we refer to the totality of capital invested as debt.



4.2 Households

       A risk neutral, infinitely lived, representative household discounts the future by a




                                             20
factor 𝛽 < 1.        At each time 𝑡, the household allocates its current income between

consumption and investment by maximizing its expectation of the utility function:
                                                    +∞
                                                �         𝛽 𝑠−𝑡 𝑐𝑠 .
                                                    𝑠=𝑡


          The household consumes and purchases the claims issued by firms, which then

pay out or default in the next period. Its income consists of the payout of debt bought in

the previous period, the profits of firms (which are owned by the household), and a

fixed endowment 𝑤 that we assume to be large enough: 12
                    1
A.1 𝑤 ≥ (𝛼𝛽)1−𝛼 .

          At each time 𝑠 and state 𝜔𝑠 , then, the household’s budget constraint is:
                    +∞                               +∞
           𝑐𝑠 + �       𝑘𝑠+1 (𝜌)𝑓(𝜌)𝑑𝜌 = 𝑤 + �             𝐼(𝜌, 𝜔𝑠 )[𝑟𝑠 (𝜌)𝑘𝑠 (𝜌) + 𝜋𝑠 (𝜌)]𝑓(𝜌)𝑑𝜌,
                   −∞                               −∞

where 𝑐𝑠 is consumption, 𝑘𝑡+1 (𝜌) is capital supplied to firm 𝜌, 𝐼(𝜌, 𝜔𝑠 ) is an indicator

function equal to one when firm 𝜌 repays, namely when 𝜔𝑠 ≥ 𝜌, and 𝜋𝑠 (𝜌) is the profit

of firm 𝜌 when active. The household’s income depends, via debt repayments, on the

state of the economy: the worse is the current state (the lower is 𝜔𝑠 ), the higher is the

fraction of defaulting firms and thus the lower is the household’s income.

          The timeline of an investment cycle in the model is illustrated below.




                                   t                                   t+1
                         Firms issue debt,                       State 𝜔𝑡+1 realized,
                         households buy it,                      production and debt
                         investment occurs                       payouts occur



          Investment decisions by households and firms depend on the perceived

probability with which each firm type 𝜌 repays its debt in the next period. Under the


12   As we show later, this condition ensures that the equilibrium expected return is equal to 𝛽 −1 .

                                                       21
assumed normal shocks, at time 𝑡 the perceived probability with which firm 𝜌 repays at

time 𝑡 + 1 (i.e. the assessed probability of positive output at 𝑡 + 1) is given by:
                                                                                        2
                               +∞                         +∞           �𝑥−𝔼𝜃
                                                                           𝑡 (𝜔𝑡+1 )�
                                                1                  −
      𝜇 �𝜌, 𝔼𝜃𝑡 (𝜔𝑡+1 )� = �    ℎ𝑡𝜃 (𝑥) 𝑑𝑥 =          �        𝑒            2𝜎2             𝑑𝑥.    (7)
                           𝜌                   𝜎√2𝜋   𝜌


The perceived probability of default is then 1 − 𝜇 �𝜌, 𝔼𝜃𝑡 (𝜔𝑡+1 )�. A perfectly safe firm

𝜌 → −∞ never defaults, since lim𝜌→−∞ 𝜇 �𝜌, 𝔼𝜃𝑡 (𝜔𝑡+1 )� = 1. When 𝜃 = 0, we are in the

case of rational expectations and the perceived probability of default is computed

according to the true conditional distribution ℎ(Ω𝑡+1 = 𝜔|Ω𝑡 = 𝜔𝑡 ). When 𝜃 > 0, the

distortions of diagnostic expectations affect the perceived safety of different firms. In

what follows, we refer to 𝜇 �𝜌, 𝔼𝜃𝑡 (𝜔𝑡+1 )� as the “perceived creditworthiness” of firm 𝜌.




4.3 Capital Market Equilibrium and Credit Spreads

       At time 𝑡 firm 𝜌 demands capital 𝑘𝑡+1 (𝜌) at the market contractual interest rate

𝑟𝑡+1 (𝜌) so as to maximize its expected profit at 𝑡 + 1:

                 max (𝑘𝑡+1 (𝜌)𝛼 − 𝑘𝑡+1 (𝜌) ∙ 𝑟𝑡+1 (𝜌)) ∙ 𝜇 �𝜌, 𝔼𝜃𝑡 (𝜔𝑡+1 )�.                       (8)
                𝑘𝑡+1 (𝜌)


The first order condition for the profit maximization problem is given by:
                                                                        1
                                                      𝛼       1−𝛼
                                      𝑘𝑡+1 (𝜌) = �          �     ,                                (9)
                                                   𝑟𝑡+1 (𝜌)

which is the usual downward sloping demand for capital.

       Households are willing to supply any amount of capital to firm 𝜌 provided the

interest rate 𝑟𝑡+1 (𝜌) makes the household indifferent between consuming and saving:

                                                                            1
  𝑟𝑡+1 (𝜌) ∙ 𝜇 �𝜌, 𝔼𝜃𝑡 (𝜔𝑡+1 )� = 𝛽 −1 ⇔ 𝑟𝑡+1 (𝜌) =                                         .     (10)
                                                           𝛽𝜇 �𝜌, 𝔼𝜃𝑡 (𝜔𝑡+1 )�




                                                22
       In equilibrium, this condition must hold for all firms 𝜌. On the one hand, no

arbitrage requires all firms to yield the same expected return. On the other hand, such

expected return cannot be below 𝛽 −1. If this were the case, the household would not

invest and the marginal product of capital would be infinite, leading to a contradiction.

But the expected return of debt cannot be above 𝛽 −1 either. If this were the case, the

household would invest the totality of its income. Under A.1, however, this implies that

the marginal product of capital would fall below 𝛽 −1, again leading to a contradiction.

       From Equation (10), we can compute the spread obtained on the debt of risky

firm 𝜌 at time 𝑡 as the difference between the equilibrium 𝑟𝑡+1 (𝜌) and the safe rate 𝛽 −1:

                                               1
                 𝑆 �𝜌, 𝔼𝜃𝑡 (𝜔𝑡+1 )� = �                − 1� 𝛽 −1 .                     (11)
                                              𝜃 (𝜔
                                       𝜇 �𝜌, 𝔼𝑡 𝑡+1 )�

Risky firms must compensate investors for bearing their default risk by promising

contractual interest rates above 𝛽 −1. The spread at 𝑡 depends on the firm’s riskiness 𝜌

and of current expectations of the aggregate economy. Greater optimism 𝔼𝜃𝑡 (𝜔𝑡+1 )

lowers spreads by improving perceived creditworthiness 𝜇 �𝜌, 𝔼𝜃𝑡 (𝜔𝑡+1 )�.          Greater

riskiness 𝜌 enhances spreads by reducing perceived creditworthiness.

       By combining Equations (11) and (9) we obtain:
                                                                    1
                                                                   1−𝛼
                                                 𝛼𝛽
                         𝑘𝑡+1 (𝜌) = �                          �         ,             (12)
                                        1 + 𝛽𝑆 �𝜌, 𝔼𝜃𝑡 (𝜔𝑡+1 )�

which links expectations to credit spreads, investment and output. When times are

good, households are optimistic and 𝔼𝜃𝑡 (𝜔𝑡+1 ) is high. As a consequence, spreads are

compressed, firms issue debt and expand investment. When times turn sour,

households become pessimistic, spreads rise and firms cut debt issuance and




                                               23
investment. As we show later, Equation (12) can be aggregated across different values

of 𝜌 to obtain aggregate investment at time 𝑡 and output at 𝑡 + 1.

       We can now generate some testable implications of our model. Using Equation

(11), define the average spread at time 𝑡 as:
                                       +∞
                              𝑆𝑡 = �     𝑆 �𝜌, 𝔼𝜃𝑡 (𝜔𝑡+1 )� 𝑓(𝜌)𝑑𝜌 .                    (13)
                                    −∞

       Here 𝑆𝑡 represents an inverse measure of optimism, which is strictly

monotonically decreasing in the expectations argument. When investors are more

optimistic, i.e. 𝔼𝜃𝑡 (𝜔𝑡+1 ) is higher, average perceived creditworthiness is higher, and

hence the average spread 𝑆𝑡 charged on risky debt is lower.

       We can substitute this inverse measure of optimism for expectations 𝔼𝜃𝑡 (𝜔𝑡+1 ) in

Equations (11) and (12). An increase in the average spread 𝑆𝑡 corresponds to an

increase in the spreads, as well as a decrease in investment, of all firms 𝜌. We obtain the

following result for the cross section of firms:


Proposition 2. Lower optimism 𝔼𝜃𝑡 (𝜔𝑡+1 ) and thus higher spread 𝑆𝑡 at time 𝑡 causes:

i) a disproportionate rise in the spread of riskier firms:

                                   𝜕 2 𝑆 �𝜌, 𝔼𝜃𝑡 (𝜔𝑡+1 )�
                                                            > 0.
                                            𝜕𝑆𝑡 𝜕𝜌

ii) a disproportionate decline in debt issuance and investment by riskier firms:

                             𝜕 𝑘𝑡+1 (𝜌1 )
                                           <0        𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑎𝑙𝑙 𝜌1 > 𝜌2 .
                            𝜕𝑆𝑡 𝑘𝑡+1 (𝜌2 )


       Because it is more sensitive to aggregate conditions, investment by riskier firms

fluctuates more with expectations and displays more co-movement with credit markets.

       These predictions of the model are consistent with the evidence of Greenwood

and Hanson (2013). They document that when the Baa-credit spread falls, bond

                                                24
issuance increases and the effect is particularly strong for firms characterized by higher

expected default rates. As a consequence, the share of non-investment grade debt over

total debt (the “junk share”) increases, as has also been documented by LSZ (2015).

       This behavior of the junk share follows directly from property ii) above, which

implies that the share of debt issued by firms riskier than an arbitrary threshold 𝜌�:
                                        +∞
                                      ∫𝜌�    𝑘𝑡+1 (𝜌)𝑓(𝜌)𝑑𝜌
                                        +∞                    ,
                                      ∫−∞ 𝑘𝑡+1 (𝜌)𝑓(𝜌)𝑑𝜌

unambiguously increases as spreads become compressed (for any 𝜌�).

       The qualitative effects described in Proposition 2 do not rely on diagnostic

expectations and obtain even if households are fully rational. Diagnostic expectations

have distinctive implications for the behavior over time of equilibrium credit spreads as

well as of their expectations by market participants. We now turn to this analysis.



5. Diagnostic Expectations and Equilibrium Credit Spreads

       We investigate the link between expectations and the dynamics of the

equilibrium credit spread by considering a linearized version of Equation (11). A first

order expansion of Equation (11) with respect to investors’ expectations 𝔼𝜃𝑡 (𝜔𝑡+1 )

around the long run mean of zero yields:

                                      1    1            𝜇′(𝜌, 0)
               𝑆 �𝜌, 𝔼𝜃𝑡 (𝜔𝑡+1 )� ≈     ∙�      − 1� −           ∙ 𝔼𝜃 (𝜔 )
                                      𝛽 𝜇(𝜌, 0)        𝛽𝜇(𝜌, 0)2 𝑡 𝑡+1

The spread drops as expectations improve (since 𝜇′(𝜌, 0) > 0), but more so for riskier

firms (the slope coefficient increases in 𝜌). Aggregating this equation across all firms 𝜌

and denoting by 𝜎0 , 𝜎1 > 0 the average intercept and slope, we find that the average

spread at time 𝑡 approximately satisfies:

                                       𝑆𝑡 = 𝜎0 − 𝜎1 𝔼𝜃𝑡 (𝜔𝑡+1 ).                         (14)


                                                25
Inserting into (14) the expression for 𝔼𝜃𝑡 (𝜔𝑡+1 ) of Equation (4), under the maintained

assumption of AR(1) fundamentals 𝜔𝑡 = 𝑏𝜔𝑡−1 + 𝜖𝑡 , we establish:


Proposition 3. The average credit spread 𝑆𝑡 follows an ARMA(1,1) process given by:

                   𝑆𝑡 = (1 − 𝑏)𝜎0 + 𝑏 ∙ 𝑆𝑡−1 − (1 + 𝜃)𝑏𝜎1 𝜖𝑡 + 𝜃𝑏 2 𝜎1 𝜖𝑡−1 .             (15)


Under rational expectations (𝜃 = 0) the equilibrium spread, like fundamentals, follows

an AR(1) process characterized by persistence parameter 𝑏. Starting from the long run

spread 𝜎0 , after a positive fundamental shock 𝜖𝑡 > 0 expectations improve and the

spread declines. After this initial drop, the spread on average gradually returns to 𝜎0 .

The reverse occurs after a negative piece of news 𝜖𝑡 < 0: spreads go up on impact and

then monotonically return to 𝜎0 .

       Under diagnostic expectations, 𝜃 > 0, credit spreads continue to have an

autoregressive parameter 𝑏 but now also contain a moving average component. The

spread at time 𝑡 now depends also on the shock experienced at 𝑡 − 1. If the news

received in the previous period were good, 𝜖𝑡−1 > 0, so that 𝑆𝑡−1 was low, there is a

discrete hike in the spread at time 𝑡. If the news received in the previous period were

bad, 𝜖𝑡−1 < 0, so that 𝑆𝑡−1 was high, there is a discrete drop in the spread at time 𝑡.

       These delayed corrections occur on average (controlling for mean reversion in

fundamentals) and correspond to the systematic correction of errors in diagnostic

forecasts described in Section 3. In particular, the over-reaction 𝜃𝜖𝑡−1 at 𝑡 − 1 reverses

on average at 𝑡. Reversal of optimism about fundamentals contaminates the spread,

which exhibits the predictable non-fundamental reversal of Equation (15). When at

𝑡 − 1 news are good, 𝜖𝑡−1 > 0, optimism is excessive and the spread 𝑆𝑡−1 drops too far.

Next period this excess optimism wanes on average, so that 𝑆𝑡 is corrected upwards.




                                             26
The reverse occurs if at 𝑡 − 1 news are bad. In this sense, the making and un-making of

expectational errors cause boom bust cycles and mean reversion in spreads.

       We next show that the equilibrium behavior of credit spreads in (15) accounts

for the findings on expectational errors of Section 2. In section 5.2, we show that the

model also accounts for the evidence on the link between credit spreads and economic

activity that is hard to explain under rational expectations.



5.1 Credit Spread Forecasts

       In Section 2, we provided some evidence concerning expectations of credit

spreads, namely that forecasts of credit spreads exhibit predictable errors due to an

extrapolative nature of expectations, and that these forecasts exhibit systematic

reversals. To connect the model to this evidence, we now describe how agents with

diagnostic expectations form forecasts of credit spreads.

       Investors forecast future credit spreads using the structural equation (14). As a

consequence, the forecast made at 𝑡 for the spread at 𝑡 + 𝑇 is given by:

                          𝔼𝜃𝑡 (𝑆𝑡+𝑇 ) = 𝜎0 − 𝜎1 𝔼𝜃𝑡 �𝔼𝜃𝑡+𝑇 (𝜔𝑡+𝑇+1 )�.

       By exploiting Proposition1 and Corollary 1 we obtain:


Lemma 1 The 𝑇 periods ahead diagnostic forecast of the spread is given by:

                                 𝔼𝜃𝑡 (𝑆𝑡+𝑇 ) = 𝜎0 (1 − 𝑏 𝑇 ) + 𝑏 𝑇 𝑆𝑡 .               (16)


Diagnostic expectations project the current spread into the future via the persistence

parameter 𝑏. The more persistent is the process for fundamentals, the greater is the

influence of the current spread 𝑆𝑡 on forecasts of future spreads.

       Critically, unlike the equilibrium process for the spread in (15), the forecast

process in (16) does not exhibit reversals. The intuition is simple: diagnostic forecasters

                                              27
fail to anticipate the systematic reversal in the equilibrium spread realized when their

extrapolation of current news turns out to be incorrect.

        This idea can help account for the evidence of Section 2.


Proposition 4. If the equilibrium spread follows (15) and expectations follow (16):

i) the forecast error at 𝑡 + 1 is predictable in light of information available at 𝑡:

                                    𝔼𝑡 �𝑆𝑡+1 − 𝔼𝜃𝑡 (𝑆𝑡+1 )� = 𝜃𝑏 2 𝜎1 𝜖𝑡 .                         (17)

ii) the revision of expectations about 𝑆𝑡+𝑇 occurring between 𝑡 and 𝑡 + 𝑠 is predictable in

light of information available at time 𝑡:

                                  𝔼𝑡 �𝔼𝜃𝑡+𝑠 (𝑆𝑡+𝑇 ) − 𝔼𝜃𝑡 (𝑆𝑡+𝑇 )� = 𝜃𝑏 𝑇+1 𝜎1 𝜖𝑡 .                (18)


        Forecast errors and forecast revisions are predictable because expectations

neglect the systematic reversal of excess optimism or pessimism. As a consequence,

current good news about fundamentals, 𝜖𝑡 > 0, predict both that the realized spread

next period is on average above the forecast (Equation 17) and that longer term

forecasts of spreads will be revised upward in the future (Equation 18). The reverse

pattern of predictability occurs after bad news 𝜖𝑡 < 0.

        Equations (17) and (18) can thus account for the evidence of Section 2. In good

times 𝜖𝑡 > 0 and the spread 𝑆𝑡 is excessively low. This reflects excess optimism about

the future, so 𝔼𝑡 �𝑆𝑡+1 − 𝔼𝜃𝑡 (𝑆𝑡+1 )� > 0. The reverse occurs in bad times. Overall, the

spread 𝑆𝑡 is negatively correlated with the forecast error 𝔼𝑡 �𝑆𝑡+1 − 𝔼𝜃𝑡 (𝑆𝑡+1 )�, as

documented in Column 3 of Table 1. 13 Similarly, good times in which the spread 𝑆𝑡 is


13This negative correlation comes about precisely because, as shown in columns 1 and 2 of Table 1, the
coefficient of forecasts 𝔼𝜃𝑡 (𝑆𝑡+1 ) on the current spread 𝑆𝑡 is higher than the persistence parameter
obtained by fitting an AR(1) to the path of equilibrium spreads. Formally, suppose that expectations are
diagnostic. Then, if one fits the AR(1) 𝑆𝑡+1 = 𝛾 + 𝛿𝑆𝑡 + 𝑣𝑡+1 to the equilibrium spread of Equation (15),
the estimated autoregressive coefficient is:
                                     𝔼(𝑆𝑡 𝑆𝑡−1 )       (1 + 𝜃)[1 − 𝜃𝑏 2 ] + (𝜃𝑏)2
                         𝛿̂ (𝜃) =                =𝑏                                 .
                                   𝔼(𝑆𝑡−1 𝑆𝑡−1 )    (1 + 𝜃)[1 + 𝜃 − 2𝜃𝑏 2 ] + (𝜃𝑏)2

                                                  28
low predict upward revisions of future forecasts of spreads 𝔼𝑡 �𝔼𝜃𝑡+𝑠 (𝑆𝑡+𝑇 ) −

𝔼𝜃𝑡 (𝑆𝑡+𝑇 )� > 0.    The spread 𝑆𝑡 is thus negatively correlated with the forecast revision

𝔼𝑡 �𝔼𝜃𝑡+𝑠 (𝑆𝑡+𝑇 ) − 𝔼𝜃𝑡 (𝑆𝑡+𝑇 )� as shown in Table 2. Predictability of both forecast errors

and revisions obtains because agents’ expectations over-react and extrapolate current

spreads into the future without realizing that such over-reaction eventually reverses.

        These predictions are illustrated in Figure 4 below. For a simulated path of

fundamentals following an AR(1) process, Panel A shows the time series of next-period

forecasts of credit spreads, under rational expectations (𝔼𝑡−1 (𝑆𝑡 ), dashed blue), and

under diagnostic expectations (𝔼𝜃𝑡−1 (𝑆𝑡 ), solid red line). 14 For the same simulation,

Panel B shows the negative correlation between the current spread 𝑆𝑡 and forecast

        𝜃           𝜃
errors 𝑆𝑡+1 − 𝔼𝜃𝑡 �𝑆𝑡+1 �.

        We can draw another useful comparison between our model and “Natural

Expectations” (Fuster et al 2010). Both models share the feature that forecast errors

are predictable because individuals underestimate the possibility of reversals. The

underlying mechanism is however very different. The natural expectations framework

assumes exogenous long-term reversals, and errors in expectations arise because

agents fit a simpler AR(1) model to the data. In our model, in contrast, both the process

for spreads and the agents’ forecast errors are endogenous to diagnostic expectations.

Agents extrapolate current news too far into the future, which in turn endogenously

generates unanticipated reversals in the equilibrium process for spreads.




If instead one fits the linear expectations model 𝔼𝜃𝑡 (𝑆𝑡+1 ) = 𝜑 + 𝜇𝑆𝑡 + 𝑒𝑡+1 , the estimated coefficient on
the current spread is equal to 𝜇̂ = 𝑏. It is easy to check that the estimated persistence of actuals 𝛿̂ (𝜃) is
lower than 𝑏, the estimated persistence of forecasts. This is because the AR(1) specification picks
reversals in the moving average component of actuals by estimating a lower persistence parameter.

started at 𝜔𝑡 = 0 (the long-term mean of the process), and was run for 75 periods. The diagnostic
expectation parameter was set at 𝜃 = 1.

5.2 Predictability of Returns, Volatility of Spreads, and Economic Activity

       Our model can account for some additional evidence.                      We first consider the

evidence on abnormal bond returns and on excess volatility of credit spreads. For our

purposes, it is convenient to define the “rational spread” 𝑆𝑡𝑟 as one that would prevail at

time t under rational expectations (𝜃 = 0). This spread is the compensation for default

risk demanded by rational investors. Proposition 3 then implies:


Corollary 2. Under diagnostic expectations, 𝜃 > 0, the following properties hold:

i) investors earn predictably low (resp. high) average returns after good (resp. bad) news:

                                        𝑆𝑡 − 𝑆𝑡𝑟 = −𝜃𝑏𝜎1 𝜖𝑡 .

ii) credit spreads exhibit excess volatility:

                            𝑉𝑎𝑟[𝑆𝑡 |𝜔𝑡−1 ] = (1 + 𝜃)2 𝑉𝑎𝑟[𝑆𝑡𝑟 |𝜔𝑡−1 ].


       Predictability of returns comes from errors in expectations. After good news

𝜖𝑡 > 0, investors are too optimistic and demand too little compensation for default risk,

                                                  30
𝑆𝑡 < 𝑆𝑡𝑟 . The average realized return on bonds is thus below the riskless rate 𝛽 −1.

After bad news 𝜖𝑡 < 0 , investors are too pessimistic and demand excessive

compensation for default risk, 𝑆𝑡 > 𝑆𝑡𝑟 . The average realized return is above 𝛽 −1. 15

         Expectational errors also underlie excess volatility of spreads.                        Equilibrium

spreads vary too much relative to objective measures of default risk, which are captured

by 𝑆𝑡𝑟 , because spreads also reflect investor over-reaction to recent news. Over-reaction

to good or bad news causes investors’ risk perceptions to be too volatile, which in turn

introduces excess volatility into market prices. 16

         Greenwood and Hanson (2013) document the pattern of return predictability in

Corollary 2. They find that high levels of the junk share predict anomalously low, and

even negative, excess returns, and that this occurs precisely after good news, measured

by drops in expected default rates (point i). 17 They consider conventional explanations

for this finding, such as time varying risk aversion and financial frictions, but conclude

that the evidence (particularly the observed frequency of negative returns) is more

consistent with the hypothesis that the junk share is a proxy for investor sentiment and

extrapolation. Diagnostic expectations offer a psychological foundation for this account.

         Additionally, several papers document that credit spreads appear too volatile

relative to what could be explained by the volatility in default rates or fundamentals

(Collin-Dufresne et al. 2001, Gilchrist and Zakrasjek 2012).                         For instance, Collin-


15 Return predictability can also be gauged from Equation (10). The investor’s average return at 𝑡 is in
fact equal to �𝜇�𝜌, 𝔼𝑡 (𝜔𝑡+1 )�/𝜇 �𝜌, 𝔼𝜃𝑡 (𝜔𝑡+1 )�� 𝛽 −1 . This is below the risk free rate in good times, when
investors are too optimistic 𝜇 �𝜌, 𝔼𝜃𝑡 (𝜔𝑡+1 )� > 𝜇�𝜌, 𝔼𝑡 (𝜔𝑡+1 )�, and above the risk free rate during periods
of pessimism.
16 Specifically, excess volatility is due to the fact that beliefs do not just depend on the level of the current
fundamentals 𝜔𝑡 (as would be the case under rational expectations). They also depend on the magnitude
𝜀𝑡 of the recently observed news, which corresponds roughly speaking to the change in fundamentals.
17 One intuitive way to see this is to note (see Equation (16)) that the credit terms obtained by riskier
firms are more sensitive to the biases caused by diagnostic expectations than those obtained by safer
firms. Periods of excess optimism witness an abnormal increase in the junk share and disappointing
subsequent returns. Periods of excess pessimism see the reverse pattern.

                                                      31
Dufresne et al. (2001) find that credit spreads display excess volatility relative to

measures of fundamentals such as realized default rates, liquidity, or business

conditions. They argue this excess volatility can be explained by a common factor that

captures aggregate shocks in credit supply and demand. Our model suggests that

investors’ excessive reaction to changing news can offer an account of these shocks.

       The boom-bust cycles in credit spreads shape investment (see Equation 12) and

cause in turn overbuilding, underbuilding, and excess volatility in the real economy.

Gennaioli, Ma and Shleifer (2015) find that CFOs with more optimistic earnings

expectations invest more. Greenwood and Hanson (2015) study empirically investment

cycles in the ship industry.    Consistent with our model, they find that returns to

investing in dry bulk ships are predictable and tightly linked to boom-bust cycles in

industry investment. High current ship earnings are associated with higher ship prices

and higher industry investment, but predict low future returns on capital.

       We next consider the implications of our model for the link between credit

markets and economic activity.      Krishnamurthy and Muir (2015) and LSZ (2015)

document that a tightening of credit spreads at 𝑡 induces an output contraction in

period 𝑡 + 1. Our model yields this pattern as the result of a drop in confidence. A

reduction in optimism 𝔼𝜃𝑡 (𝜔𝑡+1 ) raises the current spread. Tighter financial conditions

in turn cause current debt issuance and investment to decline, leading to a decline in

aggregate output at 𝑡 + 1.

       There is also growing evidence of systematic reversion in credit conditions and

of subsequent output drops. In particular, LSZ (2015) show that low credit spreads at

𝑡 − 1 systematically predict higher credit spreads at 𝑡 and then a drop in output at 𝑡 + 1.

This evidence bears directly on the possibility for our model to generate full-fledged

credit cycles. LSZ (2015) do not try to tease out whether the cycle in credit spreads is

                                            32
due to fundamentals (e.g., mean reversion in the state of the economy) or to fluctuations

in investor sentiment. According to the sentiment account, which they seem to favor, a

period of excessive investor optimism is followed by a period of cooling off, which they

refer to as “unwinding of investor sentiment”. This reversal contributes to a recession

over and above the effect of changes in fundamentals.

        Diagnostic expectations can account for this “unwinding of investor sentiment”,

thereby reconciling predictable reversals in market conditions with abnormal returns

and excess volatility of credit spreads. 18 Diagnostic expectations yield predictable

unwinding of sentiment through the stochastic ARMA for the equilibrium spread in

Proposition 3. Using Equation (15), the rational expectation of credit spreads at time 𝑡 is

given by:

                         𝔼𝑡−1 (𝑆𝑡 ) = [(1 − 𝑏)𝜎0 + 𝑏 ∙ 𝑆𝑡−1 ] + 𝜃𝑏 2 𝜎1 𝜖𝑡−1                     (19)

There are two terms in expression (19). The first term is mean reversion: conditions at

𝑡 can be predicted to deteriorate if the current spread is lower than the true long run

value 𝜎0 . The second term captures reversals of past sentiment, which is a function of

past news 𝜖𝑡−1 = 𝔼𝑡−1 (𝜔𝑡 ) − 𝔼𝑡−2 (𝜔𝑡 ). Good news 𝜖𝑡−1 > 0 at 𝑡 − 1 lead to overheated

markets in the same period and to non-fundamental reversal at 𝑡. This result has the

following implication:


Proposition 5. Suppose that expectations are diagnostic, 𝜃 > 0, and at 𝑡 − 1 credit

spreads are too low due to recent good news, namely 𝜖𝑡−1 > 0. Then:

i) Controlling for fundamentals at 𝑡 − 1, credit spreads predictably rise at t.


18 In related settings, Jorda, Schularick and Taylor (2012) document that strong growth of bank loans
forecasts future financial crises and output drops. Baron and Xiong (2014) show that credit booms are
followed by stock market declines. They document that in good times banks expand their loans, and this
expansion predicts future negative returns on bank equity. The negative returns to equity might reflect
the unwinding of initial investor optimism, or might be caused by abnormally low realized performance
on the bank’s credit decisions (as per Proposition 4). See also Fahlenbrach et al. (2016).

                                                 33
ii) Controlling for fundamentals at 𝑡 − 1, there is a predictable drop in aggregate

investment at 𝑡 and in aggregate production at 𝑡 + 1.


       Diagnostic expectations drive a cycle around fundamentals: over-reaction to

good news causes credit markets and the economy to overshoot at 𝑡 − 1. The

subsequent reversal of such over-reaction causes a drop in credit and economic activity

that is more abrupt than could be accounted for by mean reversion in fundamentals. In

fact, investor psychology can itself be a cause of volatility in credit, investment, and

business cycles, even in the absence of mean reversion in fundamentals, for example if

the process for aggregate productivity 𝜔𝑡 is a random walk (𝑏 = 1).

       In sum, diagnostic expectations lead to short-term extrapolative behavior and

systematic reversals. This is in line with a large set of recent empirical findings on both

financial markets and production, including: i) excess volatility of spreads relative to

measures of fundamentals, ii) excessive spread compression in good times and

excessive spread widening in bad times (and a similar pattern in the junk share), iii)

excessively volatile investment and output, iv) good times predicting abnormally low

returns, and finally v) non-fundamental boom bust cycles in credit spreads, driven by

transient overreaction to news.



6. Conclusion

       We have presented a new approach to modeling beliefs in economic models,

diagnostic expectations, based on Kahneman and Tversky’s representativeness

heuristic. Our model of expectations is portable in Rabin’s sense, meaning that the same

framework accounts for many experimental findings, the phenomenon of stereotyping,

but also critical features of beliefs in financial markets such as extrapolation, over-


                                            34
reaction, and neglect of risk. Diagnostic expectations are also forward-looking, which

means that they are invulnerable to the Lucas critique of mechanical backward looking

models of beliefs.      We applied diagnostic expectations to a straightforward

macroeconomic model of investment, and found that it can account for several

empirical findings regarding credit cycles without resort to financial frictions.

       Two aspects of our research most obviously require further investigation. First,

we have assumed away financial frictions.              Indeed, in our model debt is

indistinguishable from equity, in that there are no costs of financial distress and no

differential legal rights of alternative financial claims, and in particular no collateral

constraints. Furthermore, investors are risk neutral, so that debt does not have a

special role in meeting the needs of risk averse investors (see Gennaioli, Shleifer, and

Vishny 2012). The absence of financial frictions and of risk averse investors leads to

completely symmetric effects of positive and negative news.           Introducing a more

realistic conception of debt might be extremely useful, particularly in the context of

analyzing financial crises. In particular, diagnostic expectations may interact with

collateral constraints to give rise to additional consequences of tightening credit.

       When the economy is hit by a series of good news, investors holding diagnostic

expectations become excessively optimistic, fueling as in the current model excessive

credit expansion. During such a credit expansion households would pay insufficient

attention to the possibility of a bust.     As fundamentals stabilize, the initial excess

optimism unwinds, bringing this possibility to investors’ minds. The economy would

appear to be hit by a “financial shock”: a sudden, seemingly unjustified, increase in

credit spreads. Agents would appear to have suddenly become more risk averse: they

now take into account the crash risk they previously neglected.



                                            35
       In the presence of financial frictions, the economy will not go back to its normal

course. When excessive leverage is revealed, debt investors try to shed the excessive

risk they have taken on, depressing debt prices and market liquidity, particularly if they

are very risk averse as in Gennaioli, Shleifer and Vishny (2012, 2015). The tightening of

debt constraints causes fire-sales and corporate investment cuts, leaving good

investment opportunities unfunded.         Such a crisis does not occur because of

deteriorating fundamentals, but because the initial excess optimism bursts. Years of

bonanza plant the seeds for a financial crisis. A combination of diagnostic expectations

and financial frictions could thus lead to models of financial crises that match both the

expectations data and the reality of severe economic contractions.

       The second set of open questions relates to expectation formation, and the

ability of diagnostic expectations and other models in explaining the data. Using data

on survey expectations greatly expands the possibilities for building and testing new

models. As we have already noted, some economic time series, such as inflation, appear

to exhibit under-reaction to data, while others exhibit over-reaction or the combination

of the two. This raises both empirical and theoretical challenges. First, it seems critical

to understand what are the series, and types of news, where we see under- and over-

reaction. This may help determine whether the data are best explained by models of

inattention (or slow arrival of information), representativeness, a combination of the

two, or neither. Second, as we illustrated in this paper for the case of credit spreads,

combining the data on time series with data on survey expectations can provide a good

deal of information about the expectation process and its influence on decisions and

aggregate outcomes.      Building models of beliefs and expectations starting from

psychological primitives seems to be a promising area of research in both

macroeconomics and finance.

Proposition 1. Let ωt be an AR(1) process, (𝜔𝑡 − 𝜔) = 𝑏(𝜔𝑡−1 − 𝜔) + 𝜖𝑡 , with i.i.d.

normal (0, σ2 ) shocks 𝜖𝑡 . We now compute diagnostic expectations at a generic

horizon 𝑇 > 1. Writing 𝜔𝑡+𝑇 as a function of 𝜔𝑡 plus subsequent shocks, we find
                                                     𝑇−1           𝑇−1

so that the true distribution of 𝜔𝑡+𝑇 given 𝜔𝑡 , namely ℎ(𝜔𝑡+𝑇 |𝜔𝑡 ), is a normal

The reference distribution is ℎ(𝜔𝑡+𝑇 |𝑏𝜔𝑡−1 + (1 − 𝑏)𝜔

The diagnostic distribution then reads (up to normalization constants):

                            1                       2                                2

                           2𝜎𝑇

The quadratic and linear terms in 𝜔𝑡+𝑇 are:

                          1        2                                           2

                         2𝜎𝑇

It follows that the diagnostic distribution ℎ𝑡𝜃 (𝜔𝑡+𝑇 ) is also a normal distribution 𝒩�𝔼𝜃𝑡 (𝜔𝑡+𝑇 ), 𝜎𝑇2 �

with mean:

                            𝔼𝜃𝑡 (𝜔𝑡+𝑇 ) = 𝔼𝑡 (𝜔𝑡+𝑇 ) + 𝜃[𝔼𝑡 (𝜔𝑡+𝑇 ) − 𝔼𝑡−1 (𝜔𝑡+𝑇 )]

         In particular, for 𝑇 = 1 we get

                     𝔼𝜃𝑡 (𝜔𝑡+1 ) = 𝔼𝑡 (𝜔𝑡+1 ) + 𝜃[𝔼𝑡 (𝜔𝑡+1 ) − 𝔼𝑡−1 (𝜔𝑡+1 )]

Corollary 1. Equation (5) follows from the general proof given for Proposition 1. We

now compute iterated diagnostic expectations. We start by computing 𝔼𝜃𝑡 �𝔼𝑡′ (𝜔𝑡+𝑇 )�

when 𝑡 < 𝑡 ′ < 𝑡 + 𝑇. From the perspective of period 𝑡, the expectation 𝔼𝑡′ (𝜔𝑡+𝑇 ) =

that a similar representation holds:

           𝔼𝜃𝑡 �𝔼𝑡′ (𝜔𝑡+𝑇 )� = 𝔼𝑡 �𝔼𝑡′ (𝜔𝑡+𝑇 )� + 𝜃�𝔼𝑡 �𝔼𝑡′ (𝜔𝑡+𝑇 )� − 𝔼𝑡−1 �𝔼𝑡′ (𝜔𝑡+𝑇 )��

The law of iterated expectations of the rational operator 𝔼𝑡 then yields:

                    𝔼𝜃𝑡 �𝔼𝑡′ (𝜔𝑡+𝑇 )� = 𝔼𝑡 (𝜔𝑡+𝑇 ) + 𝜃[𝔼𝑡 (𝜔𝑡+𝑇 ) − 𝔼𝑡−1 (𝜔𝑡+𝑇 )]

In particular, 𝔼𝜃𝑡 �𝔼𝑡′ (𝜔𝑡+𝑇 )� is independent of 𝑡’, so that

                                      𝔼𝜃𝑡 �𝔼𝑡′ (𝜔𝑡+𝑇 ) − 𝔼𝑡′−1 (𝜔𝑡+𝑇 )� = 0

Intuitively, future distortions are in the kernel of the diagnostic expectations operator,

because on average there is no news. Then, from repeated application of Equation (5)

we get:

             𝔼𝜃𝑡 �𝔼𝜃𝑡 ′ (𝜔𝑡+𝑇 )� = 𝔼𝜃𝑡 (𝔼𝑡 ′ (𝜔𝑡+𝑇 ) + 𝜃[𝔼𝑡 ′ (𝜔𝑡+𝑇 ) − 𝔼𝑡 ′ −1 (𝜔𝑡+𝑇 )])

                                 = 𝔼𝑡 (𝜔𝑡+𝑇 ) + 𝜃[𝔼𝑡 (𝜔𝑡+𝑇 ) − 𝔼𝑡−1 (𝜔𝑡+𝑇 )] = 𝔼𝜃𝑡 (𝜔𝑡+𝑇 )

Proposition 3. From Equation (14) we have:

         𝑆𝑡 = 𝜎0 − 𝜎1 [𝑏𝜔𝑡 + (1 − 𝑏)𝜔 + 𝜃1 𝑏𝜖𝑡 ]

                            = 𝜎0 − 𝜎1 [𝑏(𝑏𝜔𝑡−1 + (1 − 𝑏)𝜔 + 𝜖𝑡 ) + (1 − 𝑏)𝜔 + 𝜃1 𝑏𝜖𝑡 ]

where we used the AR(1) condition 𝜔𝑡 = 𝑏𝜔𝑡−1 + (1 − 𝑏)𝜔 + 𝜖𝑡 . Note that, rearranging

the first line (valid for all 𝑡) we find:

                           𝜎1 [𝑏𝜔𝑡−1 + (1 − 𝑏)𝜔] = 𝜎0 − 𝑆𝑡−1 − 𝜎1 𝜃1 𝑏𝜖𝑡−1

Inserting above, we then get:

                                                      43
             𝑆𝑡 = (1 − 𝑏)(𝜎0 − 𝜎1 𝜔) + 𝑏 ∙ 𝑆𝑡−1 − (1 + 𝜃1 )𝑏𝜎1 𝜖𝑡 + 𝜃1 𝑏 2 𝜎1 𝜖𝑡−1

Spreads thus follow an ARMA(1,1) process.

∎



Lemma 1 For notational convenience, rewrite the stochastic process driving credit

spreads as 𝑆𝑡 = 𝑎 + 𝑏 ∙ 𝑆𝑡−1 − 𝑐𝜖𝑡 + 𝑑𝜖𝑡−1 , with 𝑎 = (1 − 𝑏)(𝜎0 − 𝜎1 𝜔), 𝑐 = (1 + 𝜃)𝑏𝜎1

and 𝑑 = 𝜃𝑏 2 𝜎1. The 𝑇 periods ahead diagnostic forecast of the spread is given by:

                     𝔼𝜃𝑡 (𝑆𝑡+𝑇 ) = 𝔼𝜃𝑡 (𝑎 + 𝑏 ∙ 𝑆𝑡+𝑇−1 − 𝑐𝜖𝑡+𝑇 + 𝑑𝜖𝑡+𝑇−1 )

Note that 𝔼𝜃𝑡 (𝜖𝑡+𝑠 ) = 0 for any 𝑠 > 0, because rational expectations of future shocks are

always zero. Thus, for 𝑇 > 1, 𝔼𝜃𝑡 (𝑆𝑡+𝑇 ) becomes
                                             𝑇−2                           𝑇−1

      𝔼𝜃𝑡 (𝑆𝑡+𝑇 ) = 𝑎 + 𝔼𝜃𝑡 (𝑏 ∙ 𝑆𝑡+𝑇−1 ) = 𝑎 � 𝑏 𝑠 + 𝑏 𝑇−1 𝔼𝜃𝑡 (𝑆𝑡+1 ) = 𝑎 � 𝑏 𝑠 + 𝑏 𝑇 𝑆𝑡
                                             𝑠=0                           𝑠=0


Inserting the coefficients we get :

                          𝔼𝜃𝑡 (𝑆𝑡+𝑇 ) = (1 − 𝑏 𝑇 )(𝜎0 − 𝜎1 𝜔) + 𝑏 𝑇 𝑆𝑡

Consider now the case 𝑇 = 1. Using (14) and the law of iterated expectations for

diagnostic expectations, write 𝔼𝜃𝑡 (𝑆𝑡+1 ) = 𝜎0 − 𝜎1 𝔼𝜃𝑡 (𝜔𝑡+2 ). Inserting 𝜔𝑡+2 = 𝑏𝜔𝑡+1 +

𝜖𝑡+2 and 𝔼𝜃𝑡 (𝜖𝑡+2 ) = 0, we obtain the result.

∎



Proposition 4. The forecast error at 𝑡 + 1 is 𝔼𝑡 �𝑆𝑡+1 − 𝔼𝜃𝑡 (𝑆𝑡+1 )�.           The first result

follows immediately from Lemma 1. Alternatively, write:

                 𝑆𝑡+1 − 𝔼𝜃𝑡 (𝑆𝑡+1 ) = −𝜎1 �𝔼𝜃𝑡+1 (𝜔𝑡+2 ) − 𝔼𝜃𝑡 �𝔼𝜃𝑡+1 (𝜔𝑡+2 )��

The first term is 𝔼𝜃𝑡+1 (𝜔𝑡+2 ) = 𝔼𝑡+1 (𝜔𝑡+2 ) + 𝜃𝑏𝜖𝑡+1, while the second term is

𝔼𝜃𝑡 �𝔼𝜃𝑡+1 (𝜔𝑡+2 )� = 𝔼𝑡 (𝜔𝑡+2 ) + 𝜃𝑏 2 𝜖𝑡 . Taking expectations on the difference, we find


                                              44
𝔼𝑡 �𝑆𝑡+1 − 𝔼𝜃𝑡 (𝑆𝑡+1 )� = 𝜎1 𝜃𝑏 2 𝜖𝑡 . Thus, positive news today narrow the spread today and

the predicted spread tomorrow, but the realized spread tomorrow is systematically

larger than predicted.

       Similarly, we can write

    𝔼𝑡 �𝔼𝜃𝑡+𝑠 (𝑆𝑡+𝑇 ) − 𝔼𝜃𝑡 (𝑆𝑡+𝑇 )� = −𝜎1 𝔼𝑡 �𝔼𝜃𝑡+𝑠 �𝔼𝜃𝑡+𝑇 (𝜔𝑡+𝑇+1 )� − 𝔼𝜃𝑡 �𝔼𝜃𝑡+𝑇 (𝜔𝑡+𝑇+1 )��

Using the representation of Corollary 1, this becomes

                           𝔼𝑡 �𝔼𝜃𝑡+𝑠 (𝑆𝑡+𝑇 ) − 𝔼𝜃𝑡 (𝑆𝑡+𝑇 )� = 𝜎1 𝜃𝑏 𝑇+1 𝜖𝑡

Again, positive news today compress expected spreads in the future, and these

expectations systematically widen going forward.

∎


Corollary 2. Defining 𝑆𝑡𝑟 as the credit spread that obtains under rational expectations,

where 𝜃 = 0, it follows immediately from Equation (14) that

                                       𝑆𝑡 − 𝑆𝑡𝑟 = −𝜃𝑏𝜎1 𝜖𝑡

Moreover,

            𝑉𝑎𝑟[𝑆𝑡 |𝜔𝑡−1 ] = 𝑉𝑎𝑟[−(1 + 𝜃)𝑏𝜎1 𝜖𝑡 |𝜔𝑡−1 ] = (1 + 𝜃)2 𝑉𝑎𝑟[𝑆𝑡𝑟 |𝜔𝑡−1 ].

∎


Proposition 5. Assume that at 𝑡 − 1 spreads are low due to recent good news, 𝜖𝑡−1 > 0,

It follows from the ARMA(1,1) structure for spreads derived in Proposition 3 that the

expected future path of spreads is:

                   𝔼𝑡−1 [𝑆𝑡 ] = (1 − 𝑏)(𝜎0 − 𝜎1 𝜔) + 𝑏 ∙ 𝑆𝑡−1 + 𝜃𝑏 2 𝜎1 𝜖𝑡−1

from which the result follows.

       Aggregate investment at 𝑡 and aggregate production at 𝑡 + 1 are strictly

decreasing functions of the average credit spread 𝑆𝑡 . It follows from point i) that, under


                                                 45
the assumptions of the Proposition and controlling for fundamentals at 𝑡 − 1, there is a

predictable drop in these quantities from the perspective of 𝑡 − 1.

Appendix

       We briefly consider two alternative specifications of the reference group –G used

to define representativeness.



Lagged Diagnostic Expectations as Reference

       We start by specifying – 𝐺 in terms of diagnostic expectations 𝔼𝜃𝑡−1 (𝜔𝑡 ). Assume

that the agent compares the current distribution with the one implied by his past

diagnostic expectation of Ω𝑡 , namely −𝐺 ≡ �Ω𝑡 = 𝔼𝜃𝑡−1 (𝜔𝑡 )�. Diagnostic expectations at

time 𝑡 are then given by:

                  𝔼𝜃𝑡 (𝜔𝑡+1 ) = 𝔼𝑡 (𝜔𝑡+1 ) + 𝜃�𝔼𝑡 (𝜔𝑡+1 ) − 𝑏𝔼𝜃𝑡−1 (𝜔𝑡 )�.           (17)

       The agent is overly optimistic when news point to an outcome that is sufficiently

good as compared with his past expectations, 𝔼𝑡 (𝜔𝑡+1 ) > 𝑏𝔼𝜃𝑡−1 (𝜔𝑡 ), and overly

pessimistic otherwise. By iterating Equation (17) backwards, for 𝜃𝑏 < 1 we obtain:

                     𝔼𝜃𝑡 (𝜔𝑡+1 ) = (1 + 𝜃) �       (−𝜃𝑏)𝑗 𝔼𝑡−𝑗 �𝜔𝑡−𝑗+1 � .           (18)
                                               𝑗≥0


       Diagnostic expectations are a weighted average of current and past one-period-

ahead rational expectations, with weights that depend on 𝜃. Again, when 𝜃 = 0,

expectations are rational. In Equation (18) the signs on rational expectations obtained

in odd and even past periods alternate. This is an intuitive consequence of (17) and

implies that news exert a non-monotonic effect in future expectations. Agents over-

react on impact, but this over-reaction implies reference expectations are higher the

next period, causing a reversal to pessimism (which in turn generates future optimism

and so on). Specifying – 𝐺 in terms of diagnostic expectations thus preserves the two

key properties of our basic model: expectations display over-reaction to news on impact

but also reversal in the future.


                                              47
Slow Moving – 𝐺

       In our main specification, context – 𝐺 is the immediate past. This assumption

starkly illustrates our results and buys significant tractability. It is however possible

that remote but remarkable memories influence the agent’s background context. Our

model can be easily enriched to capture this feature by defining representativeness in

terms of a mixture of current and past likelihood ratios:
                                             𝛼1                                    𝛼
            ℎ(Ω𝑡+1 = 𝜔𝑡+1 |Ω𝑡 = 𝜔𝑡 )                ℎ(Ω𝑡+1 = 𝜔𝑡+1 |Ω𝑡 = 𝑏𝜔𝑡−1 ) 2
          �                            �          �                                � ,
           ℎ(Ω𝑡+1 = 𝜔𝑡+1 |Ω𝑡 = 𝑏𝜔𝑡−1 )              ℎ(Ω𝑡+1 = 𝜔𝑡+1 |Ω𝑡 = 𝑏 2 𝜔𝑡−2 )

where 𝛼1 ≥ 0 and 𝛼2 ≥ 0 capture the weights attached to present and past

representativeness, respectively. The coefficients 𝛼𝑖 capture limited memory (past news

are completely forgotten if 𝛼2 = 0, as in the main text), and 𝛼1 > 𝛼2 captures recency

effects. In this case we have that:

                   𝔼𝜃𝑡 (𝜔𝑡+1 ) = 𝔼𝑡 (𝜔𝑡+1 ) + 𝜃𝛼1 [𝔼𝑡 (𝜔𝑡+1 ) − 𝔼𝑡−1 (𝜔𝑡+1 )] +

                                          +𝜃𝛼2 [𝔼𝑡−1 (𝜔𝑡+1 ) − 𝔼𝑡−2 (𝜔𝑡+1 )].            (22)

       The agent can remain too optimistic even after minor bad news, 𝔼𝑡 (𝜔𝑡+1 ) −

𝔼𝑡−1 (𝜔𝑡+1 ) < 0, provided he experienced major good news in the past 𝔼𝑡−1 (𝜔𝑡+1 ) −

𝔼𝑡−2 (𝜔𝑡+1 ) ≫ 0. This feature can yield under-reaction to early warnings of crises (see

Gennaioli et al. 2015 for a related formulation). At the same time, the main properties of

over-reaction and reversal continue to hold in this specification with respect to

repeated news in the same direction, which are plausible in the case of credit cycles.

       In general, the robust predictions of the model remain over-reaction and

reversals. Different specifications of – 𝐺 yield different ancillary predictions that may

make it possible to uncover the structure of – 𝐺 in the data. This is an important avenue

for future work.
