                                        ABSTRACT

A new class of Capital Asset Pricing Models (CAPM) arises from the first principle of real
investment for individual firms. Conceptually as "causal"' as the consumption CAPM, yet
empirically more tractable, the investment CAPM emerges as a leading asset pricing paradigm.
Firms do a good job in aligning investment policies with costs of capital, and this alignment
drives many empirical patterns that are anomalous in the consumption CAPM. Most important,
integrating the anomalies literature in finance and accounting with neoclassical economics, the
investment CAPM succeeds in mounting an efficient markets counterrevolution to behavioral
finance in the past 15 years.

1    Introduction

Consider a two-period stochastic general equilibrium model. The economy has three defining char-
acteristics of neoclassical economics: (i) Agents have rational expectations; (ii) consumers maximize
utility, and firms maximize their market value of equity; and (iii) markets clear.

    There are two dates, t and t + 1. The economy is populated by a representative household
and heterogeneous firms, indexed by i = 1, 2, . . . , N . The representative household maximizes its
expected utility, U (Ct ) + ρEt [U (Ct+1 )], in which ρ is the time preference coefficient, and Ct and
Ct+1 are consumption expenditures in t and t + 1, respectively. Let Pit be the ex-dividend equity,
and Dit the dividend of firm i at period t. The first principle of consumption says that:

                                                                                S
                    Pit = Et [Mt+1 (Pit+1 + Dit+1 )]        ⇒         Et [Mt+1 rit+1 ] = 1,            (1)

          S
in which rit+1 ≡ (Pit+1 + Dit+1 )/Pit is firm i’s stock return, and Mt+1 ≡ ρU ′ (Ct+1 )/U ′ (Ct ) is the
household’s stochastic discount factor. Equation (1) can be rewritten as:

                                            S
                                       Et [rit+1 ] − rf t = β M
                                                              it λM t ,                                (2)

in which rf t ≡ 1/Et [Mt+1 ] is the real interest rate, β M          S
                                                          it ≡ −Cov(rit+1 , Mt+1 )/Var(Mt+1 ) is the con-

sumption beta, and λM t ≡ Var(Mt+1 )/Et [Mt+1 ] is the price of the consumption risk. Equation (2)
is the consumption CAPM, first derived by Rubinstein (1976), Lucas (1978), and Breeden (1979).
The classic CAPM, due to Treynor (1962), Sharpe (1964), Lintner (1965), and Mossin (1966), can
be obtained as a special case of the consumption CAPM under quadratic utility or exponential
utility with normally distributed returns (Cochrane 2005, p. 152–155).

    On the production side, firms produce a single commodity to be consumed or invested. Firm i
starts with the productive capital, Kit , operates in both dates, and exits at the end of date t + 1
with a liquidation value of zero. The rate of capital depreciation is set to be 100%. Firms differ
in capital, Kit , and profitability, Xit , both of which are known at the beginning of date t. The
operating profits are given by Πit ≡ Xit Kit . Firm i’s profitability at date t + 1, Xit+1 , is stochastic,
and is subject to aggregate shocks affecting all firms simultaneously, as well as firm-specific shocks
affecting only firm i. Let Iit be the investment for date t, then Kit+1 = Iit . Investment entails
quadratic adjustment costs, (a/2)(Iit /Kit )2 Kit , in which a > 0 is a constant parameter.

    Firm i uses its operating profits at date t to pay investment and adjustment costs. If the net


                                                      1
cash flow, Dit ≡ Xit Kit − Iit − (a/2)(Iit /Kit )2 Kit , is positive, the firm distributes it back to the
household. A negative Dit means external equity raised by the firm from the household. At date
t + 1, firm i uses capital, Kit+1 , to obtain operating profits, Xit+1 Kit+1 , which is in turn distributed
as dividends back to the household, Dit+1 ≡ Xit+1 Kit+1 . With only two dates, firm i does not
invest in date t + 1, Iit+1 = 0, and the ex-dividend equity value, Pit+1 , is zero.

   Taking the household’s stochastic discount factor, Mt+1 , as given, firm i chooses Iit to maximize
the cum-dividend equity value at the beginning of date t:
                                 "                                                    #
                                               a Iit 2
                                                      
          Pit + Dit = max Xit Kit − Iit −                 Kit + Et [Mt+1 Xit+1 Kit+1 ] .               (3)
                          {Iit }               2 Kit

The first principle of investment for firm i says that:

                                             Iit
                                       1+a       = Et [Mt+1 Xit+1 ].                                   (4)
                                             Kit

Intuitively, the marginal costs of investment, consisting of the purchasing price (unity) and the
marginal adjustment costs, a(Iit /Kit ), must equal marginal q, which is the present value of the
marginal benefits of investment given by the marginal product of capital, Xit+1 .

   The first principle of investment can be rewritten without the stochastic discount factor,
Mt+1 (Cochrane 1991). In particular, equation (3), when combined with Dit ≡ Xit Kit − Iit −
(a/2)(Iit /Kit )2 Kit , implies that the ex-dividend equity value at the optimum is:

                                       Pit = Et [Mt+1 Xit+1 Kit+1 ].                                   (5)

The stock return can then be rewritten as:

                   S        Pit+1 + Dit+1        Xit+1 Kit+1              Xit+1
                  rit+1 =                 =                        =                  .                (6)
                                 Pit        Et [Mt+1 Xit+1 Kit+1 ]   Et [Mt+1 Xit+1 ]

   Combining equations (4) and (6) yields the investment CAPM :

                                          S            Xit+1
                                         rit+1 =                    .                                  (7)
                                                   1 + a(Iit /Kit )

Intuitively, firm i keeps investing until the date-t marginal costs of investment, 1 + a(Iit /Kit ), equal
the marginal benefits of investment at t + 1, Xit+1 , discounted to date t with the stock return,
 S , as the discount rate. Equivalently, the ratio of the marginal benefits of investment at t + 1
rit+1
                                                                            S .
divided by the marginal costs of investment at t equals the discount rate, rit+1


                                                      2
   Most important, the investment CAPM, as asset pricing theory, gives rise to cross-sectionally
varying expected returns. The model predicts that, all else equal, high investment stocks should
earn lower expected returns than low investment stocks, and that stocks with high expected prof-
itability should earn higher expected returns than stocks with low expected profitability. When
expected returns vary cross-sectionally in equilibrium, stock prices will adjust in a way that con-
nects expected returns to characteristics. In particular, stock prices will not adjust to conform to
a cross-sectionally constant discount rate, meaning that characteristics do not predict returns. A
cross-sectionally constant discount rate is equivalent to saying that all stocks are equally risky.

   The intuition behind the investment CAPM is just the net present value rule in capital bud-
geting, which is a fundamental principle in modern corporate finance. Investment predicts returns
because given expected profitability, high costs of capital imply low net present values of new cap-
ital and low investment, and low costs of capital imply high net present values of new capital and
high investment. Profitability predicts returns because high expected profitability relative to low
investment must imply high discount rates. The high discount rates are necessary to offset the high
expected profitability to induce low net present values of new capital and low investment. If the
discount rates were not high enough, firms would instead observe high net present values of new
capital and invest more. Conversely, low expected profitability relative to high investment must
imply low discount rates. If the discount rates were not low enough to counteract the low expected
profitability, firms would instead observe low net present values of new capital and invest less.

   The consumption CAPM and the investment CAPM are the two sides of the same coin in gen-
eral equilibrium, delivering identical expected returns (Lin and Zhang 2013). To see this insight,
combining the consumption CAPM in equation (2) and the investment CAPM in equation (7) yields:

                                                                   Et [Xit+1 ]
                              rf t + β M              S
                                       it λM t = Et [rit+1 ] =                    .                   (8)
                                                                 1 + a(Iit /Kit )

Intuitively, the consumption CAPM, which is derived from the first principle of consumption, con-
nects expected returns to consumption betas. The consumption CAPM predicts that consumption
betas are sufficient statistics for expected returns. Once consumption betas are controlled for, char-
acteristics should not affect the cross section of expected returns. This prediction is the organizing
framework for the bulk of empirical finance and capital markets research in accounting.

   The investment CAPM, which is derived from the first principle of investment, connects ex-
pected returns to characteristics. It predicts that characteristics are sufficient statistics for expected

                                                      3
returns. Once characteristics are controlled for, consumption betas should not affect expected re-
turns. As such, the consumption CAPM and the classic CAPM as its special case miss what
neoclassical economics has to say about the cross section of expected returns from the investment
side altogether. Derived from the two-period manager’s problem, the investment CAPM is the dual
proposition to the classic CAPM, which is in turn derived from a two-period investor’s problem.

    This essay aims at three objectives. First, I review the investment CAPM literature within a
unified conceptual framework, identify its main strands, and clarify their interconnections. Second,
I explain the big picture. I trace the origin of the investment CAPM to at least Fisher’s (1930) clas-
sic The Theory of Interest. I describe the reincarnation of the investment CAPM as an inevitable
response to the anomalies literature and its challenge to efficient markets (Fama 1965, 1970) and
rational expectations (Muth 1961; Lucas 1972). Third, to the extent that the investment CAPM
thinks about asset pricing issues very differently from the traditional consumption CAPM, I hope
to make the related literature accessible to doctoral students, economists who do not specialize in
asset pricing, as well as investment management professionals. While mostly a review, many new
insights and results are also furnished. Finally, due to space limit, this essay reviews mostly the
empirical literature. A companion essay, Zhang (2017), reviews the related quantitative theories.

    The rest of the paper unfolds as follows. Section 2 shows how the investment CAPM is tested
via a factor model. Section 3 shows the structural estimation and tests of the multiperiod invest-
ment CAPM. Section 4 explains the big picture of the investment CAPM, and clarifies its relations
with the consumption CAPM and behavioral finance. Finally, Section 5 discusses open questions.


2    The q-factor Model

Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2015) implement the investment CAPM with Black, Jensen, and Scholes’s
(1972) portfolio approach. In their q-factor model, the expected return of an asset in excess of
the risk-free rate, denoted E[Ri − Rf ], is described by the sensitivities of its returns to the market
factor, a size factor, an investment factor, and a profitability (return on equity, ROE) factor:

             E[Ri − Rf ] = β iMKT E[MKT] + β iME E[rME ] + β iI/A E[rI/A ] + β iROE E[rROE ],          (9)

in which E[Ri − Rf ] is the expected excess return, E[MKT], E[rME ], E[rI/A ], and E[rROE ] are the
expected factor premiums, and β iMKT , β iME , β iI/A , and β iROE are the factor loadings, respectively.



                                                    4
   Strictly speaking, the investment CAPM in equation (7) only motivates the investment and ROE
factors. Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2015) include the size factor to make the q-factor model more palat-
able for evaluating mutual funds, in which size is a popular investment style. However, Hou et al.
show that while the size factor helps the q-factor model fit the average returns across the size deciles,
its incremental role in a broad set of anomaly deciles is minimal. Finally, equation (7) is primarily a
cross-sectional model, and the size, investment, and ROE factors are all zero-investment portfolios.
As such, the market factor is also included to anchor the time-series average of expected returns,
while the task of fitting the cross-sectional variation of expected returns is left to the q-factors.

2.1    Intuition

Figure 1 shows that many cross-sectional patterns, such as equity issuance, accruals, valuation
ratios, and long-term reversal, are likely different manifestations of the investment premium.

                                                                      X-axis: Investment-to-capital




   The negative relation between average returns and equity issuance (Ritter 1991; Loughran and
Ritter 1995) is consistent with the investment premium. The flow of funds constraint of firms im-
plies that a firm’s uses of funds must equal its sources of funds. As such, all else equal, issuers must
invest more, and earn lower average returns than nonissuers (Lyandres, Sun, and Zhang 2008).


                                                      5
In addition, total asset growth predicts returns with a negative slope (Cooper, Gulen, and Schill
2008). However, asset growth is the most comprehensive measure of investment-to-capital, in which
capital is interpreted as all productive assets, and investment is the change in total assets. As such,
asset growth is the premier manifestation of the investment effect.

   The value premium (Rosenberg, Reid, and Lanstein 1985) is also consistent with the investment
premium.    Combining equations (4) and (5) implies that the marginal costs of investment,
1+a(Iit /Kit ), equal market equity-to-capital, Pit /Kit+1 . Without debt, Pit /Kit+1 equals market-to-
book equity. Intuitively, value firms with low Pit /Kit+1 should invest less, and earn higher expected
returns than growth firms with high Pit /Kit+1 . More generally, firms with high valuation ratios
have more growth opportunities, invest more, and earn lower expected returns than firms with
low valuation ratios. The investment premium also manifests as long-term reversal (De Bondt and
Thaler 1985). High valuation ratios of growth firms are often associated with a stream of positive
shocks to prior stock returns, and low valuation ratios of value firms with a stream of negative
shocks to prior stock returns. As such, firms with high long-term prior returns tend to be growth
firms that invest more, and earn lower expected returns than firms with low long-term prior returns.

   In addition to the investment premium, equation (7) also gives rise to the profitability premium.
Controlling for investment, firms with high expected profitability should earn higher expected re-
turns than firms with low expected profitability. For any portfolio sorts that produce wider cross-
sectional expected return spreads associated with expected profitability than those with investment,
their average returns can be interpreted with the common implied sort on expected profitability.

   Earnings momentum winners that have recently experienced positive shocks to profitability
tend to be more profitable, with higher expected profitability, than earnings momentum losers
that have recently experienced negative shocks to profitability. The profitability effect then implies
that earnings momentum winners should earn higher expected returns than earnings momentum
losers. In addition, shocks to earnings are positively correlated with stock returns contempora-
neously. Intuitively, firms with positive earnings shocks tend to experience immediate stock price
increases, whereas firms with negative earnings shocks tend to experience immediate stock price
decreases. As such, the profitability effect is also consistent with price momentum, i.e., stocks that
have performed well recently continue to earn higher average returns in the subsequent six months
than stocks that have performed poorly recently. Finally, firms that are more financially distressed
are less profitable, and all else equal, should earn lower expected returns than firms that are less

                                                  6
financially distressed. As such, the profitability effect is also consistent with the distress anomaly.

   The anomaly variables described so far are directly related to investment and profitability. Hou,
Xue, and Zhang (2015) test the q-factor model with substantially more anomalies. As noted, the
consumption CAPM and the investment CAPM are theoretically equivalent in equilibrium, deliv-
ering identical expected returns. In particular, the investment CAPM says that controlling for a
few characteristics is sufficient to explain the cross section of expected returns. Hou et al. take this
prediction seriously, and test the q-factor model with an exhaustive array of anomaly variables,
including those that are not directly related to investment and profitability.

2.2   Evidence

Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2015) measure investment-to-capital, I/A, as the annual change in total
assets divided by one-year-lagged total assets, and profitability, ROE, as quarterly earnings (in-
come before extraordinary items) divided by one-quarter-lagged book equity. The q-factors are
constructed from a triple 2 × 3 × 3 sort on size, I/A, and ROE. Hou et al. examine nearly 80
anomaly variables that cover all the major categories of anomalies, including momentum, value-
versus-growth, investment, profitability, intangibles, and trading frictions. To form testing deciles,
NYSE breakpoints and value-weighted decile returns are used to alleviate the impact of microcaps.

   The q-factor model outperforms the Fama-French three-factor and Carhart models. Across the
35 significant high-minus-low deciles, the average magnitude of the q-model alphas is 0.2% per
month, which is lower than 0.33% in the Carhart model and 0.55% in the three-factor model. Only
five out of 35 high-minus-low deciles have significant q-model alphas at the 5% level. In contrast,
19 high-minus-low deciles have significant Carhart alphas, and 27 have significant Fama-French
alphas. The q-factor model also has the lowest mean absolute value of alphas across all 35 sets
of deciles, 0.11% per month, which is lower than 0.12% in the Carhart model and 0.16% in the
three-factor model. The Gibbons, Ross, and Shanken (GRS, 1989) test on the null that the alphas
are jointly zero across a given set of deciles rejects the q-factor model at the 5% level in 20 out of 35
sets of deciles, but the Carhart model in 24, and the three-factor model in 28 sets of deciles. Across
the nine momentum anomalies, the average magnitude of the high-minus-low alphas is 0.19% per
month in the q-factor model, 0.29% in the Carhart model, and 0.85% in the three-factor model.

   Consistent with the broad implications of the investment CAPM, most anomalies turn out to
be different manifestations of the investment and profitability effects. Price and earnings momen-


                                                   7
tum are mainly connected to the ROE factor. For the high-minus-low momentum deciles, all the
ROE factor loadings are significant, but the investment factor loadings are mostly insignificant.
The investment factor is mainly responsible for capturing the value-minus-growth anomalies. Their
investment factor loadings are all more than five standard errors from zero, but the ROE factor
loadings are mostly insignificant. The investment factor is mainly responsible for the investment
anomalies, the ROE factor for the profitability anomalies, and a combination of the two factors
accounts for the anomalies in the intangibles and trading frictions categories.

2.3     Debate

The q-factor model poses to end the almost quarter-century reign of the Fama-French three-factor
model, along with its extension, the Carhart four-factor model, as the workhorse model for empirical
asset pricing. Perhaps not surprisingly, the q-factor model touches off a firestorm of controversy.1

2.3.1    “Endorsement” from Fama and French (2015)

Subsequent to our work, Fama and French (2015) incorporate their own versions of the investment
and profitability factors into their original three-factor model to form a five-factor model:2

            E[Ri − Rf ] = bi E[MKT] + si E[SMB] + hi E[HML] + ri E[RMW] + ci E[CMA].                              (10)

MKT, SMB, and HML are the market, size, and value factors that first appear in their three-factor
model. The two new factors resemble the q-factors. RMW (robust-minus-weak) is the difference
between the returns on diversified portfolios of stocks with robust and weak operating profitability.
CMA (conservative-minus-aggressive) is the difference between the returns on diversified portfolios
of low and high investment stocks. Operating profitability, OP, is revenues minus costs of goods
sold, minus selling, general, and administrative expenses, minus interest expenses, all scaled by
book equity (Novy-Marx 2013). Investment, Inv, is the change in book assets divided by one-year-
lagged book assets (same as in Hou, Xue, and Zhang 2015). The factors are constructed from
independent 2×3 sorts by interacting size with, separately, book-to-market, OP, and Inv.

     Although first appearing in October 2012 as NBER working paper 18435, the Hou-Xue-Zhang (2015) article is
a new incarnation of the previous work circulated as “Neoclassical factors” (as NBER working paper 13282, July
2007), “An equilibrium three-factor model” (January 2009), “Production-based factors” (April 2009), “A better
three-factor model that explains more anomalies” (June 2009), and “An alternative three-factor model” (April 2010).
The frequent title changes make it clear that the June 2009 title was fought against vigorously, albeit unsuccessfully.
The insight that investment and profitability are fundamental forces in the cross section of expected stock returns
in the investment CAPM first appears in Zhang (2005a, NBER working paper 11322, May 2005).

     Their June 2013 draft, Fama and French (2013), adds only a profitability factor into their three-factor model,
and subsequent drafts, starting from the November 2013 draft, also add an investment factor.

   Fama and French (2015) motivate their five-factor model from the Miller and Modigliani (1961)
valuation theory. From the dividend discounting model, the market value of firm i’s stock, Pit , is
the present value of its expected dividends, Pit = ∞                        τ
                                                  P
                                                    τ =1 E[Dit+τ ]/(1 + ri ) , in which Dit is divi-

dends, and ri is the firm’s long-term average expected stock return, i.e., the internal rate of return.
The clean surplus relation says that dividends equal earnings minus the change in book equity,
Dit+τ = Πit+τ − △Bit+τ , in which △Bit+τ ≡ Bit+τ − Bit+τ −1 . It follows that:
                                  P∞
                            Pit        E[Πit+τ − △Bit+τ ]/(1 + ri )τ
                                = τ =1                                .                               (11)
                            Bit                 Bit

   Fama and French (2015) argue that the valuation equation (11) makes three theoretical predic-
tions. First, fixing everything except the current market value, Pit , and the expected stock return,
ri , a low Pit , or a high book-to-market equity, Bit /Pit , implies a high expected return. Second, fixing
everything except the expected profitability and the expected stock return, high expected profitabil-
ity implies a high expected return. Third, fixing everything except the expected growth in book
equity and the expected return, high expected book equity growth implies a low expected return.

   Fama and French (2015) use operating profitability as the proxy for the expected profitability
and past investment as the proxy for the expected investment. Empirically, the five-factor model
outperforms the original three-factor model in pricing testing portfolios formed on size, book-to-
market, investment, and profitability. However, these portfolios are formed on the same variables
underlying the factors. Fama and French (2016) extend their set of testing portfolios to include
accruals, net share issues, momentum, volatility, and the market beta, which are still a small subset
of the comprehensive universe of anomalies examined in Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2015).

2.3.2   Which Factor Model?

Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2016) compare the q-factor model with the Fama-French five-factor model
on empirical grounds. To make the sample comparable to Fama and French (2015), who start their
sample in July 1963, Hou et al. extend the sample for the q-factors back to January 1967.

   Table 1 shows that, from January 1967 to December 2014, the size, investment, and ROE factors
earn on average 0.32%, 0.43%, and 0.56% per month (t = 2.42, 5.08, and 5.24), respectively. SMB,
HML, RMW, and CMA earn on average 0.26%, 0.36%, 0.27%, and 0.34% (t = 1.92, 2.57, 2.58, and
3.63), respectively. The five-factor model cannot explain the investment and ROE q-factors, leaving
alphas of 0.12% (t = 3.35) and 0.45% (t = 5.6), respectively. However, the q-factor model explains

                                                    9
the HML, RMW, and CMA returns, with tiny alphas of 0.03%, 0.04%, and 0.01%, respectively
(t-statistics all below 0.5). As such, RMW and CMA are noisy versions of the q-factors.

    Hou, Mo, Xue, and Zhang (2017) raise four concerns on Fama and French’s (2015) motivation of
the five-factor model. First, Fama and French derive the relations between book-to-market, invest-
ment, and profitability only with the internal rate of return, but argue that the difference between
the one-period-ahead expected return and the internal rate of return is not important. However,
Hou et al. estimate the internal rate of returns for RMW and CMA with accounting-based models
(Gebhardt, Lee, and Swaminathan 2001), and show that these estimates deviate greatly from their
one-month-ahead average returns. Whereas the average returns of RMW are significantly positive,
its estimates of the internal rate of returns are often significantly negative.

    Second, Fama and French (2015) argue that the value factor is a separate factor in valuation
theory, but find it to be redundant in describing average returns in the data. However, the
investment CAPM implies that the value premium is just a different manifestation of the investment
effect. The first principle of investment says that the marginal costs of investment, which rise with
investment, equal marginal q, which is in turn closely related to market-to-book equity. As such, the
value factor is redundant in the presence of the investment factor in the investment CAPM. Without
the redundant HML, the five-factor model collapses to a noisy version of the q-factor model.

    Third, Fama and French (2015) motivate their investment factor, CMA, from the negative rela-
tion between the expected investment and the internal rate of returns in valuation theory. However,
the valuation equation can be reformulated to show that the relation between the one-period-ahead
expected return and the expected investment is more likely to be positive. Combining the definition
of return, Pit = (Et [Dit+1 ] + Et [Pit+1 ])/(1 + Et [rit+1 ]), with the clean surplus relation yields:

                                          Et [Πit+1 − △Bit+1 ] + Et [Pit+1 ]
                                  Pit =                                      .                            (12)
                                                    1 + Et [rit+1 ]

Dividing both sides by Bit and rearranging yield:
                               h       i      h        i       h                    i

                  Pit       Et    Bit    − Et    Bit     + E t   Bit+1   1 +   Bit

                  Bit                             1 + Et [rit+1 ]
                               h       i      h                    i       h       i

                  Pit       Et    Bit    + Et    Bit     Bit+1  −  1   +   Et Bit+1
                       =                                                               .                  (14)

ated with high Et [rit+1 ], because Pit+1 /Bit+1 − 1 tends to be positive in the data. More generally,
leading equation (14) by one period at a time and recursively substituting Pit+1 /Bit+1 in the same
equation implies a positive Et [△Bit+τ /Bit ]-Et [rit+1 ] relation for all τ ≥ 1.3

    Finally, after arguing for the negative relation between the expected investment and the expected
return, Fama and French (2015) use past investment as the proxy for the expected investment.
However, while past profitability forecasts future profitability, past investment does not forecast
future investment. Hou, Mo, Xue, and Zhang (2017) document that in annual cross-sectional
regressions of future book equity growth on current asset growth, the average R2 starts at 5% in year
one, drops quickly to zero in year four, and remains at zero through year ten. The low persistence of
micro-level investment is well known in the lumpy investment literature (Dixit and Pindyck 1994;
Doms and Dunne 1998; Whited 1998). In all, the last two concerns imply that the investment
factor can only be derived from market-to-book in the valuation equation (11), augmented with
the investment-value linkage, which is in turn a key insight from the investment CAPM.

2.3.3     Which ROE Factor?

Fama and French (2006) test the expected profitability and expected investment effects predicted
by valuation theory. Cross-sectional regressions are used to predict profitability and asset growth
one, two, and three years ahead, and the fitted values from these first-stage regressions are used
as explanatory variables in second-stage cross-sectional regressions of returns. Contrary to the
hypothesized negative relation between the expected investment and expected returns, the average
slopes on the expected investment in second-stage regressions are insignificantly positive. Also,
with a long list of predictors for future profitability in the first-stage, including lagged fundamen-
tals, returns, analysts forecasts, and the default probability, the expected profitability shows only
insignificant, albeit positive, average slopes in the second-stage regressions.

    Fama and French (2008) also report an insignificant profitability premium. Profitability is mea-
sured as income before extraordinary items (Compustat annual item IB), minus preferred dividends
(item DVP), if available, plus income account deferred taxes (item TXDI), if available, divided by
contemporaneous book equity. From annual sorts, Fama and French report that profitability sorts
“produce the weakest average hedge portfolio returns,” and suggest that with controls for size and
   3
     Lettau and Ludvigson (2002) show that high aggregate risk premiums forecast high long-term aggregate in-
vestment growth rates. Using cross-sectional regressions, Fama and French (2006) report a weakly positive relation
between the expected investment and the expected returns. However, Aharoni, Grundy, and Zeng (2013) report a neg-
ative relation, and attribute the difference to firm-level variables, as opposed to per share variables in Fama and French.


                                                            12
book-to-market, “hedge returns do not provide much basis for the conclusion that there is a positive
relation between average returns and profitability (p. 1663).

   Novy-Marx (2013) shows that a different profitability measure, gross profits-to-assets, produces
a significant premium in annual sorts. It is argued that gross profits are a cleaner accounting
measure of economic profitability than earnings. Expensed investments, such as research and de-
velopment, advertising, and employee training, reduce earnings, but do not increase book equity.
These expenses give rise to higher future economic profits, and are better captured by gross profits.
Fama and French (2015) base their profitability factor, RMW, on the gross profitability effect.

   A cleaner measure of economic profits might not be the whole story. Panel A of Table 2 reports
factor regressions for the annually formed gross profits-to-assets deciles. Consistent with Novy-
Marx (2013), the high-minus-low decile earns an average return of 0.38% per month (t = 2.62) and
a Carhart alpha of 0.49% (t = 3.39). The Fama-French five-factor alpha is 0.19% (t = 1.46), and
the q-factor alpha is 0.18% (t = 1.24). More important, Panel B replicates the tests, but scales
gross profits with one-year-lagged assets, not contemporaneous assets. The average high-minus-low
return falls to only 0.16% per month (t = 1.04). Intuitively, the gross profits-to-assets ratio equals
the gross profits-to-lagged assets ratio divided by asset growth (contemporaneous assets-to-lagged
assets). As such, the gross profitability effect is contaminated by a hidden investment effect. Once
this investment effect is purged, the gross profitability effect largely disappears.

   Which deflator should be used to scale profits, lagged or contemporaneous assets? Because in
Compustat, both profits and assets are measured at the end of a period, economic logic implies
that profits should be scaled by one-period-lagged assets. Intuitively, profits are generated by
the one-period-lagged assets. Contemporaneous assets at the end of the period in Compustat are
accumulated via the investment process over the course of the current period. With one-period time-
to-build, contemporaneous assets can start to generate profits only at the beginning of next period.

   In contrast to the small, insignificant profitability premium from annual sorts on gross profits-to-
lagged assets, Panel C shows that monthly sorts per Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2015) on the same vari-
able revive the profitability premium. Due to limited coverage for the cost of goods sold (Compustat
quarterly item COGSQ) and total assets (item ATQ), the sample starts from January 1976. The
high-minus-low decile earns an average return of 0.51% per month (t = 3.4) and a Carhart alpha of
0.56% (t = 3.81). The five-factor alpha is 0.3% (t = 2.14), but the q-factor alpha is 0.2% (t = 1.41).

                    Table 2 : Deciles on Different Gross Profitability Measures

All deciles are based on NYSE breakpoints and value-weighted returns. m is average excess returns, and tm
is its t-statistics. αC , a, and αq are the alphas from the Carhart model, the Fama-French five-factor model,
and the q-factor model, and tC , ta , and tq are their t-statistics, respectively. m.a.e. (mean absolute error) is
the average magnitude of alphas across the testing deciles. The GRS p-value testing that all ten alphas are
jointly zero is in brackets beneath the m.a.e. for a given factor model. All the t-statistics are adjusted for
heteroscedasticity and autocorrelations. In Panel A, at the end of June of year t, stocks are split into deciles
based on gross profits, measured as total revenue (Compustat annual item REVT) minus cost of goods sold
(item COGS), divided by total assets (item AT), all for the fiscal year ending in calendar year t − 1. Monthly
decile returns are calculated from July of year t to June of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of
t + 1. Panel B replicates Panel A, except that the denominator of the sorting variable is total assets for the
fiscal year ending in calendar year t − 2. In Panel C, at the beginning of each month t, stocks are split into
deciles based on total revenue (Compustat quarterly item REVTQ) minus cost of goods sold (item COGSQ),
divided by one-quarter-lagged assets (item ATQ), all from the fiscal quarter ending at least four months ago.
Monthly returns are calculated for month t, and the deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of month t + 1.

All deciles are based on NYSE breakpoints and value-weighted returns. m is average excess returns, and
tm is its t-statistics. αC , a, and αq are the alphas from the Carhart model, the Fama-French five-factor

factor model. The t-statistics are adjusted for heteroscedasticity and autocorrelations. At the beginning
of each month t, stocks are split into deciles based on quarter ROA and ROE, measured as income before
extraordinary items (Compustat quarterly item IBQ) scaled by one-quarter-lagged assets (item ATQ) or
one-quarter-lagged book equity, respectively. Quarterly earnings are used immediately after the most recent
quarterly earnings announcement dates (item RDQ). Monthly decile returns are calculated for month t, and
the deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of month t + 1.

    Gross profits are largely irrelevant in monthly sorts. Table 3 reports deciles formed monthly on
ROA (earnings-to-lagged assets) and, separately, on ROE. To ease comparison, the sample starts
at January 1976 as in Panel C of Table 2. Panel A shows that monthly ROA sorts yield an average
high-minus-low return of 0.58% per month (t = 2.53). From Panel B, the average return for the
high-minus-low ROE decile is even higher, 0.72% (t = 2.79). As such, despite much maligned in
annual sorts, earnings perform better than gross profits in monthly sorts.

2.3.4    Independent Comparison

Several studies have independently compared the q-factor model with the Fama-French (2015) five-
factor model. Their empirical results are broadly in line with those in Hou et al. (2016). Barillas


                                                      15
and Shanken (2015) develop a Bayesian test procedure that allows model comparison, i.e., the
computation of model probabilities for the collection of all possible pricing models based on sub-
sets of the given factors. Applying this new methodology to the head-to-head contest between
the q-factor model and the five-factor model, Shanken (2015) reports model probabilities that are
overwhelmingly in favor of the q-factor model (97% versus 3%).

   Stambaugh and Yuan (2016) independently verify the two key results in Hou, Xue, and Zhang
(2016). First, the q-factor model explains the Fama-French (2015) five-factor returns in time se-
ries regressions, but the five-factor model cannot explain the q-factor returns. Second, the q-factor
model outperforms the five-factor model in explaining a wide array of anomalies in the cross section.
Stambaugh and Yuan also propose a “mispricing” factor model. The mispricing factors are formed
by aggregating a stock’s information across 11 anomalies with average rankings within two anomaly
clusters that exhibit the greatest comovement in high-minus-low returns. Empirically, the mispric-
ing factor model and the q-factor model are “evenly matched” in factor spanning tests, but the
mispricing model has an edge in explaining anomalies, especially in the set of 11. The edge is not sur-
prising, however, as the two mispricing factors are basically principal components extracted ex post
from the 11 anomalies. The breakpoints for the mispricing factors are 20-60-20, as opposed to the
more standard 30-40-30 from Fama and French (1993). Most important, one of the mispricing fac-
tors has a correlation about 0.7 with the investment factor, and another also has a correlation of 0.7
with the ROE factor in the q-factor model. As such, the principal component analysis essentially un-
covers the q-factors that are in turn motivated from the economic theory in the investment CAPM.

2.4   Notes

The q-factor model is built on a rich empirical literature in finance and accounting. Most impor-
tant, as the q-factor model uses the Fama-French three- and five-factor models as a straw man, it is
only natural to acknowledge our enormous intellectual debt to Fama and French. Fama and French
(1992) show that size and book-to-market combine to describe average returns in cross-sectional
regressions, and that the relation between the market beta and average returns is flat, even when
beta is used alone. Fama and French (1993) propose the three-factor model to replace the CAPM
as the workhorse for estimating expected stock returns. Fama and French (1996) show that, except
for momentum, the three-factor model summarizes the cross section of expected returns as of the
mid-1990s. Carhart (1997) augments the three-factor model with a momentum factor. Perhaps



                                                  16
in response to the challenge by Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2015), Fama and French (2015) upgrade
their three-factor model with two new factors that resemble the investment and ROE factors in
the q-factor model. It is evident that the intellectual designs of the q-factor model, including its
econometric tests, factor construction, formation of testing portfolios, and above all, the taste of
the economic question, are all deeply influenced by Fama and French.

2.4.1   Related Literature on the Investment Premium

Different Forms of the Investment Premium              The first group of studies documents the in-
vestment effect in various forms, and shows how it relates to other cross-sectional patterns.

   Titman, Wei, and Xie (2004) show that firms that increase capital investment subsequently
earn lower average returns than firms that decrease capital investment. This effect is also stronger
among firms with higher cash flows, implying higher investment discretion. Titman et al. interpret
the evidence as investors underreacting to the empire building implications of increasing invest-
ment. Empire building means that managers invest for their own private benefits rather than the
benefits for shareholders (Jensen 1986). However, the investment CAPM, derived without empire
building, is consistent with the evidence that the investment effect is stronger in firms with higher
cash flows. Taking the first-order derivative of equation (7) with respect to investment-to-capital
         S /∂(I /K ) = −aX
yields ∂rit+1                                     2
               it it      it+1 /[1 + a(Iit /Kit )] . Its magnitude rises with profitability, Xit+1 ,

meaning that the investment effect should be stronger among firms with higher cash flows.

   Titman, Wei, and Xie (2004) measure abnormal investment as the ratio of capital expenditure
divided by sales, scaled by the prior three-year moving average of this ratio. Dividing investment by
sales makes the ratio closer to profitability than to investment. Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2016) show
that the high-minus-low abnormal investment decile earns on average −0.31% per month (t = −2.2)
from 1967 to 2014. The q-factor alpha is −0.17% (t = −1.05), along with an insignificant investment
factor loading of 0.13 (t = 1.04) but a significant ROE factor loading of −0.2 (t = −2.26).

   Anderson and Garcia-Feijóo (2006) show that sorting on book-to-market provides a large spread
in investment growth across extreme deciles, and that firms with high investment growth earn sig-
nificantly lower subsequent returns on average than firms with low investment growth. Xing (2008)
shows that a low-minus-high investment growth factor contains similar information as the value
factor, and can price the 25 size and book-to-market portfolios as well as the value factor. Both
studies interpret their evidence as consistent with the investment CAPM.


                                                 17
   Lyandres, Sun, and Zhang (2008) show that the investment effect helps interpret the new issues
puzzle (Ritter 1991; Loughran and Ritter 1995). Lyandres et al. show that adding an investment
factor into the CAPM and the Fama-French three-factor model reduces a substantial amount of the
underperformance following initial public offerings, seasoned equity offerings, and convertible debt
offerings, as well as the composite issuance effect (Daniel and Titman 2006). Also, Lyandres et al.
document that equity issuers invest much more relative to their assets than nonissuers matched on
size and book-to-market, despite similar profitability across issuers and matching nonissuers.

   Cooper, Gulen, and Schill (2008) document the strong predictive power of the annual growth
rates of total assets in the cross section. Their key insight is that the investment effect is a per-
vasive phenomenon, going beyond specific components of investment explored in prior studies. In
particular, their Table II shows that from 1968 to 2002, the high-minus-low asset growth decile
earns on average a whopping equal-weighted return of −1.73% per month and a value-weighted
return of −1.05%. Cooper et al. argue that “bias in the capitalization of new investments leads to
a host of potential investment policy distortions,” and interpret their evidence as suggesting that
“such potential distortions are present and economically meaningful (p. 1648).”

   Cooper, Gulen, and Schill (2008) have clearly influenced the q-factor model and the Fama-
French five-factor model. Both form the investment factor on total asset growth. However, Cooper
et al.’s evidence on the predictive power of asset growth is exaggerated by excessively weighting
on microcaps. Their deciles are formed with all breakpoints, rather than NYSE breakpoints, and
the portfolio returns are equal-weighted to give microcaps disproportionately large weights. Hou,
Xue, and Zhang (2016) show that from 1967 to 2014, the high-minus-low asset growth decile earns
−0.46% per month (t = −2.92) with NYSE breakpoints and value-weighted returns and −0.69%
(t = −4.74) with all-but-micro breakpoints and equal-weighted returns. Also, the investment
CAPM predicts that high investment implies low subsequent returns. As such, this evidence does
not necessarily mean value-destroying investment distortions such as empire building.

   Butler, Cornaggia, Grullon, and Weston (2011) propose a clever identification strategy to
disentangle investment and behavioral market timing explanations for the underperformance
following security issuance. The investment CAPM says that issuers invest more, and are associated
with lower costs of capital than nonissues. The market timing explanation says that managers issue
more equity relative to debt when equity is overvalued, and repurchase more equity relative to debt
when equity is undervalued. While the investment CAPM says that only the amount of net financing

                                                 18
forecasts returns, the market timing hypothesis predicts that the composition of net financing
(equity relative to debt) is more important. Empirically, Butler et al. report pervasive evidence that
conditional on the amount of net financing, the composition of financing does not forecast returns.

   Cooper and Priestley (2011) report extensive evidence that the negative relation between in-
vestment and average returns is related to macroeconomic risk. First, low investment firms have
substantially higher loadings on the Chen, Roll, and Ross (1986) macroeconomic risk factors than
high investment firms, especially on the growth rate of industrial production and the term spread.
Second, the large loading spreads on these two macro risk factors, combined with their large esti-
mated risk premiums from two-pass cross-sectional regressions, account for 60–80% of the average
return spreads across extreme investment deciles. Third, macro risk loadings fall during high in-
vestment periods, but rise during disinvestment periods. Finally, the investment factor returns
contain information about future real growth rates of industrial production, gross domestic prod-
uct, aggregate corporate earnings, and aggregate investment. However, Cooper and Priestley do
not conduct similar risk analysis for the positive relation between profitability and average returns.


The Cross-sectional Variation of the Investment Premium                     Li and Zhang (2010) argue
that investment frictions should strengthen the investment effect. Intuitively, when investment is
frictionless (adjustment costs are zero), investment would be infinitely elastic to changes in the dis-
count rate. As investment becomes more frictional, investment becomes less elastic to the discount
rate changes. In other words, a given magnitude of change in investment corresponds to a higher
magnitude of change in the discount rate, meaning that the investment effect in the average returns
becomes stronger as investment becomes more frictional.

   The impact of investment frictions on the investment effect is similar to limits to arbitrage
(Shleifer and Vishny 1997). Trading frictions from the investors’ side make arbitrage activities costly
and incomplete, allowing mispricing to persist in the marketplace. Attributing the investment effect
to mispricing, limits to arbitrage imply that it should be stronger among firms with stronger limits
to arbitrage. Because the investment CAPM and mispricing emphasize different types of frictions
that likely coexist in the data, their effects are not mutually exclusive. In addition, to the extent that
firms with stocks that are more costly to trade could also face higher investment costs, investment
frictions and limits to arbitrage could both at work for the same set of firms simultaneously.

   Empirically, using proxies for financial constraints (asset size, payout ratio, and credit rating) to


                                                   19
measure investment frictions, Li and Zhang (2010) report only weak evidence that the investment
effect is stronger in firms with stronger investment frictions. In contrast, idiosyncratic volatility
and dollar trading volume, which are common proxies for limits to arbitrage, dominate proxies of
financial constraints in characterizing the cross-sectional variation of the investment effect.

   Lam and Wei (2011) conduct more comprehensive tests by using ten proxies of limits to ar-
bitrage, including idiosyncratic volatility, analyst coverage, analyst forecast dispersion, cash flow
volatility, the number of institutional shareholders, stock price, bid-ask spread, institutional own-
ership, absolute return-to-volume, and dollar trading volume, as well as four proxies of financial
constraints, firm age, asset size, payout ratio, and credit rating. Lam and Wei show that the prox-
ies for limits to arbitrage are highly correlated with those for investment frictions. The evidence
from equal-weighted returns is consistent with both limits to arbitrage and investment frictions
hypotheses, but the evidence from value-weighted returns is weaker. Finally, in direct comparisons,
each hypothesis is supported by a fair and similar amount of evidence.

   Lipson, Mortal, and Schill (2011) refute Fama and French’s (2008) conclusion that the invest-
ment effect exists only in small firms. Lipson et al. show that Fama and French’s investment measure
excludes the part of asset growth related to equity issues, which are a major source of financing for
large firms. Also, the investment effect is stronger in firms with high idiosyncratic volatility, and is
concentrated around earnings announcement dates. Finally, analysts forecast errors are higher for
faster growing firms, consistent with the mispricing interpretation.

   Titman, Wei, and Xie (2013) study the investment effect in international markets, and find that
it is stronger in countries with more developed markets than in countries with less developed mar-
kets. This evidence lends support to the investment CAPM because financial market development
aligns managers’ incentives with shareholders, and the investment effect arises from maximizing the
shareholder value. Titman et al. also show that the investment effect is not related to corporate
governance or trading costs across countries, inconsistent with the mispiricing interpretation.

   Watanabe, Xu, Yao, and Yu (2013) conduct a more comprehensive study of the investment effect
in international equity markets. If the investment effect is due to mispricing, it should be stronger
in countries in which stocks are less efficiently priced and mispricing is more difficult to arbitrage
away. In contrast, if the investment effect is due to the investment CAPM, it should be stronger in
countries in which stocks are more efficiently priced. Watanabe et al use four country-level proxies
for market efficiency: (i) stock return synchronicity, which is the average R2 from firm-level market

                                                  20
regressions within each country, and is negatively related to the amount of firm-specific information
impounded into individual stock prices; (ii) future earnings response coefficients, a measure of the
information content of stock prices for future earnings; (iii) the developed market status from the
International Finance Corporation; and (iv) the importance of stock market to the economy, which
is measured by total market capitalization-to-gross domestic product, as well as the number of pub-
licly traded companies and initial public offerings scaled by population. Empirically, the investment
effect is stronger in countries with lower stock return synchronicity and higher future earnings
response coefficients, in developed markets, and in economies in which stock markets are more
important. The evidence lends support to the investment CAPM, but casts doubt on mispricing.


Explaining the Accrual Anomaly           Accounting accruals (earnings minus cash flows) allow a
firm to measure its performance by recognizing economic events regardless of the timing of cash
transactions. The basic idea is to match revenues to expenses at the time of a transaction, not a
cash payment. Sloan (1996) shows that firms with high accruals earn lower average returns than
firms with low accruals, and interprets the evidence as investors overreacting to the persistence
of the accrual component of earnings in forming earnings expectations. These naive investors are
subsequently surprised, when realized earnings of firms with high accruals fall short of, and those
of firms with low accruals exceed, prior expectations. Richardson, Sloan, Soliman, and Tuna (2005)
rank components of accruals by their degree of reliability, and show that less reliable components
lead to less persistence in earnings and stronger accrual anomaly than more reliable components.

   Several studies link accruals to investment. Fairfield, Whisenant, and Yohn (2003) decompose
the growth in net operating assets into accruals and the growth in long-term net operating assets,
and show that after controlling for current profitability, both components forecast future stock
returns with a negative slope. Fairfield et al. suggest that investors overreact to both components
equally, and that the accrual anomaly is a special case of a more general growth anomaly. Zhang
(2007) documents that accruals are positively correlated with employee growth, and that the magni-
tude of the accrual anomaly monotonically increases with the accruals-employee growth covariation.

   Interpreting accruals as working capital investment, Wu, Zhang, and Zhang (2010) apply the
investment CAPM to the accrual anomaly. The investment CAPM helps explain Richardson, Sloan,
Soliman, and Tuna’s (2005) key finding that less reliable accruals lead to stronger accrual anomaly.
Empirically, less reliable accruals are more correlated with investment than more reliable accruals.


                                                 21
Conceptually, less reliable changes in noncash working capital and changes in net noncurrent
operating assets represent direct forms of investment in short-term and long-term capital,
respectively. In contrast, more reliable changes in net financial assets contain diverse components,
including marketable securities and financial liability, which are less correlated with investment.

    Table 4 reports factor regressions of deciles formed on operating accruals, measured with the
balance sheet approach of Sloan (1996), scaled by average total assets. The high-minus-low decile
earns an average return of −0.29% per month (t = −2.13). Consistent with Wu, Zhang, and Zhang
(2010), a two-factor model with the market and investment factors yields a high-minus-low alpha of
−0.1% (t = −0.66). The investment factor loading is −0.53, which is more than four standard errors
from zero. However, as shown in Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2015), the full-fledged q-factor model fails
to capture the accrual anomaly with an alpha of −0.42% (t = −2.96). The culprit is a large, positive
ROE factor loading, 0.31 (t = 4.08), which goes in the wrong way to explain the average return.4

    Following Ball, Gerakos, Linnainmaa, and Nikolaev (2016), Table 4 also experiments with an
alternative q-factor model with a cash-based ROE factor. The cash-based ROE is quarterly cash-
based operating profits divided by one-quarter-lagged book equity.5 The sample starts in January
1972 due to limited coverage in Compustat quarterly files in earlier years. The construction of the
cash-based q-factors is identical to that for the benchmark q-factors, except that at the beginning
of each month t, stocks are split on the cash-based ROE for the fiscal quarter ending at least four
months ago, as opposed to the ROE calculated with the latest announced earnings.

    The cash-based ROE factor earns on average 0.59% per month (t = 7.5) from January 1972
to December 2014. Its Carhart alpha is 0.57% (t = 7.83), and the Fama-French five-factor alpha
0.54% (t = 6.81). The investment factor earns on average 0.33% (t = 3.28). Its Carhart alpha is
0.17% (t = 2.09), and the five-factor alpha is close to zero. The average size factor return is 0.28%
(t = 1.9). The correlation between the benchmark and cash-based ROE factors is only 0.56. The
    4
      Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2015) also show that the investment factor loading for the high-minus-low accrual decile is
close to zero, in contrast to −0.47 (t = −5.19) in Table 4. The difference arises because Hou et al. measure operating
accruals, starting from 1988, as net income (Compustat annual item NI) minus net cash flow from operations (item
OANCF) from the statement of cash flows. In untabulated results, from July 1989 to December 2014, the high-minus-
low decile on this cash flows-based operating accruals earns an average return of −0.38% per month (t = −2.12). The
q-factor alpha is −0.51% (t = −2.64), the investment factor loading −0.07, and the ROE factor loading 0.28 (t = 3.06).
    5
      Cash-based operating profits are revenues (Compustat quarterly item REVTQ) minus cost of goods sold
(item COGSQ) minus selling, general, and administrative expenses (item XSGAQ) plus research and development
expenditure (item XRDQ, zero if missing) minus change in accounts receivable (item RECTQ) minus change in
inventory (item INVTQ) plus change in deferred revenue (item DRCQ plus item DRLTQ) plus change in trade
accounts payable (item APQ). All balance sheet changes are quarterly changes, and are set to zero if missing.

                        Table 4 : The Balance Sheet Operating Accruals Deciles

Operating accruals are defined as (dCA−dCASH)−(dCL−dSTD−dTP)−DP, in which dCA is the change
in current assets (Compustat annual item ACT), dCASH is the change in cash or cash equivalents (item
CHE), dCL is the change in current liabilities (item LCT), dSTD is the change in debt included in current
liabilities (item DLC), dTP is the change in income taxes payable (item TXP, zero if missing), and DP is
depreciation and amortization (item DP). At the end of June of each year t, stocks are split into deciles with
NYSE breakpoints on operating accruals for the fiscal year ending in calendar year t − 1 scaled by average
total assets (item AT) for the fiscal years ending in t − 1 and t − 2. Monthly value-weighted decile returns
are calculated from July of year t to June of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1. m is
average excess returns, tm is its t-statistics, and m.a.e. (mean absolute error) is the average magnitude of
alphas across the testing deciles. The GRS p-value is in brackets beneath the m.a.e. for a given factor model.
All the t-statistics are adjusted for heteroscedasticity and autocorrelations.

cash-based ROE factor has an alpha of 0.42% (t = 5.1) in the q-factor model. However, the cash-
based q-factor model cannot subsume the benchmark q-factors, with alphas of 0.15% (t = 2.94),
0.15% (t = 3.55), and 0.23% (t = 2.37) for the size, investment, and ROE factors, respectively.

   Panel D in Table 4 shows that the cash-based q-factor model explains the accrual anomaly.
The alpha of the high-minus-low decile is −0.17% per month (t = −1.09), and the model cannot
be rejected by the GRS test (p = 0.07). The investment factor loading is −0.48, which is close to
−0.47 in the benchmark q-factor model. More important, the cash-based ROE factor loading is
only −0.05 (t = −0.48), in contrast to 0.31 (t = 4.08) for the benchmark ROE factor. Intuitively,
because earnings equal cash flows plus accruals, high accrual firms would appear more “profitable,”
and load more heavily on the earnings-based benchmark ROE factor than low accrual firms. The
cash-based ROE factor avoids this pitfall, as accruals do not enter the cash-based ROE.

2.4.2   Related Literature on the Profitability Premium

The ROE factor in the q-factor model is built on the illustrious accounting literature on post-
earnings-announcement drift (earnings momentum) launched by Ball and Brown (1968). In par-
ticular, the monthly sort on quarterly earnings in the ROE factor is heavily influenced by the
construction of earnings momentum (Chan, Jegadeesh, and Lakonishok 1996).


Post-earnings-announcement Drift         I do not attempt to review the literature on post-earnings-
announcement drift (see Richardson, Tuna, and Wysocki 2010 for an extensive review). Rather,
the goal is to describe how this literature informs and influences the investment CAPM literature,
and how the investment CAPM might add to the accounting literature.

   Ball and Brown (1968) show that the sign and magnitude of stock returns in the post-earnings
announcement period are positively correlated with the sign and magnitude of unexpected earnings.
Foster, Olsen, and Shevlin (1984) use more sophisticated models of expected earnings, and show
that the magnitude of the post-earnings-announcement drift decreases with firm size. Bernard and
Thomas (1989) show that a disproportionately large fraction of the drift is concentrated in the
three-day period surrounding the earnings announcement dates in subsequent quarters.

   The investment CAPM is consistent with the evidence that a disproportionately large fraction of
earnings momentum is concentrated in a few days surrounding the subsequent earnings announce-
ments. Intuitively, equation (7) holds ex post in realization, state by state, period by period, an


                                                24
observation first made in Cochrane (1991). In the static model, stock returns should move only when
earnings shocks hit, and all of earnings momentum should be materialized on earnings announce-
ment dates. In the multiperiod model, investment, Iit+1 , which correlates positively but not per-
fectly with earnings shocks, also appears in the numerator of equation (7). As such, only a fraction
of earnings momentum should be realized on earnings announcement dates (Liu and Zhang 2014).

   The investment CAPM also predicts that the magnitude of post-earnings-announcement drift is
                                                                           S
larger in small firms than in big firms. Equations (5) and (6) imply that rit+1 = (Kit+1 /Pit )Xit+1 .
As such, the strength of the earnings-return relation decreases with the market equity, Pit . The
                                                                                   S ]/∂E [X
same equation also implies that the profitability effect in average returns, ∂Et [rit+1  t  it+1 ],

should be stronger in value firms with high Kit+1 /Pit than in growth firms with low Kit+1 /Pit . In
                                                     S ]/∂(K
addition, the value effect in average returns, ∂Et [rit+1   it+1 /Pit ), should be stronger in more

profitable firms than in less profitable firms (Piotroski 2000).

   Bernard and Thomas (1990) present the most telling evidence suggesting that stock prices fail
to reflect the extent to which earnings deviate from a naive expectation based on a seasonally ad-
justed random walk, in which expected earnings are the earnings from four quarters ago. Their key
evidence is the negative correlation between unexpected earnings for quarter t and the abnormal re-
turns around the earnings announcement for quarter t+4, in addition to the positive correlation be-
tween unexpected earnings for quarter t and the drift for quarters t+1 to t+3. The evidence is inter-
preted as stock prices failing to reflect fully the mean reversion of earnings changes in four quarters.

   Bernard and Thomas (1990) develop clear testable hypotheses based on underreaction to earn-
ings news. Suppose investors form naive earnings expectations based on the detrended seasonally
adjusted random walk. Let Πit+1 be the detrended earnings for stock i for quarter t + 1. The
market’s expected earnings embedded in the stock price are given by EtM [Πit+1 ] = Πit−3 , in which
EtM [·] is the market’s expectation conditional on time-t information. When Πit+1 is announced, the
market perceives the unexpected earnings as Πit+1 − EtM [Πit+1 ]. Let λi be the earnings response
coefficient. The abnormal return at the earnings announcement date for quarter t + 1 is:

                   S
                  rit+1 − EtM [rit+1
                                S
                                     ] = λi (Πit+1 − EtM [Πit+1 ]) = λi (Πit+1 − Πit−3 ).          (15)


   Bernard and Thomas (1990) assume the Brown-Rozeff (1979) model for the true earnings:

                           Πit+1 = Πit−3 + φ(Πit − Πit−4 ) + θǫit−3 + ǫit+1 ,                      (16)

                                                    25
in which ǫit+1 is the earnings shock at period t + 1, φ > 0, and θ is negative enough that the fourth-
order autocorrelation in seasonally differenced earnings is negative. The true expected earnings is:

                               Et [Πit+1 ] = Πit−3 + φ(Πit − Πit−4 ) + θǫit−3 .                             (17)

However, if investors use the naive earnings expectations from the seasonally adjusted random walk:

 S
rit+1 − EtM [rit+1
              S
                   ] = λi (Πit+1 − EtM [Πit+1 ]) = λi (Πit+1 − Et [Πit+1 ]) + λi (Et [Πit+1 ] − EtM [Πit+1 ])

                     = λi ǫit+1 + λi φ(Πit − Πit−4 ) + λi θǫit−3 .                                          (18)


   Using the time series earnings model in equation (16) then yields:

      S
     rit+1 − EtM [rit+1
                   S
                        ] = λi ǫit+1 + λi φǫit + λi φ2 ǫit−1 + λi φ3 ǫit−2 + λi (θ + φ4 )ǫit−3 + λi ν i ,   (19)

in which ν i is a linear combination of earnings shocks prior to t − 3. As such, if the true earnings
follow the Brown-Rozeff model but investors form naive expectations from a seasonal random walk,
then the abnormal return at the earnings announcement of quarter t + 1 should have positive but
declining correlations with the earnings shocks from quarters t, t − 1, and t − 2, but a negative
correlation with the earnings shock from quarter t − 3. The evidence confirms this prediction.

   Bernard and Thomas’s (1990) evidence is the “most damaging” to efficient markets (Kothari
2001, p. I-194). No rational explanation has been offered to date. However, the investment CAPM
seems to make some progress. In particular, multiplying both the numerator and the denominator
of equation (7) with Kit+1 , which is known at the beginning of period t, yields:

                                                S
                                               rit+1 = λit Πit+1 ,                                          (20)

in which λit ≡ 1/[(1 + a(Iit /Kit ))Kit+1 ] = 1/Pit is the earnings response coefficient.

   Continue to assume that the true earnings follow the Brown-Rozeff (1979) model. Under ratio-
nal expectations, equations (17) and (20) imply:

          S
     Et [rit+1 ] = λit φ(Πit − Πit−4 ) + λit θǫit−3 + λit Πit−3

                = λit φǫit + λit φ2 ǫit−1 + λit φ3 ǫit−2 + λit (θ + φ4 )ǫit−3 + λit (ν i + Πit−3 ).         (21)




                                                        26
The abnormal return at the earnings announcement for quarter t + 1 is:

                                      S           S
                                     rit+1 − Et [rit+1 ] = λit ǫit+1 ,                             (22)

which is unpredictable with time-t information. However, this unpredictability requires that the
expected return is measured precisely. In Bernard and Thomas (1989, 1990), abnormal return is
calculated as the size-adjusted return, and size seems an imperfect control for the expected return.
Suppose the last term in equation (21), λit (ν i + Πit−3 ), is largely expected due to its long lag, but
a portion of the remainder of the expected return is mismeasured as a part of the abnormal return.
The equation then implies that the “abnormal” return at the earnings announcement of quarter
t + 1 would display positive and declining correlations with earnings shocks from prior quarters.


Fundamental Analysis         In addition to post-earnings-announcement drift, the ROE factor in
Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2015) is also rooted in the fundamental analysis literature in accounting.
Ou and Penman (1989) combine a large set of financial statement items into one composite metric
that predicts the direction of one-year-ahead earnings changes. Lev and Thiagarajan (1993) use
conceptual arguments to select 12 fundamental signals to correlate with contemporaneous stock
returns, and to forecast future earnings growth. In contrast, Hou et al. use a single variable (prof-
itability) as the expected profitability proxy. This parsimony is designed to reduce estimation errors
in the proxy so as to strengthen its predictive power for future profitability and returns.

   Abarbanell and Bushee (1997, 1998) show that several fundamental signals, including inventory
changes, changes in account receivables, gross margin, changes in selling and administrative ex-
penses, and tax expenses-to-earnings provide information about future returns. This information
is also shown to be associated with one-year-ahead earnings news and analysts’ forecast errors.
Piotroski (2000) applies context-specific fundamental analysis to a broad portfolio of value stocks.
Nine signals are selected to capture a firm’s profitability, leverage, liquidity, source of funds, and
operating efficiency. Piotroski finds that the average return earned by a value investor can be
increased by at least 7.5% per annum through selecting financially strong value stocks.

   More recently, the fundamental analysis literature and the investment CAPM literature have
started to show signs of convergence in perspectives. Penman and Zhu (2015) use a model similar
to equation (12) to connect expected returns to expected earnings and expected earnings growth.
Consistent with the model’s predictions, many accounting variables predict future earnings and


                                                    27
earnings growth in the data in the same direction in which these variables forecast returns. Pen-
man and Zhu interpret the evidence as “consistent with rational pricing in the sense that the returns
are those one would expect if the market were efficient in its pricing (p. 1836).”


3     Structural Estimation and Tests
3.1     The Multiperiod Investment CAPM

Building on Cochrane (1991), Liu, Whited, and Zhang (2009) derive and test the multiperiod invest-
ment CAPM. Time is discrete and the horizon infinite. Firms use capital and costlessly adjustable
inputs to produce a homogeneous output. These latter inputs are chosen each period to maximize
operating profits, which are defined as revenues minus the expenditures on these inputs. Taking
the operating profits as given, firms choose investment to maximize the market value of equity.

    Let Πit = Π(Kit , Xit ) be the operating profits of firm i at time t, in which Kit is capital, and Xit
is a vector of exogenous aggregate and firm-specific shocks. Firm i has a Cobb-Douglas production
function with constant returns to scale, meaning that Π(Kit , Xit ) = Kit ∂Π(Kit , Xit )/∂Kit . The
marginal product of capital is parameterized as ∂Π(Kit , Xit )/∂Kit = κYit /Kit , in which κ > 0 is a
constant parameter, and Yit is sales. As such, shocks to operating profits, Xit , are reflected in sales.
Capital accumulates as Kit+1 = Iit + (1 − δ it )Kit , in which Iit is investment, and δ it is an exogenous
proportional rate of depreciation. Firms incur adjustment costs when investing. The adjustment
costs function, Φ(Iit , Kit ), is increasing and convex in Iit , decreasing in Kit , and exhibits constant
returns to scale in Iit and Kit , i.e., Φ(Iit , Kit ) = Iit ∂Φ(Iit , Kit )/∂Iit + Kit ∂Φ(Iit , Kit )/∂Kit . A
standard quadratic functional form is given by Φ(Iit , Kit ) = (a/2) (Iit /Kit )2 Kit , in which a > 0.

    Firms can finance investment with one-period debt. At the beginning of time t, firm i can
issue an amount of debt, Bit+1 , which must be repaid at the beginning of period t + 1. The
                                      B , can vary across firms and over time. Taxable corporate
gross corporate bond return on Bit , rit
profits equal operating profits less capital depreciation, adjustment costs, and interest expenses,
                                             B − 1)B , in which adjustment costs are expensed. Let τ
Π(Kit , Xit ) − δ it Kit − Φ(Iit , Kit ) − (rit     it                                               t

denote the corporate tax rate at time t. The payout of firm i equals

                                                                     B                             B

    Let Mt+1 be the stochastic discount factor from t to t+1, which is correlated with the aggregate
component of Xit+1 . The cum-dividend market equity can be formulated as
                                                       "∞             #

subject to a transversality condition that prevents firms from borrowing an infinite amount to dis-
tribute to shareholders, limT →∞ Et [Mt+T Bit+T +1 ] = 0. The equity value-maximization implies

    The investment return is the ratio of the marginal benefits of investment at time t + 1 to the
marginal costs of investment at t. In its numerator, (1 − τ t+1 )κYit+1 /Kit+1 is the marginal after-
tax profits produced by an additional unit of capital, (1 − τ t+1 )(a/2)(Iit+1 /Kit+1 )2 is the marginal
after-tax reduction in adjustment costs, τ t+1 δ it+1 is the marginal depreciation tax shield, and the
last term in the numerator is the marginal continuation value of the extra unit of capital net of
depreciation. Also, the first term in brackets in the numerator divided by the denominator is analo-
gous to a dividend yield. The second term in brackets in the numerator divided by the denominator
is analogous to a capital gain because this ratio is the growth of marginal q.

                                                      S
Let Pit ≡ Vit − Dit be the ex-dividend equity value, rit+1 ≡ (Pit+1 + Dit+1 )/Pit be the stock return,
and wit ≡ Bit+1 /(Pit + Bit+1 ) be the market leverage. Then the investment return is the weighted
average of the stock return and the after-tax corporate bond return:

                                      I           Ba                 S
                                     rit+1 = wit rit+1 + (1 − wit ) rit+1 .                                (26)

Equation (26) is exactly the weighted average cost of capital in corporate finance.
                                  S
    Solving for the stock return rit+1 from equation (26) gives the multiperiod investment CAPM :
                                                          I
                                                         rit+1        Ba

                                                              1 − wit
          Iw is the levered investment return. Together, equations (25) and (26) imply that the
in which rit+1
weighted average cost of capital equals the ratio of the next-period marginal benefits of investment

                                                        29
divided by the current-period marginal costs of investment. This first principle of investment pro-
vides the microfoundation for the weighted average cost of capital approach to capital budgeting in
corporate finance. Intuitively, firms will keep investing until the costs of doing so, which rise with
investment, equal the present value of additional investment, which is the next-period marginal
benefits of investment discounted by the weighted average cost of capital.

3.1.1   Expected Stock Returns

The multiperiod investment CAPM implies an ex-ante restriction that the expected stock return
equals the expected levered investment return across all testing assets:

                                           S       Iw
                                                         
                                         E rit+1 − rit+1   = 0.                                      (28)

The model error from the moment condition defines the investment CAPM alpha:

                                        αiq ≡ ET rit+1
                                                 S       Iw
                                                               
                                                       − rit+1   ,                                   (29)

in which ET [·] is the sample mean of the series in brackets.

   Liu, Whited, and Zhang (2009) estimate the parameters a and κ via one-stage generalized
method of moments (GMM) at the portfolio level. Grouping stocks into portfolios enlarges the
average return spread across extreme portfolios, and makes it more significant by diversifying away
idiosyncratic volatilities at the stock level. Accordingly, the power of asset pricing tests increases
(Black, Jensen, and Scholes 1972). The portfolio approach also has the advantage that portfolio
investment data are smooth, whereas the investment data at the firm level can be lumpy.

                                                                               Iw , against average
   Figure 2 shows that the scatter points of average predicted stock returns, rit+1
                         S , are largely aligned with the 45-degree line across the earnings surprises
realized stock returns, rit+1
(Panel A) and book-to-market deciles (Panel B). The alpha of the high-minus-low earnings sur-
prises decile is only −0.4% per annum, and the alpha of the high-minus-low book-to-market decile
1.2%, both of which are within one standard error from zero. The mean absolute alpha is 0.7%
across the earnings surprises deciles, and 2.3% across the book-to-market deciles.

   However, the point estimates in Liu, Whited, and Zhang (2009) reveal a weakness. The adjust-
ment costs parameter, a, is estimated to be 7.7 across the earnings surprises deciles, but 22.3 across
the book-to-market deciles. The capital’s share parameter, κ, is 0.3 across the former, but 0.5
across the latter deciles. Ideally, if a model is well specified, the estimates of these technological pa-

rameters should be invariant across different testing assets. Clearly, the first stab at implementing
the multiperiod investment CAPM via structural estimation is far from perfect.

   Liu and Zhang (2014) use the model to understand price momentum. Momentum deciles are
rebalanced monthly, but accounting variables in Compustat are annual. To handle this difficulty,
Liu and Zhang design a more polished timing alignment procedure in that monthly levered in-
vestment returns of a momentum decile are constructed from its annual accounting variables to
match with the decile’s monthly stock returns. The investment CAPM performs well across the
price momentum deciles. The scatter points of average predicted versus realized returns are again
largely aligned with the 45-degree line. The winner-minus-loser decile has a small alpha of 0.4%
per annum, which is only about 2.65% of its average return of 15.09% (equal-weighted). Also, the
mean absolute alpha is 0.83%, which is small relative to the average decile return of 12.4%.

   Armed with the point estimates from matching only average momentum profits, Liu and Zhang
(2014) examine the reversal of momentum in long horizons as diagnostics on the model. In the
event-time window covering 36 months after the portfolio formation, average winner-minus-loser


                                                                                               31
returns in the data start at 19.98% per annum in the first month in the holding period, fall to 13.15%
in month six, converge largely to zero in month ten, and turn negative afterward. The investment
CAPM goes a long way toward explaining this reversal. Levered investment returns for the winner-
minus-loser decile start at 18.21% per annum in the first month, fall to 10.73% in month six, and
further to 2.87% in month twelve. The predicted price momentum profits converge largely to zero in
month fifteen, and turn negative afterward. The expected growth plays a key role in capturing the
reversal of price momentum. The investment-to-capital growth spread starts at 39.45% in month
one, weakens to 23.06% in month six, converges to zero in month thirteen, and turns negative
afterward. In contrast, the sales-to-capital spread is much more persistent than momentum profits.

3.1.2   Equity Valuation

Equity valuation is immensely important in theory and practice. In academia, a vast accounting
literature has built on the dividend discounting and residual income models for equity valuation
(Ohlson 1995). Widely practiced in the financial services industry, valuation is at the core of stan-
dard business school curriculum with many textbook treatments (Penman 2013; Koller, Goedhart,
and Wessles 2015). Traditional valuation methods calculate the present value of future dividends,
working from the perspective of investors’ demand of risky equities.

   Belo, Xue, and Zhang (2013) approach the valuation question from the perspective of managers’
supply of assets. The idea is that managers, if behaving optimally, will adjust the supply of assets to
their changes in the market value. Managers will invest until the marginal benefits of one extra unit
of assets (marginal q, which is the present value of all the future dividends generated by this extra
unit) equal the marginal costs of supplying this extra unit. With a specified capital adjustment
technology, the marginal costs of investment (marginal q) can be inferred from investment. With
constant returns to scale, the inferred marginal q provides the value for a firm’s entire capital assets.

   Working within the multiperiod framework outlined in Section 3.1, Belo, Xue, and Zhang (2013)
allow the marginal adjustment costs of investment to be nonlinear:

                                                       Iit ν

in which η > 0 is the slope, and ν > 0 the curvature parameter. The first principle of investment




                                                   32
implies that the market value of the firm is given by:

    Belo, Xue, and Zhang (2013) measure Tobin’s q in the data as qit = (Pit + Bit+1 )/Ait , in which
Ait is total assets, and test whether the average q in the data equals that implied in the model:
                             "     "                       ν−1 #       #

                           E qit − 1 + (1 − τ t )η ν                       = 0.                (33)

However, this equation allows assets to be potentially misvalued, but forces managers to align in-
vestment with misvalued q. To alleviate this concern, Belo et al. estimate the valuation moment
jointly with a (scaled) investment Euler equation moment, specified as:

    Empirically, the scatter points of average predicted q versus average realized q across the Tobin’s
q deciles are largely aligned with the 45-degree line. The high-minus-low error from the valuation
moment is 0.27, which is only 6% of the high-minus-low spread in Tobin’s q, 4.5. The high-minus-
low Euler equation error is slightly larger at 0.32. The mean absolute valuation error is 0.08, which
is only 5.13% of the average q across the deciles, 1.56. The point estimates are sensible, 4.1 for
the slope parameter, η, and 4.09 for the curvature parameter, ν, which is also reliably different
from two, rejecting the quadratic adjustment costs function. These estimates imply an average
adjustment costs-to-sales ratio of 3.95%, which is relatively low.

3.2     Notes
3.2.1    The Neoclassical q-Theory of Investment

The neoclassical q-theory of investment is originally developed to explain real investment behavior.
This literature is vast (see Chirinko 1993 for a review on aggregate investment, and Bond and Van
Reenen 2007 on firm investment). Introduced by Brainard and Tobin (1968) and Tobin (1969),
the basic idea is to relate investment to average q, which is the ratio of the market value of a firm
to the replacement costs of its capital stock. Jorgenson (1963), Lucas and Prescott (1971), Mussa
(1977), and Abel (1983) provide the neoclassical formulation of q-theory, and derive the relation
between investment and marginal q. Hayashi (1982) shows that under constant returns to scale,
marginal q equals average q. This proposition allows empirical studies to replace the unobservable
marginal q with the observable average q. Abel and Eberly (1994) extend q-theory to incorporate
costly reversibility and flow fixed costs of investment.

   Empirically, q-theory’s performance has been disappointing in describing investment behavior.
In investment-q regressions, for instance, the slope coefficients on cash flow are typically large and
significant for firms that are financially constrained, even after controlling for q (Fazzari, Hubbard,
and Petersen 1988).     In investment Euler equation tests, the investment model is rejected in
subsamples that consist of financially constrained firms (Whited 1992). The empirical performance
deteriorates further at the micro level across firms or plants, in which fixed costs of investment and
other nonconvexities play an important role (Doms and Dunne 1998; Cooper and Haltiwanger 2006).

   In contrast, the investment model is more successful in cross-sectional asset pricing. The key
difference is that asset pricing tests are conducted at the portfolio level. As noted, forming portfo-
lios makes average return spreads more reliable, increasing the test power. Because of aggregation,
investment data at the portfolio level are smooth relative to firm-level or plant-level investment
data. Thomas (2002) and Veracierto (2002), for instance, show that aggregation largely elimi-
nates the impact of lumpy investment on aggregate dynamics in equilibrium business cycle models.
Cooper and Haltiwanger (2006) also show that the quadratic model captures most of the time series
variation in aggregate investment simulated from a nonconvex adjustment costs model estimated
on plant-level data. Finally, financial constraints are not a strong predictor of cross-sectional ex-
pected returns in the data (Lamont, Polk, and Saá-Requejo 2001). It remains to be seen, however,
whether financial constraints affect equity valuation, especially at the firm level.

3.2.2   Investment-Based Asset Pricing Tests

Aggregate Stock Market         Cochrane (1991) is the first to apply q-theory to study asset prices.
Cochrane derives the investment return in equation (25) in a simplified setting without debt or taxes,
and argues that the investment return should equal the return to owning capital, which is in turn
the stock return. Restoy and Rockinger (1994) prove that the equality between the investment and
stock returns holds under more general conditions, and that the equality is in effect a mathematical
restatement of that between marginal q and average q under the Hayashi (1982) conditions.
Empirically, Cochrane shows that with reasonable parameters, the mean of the aggregate investment
return matches the mean of the aggregate stock market return, meaning that the equity premium
is not a puzzle in q-theory. However, the investment return volatility is only about one half of the
stock market volatility. The correlation between investment and stock returns is as high as 40%.
Finally, investment-to-capital predicts the stock market return with a significantly negative slope.

   Lettau and Ludvigson (2002) emphasize that time-varying aggregate risk premiums have impli-
cations not only for aggregate investment today, but also for future investment over long horizons.
Predictive variables for market excess returns over long horizons should also forecast long horizon
fluctuations in the growth of marginal q and investment. Evidence from long horizon regressions
of aggregate investment growth on a variety of risk premium predictors confirms this prediction.

   Merz and Yashiv (2007) introduce labor into the investment model, and fit the resulting val-
uation equation on the aggregate U.S. data. A convex adjustment costs function with nonlinear
marginal costs is able to account for the valuation data, including the mean and volatility of the
market equity-to-output ratio. The valuation ratio predicted from the estimated model also traces
closely the valuation ratio in the data, including the stock price runup in the late 1990s. Merz
and Yashiv attribute the model’s good performance to the use of gross flows data for both invest-
ment and hiring, the joint estimation of hiring and investment including their interaction, and the
nonlinear marginal costs in the adjustment costs function.

   Jermann (2010) examines the determinants of the equity premium implied by firms’ first-order
conditions. Assuming two states of the world and two capital inputs (structures and equipment),
                           I
Jermann rewrites Et [Mt+1 rit+1 ] = 1 as a system of two equations consisting of the structures and
equipment investment returns. The system can then be solved for the two state prices, from which
the interest rate can be calculated. With reasonable parameter values, the model fits the first and


                                                 35
second moments of the market return and interest rate in the data, and connects these moments
with technologies. However, while this method derives state prices from the production side, it
seems empirically infeasible to extend it to more than two states of the world.


Cross-sectional Tests Cochrane (1996) conducts cross-sectional tests on the consumption
                S ] = 1, in which r S
CAPM, Et [Mt+1 rit+1               it+1 is the stock returns across the size deciles, and Mt+1 is

specified as a linear function of two investment returns constructed per equation (25) on the gross
private domestic nonresidential and residential investment data. Gomes, Yaron, and Zhang (2006)
study the impact of financial constraints, which are modeled as a dividend nonnegativity constraint,
on the cross section of returns. Following Cochrane, Gomes et al. specify the stochastic discount
factor as a linear function of the aggregate investment return subject to financial constraints. With
the 25 size and book-to-market portfolios as testing assets, financial constraints provide a common
factor, but their impact seems more important in good times, when investment are high.

   Instead of Cochrane’s (1996) test framework, Whited and Wu (2006) estimate the investment
Euler equation augmented with financial constraints at the firm level via GMM. The shadow price
of external funds is specified as a linear function of several firm characteristics. Using the estimated
shadow price as a financial constraints index, Whited and Wu show that there exists a financial
constraints factor, but that its average return is insignificant, albeit positive.

   Balvers and Huang (2007) formulate a productivity-based asset pricing model, in which the
Solow residual is the only priced factor, and capital is the only conditioning variable. Their cross-
sectional tests show that value and growth stocks have similar average productivity risk. However,
growth stocks have their highest productivity risk, when the productivity risk premium is low or
even negative in good times, giving rise to lower average returns than value stocks. Intuitively,
the market value of growth firms varies more drastically with productivity shocks in booms, when
capital is abundant, as positive shocks are propagated by low investment costs.

   Cochrane (1993) emphasizes that standard production technologies restrict firms from adjusting
their output across states of nature. Cochrane formulates a flexible state-contingent production
technology to overcome this limitation, and derives a stochastic discount factor as firms’ marginal
rate of transformation. Belo (2010) estimates this model by identifying the marginal rate of trans-
formation from price and output data in the durable and nondurable goods sectors. Belo’s estimates
suggest that firms’ ability to transform output across states of nature seems high.

    Vitorino (2014) quantifies the impact of advertising on expected returns and equity valuation.
Interpreting advertising expenses as investment in brand capital, Vitorino extends the expected re-
turn test in equation (28) and the valuation test in equation (33) to a setting with two capital inputs,
physical capital and brand capital. The model matches well the average stock returns and Tobin’s
q across portfolios formed on advertising expenses. Also, brand capital accounts for a substantial
fraction, about 23%, of firms’ market equity, and this fraction varies greatly across industries.

    Cooper and Priestley (2015) apply the investment CAPM to study the expected returns and
valuation of private firms, which form a substantial part of the U.S. economy. Whereas estimating
costs of capital from the consumption CAPM requires historical stock returns data that are not
feasible for private firms, the investment CAPM estimates costs of capital directly from economic
fundamentals. As such, the investment CAPM uniquely befits private firms. Cooper and Priestley
examine the cross section of ten industry portfolios formed on the fraction of the sales of public
firms in a given industry to its total industry sales. The bottom two deciles, which consist of only
private firms, are identified as private industries, and the top decile as public industries.

    Cooper and Priestley (2015) report three key findings. First, characteristics such as investment
and profitability play a similar role in driving the cross-sectional variation of investment returns
across both private and public firms. This evidence lends support to the investment CAPM, but
casts doubt on mispricing as an explanation for the role of these characteristics. The key identifi-
cation is that private firms do not have stock prices to overreact or underreact to, and should be
less affected by mispricing, if at all. Second, a four-factor model, resembling the q-factor model,
constructed on both private and public firms, performs well in describing the cross section of in-
vestment returns, and provides the cost-of-capital estimates for private firms. Finally, private firms
have expected returns and valuation ratios that are not far from those of public firms.


4    The Big Picture

After reviewing what the investment CAPM can do, I take a step back, and explain the big picture.
I provide a historical perspective of the investment CAPM in Section 4.1, and clarify its relation
with the consumption CAPM in Section 4.2 and with behavioral finance in Section 4.3.




                                                  37
4.1     A Historical Perspective
4.1.1    Origin

The origin of the investment CAPM can be traced to Böhm-Bawert (1891) and Fisher (1930).
Böhm-Bawert provides three reasons why the rate of interest is positive. First, the marginal util-
ity of income falls over time because of more resources in the future. Second, due to psychological
reasons, consumers tend to underestimate future needs. Both reasons are consumption-based deter-
minants of the equilibrium interest rate. Böhm-Bawert’s third reason is “roundabout” production:

It is an elementary fact of experience that methods of production which take time are more productive.
That is to say, given the same quantity of productive instruments, the lengthier the productive method
employed the greater the quantity of products that can be obtained (p. 260).... Command over a sum of
present consumption goods provides us with the means of subsistence during the current economic period.
This leaves the means of production, which we may have at our disposal during this period (Labour, Uses of
Land, Capital), free for the technically more productive service of the future, and gives us the more abundant
product attainable by them in longer methods of production (p. 271).

   Because production per worker rises with the length of the period of production, some coun-
terbalancing force must exist to cause producers to choose a production period of finite length.
Böhm-Bawert (1891) argues that this counterbalancing force is the positive rate of interest. This
mechanism implies that the lower the interest rate, the longer will be the optimal period of pro-
duction, and the more capital will be tied up in the production process. Conversely, the higher the
interest rate, the shorter will be the optimal period of production, and the less capital will be tied
up in the production process. This effect is exactly the negative relation between real investment
and the discount rate (Figure 1), albeit without uncertainty.

   Fisher (1930) studies the economic determinants of the real interest rate by constructing the
first general equilibrium model with both intertemporal exchange and production. His model also
shows the Fisher Separation Theorem, which justifies the maximization of the present value as the
objective of the firm, without any direct dependence on shareholder preferences. Figure 3, which
is adapted from Chart 38 in Fisher (p. 271), shows the key insights. The horizontal axis labeled
C0 represents consumption in date 0, and the vertical axis C1 represents consumption in date 1.
Endowed with an amount of resources, K0 , in date 0, the agent’s problem is to choose an optimal
time pattern of consumption. The agent’s preferences are represented by indifference curves, such
as U0 and U1 . There are two available ways to transfer resources between dates 0 and 1. The
“market opportunity” represented by the two straight lines in the figure is through borrowing and
lending at the interest rate, r. The “investment opportunity” represented by the curve K0 OK1


                                                     38
is through a real production technology. The curve is concave to the origin due to diminishing
returns to scale. Without the production technology, the optimum is Q, which is the tangent point
between the market line initiated at K0 and the indifference curve U0 .

   With the production technology, the agent solves the optimum in two separate steps. First, the
production optimum is achieved at O, which is the tangent point between its associated market
line and the production frontier. Starting from K0 , the agent keeps moving up along the produc-
tion curve K0 OK1 , until the marginal rate of transformation, △K1 /△K0 − 1, in which △K0 is
the amount of input in date 0, and △K1 is output in date 1, is equal to the interest rate, r. This
equality is achieved at the tangent point O. Prior to this point, △K1 /△K0 − 1 > r, meaning that it
is optimal to invest more. Beyond this point, △K1 /△K0 − 1 < r, meaning that it is suboptimal to
keep investing. Second, the consumption optimum is achieved at point P , through borrowing and
lending along the market line associated with O. An important implication of the Fisher Separa-
tion Theorem is that the equilibrium interest rate can be “determined” purely from the production
technology, without any direct dependence on investor preferences.

                                                39
   In his own words, Fisher (1930) describes the interaction and equivalence between the
consumption-based (impatience) and investment-based determinants of the interest rate as follows:
Our outer opportunities urge us to postpone present income—to shift it toward the future, because it will
expand in the process. Impatience is impatience to spend, while opportunity is opportunity to invest. The
more we invest and postpone our gratification, the lower the investment opportunity rate becomes, but the
greater the impatience rate; the more we spend and hasten our gratification, the lower the impatience rate
becomes but the higher the opportunity rate.
    If the pendulum swings too far toward the investment extreme and away from the spending extreme, it is
brought back by the strengthening of impatience and the weakening of investment opportunity. Impatience is
strengthened by growing wants, and opportunity is weakened because of diminishing returns. If the pendulum
swings too far toward the spending extreme and away from the investment extreme it is brought back by the
weakening of impatience and the strengthening of opportunity for reasons opposite to those stated above.
    Between these two extremes lies the equilibrium point which clears the market, and clears it at a rate of
interest registering (in a perfect market) all impatience rates and all opportunity rates (p. 177).

   Hirshleifer (1958) uses the Fisherian approach to study optimal investment decisions of firms,
with and without certain capital markets imperfections. Hirshleifer (1965, 1966, 1970) extends the
Fisherian equilibrium into a world with uncertainty, using the state-preference approach of Arrow
(1964) and Debreu (1959). Diamond (1967) and Hirshleifer (1970) also contain an early formation
of state-contingent production, a theme echoed later by Cochrane (1993) and Belo (2010).

   Jorgenson (1963) formulates a model of investment demand with capital as a factor of produc-
tion, and introduces the concept of the user cost of capital as the rental price of capital services.
The user cost of capital contains three components, including the interest rate, the depreciation
rate, and the rate of capital loss on investment goods, adjusted for the taxation of capital income.
Hall and Jorgenson (1967) analyze the impact of alternative tax policies on the user cost of capital.

   In a justly immortal contribution, Modigliani and Miller (1958) ask the cost of capital question:
What is the “cost of capital” to a firm in a world in which funds are used to acquire assets whose yields
are uncertain; and in which capital can be obtained by many different media, ranging from pure debt in-
struments, representing money-fixed claims, to pure equity issues, giving holders only the right to a pro-rata
share in the uncertain venture (p. 261)?

Modigliani and Miller’s Proposition I says that in perfect capital markets, the value of a firm
equals the market value of the total cash flows produced by its assets, and is unaffected by its cap-
ital structure. Proposition II says that the cost of equity equals the cost of unlevered equity plus
a risk premium, which equals the market debt-to-equity ratio times the spread between the cost
of unlevered equity and the cost of debt. Both propositions are extensively discussed in modern
corporate finance textbooks, including Ross, Westerfield, and Jaffe (2008, p. 428–447), Berk and
DeMarzo (2009, p. 455–466), and Brealey, Myers, and Allen (2011, p. 418–434).

                                                     40
    However, it is the relatively overlooked Proposition III in Modigliani and Miller (1958) that
contains arguably the earliest discussion of the investment CAPM:

Proposition III. If a firm in class k is acting in the best interest of the stockholders at the time of the decision,
it will exploit an investment opportunity if and only if the rate of return on the investment, say ρ∗ , is as
large as or larger than ρk . That is, the cut-off point for investment in the firm will in all cases be ρk and
will be completely unaffected by the type of security used to finance the investment. Equivalently, we may
say that regardless of the financing used, the marginal cost of capital to a firm is equal to the average cost
of capital, which is in turn equal to the capitalization rate for an unlevered stream in the class to which the
firm belongs (p. 288, original emphasis).

    Cochrane (1991) is the first in the modern era to use the investment model to study asset prices:

The logic of the production-based model is exactly analogous [to that of the consumption-based model].
It ties asset returns to marginal rates of transformation, which are inferred from data on investment (and
potentially, output and other production variables) through a production function. It is derived from the
producer’s first order conditions for optimal intertemporal investment demand. Its testable content is a re-
striction on the joint stochastic process of investment (and/or other production variables) and asset returns.
This restriction can also be interpreted in two ways. If we fix the return process, it is a version of the q theory
of investment. If we fix the investment process, it is a production-based asset pricing model. For example,
the production-based asset pricing model can make statements like “expected returns are high because (a
function of) investment growth is high” (p. 210, original emphasis).

Alas, when applying the investment model to the cross section, Cochrane (1996) retreats back to the
consumption CAPM, stipulates the stochastic discount factor as a linear function of the residential
and nonresidential investment returns, and performs GMM tests per Hansen and Singleton (1982).

4.1.2    Oblivion

Modern asset pricing is thoroughly dominated by the consumption CAPM. The term “the invest-
ment CAPM” has not even appeared in the prior literature. The glorious history of asset pricing
is well known (Bernstein 1992; Rubinstein 2006). I only wish to shed light on how classic asset
pricing studies have gone down the path of ignoring the supply (investment) side altogether, despite
it receiving a symmetric treatment as the demand (consumption) side in Fisher (1930). The crux
seems to be uncertainty. Fisher’s general equilibrium model assumes certainty and only provides
a theory of the interest rate, as opposed to a theory of risky asset prices. In hindsight, thanks to
Arrow (1964) and Debreu (1959), it is clear that asset pricing theory is nothing but the standard
price theory in microeconomics extended to uncertainty and over time.

    However, predating the Arrow-Debreu framework, Markowitz (1952, 1959) formulates the mean
variance model of portfolio selection (see also Roy 1952). The model postulates that investors
should maximize the expected portfolio return, while minimizing portfolio variance. Treynor (1962),


                                                         41
Sharpe (1964), Lintner (1965), and Mossin (1966) ask what would happen in equilibrium if investors
all follow Markowitz’s decision rule, leading to the derivation of the CAPM. Merton (1973) extends
the one-period CAPM to the intertemporal CAPM, in which state variables related to shifts in
the investment opportunity set over time are also risk factors (see also Long 1974). The classic
textbooks by Fama and Miller (1972) and Fama (1976) rely almost exclusively on the mean vari-
ance model to deal with uncertainty. While acknowledging Hirshleifer’s (1965, 1966) applications
of the Arrow-Debreu approach, Fama and Miller view the mean variance model as much more
operational empirically. This operational advantage no longer exists, thanks to the methodological
contributions in Hansen (1982) and Hansen and Singleton (1982).

    Recasting equilibrium asset pricing within the Arrow-Debreu framework, Rubinstein (1976),
Lucas (1978), and Breeden (1979) derive the consumption CAPM from the first principle of the
optimal consumption-portfolio choice problem of a representative consumer. Hansen and Single-
ton (1982) and Breeden, Gibbons, and Litzenberger (1989) provide early tests of the consumption
CAPM. Ludvigson (2013) offers a recent review of this literature.

    Since consumers and producers are two different agents integral to the Arrow-Debreu model,
early asset pricing theorists justify their modeling choice as reducing a messy general equilibrium
problem into a tractable consumption-based partial equilibrium problem. Merton (1973) writes:

Since movements from equilibrium to equilibrium through time involve both price and quantity adjustment,
a complete analysis would require a description of both the rate of return and change in asset value dynamics.
To do so would require a specification of firm behavior in determining the supply of shares, which in turn
would require knowledge of the real asset structure (i.e., technology; whether capital is “putty” or “clay”;
etc.). In particular, the current returns on firms with large amounts (relative to current cash flow) of non-
shiftable capital with low rates of depreciation will tend to be strongly affected by shifts in capitalization rates
because, in the short turn, most of the adjustment to the new equilibrium will be done by prices (p. 871).
    Since the present paper examines only investor behavior to derive the demands for assets and the rela-
tive yield requirements in equilibrium, only the rate of return dynamics will be examined explicitly. Hence,
certain variable taken as exogenous in the model, would be endogenous to a full-equilibrium system (p. 871).

Similarly, Breeden (1979) also defends his abstraction from the production side:

[It] is not necessary to explicitly examine firms’ production decisions and the supply of asset shares, provided
that the assumptions made are consistent with optimal behavior of firms in a general equilibrium model. To
be consistent with general equilibrium, prices must be recognized to be endogenously determined through
the equilibrium of supply and demand (p. 269).

    Although general equilibrium asset pricing models with production have appeared sporadically
(Brock 1982; Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross 1985), the consumption CAPM has firmly dominated modern
asset pricing. The standard MBA textbook by Bodie, Kane, and Marcus (2014) uses the classic

                                                        42
CAPM as the organizing framework. Standard Ph.D. textbooks, such as Huang and Litzenberger
(1988), Ingersoll (1988), Duffie (2001), Cochrane (2005), Back (2010), and Danthine and Donaldson
(2015), are all based on the consumption CAPM. In particular, Cochrane writes:

Asset pricing theory all stems from one simple concept, presented in the first page of the first chapter of
this book: price equals expected discounted payoff. The rest is elaboration, special cases, and a closet full
of tricks that make the central equations useful for one or another application (p. xiii).
    All asset pricing models amount to alternative ways of connecting the stochastic discount factor to data
(p. 7, original emphasis).

In hindsight, it seems clear that Cochrane meant that consumption-based asset pricing is all about
the stochastic discount factor. Alas, his writings are sometimes misinterpreted as saying that only
the consumption CAPM is asset pricing, but the investment CAPM is not.

4.1.3   Reincarnation

The consumption CAPM is an empirical failure. Starting from Ball and Brown (1968), a massive
literature on asset pricing anomalies has documented pervasive evidence that rejects the consump-
tion CAPM, casting doubt on its premise of efficient markets. Fama (1998), Barberis and Thaler
(2003), and Richardson, Tuna, and Wysocki (2010) provide extensive reviews of the anomalies
literature. Behavioral finance has risen to use investor sentiment to explain anomalies in inefficient
markets. The field today is divided between neoclassicists, who are disturbed by anomalies, but
unwilling to give up on microfoundations, and behavioralists, who view anomalies as a resounding
rejection of efficient markets in particular and neoclassical economics in general. In the financial
services industry, the anomalies literature has formed the scientific foundation for quantitative in-
vestment management. Practitioners are overwhelmingly sympathetic to the behavioral view, while
dismissing neoclassicists as theoretical purists who have lost touch with the real world.

   I view anomalies not as an indictment of efficient markets, but as the empirical difficulties of
the consumption CAPM. More important, I view anomalies as suggesting that the consumption
paradigm is conceptually incomplete. The genius of Breeden, Lucas, and Rubinstein is to reduce
a messy multidimensional general equilibrium asset pricing problem into a tractable consumption-
based partial equilibrium problem. Alas, this reduction, by its very construction, is achieved by
abstracting from the investment side of general equilibrium. Unfortunately, anomalies are primarily
empirical relations between firm characteristics and expected returns. Because firms are ignored,
perhaps not surprisingly, the consumption CAPM fails to explain anomalies.


                                                     43
   Inspired by Cochrane (1991), I recognize in Zhang (2005a) that the neoclassical q-theory of
investment allows a different reduction of the general equilibrium asset pricing problem, a reduc-
tion that is symmetric and neatly complementary to the reduction in the form of the consumption
CAPM achieved by the permanent income theory of consumption. The first principle of investment
for individual firms implies that the weighted average cost of capital equals the benefits of one extra
unit of capital divided by its costs (equations 25 and 26). Intuitively, firms keep investing until the
costs of doing so rise to the level of the discounted investment benefits.

   The big news for asset pricing is that the investment CAPM expresses the stock return purely
as a function of firm characteristics. The investment CAPM does not use any information on
consumption and utility functions, thereby achieving a reduction symmetric to the consumption
CAPM, which does not use any information on production and investment technologies. This sep-
aration is in the spirit of the Fisher Separation Theorem. The investment CAPM implies that the
evidence that firm characteristics forecast stock returns does not necessarily mean mispricing. No
expectational errors are ever assumed in deriving the investment CAPM.

4.2     Complementarity with the Consumption CAPM

The relation between the investment CAPM and the consumption CAPM is complementary.

4.2.1    Marshall’s Scissors

As asset pricing theory, the investment CAPM is as fundamental as the consumption CAPM. In
the Arrow-Debreu economy, the first principle of consumption and the first principle of investment
are two key optimality conditions. Consumption betas, expected returns, and firm characteristics
are all endogenous variables, which are in turn determined by a system of simultaneous equations
in general equilibrium. No causality runs across these endogenous variables. Neither consumption
betas nor firm characteristics are causal forces driving expected returns. As such, the investment
CAPM is no more and no less “causal” than the consumption CAPM (Lin and Zhang 2013).

   Cochrane (2005) also emphasizes no causality from consumption betas to expected returns:

It is enormously tempting to slide into an interpretation that E(mx) determines p. We routinely think of
betas and factor risk prices—components of E(mx)—as determining expected returns. For example, we
routinely say things like ‘the expected return of a stock increased because the firm took on riskier projects,
thereby increasing its beta.’ But the whole consumption process, discount factor, and factor risk premia
change when the production technology changes (p. 41, original emphasis).




                                                     44
   History tends to repeat itself. As noted, asset pricing theory is just the standard price theory
extended to uncertainty and over time. During the last quarter of the 19th century, economists de-
bated the relative importance of demand and supply in price theory (Landreth and Colander 2002).
While David Ricardo and John Stuart Mill had stressed costs of production, William Jevons, Carl
Menger, and Léon Walras insisted that value should depend only on marginal utility. Alfred Mar-
shall (1890) used the following analogy to resolve this controversy in his Principles of Economics:

We might as reasonably dispute whether it is the upper or under blade of a pair of scissors that cuts a piece
of paper, as whether value is governed by utility or costs of production. It is true that when one blade is
held still, and the cutting is affected by moving the other, we may say with careless brevity that the cutting
is done by the second; but the statement is not strictly accurate, and is to be excused only so long as it
claims to be merely a popular and not a strictly scientific account of what happens (Marshall 1890 [1961,
9th edition, p. 348]).

   Even Fisher (1930) had to address an earlier criticism that he had neglected production:

Years after The Rate of Interest was published, I suggested the more popular term “impatience” in place
of “agio” or “time preference.” This catchword has been widely adopted, and, to my surprise, has led to a
widespread but false impression that I had overlooked or neglected the productivity or investment oppor-
tunity side entirely. It also led many to think that, by using the new word impatience, I meant to claim a
new idea. Thus I found myself credited with being the author of “the impatience theory” which I am not,
and not credited with being the author of those parts lacking any catchword. It was this misunderstanding
which led me, after much search, to adopt the catchword “investment opportunity” as a substitute for the
inadequate term “productivity” which had come into such general use (p. viii).

4.2.2   The Aggregation Critique

Given that the investment CAPM and the consumption CAPM are parallel but complementary in
general equilibrium, why does the former perform better than the latter in the data?

   The Roll and Hansen-Richard critiques are well known. Roll (1977) argues that the wealth port-
folio is not observable, making the CAPM tests infeasible. Hansen and Richard (1987) argue that
the conditioning information of investors is not observable, making the consumption CAPM tests in-
feasible in a dynamic world. Both critiques seem less important for the investment CAPM. Although
the q-factor model includes the market factor, it is only used to anchor the time-series averages of re-
turns, while the task of accounting for their cross-sectional variation is left to the q-factors. Also, the
structural investment CAPM tests do not need to specify the conditioning information of managers.

   The most damaging critique against the consumption CAPM, I believe, is aggregation. Most
consumption CAPM studies sidestep the aggregation problem by examining the optimizing behavior
of a representative consumer. However, the Sonnenschein-Mantel-Debreu theorem in general equi-
librium theory states that the aggregate excess demand function is not restricted by the standard

                                                     45
rationality assumption on individual demands (Sonnenschein 1973; Debreu 1974; Mantel 1974).
Individuals can be fully rational, but the aggregate behavior might appear entirely different.

   Kirman (1992) raises four objections to the representative consumer. First, individual maxi-
mization does not imply collective rationality, and collective maximization does not imply individual
rationality. Second, the response of the representative consumer to a parameter change might not
be the same as the aggregate response of individuals. Third, it is possible for the representative
to exhibit preference orderings that are opposite to all the individuals’. Finally, the aggregate
behavior of rational individuals might exhibit complicated dynamics, and imposing these dynamics
on one individual can lead to unnatural characteristics of the individual. Kirman concludes that:
[It] is clear that the “representative” agent deserves a decent burial, as an approach to economic analysis
that is not only primitive, but fundamentally erroneous (p. 119).

In essence, aggregation in the representative consumer assumes that all 319 million Americans are
identical in preferences. In case it is still not disturbing enough, try 1.4 billion Chinese.

   On the critical importance of aggregation, Deaton (1992) also writes:
I have come to believe that [representative agent models] are of limited value, and that what we have learned
from them is more methodological than substantive. Representative agents have two failings: they know too
much, and they live too long. An aggregate of individuals with finite lives, and with limited and heteroge-
neous information is not likely to behave like the single individual of the textbook. We are likely to learn
more about aggregate consumption by looking at microeconomic behavior, and by thinking seriously about
aggregation from the bottom up (p. ix).
    The main puzzle is not why these representative agent models do not account for the evidence, but why
anyone ever thought that they might, given the absurdity of the aggregation assumptions that they require
(p. 70).

   The aggregation problem cuts both ways, however. On the one hand, without confronting this
problem, imposing that asset pricing is all about the stochastic discount factor is self-defeating. On
the other hand, the aggregation difficulty also means that the failure of the consumption CAPM
might have nothing to say about individual rationality. As noted, the Sonnenschein-Mantel-Debreu
theorem says that individual rationality imposes no restrictions on aggregate consumption. A nat-
ural corollary is that the consumption CAPM is not testable!

   The investment CAPM is relatively immune to the aggregation critique. The consumption
CAPM is macroeconomic in nature, and is derived from the first principle of the representative
consumer, which is the aggregate stand-in for all the individuals in the economy. In contrast, the
investment CAPM is microeconomic in nature, and is derived from the first principle of an indi-
vidual firm. It seems circuitous, if not clumsy, to use the macroeconomic consumption CAPM to

                                                     46
explain micro-level anomalies, with the strong built-in aggregation assumption. By comparison,
the investment CAPM is more straightforward and natural for this purpose.

4.2.3   Beta Measurement Errors

In addition to the aggregation critique, another relatively underappreciated problem is beta mea-
surement errors. Fama (1991) describes the difficulties of estimating consumption betas as follows:

Consumption is measured with error, and consumption flows from durables are difficult to impute. The
model calls for instantaneous consumption, but the data are monthly, quarterly, and annual aggregates.
Finally, ... the elegance of the consumption model (all incentives to hedge uncertainty about consumption
and investment opportunities are summarized in consumption β’s) likely means that consumption β’s are
difficult to estimate because they vary through time (p. 1599).

These difficulties probably explain why the consumption CAPM often underperforms the classic
CAPM in empirical tests. However, the CAPM is also subject to severe measurement errors.

   Miller and Scholes (1972) simulate random returns from the CAPM, and find that test results
on simulated data are consistent with those from the real data:

We have shown that much of the seeming conflict between these [empirical] results and the almost exactly
contrary predictions of the underlying economic theory may simply be artifacts of the testing procedures
used. The variable that measures the systematic covariance risk of a particular share is obtained from a
first-pass regression of the individual company returns on a market index. Hence it can be regarded at
best as an approximation to the perceived systematic risk, subject to the margin of error inevitable in any
sampling process, if to nothing else. The presence of such errors of approximation will inevitably weaken the
apparent association between mean returns and measured systematic risk in the critical second-pass tests.

   More recently, Gomes, Kogan, and Zhang (2003) and Carlson, Fisher, and Giammarino (2004)
show how size and book-to-market can dominate empirically estimated betas in cross-sectional re-
gressions on data simulated from economies with the conditional CAPM structure. Li, Livdan, and
Zhang (2009) report similar results on real investment and equity issues in cross-sectional regres-
sions. Bai, Hou, Kung, Li, and Zhang (2017) show how the CAPM can fail to explain the value
premium in an economy with rare disasters, and how measurement errors in estimated betas can
completely flatten the risk-return relation in an economy without any mispricing. These simulation
results do not mean that the CAPM is alive and well, but do suggest that beta measurement errors
might have a lot to do with the empirical difficulties of the CAPM.

   Using simulated data from a dynamic investment model as in Zhang (2005b), in which the
conditional CAPM holds by construction, Lin and Zhang (2013) show how characteristics can eas-
ily dominate covariances in predicting returns in Daniel and Titman’s (1997) two-way sorts on
covariances and characteristics. The beta estimates from 36-month rolling-window regressions are

                                                     47
averaged betas in the past three years, whereas the true betas in the model are time-varying. The
time-lag between the estimated betas and portfolio formation reduces the power of covariances to
predict returns. In addition, using latest instruments in estimating conditional betas hardly allevi-
ates the measurement errors. Because the theoretical relations between instruments and betas are
typically nonlinear, linear beta models contain large specification errors (Harvey 2001).

    Some empiricists tend to downplay theoretical results based on simulated data. It is true that
simulated data are not real data. That said, if the estimated betas from standard empirical proce-
dures differ drastically from the true betas in a controlled laboratory, what confidence should one
have in beta estimates in the real world that is vastly more complex than our laboratories?

4.3     An Efficient Markets Counterrevolution to Behavioral Finance

Asset pricing anomalies obey standard economic principles.

4.3.1    Mispricing

It is standard practice to equate anomalies to mispricing in behavioral finance.

Research in experimental psychology suggests that, in violation of Bayes’ rule, most people tend to “over-
react” to unexpected and dramatic news events. This study of market efficiency investigates whether such
behavior affects stock prices. The empirical evidence, based on CRSP monthly return data, is consistent
with the overreaction hypothesis. Substantial weak form market inefficiencies are discovered (De Bondt and
Thaler 1985, p. 793).
    Evidence presented here is consistent with a failure of stock prices to reflect fully the implications of
current earnings for future earnings.... Even more surprisingly, the signs and magnitudes of the three-day
reactions are related to the autocorrelation structure of earnings, as if stock prices fail to reflect the extent
to which each firm’s earnings series differs from a seasonal random walk (Bernard and Thomas 1990, p. 305).
     The pattern that emerges is that the underperformance is concentrated among relatively young growth
companies, especially those going public in the high-volume years of the 1980s. While this pattern does not
rule out bad luck being the cause of the underperformance, it is consistent with a scenario of firms going
public when investors are irrationally over optimistic about the future potential of certain industries which,
following Shiller (1990), I will refer to as the “fad” explanation (Ritter 1991, p. 4).
    [It] is possible that the market underreacts to information about their short-term prospects of firms but
overreacts to information about their long-term prospects. This is plausible given that the nature of the
information available about a firm’s short-term prospects, such as earnings forecasts, is different from the
nature of the more ambiguous information that is used by investors to assess a firm’s longer-term prospects
(Jegadeesh and Titman 1993, p. 90).
    Investor expectations of future growth appear to have been excessively tied to past growth despite the fact
that future growth rates are highly mean reverting. In particular, investors were systematically disappointed
(Lakonishok, Shleifer, and Vishny 1994, p. 1575).
    The results indicate that earnings performance attributable to the accrual component of earnings ex-
hibits lower persistence than earnings performance attributable to the cash flow component of earnings.
The results also indicate that stock prices act as if investors “fixate” on earnings, failing to distinguish fully


                                                       48
between the different properties of the accrual and cash flow components of earnings. Consequently, firms
with relatively high (low) levels of accruals experience negative (positive) future abnormal stock returns that
are concentrated around future earnings announcements (Sloan 1996, p. 290).
    [Managers] have an incentive to put the best possible spin on both their new opportunities as well their
overall business when their investment expenditures are especially high because of their need to raise capital
as well as to justify their expenditures. If investors fail to appreciate managements’ incentives to oversell their
firms in these situations, stock returns subsequent to an increase in investment expenditures are likely to be
negative. This effect is likely to be especially important for managers who are empire builders, and invest for
their own benefits rather than the benefits of the firm’s shareholders (Titman, Wei, and Xie 2004, p. 678).

    By the early 2000s, Barberis and Thaler (2003) describe the state of affairs as follows:

While the behavior of the aggregate stock market is not easy to understand from the rational point of view,
promising rational models have nonetheless been developed and can be tested against behavioral alternatives.
Empirical studies of the behavior of individual stocks have unearthed a set of facts which is altogether more
frustrating for the rational paradigm. Many of these facts are about the cross-section of average returns:
they document that one group of stocks earn higher average returns than another. These facts have come
to be known as “anomalies” because they cannot be explained by the simpliest and most intuitive model
of risk and return in the financial economist’s toolkit, the Capital Asset Pricing Model, or CAPM (p. 1087,
original emphasis).

    It is my professional view that the argument for inefficient markets based on the failure of the
consumption CAPM in explaining asset pricing anomalies represents, to paraphrase Shiller (1984,
p. 459), “one of the most remarkable errors in the history of economic thought.”

4.3.2    Do Psychological Biases Explain Asset Pricing Anomalies?

Shleifer (2000) and Barberis and Thaler (2003) describe behavioral finance as consisting of two
building blocks, psychological biases and limits to arbitrage. While psychological biases give rise
to anomalies, limits to arbitrage prevent arbitrageurs from eliminating the mispricing, at least in
the short run. However, recent empirical work has cast doubt on both building blocks.


Are Investors More Biased Than Managers?                        Many psychological biases have been pro-
posed. Two prominent studies are Barberis, Shleifer, and Vishny (1998) and Daniel, Hirshleifer,
and Subrahmanyam (1998). In Barberis et al., conservatism means that individuals’ beliefs are
excessively slow to change, and representative heuristics means that after a consistent history of
earnings news over several years, investors erroneously believe that the past history is represen-
tative of future earnings news. Conservatism is used to explain earnings momentum, as investors
disregard the full information content of earnings announcements, and assign disproportionately
high weights to their priors. Representative heuristics is used to explain the value premium. After




                                                        49
a consistent history of, say, positive earnings news, investors become overly optimistic about future
earnings news, and overreact, pushing the stock price to unduly high levels.

   In Daniel, Hirshleifer, and Subrahmanyam (1998), overconfidence means that investors overes-
timate the precision of, and tend to overreact to, their private information signals. Self-attribution
means that investors too strongly attribute public signals that confirm the validity of their actions
to high ability, and those that disconfirm their actions to bad luck or even sabotage. As a result,
starting with unbiased beliefs about their ability, these investors tend to view public signals as on
average confirming their prior private signals, at least in the short run. Overconfidence and self-
attribution combine to produce continuous overreaction in the short run, giving rise to momentum,
and the correction of the mispricing in the long run, giving rise to the value premium.

   On the other hand, the body of evidence reviewed in this essay suggests that managers of indi-
vidual firms seem to do a good job in aligning investment policies with their costs of capital, and this
assignment drives many cross-sectional patterns that are anomalous in the consumption CAPM. If
investors are psychologically biased, why would the managers of publicly traded companies be less
biased? After all, investors and managers are from the same population. The recent intermediary
asset pricing literature suggests that marginal investors tend to be sophisticated institutional in-
vestors in the financial services industry. Why would the managers of financial firms be more biased
than the managers of nonfinancial firms? Other than institutional investors, why would individual
investors exhibit a variety of biases while at home making portfolio choice decisions, but switch
them off readily while at work making real investment decisions?

   A more plausible explanation for the simultaneous failure of the consumption CAPM and
the relative success of the investment CAPM, I believe, is aggregation (Section 4.2.2).            The
investment CAPM goes straight to the individual behavior, but the consumption CAPM works via
a representative investor, which, according to the Sonnenschein-Mantel-Debreu theorem, does not
really exist, and even if it does, is almost entirely detached from individual rationality. The recent
U.S. presidential election offers a case in point. Given its extremely contentious and divisive nature,
it would be exceedingly challenging, albeit not inconceivable, to assign a rational set of preferences
to “the representative voter” who elected Donald Trump right after electing Barack Obama. By the
same token, without addressing the aggregate problem, at least to some extent, imposing irrational
preferences directly on the fictitious representative investor as in Barberis, Shleifer, and Vishny
(1998) and Daniel, Hirshleifer, and Subramanyam (1998) is unlikely to be particularly illuminating.

                                                  50
Are U.S. Investors More Biased Than Chinese Investors?                 As noted, Titman, Wei, and
Xie (2013) and Watanabe, Xu, Yao, and Yu (2013) document that the investment effect is stronger
in developed countries than in developing countries. In particular, Titman et al.’s Table 3 reports
that the equal-weighted size-adjusted return of the high-minus-low investment quintile is −0.35%
per month (t = −6.04) averaged across developed countries, in contrast to −0.17% (t = −1.06)
averaged across developing countries. Similar evidence has been reported for price momentum.
Griffin, Ji, and Martin (2003, Table 1) report that momentum profits are on average 0.51% per
month (t = 3.09) in developed markets, in contrast to 0.27% (t = 1.21) in emerging markets. Table
5, adapted from Chui, Titman, and Wei (2010), shows that momentum profits are on average 0.86%
in developed markets, in contrast to 0.49% in emerging markets. Out of 21 developed markets,
19 show significant momentum at the 5% level, whereas only six out of 20 emerging markets show
significant momentum. In particular, momentum profits are 0.79% (t = 3.44) in the U.S., but
0.26% (t = 0.92) in China. Momentum is a stronghold of behavioral finance. Unless investors in
developed markets such as U.S. can be argued as more psychologically biased than investors in
emerging markets such as China, the evidence seems an emphatic rejection of behavioral finance.

   The evidence is more consistent with the investment CAPM. The crux is that whereas behavioral
finance rides on dysfunctional, inefficient markets, the investment CAPM relies on well functioning,
efficient markets for its mechanisms to work. As such, behavioral finance predicts that anomalies
should be stronger in emerging markets, in which investors are less sophisticated, but weaker in
developed markets, in which investors are more sophisticated. In contrast, the investment CAPM
predicts that anomalies should be stronger in developed markets, such as the U.S., in which the in-
centives of managers and shareholders are more aligned, and managers are more likely to maximize
the market equity in making investment decisions. Also, anomalies should be weaker in emerging
markets, such as China, in which managers are often appointed by the government, and more likely
to pursue social objectives such as maximizing employment, rather than the market value of equity.


Limits to Limits to Arbitrage? As noted, Shleifer and Vishny (1997) argue that trading fric-
tions make arbitrage activities costly and incomplete, allowing mispricing to persist. Because limits
to arbitrage are more severe in emerging markets than in developed markets, anomalies should be
stronger in emerging markets. This prediction contradicts Table 5 and the related evidence.

Measurement Ahead of Theory?                Koopmans (1947) emphasizes an artful combination of the-
ory, econometrics, and measurement in scientific work:

[In] research in economic dynamics the Kepler stage and the Newton stage of inquiry need to be more in-
timately combined and to be pursued simultaneously. Fuller utilization of the concepts and hypotheses of
economic theory ... as a part of the processes of observation and measurement promises to be a shorter road,
perhaps even the only possible road, to the understanding of cyclical fluctuations (p. 162, original emphasis).

    The historical rise of behavioral finance has been fueled by the discoveries of anomalies. Despite
enormous empirical contributions in the anomalies literature, what is missing, it seems, is a coherent
behavioral asset pricing framework. Also, behavioral models have not been subject to the rigorous
structural econometric tests similar to those imposed on the consumption CAPM and the invest-
ment CAPM. While these tests reveal unreasonable parameter estimates and parameter instability,
not going through these tests might have obscured similar problems in behavioral models.

4.3.3    The Joint-Hypothesis Problem Revisited

Fama (1970, 1991, 1998) and Fama and French (1993, 1996) defend efficient markets. With the
investment CAPM, I drastically modify, but ultimately strengthen their arguments.

    Fama’s (1970) definition of efficient markets needs no modification almost half a century later:

The assumptions that the conditions of market equilibrium can be stated in terms of expected returns and
that equilibrium expected returns are formed on the basis of (and thus “fully reflect”) the information set Φt
have a major empirical implication—they rule out the possibility of trading systems based only on information
in Φt that have expected profits or returns in excess of equilibrium expected profits or returns. Thus, let

                                         xjt+1 = pjt+1 − E[pjt+1 |Φt ].                                    (35)

Then
                                               E[xjt+1 |Φt ] = 0                                           (36)
which, by definition, says that the sequence {xjt } is a “fair game” with respect to the information sequence
{Φt }. Or, equivalently, let
                                         zjt+1 = rjt+1 − E[rjt+1 |Φt ],                                  (37)
then
                                               E[zjt+1 |Φt ] = 0,                                          (38)
so that the sequence {zjt } is also a “fair game” with respect to the information sequence {Φt } (p. 384–385,
original emphasis).

    Twenty years after Fama (1970), with anomalies all the rage, Fama (1991) brings the joint-
hypothesis problem to the front and center of asset pricing research:

Ambiguity about information and trading costs is not, however, the main obstacle to inferences about market
efficiency. The joint-hypothesis problem is more serious. Thus, market efficiency per se is not testable. It
must be tested jointly with some model of equilibrium, an asset-pricing model. This point ... says that we can
only test whether information is properly reflected in prices in the context of a pricing model that defines the
meaning of “properly.” As a result, when we find anomalous evidence on the behavior of returns, the way it
should be split between market inefficiency or a bad model of market equilibrium is ambiguous (p. 1575–1576).

Fama (1998) reiterates the joint-hypothesis problem, and shows that some anomalies disappear in
the three-factor model. However, the three-factor model leaves many anomalies unexplained. The
q-factor model is a direct attempt at alleviating the joint-hypothesis problem. It represents a major
step forward from the three-factor model, as evidenced in the response in Fama and French (2015).


A Tribute to Fama and French (1993)                 The Fama-French three-factor model has served its
historical purpose, rather admirably. After the CAPM is firmly rejected and abandoned in Fama
and French (1992), the three-factor model fills the vacuum left by the CAPM as the workhorse
model, and takes on the burden of defending efficient markets. The mainstream asset pricing
theory is of little help, as the consumption CAPM often underperforms the CAPM.


                                                      53
    Alas, the largely empirical nature of the three-factor model leaves it vulnerable to the data min-
ing critique. The conjecture of the book-to-market factor as a relative distress factor in Fama and
French (1996) is also rejected by the distress anomaly, which shows that more distressed firms earn
lower average returns than less distressed firms (Dichev 1998). More generally, the interpretation
of characteristics-based factors as sources of risk in the intertemporal CAPM or arbitrage pricing
theory has fallen on deaf ears. Both theories are silent about the identities of state variables, and
neither make the conceptual leap of linking expected returns to firm characteristics.


Interpreting Factors: The Investment CAPM Perspective                           Fama and French (1996) in-
terpret their three-factor model as a risk factor model:

[If] assets are priced rationally, variables that are related to average returns, such as size and book-to-market
equity, must proxy for sensitivity to common (shared and thus undiversifiable) risk factors in returns. The
time-series regressions give direct evidence on this issue. In particular, the slopes and R2 values show whether
mimicking portfolios for risk factors related to size and [book-to-market] capture shared variation in stock
and bond returns not explained by other factors (p. 4–5).
[The] empirical successes of [the three-factor model] suggest that it is an equilibrium pricing model, a three-
factor version of Merton’s (1973) intertemporal CAPM (ICAPM) or Ross’s (1976) arbitrage pricing theory
(APT). In this view, SMB and HML mimic combinations of two underlying risk factors or state variables of
special hedging concern to investors (p. 57).

    This interpretation has been controversial. Daniel and Titman (1997) show that expected re-
turns do not correlate positively with factor loadings after controlling for characteristics:

In equilibrium asset pricing models the covariance structure of returns determines expected returns. Yet we
find that variables that reliably predict the future covariance structure do not predict future returns. Our
results indicate that high book-to-market stocks and stocks with low capitalizations have high average re-
turns whether or not they have the return patterns (i.e., covariances) of other small and high book-to-market
stocks (p. 4).

This evidence has often been interpreted as suggesting mispricing in behavioral finance:

One general feature of the rational approach is that it is loadings or betas, and not firm characteristics, that
determine average returns.... [Daniel and Titman’s (1997)] results appear quite damaging to the rational
approach (Barberis and Thaler 2003, p. 1091).
[It] is important to empirically distinguish (1) the covariance between stock returns and a given attribute
from (2) the returns attributable to the characteristic. Finding evidence in support of (1) is consistent with
a risk based explanation for the return relation, whereas finding (2) would suggest mispricing (Richardson,
Tuna, and Wysocki 2010, p. 430).

    From the investment CAPM perspective, I interpret characteristics-based factor models as linear
approximations of the investment CAPM in equation (7). As a more fundamental departure from
Fama and French (1993, 1996), I interpret the q-factor model as just a parsimonious description of


                                                       54
the cross section, not necessarily a risk factor model, and the q-factor loadings as just regression
slopes, not necessarily measures of some inexplicable sources of risk. Fama and French go for the risk
interpretation, probably thinking that it is the only way to defend efficient markets, but this step is
not necessary either. The investment CAPM predicts all kinds of relations between characteristics
and expected returns, without any trace of mispricing. And as noted, the evidence of characteristics
dominating covariances in Daniel and Titman (1997) can be largely attributed to measurement
errors in covariances (Lin and Zhang 2013). Finally, the failure of the consumption CAPM can be
largely attributed to the aggregation problem (as well as measurement errors in consumption data).

    Time series and cross-sectional regressions are just two different ways of summarizing empirical
correlations, and are largely equivalent in economic terms. If a characteristic shows up significant
in cross-sectional regressions, its factor mimicking portfolio is likely to show “explanatory” power
in factor regressions. If a factor earns a significant average return in the time series, the slope of
its underlying characteristic is likely to be significant in cross-sectional regressions. Factor loadings
are no more primitive than characteristics, and vice versa, in “explaining” expected returns.


Beyond the “Risk Doctrine”               More generally, the investment CAPM broadens efficient mar-
kets beyond the “risk doctrine.” An early statement of the doctrine is in Fama (1970):

Most of the available work is based only on the assumption that the conditions of market equilibrium can
(somehow) be stated in terms of expected returns. In general terms, like the two parameter model such theo-
ries would posit that conditional on some relevant information set, the equilibrium expected return on a secu-
rity is a function of its “risk.” And different theories would differ primarily in how “risk” is defined (p. 384).

The anomalies literature puts efficient markets in peril because of the failure of traditional risk
models. The investment CAPM shows that the peril is more apparent than real.

    The risk doctrine asks what risks “explain” asset pricing anomalies. This question has been at
the center of modern asset pricing research. The investment CAPM questions the question (Lin and
Zhang 2013). As shown in Section 1, the consumption CAPM and the investment CAPM are the
two sides of the same coin in general equilibrium, delivering identical expected returns. However,
the risk doctrine only describes the consumption CAPM, which predicts that consumption risks
are sufficient statistics for expected returns, and after risks are controlled for, characteristics should
not matter. It is clear that the risk doctrine is conceptually incomplete. It does not apply to the
investment CAPM, which predicts that characteristics are sufficient statistics for expected returns,
and after characteristics are controlled for, risks should not matter.


                                                       55
    In general equilibrium, risks, expected returns, and characteristics are all endogenously de-
termined simultaneously. Neither risks nor characteristics “determine” expected returns. The
investment CAPM is as fundamental as the consumption CAPM in economy theory. The concept
that risks determine expected returns is a relic and an illusion from the CAPM, because its inven-
tors happen to take stock returns and their covariances as exogenous. Risks are no more exogenous
than investment and profitability in theory, and should not be put on a pedestal in applied work.

    The risk doctrine is also impractical. Without addressing the aggregation critique, the con-
sumption CAPM is not testable. After almost 50 years of the anomalies literature since Ball and
Brown (1968), it is perhaps time to heed the advice from Kuhn (1962):

[The] really pressing problems, e.g., a cure for cancer and the design of a lasting peace, are often not puzzles
at all, largely because they may not have any solution. Consider the jigsaw puzzle whose pieces are selected at
random from each of two different puzzle boxes. Since that problem is likely to defy (though it might not) even
the most ingenious of men, it cannot serve as a test of skill. In solution in any usual sense, it is not a puzzle
at all. Though intrinsic value is no criterion for a puzzle, the assured existence of a solution is (p. 36–37).


5    Challenges for Future Work

In this article I have attempted to articulate the broad, and hopefully internally consistent, per-
spective of the investment CAPM for asset pricing. This perspective is quite different from the
perspective of the consumption CAPM and that of behavioral finance. My message is a simple one:
Like any other prices in microeconomic theory, asset prices are determined jointly by supply and
demand in general equilibrium. As such, the consumption CAPM and behavioral finance, both of
which are demand-based, cannot possibly be the whole story. At the core, the investment CAPM
is tantamount to the net present value rule in corporate finance, which should not be controversial.
Explaining asset pricing anomalies requires a fundamental change in perspective.

    I have reviewed two workhorse models in this rapidly expanding literature, the q-factor model
for estimating expected stock returns and the multiperiod investment CAPM for structural esti-
mation and tests. The q-factor model of Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2015) achieves the important goal
of dimension reduction in the anomalies literature in the spirit of what Fama and French (1996)
did 20 years ago. The structural investment CAPM of Liu, Whited, and Zhang (2009) takes the
first principle of real investment to cross-sectional returns data in the spirit of what Hansen and
Singleton (1982) did with the consumption CAPM 35 years ago.

    I have also attempted to put the investment CAPM into the historical perspective. I have traced


                                                       56
the origin of the investment CAPM to at least Fisher (1930), who provided a symmetric treatment
of the impatience and investment opportunity theories of the equilibrium interest rate. Despite
the important writings in Hirshleifer (1958, 1970), Modigliani and Miller (1958), and Cochrane
(1991), modern asset pricing is thoroughly dominated by the consumption CAPM. A long list of
foundational contributions, including Markowitz (1952), Sharpe (1964), Lintner (1965), Merton
(1973), Rubinstein (1976), Lucas (1978), and Breeden (1979), has put investors at the center of
inquiry, while abstracting from managers altogether. This abstraction is unjustifiable, ultimately,
because asset prices are equilibrated by both demand and supply. Fixing the supply of assets in one’s
model to focus on the demand does not mean that the supply is not important in real life. On the
contrary, the abstraction is disastrous, empirically, because the aggregation critique means that the
consumption CAPM is ill-equipped for anomalies. The investment CAPM, which is derived from the
first principle of investment for individual firms, is largely immune to the aggregation problem. In
the data, anomalies in the consumption CAPM turn out to be regularities in the investment CAPM.

   The investment CAPM literature is young, with many exciting new opportunties for future
work. Are the investment and profitability premiums reliable? While the ubiquitous data mining
concern is hard to address completely, an effective antidote is to study global financial data. Do
these premiums exist in countries outside the U.S.? Does the q-factor model absorb the explanatory
power of the Carhart (1997) four-factor model in global data as in the U.S. data?

   The investment CAPM has provided economic explanations to most anomalies that have been
attributed to behavioral finance. It has become important to disentangle the investment-based from
behavioral explanations. The key identification is that behavioral finance relies on dysfunctional,
inefficient markets for its mechanisms to work, but the investment CAPM relies on well functioning,
efficient markets. As noted, in global data, both the investment and momentum effects are stronger
in developed markets than in emerging markets. Do similar cross-country patterns also hold for
other important cross-sectional patterns, such as the value and profitability premiums?

   Asset management is a vast and important field (see Fischer and Wermers 2012 and Ang 2014
for reviews). Can the q-factor model help improve the measurement of mutual fund performance?
The Carhart (1997) four-factor model is the current workhorse model in this area. In view of the
superior performance of the q-factor model over the Carhart model, it seems natural to apply the
q-factor model in this area. Xue (2014) takes a first step in this direction.

   A significant portion of the return spreads from anomaly-based strategies occurs over a few

                                                 57
days surrounding earnings announcement dates (see Jegadeesh and Titman 1993 for momentum
and La Porta, Lakonishok, Shleifer, and Vishy 1997 for the value premium). Because the con-
sumption CAPM has nothing to say about ex-post returns, this evidence has often been cited as
indicating investors’ expectational errors. However, the investment CAPM applies ex-ante as well
as ex-post, and consequently, does predict that a portion of anomalies should occur around earnings
announcements. Is there any way to disentangle these two competing explanations empirically?

   Asness, Moskowitz, and Pedersen (2013) show that value and momentum are pervasive inter-
nationally across different asset classes, including individual stocks, country equity index futures,
government bonds, currencies, and commodity futures. To what extent can the q-factor model be
applied to these alternative assets? While it seems straightforward to apply the q-factor model
to global stocks, country equity indices, corporate bonds, and even real estate assets, other asset
classes such as currencies, government bonds, and commodities require additional theorizing. In
the context of real estate investment trusts, Bond and Xue (2015) measure investment as property
acquisition and profitability as property income and price appreciation, and show that the two
economic fundamentals have substantial predictive power for real estate returns.

   While the investment CAPM is immune to the aggregation critique in theory, its current struc-
tural estimation, which is done at the portfolio level, is not. To be free of any aggregation bias,
the structural estimation should be done at the firm level. This step requires additional method-
ological innovations on handling unbalanced panel data. Can the firm-level estimation address the
parameter instability issue across different testing portfolios? Or equivalently, can the firm-level es-
timation account for value and momentum simultaneously in a single structural investment CAPM
specification? What about the investment and profitability premiums simultaneously?

   How can the supply approach to valuation in Belo, Xue, and Zhang (2013) be applied to
individual firms? Their valuation framework can be extended to incorporate additional productive
inputs such as labor and intangible assets. Their econometric framework can also be used to quantify
the valuation impact of corporate finance frictions, such as the agency conflicts between shareholders
and managers. More generally, what is the impact of time-varying and cross-sectionally varying
expected returns on corporate investment, financing, and payout policies, and vice versa? The
dynamic corporate finance literature has mostly worked with risk neutrality (Hennessy and Whited
2005). Integrating this prominent literature with the investment CAPM literature seems fruitful.

   The investment CAPM provides a neoclassical foundation for Graham and Dodd’s (1934) se-

                                                  58
curity analysis. Ou and Penman (1989) describe the traditional view as follows:

Firms’ (‘fundamental’) values are indicated by information in financial statements. Stock prices deviate
at times from these values and only slowly gravitate towards the fundamental values. Thus, analysis of
published financial statements can discover values that are not reflected in stock prices. Rather than taking
prices as value benchmarks, ‘intrinsic values’ discovered from financial statements serve as benchmarks with
which prices are compared to identify overpriced and underpriced stocks. Because deviant prices ultimately
gravitate to the fundamentals, investment strategies which produce ‘abnormal returns’ can be discovered by
the comparison of prices to these fundamental values (p. 296).

When discussing “abnormal returns,” the traditional view seems to use a cross-sectionally constant
discount rate as the null in efficient markets. The investment CAPM changes the big picture, by
showing cross-sectionally varying expected returns from the first principle of real investment. Much
remains to be done to integrate the investment CAPM with capital markets research in accounting.
