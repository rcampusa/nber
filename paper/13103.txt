                                               ABSTRACT

Based on a survey that we designed and that covers a stratified random sample of 12,400 firms in 120
cities in China with firm-level accounting information for 2002-2004, this paper examines the presence
of systematic distortions in capital allocation that result in uneven marginal returns to capital across
firm ownership, regions, and sectors. It provides a systematic comparison of investment efficiency
among wholly and partially state-owned, wholly and partially foreign-owned, and domestic privately
owned firms, conditioning on their sector, location, and size characteristics. It finds that even after
a quarter-of-century of reforms, state-owned firms still have significantly lower returns to capital,
on average, than domestic private or foreign-owned firms. Similarly, certain regions and sectors have
consistently lower returns to capital than other regions and sectors. By our calculation, if China succeeds
in allocating its capital more efficiently, it could reduce its capital stock by 8 percent without sacrificing
its economic growth (and hence could raise its household consumption and deliver a faster improvement
to its citizens' living standard).

                                     I.     INTRODUCTION

The breakneck growth rate of the Chinese economy is in large part driven by capital
accumulation (and exports). The country’s investment to GDP ratio at 40 percent in 2005
(even after the denominator was revised up by 16.8 percent by the government) is high
compared with the world average, and even higher than most other East Asian countries
which are also known for relying on capital accumulation for their growth. How efficient is
the Chinese investment? Is it systematically related to its unfinished reforms in which state-
owned firms continue to suck in a sizable chunk of new investment? The purpose of the
paper is to assess the efficiency of capital allocation in China, including whether the country
has succeeded in removing the bias in favor of state-owned firms after nearly three decades
of economic reforms.

We do so by using data from a firm survey that we carried out. One problem of usual official
firm surveys is that ownership classification tends to rely on firm registration. Yet, many
firms’ ownership may have evolved faster than what is recorded on the registration. We
designed a survey of firms in China in early 2005 and carried it out during July-November,
2005. It covered 12,400 firms in 120 cities located all across China. We asked the firms to
report actual breakdown of ownership (private, state, etc), and found that about 15 percent of
the firms in the sample (169 out of 1122) that were still registered as state-owned had already
become fully privately owned according to the actual breakdown of ownership. This suggests
that it is important to reclassify ownership based on actual ownership information rather than
the firm label at the time of its registration.

Our paper is related to the literature on the role of financial sector in China’s growth. Allen,
Qian and Qian (2005) suggest that the high rates of GDP growth must imply that the informal
financial sector has sufficiently made up for the shortcomings of the formal financial system
dominated by state-owned banks. Boyreau-Debray and Wei (2005), on the hand, provide
evidence that capital mobility is low across Chinese regions, and households’ ability to
engage in consumption risk sharing is also low in the 1990s. Hsieh and Klenow (2006)
provide evidence of unequal returns to capital across firms within the same sector in China
and India, but do not investigate systematic allocative efficiency across ownership or
locations. Bai, Hsieh, and Qian (2006) provided estimates of returns to capital using
aggregate data. Dobson and Kashyap (2007) discussed the problems associated with China’s
gradualist strategy in reforming its banks.

As a preview of the main findings, we will report strong evidence that state-owned firms
have lower (marginal and average) returns to capital than either domestic private or foreign
firms. In addition, there is also systematic dispersion in the returns to capital across locations
and sectors. Based on these econometric estimates, we calculate that China could drastically
reduce its investment-to-GDP ratio and raise its consumption without sacrificing its growth
rate by improving the returns to capital on the stock of capital currently employed by state-
owned firms.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes a simple model that helps to
interpret the subsequent econometric estimates. Section 3 is the meat of the empirical
                                                3


analysis. It starts by describing the survey from which we extract the data for the analysis,
and then provides a sequence of estimations and analyses. Section 4 concludes.

                                II. CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

In this section, we use a simple model to generate a prediction on the relationship between
observed returns to capital (or labor), and distortions on capital, labor, and output. It also
motivates the econometric specifications that we will employ in the subsequent analysis.

Firm’s Problem

Consider a representative firm j in sector s that is a price-taker in both output and input
markets. Let πj, yj, Kj and Lj be firm j’s profit, output, capital usage, and labor usage
respectively. Firm j aims to maximize its profit:

               Max πj = pj Yj - rj Kj - wj Lj                                                  (1)

where pj, rj, and wj denote the output price, gross interest (rental cost of capital), and wage
rate faced by firm j, respectively. The firm subscript is used to stress the point that distortions
in the output and factor market could be firm specific (or at least ownership specific) and
make the firm’s effective output price and input costs deviate from the market prices. We
suppress sector subscript for simplicity. Specifically, let

               pj = p (1-djY)                                                                  (2)

               rj = r (1+djK)                                                                  (3)

               wj = w (1+djL)                                                                  (4)

Where p, r, and w are the output price, rental cost of capital and wage rate common to all
firms in the same sector and location. djY summarizes all output distortions the firm faces,
expressed in the form of a tax that it proportion to its output. djK summarizes all distortions
on the cost of capital. For example, if private firms face systematic discrimination by local
banks, or face greater hurdle in getting listed in local stock markets, that could be represented
by a high (and positive) djK for them. As another example, if state-owned firms receive
subsidized credit, then their djK would be negative. djL represents all distortions on the cost of
labor. For example, if a firm is not allowed to freely dismiss workers, then its djL would be
high.

On the production function side, we assume that all differences across firms in the same
sector occur at the TFP level only:

               Yj = Aj f(Kj , Lj)                                                              (5)

Where Aj represents firm-specific total factor productivity. For simplicity, we assume f(., .)
takes a Cobb-Douglas functional form:
                                             4


               f(Kj , Lj) = Kjα Lj1-α                                                      (6)

Where α denotes the capital share in output and is the same for all firms in the same industry.
The first order conditions of the profit maximization problem yield the familiar conditions
that the marginal revenue product of capital (MRPK) and marginal revenue product of labor
(MRPL) should be equal to (firm-specific) interest rate and wage rate:

               MRPKj ≡ pj Aj f’K(Kj , Lj) = rj                                             (7)

               MRPLj ≡ pj Aj f’L(Kj , Lj) = wj                                             (8)

By the virtue of the Cobb-Douglas production function, marginal revenue products of capital
(MRPK) and labor (MRPL) are also proportional to their average revenue product
counterparts:

               ARPKj ≡ pjYj /Kj = (1/α) MRPKj                                              (9)

               ARPLj ≡ pjYj /Lj = [1/(1-α)] MRPLj                                         (10)

Researcher’s Problem

As not all distortions faced by the firm are observable by an economic researcher, we cannot
measure average and marginal revenue products directly. Instead, our observed average
revenue product of capital, denoted by ARPKjo, is given by,

               ARPKjo ≡ pYj /Kj                                                           (11)

Making use of (2), (3), (7), and (9), together with (11), we have

               ARPKjo = pjYj /[(1-djY)Kj] = ARPKj /(1-djY) = [r (1+djK)] / [α (1-djY)]    (12)

A log approximation of (12) gives a convenient linear expression:

               ln ARPKjo ≈ ln(r/α) + djK + djY                                            (13)

This indicates that the deviation of log observed average revenue product of capital from the
common component in any sector, ln(r/α), reflects a combination of firm-specific distortions
on capital cost and output.

The relationship between the observed average revenue product of labor and the distortions
can be derived similarly:

               ARPLjo ≡ pYj /Lj = ARPLj /(1-djY) = [w (1+djL)] / [(1-α) (1-djY)]          (14)

and
                                                    5


                   ln ARPLjo ≈ ln[w/(1-α)] + djL + djY                                     (15)

The dispersion of the log observed average revenue product of labor across firms within a
sector reflects a dispersion in the combined labor and output distortions. From equations (13)
and (15), it is clear that output distortion affects both ARPKjo and ARPLjo. On the other
hand, capital (labor) distortion only affects ARPKjo (ARPLjo).

So far, we have assumed that the firm is a price-taker in both the output and input markets.
Suppose we let the firm produce a differentiated product, and face a downward-sloping
demand curve as described by

                   Yjd = Ys {pj /[(1-djY)Ps}-σ                                             (16)

where Ys and Ps are the aggregated demand for output in sector s and the aggregated price
index for sector s, respectively, and σ is the elasticity of substitution between different
varieties in sector s2. As a reminder, all firm-specific variables also can have a sector s
subscript but omitted for simplicity.

Since the firm’s profit equation is no longer homogeneous of degree one in capital and labor,
the optimal levels of capital and labor can be worked out. However, for our purpose, we note
that there are still relationship similar to equations (13) and (15) between ARPKjo or ARPLjo
and the various distortions. The only changes are the two constant terms. More precisely,
with a differentiated product framework, we would have

                   ln ARPKjo ≈ ln (r/α) + 1/σ + djK + djY                                 (13)’

and

                   ln ARPLjo ≈ ln[w/(1-α)] + 1/σ + djL + djY                              (15)’

Econometric Specifications

When we turn to the data, we are especially interested in finding out how the output, capital
and labor distortions vary by firm ownership types, conditioning on sector and location
characteristics of the firms. We will classify all firms into several ownership types, and create
a set of dummies for them. In the subsequent empirical investigation, we will implement the
following panel regressions (for which time-subscripts are added where appropriate):

           ln ARPKj,to = ∑ βi ownershipi,j + ∑ year-dummies + ∑ sector-dummies
                                                                                           (17)
                            + ∑ location -dummies + other controls + errorj,t

                                             6


For a given firm j, at most one ownership dummy would take the value of one, and all others
would take the value of zero. In the case of a domestic private firm (the benchmark case), all
seven ownership dummies take the value of zero. With this specification, the coefficient βi
should be interpreted as measuring the capital and output distortions for ownership type i
relative to those for domestic private firms, holding sector, location, year, and other firm
characteristics constant. For example, if wholly state owned firms receive subsidized loans
but private firms do not, or if private firms face more hurdles in obtaining a bank loan than
state firms, or a combination of the two, then the βi coefficient for wholly state ownership
should take a negative value in the econometric estimation.

We implement a comparable specification for the observed average revenue product of labor:

       ln ARPLj,to = ∑ γi ownershipi,j + ∑ year-dummies + ∑ sector-dummies
                                                                                         (18)
                       + ∑ location -dummies + other controls + errorj,t

                                          III. DATA

The survey was conducted during July-November, 2005. It covers 12,400 firms in 120 cities,
located in all provinces, autonomous regions, and directly administrated cities, with the
exception of Tibet. In each city, a random sample of firms stratified along sector and size
(sales) was chosen. The local sample size was 200 firms each in Beijing, Chongqin,
Shanghai, and Tianjin (four “super cities” or central government directly administrated
cities), and 100 firms each in the rest of cities.

We make use of two parts of the survey. The first is three-year (2002-2004) accounting data
on sales, material, capital and labor, filled out by chief account and head of human resources.
The second part is information on the general business environment faced by the firm filled
out by the chief executive of the firm. The survey was pilot tested by World Bank staff with
firms in Beijing before it was rolled out nationwide. In September and November 2005, we
also visited some of the data points in our sample—three firms in the north and three more in
the south, interviewing the chief executive officers and the chief financial offers of these
firms. At each of the firms, we went through a selection of the survey questions, and checked
if the respondents understood the questions in the way we intended. In the process, we
discovered that some firms made careless mistakes in recording their information for some
survey questions, though a majority of the questions appear to be correctly answered. This
suggests the usefulness of applying some filters to exclude possible outliers in the subsequent
estimation.

Definitions of Ownership

As we will investigate possible allocative inefficiency across firm ownership, especially
possible preferential access to financing by state firms and policy-induced liquidity constraint
faced by private firms, we need to have a reliable way to define firm ownership. One
complication is that, due to rapid changes in the economy, there can be serious mis-matches
between firms’ actual and notional (registered) ownership. Our survey asks for firm
                                              7


ownership with two different questions. First, it asks (in the section to be filled out by firm
chief executives) the ownership type according to the current firm registration form. Second,
it asks the firm (in the section to be filled out by chief financial officers and heads of human
resources) to break down ownership shares by owners’ types (state, collective, legal person,
private individual, and foreign investors).

It is clear from the responses that the actual ownership does not always correspond to the
ownership type on a firm’s business registration. For example, 169 firms that are registered
as state-owned firms (out of a total of 1122) and 208 firms that are registered as collectives
(out of 869) are already wholly owned by domestic private capital by the time the survey
took place. For our analysis, we classify all firms into eight mutually exclusive ownership
types based on the actual ownership information. The ownership types are defined in the
following way:

       (a) Wholly state-owned if state share = 100 percent;
       (b) Majority state-owned if 50 percent ≤ state share < 100 percent;
       (c) Minority state-owned 0 < state share < 50 percent;
       (d) Wholly foreign-owned if foreign share = 100 percent;
       (e) Majority foreign-owned if 50 percent ≤ foreign share < 100 percent (and no state
           shares);
       (f) Minority foreign-owned if 0 < foreign share < 50 percent (and no state shares);
       (g) Collectively owned if registered as a collective, still with collective share > 50
           percent;
       (h) Domestic privately owned = all the rest.

Note that our category of “domestic privately owned firms” is relatively broad, capturing not
just de nova private firms, privatized formerly state or collectively owned firms. It also
captures some of the so-called “round-tripping” foreign direct investment, namely firms that
are registered as foreign invested firms (including those from Hong Kong, Macao and
Taiwan) but that the chief financial officers know are actually owned by domestic private
investors. In addition, some of the firms in this category could include state shares (but
reported as legal person shares). The last possibility can reduce the estimated difference in
returns to capital between partially state-owned and private firms.

Out of the 12,400 firms in the survey, three are registered as majority privately-owned but
are reported to have a state share in excess of 50 percent. Under the assumption that it is
unlikely for the country to have nationalized formerly privately owned firms during this
period, we choose to exclude them from our analysis.

Variable Definitions

The key variables to be explained are the observed average returns to capital and labor
(ARPKjo and ARPLjo). For each firm in a given year, we define value added, VAj,t, as

                VAj,t = value of outputj,t – value of raw materialj,t                      (19)
                                              8



Then, the observed average revenue product of capital is simply the ratio of value added to
capital:

               ARPKj,to = VAj,t / Kj, t                                                      (20)

Similarly, the observed average revenue product of labor is value added divided by total
labor,

               ARPLj,to = VAj,t / Lj, t                                                      (21)

Filtering Out Data Entry Errors and Extreme Values

The raw data may contain recording errors by the respondents at the firm level or data entry
errors by the staff of local statistical bureaus that are not captured by their checks or those of
the national bureau. In addition, missing values for certain variables (e.g., firm revenue)
would render it impossible to compute the variables of interest. Therefore, we devise a
number of filtering rules to minimize the influence of outliers and to exclude observations
with missing key information.

We filter out firm-years in which (a) either the firm revenue or the value of intermediate
inputs is missing; (b) the annual growth rate of either the value of intermediate inputs, value
added, or the ratio of value added to the value of intermediate inputs exceeds 500 percent in
absolute value.

For regressions involving ARPKj,to, we further exclude observations for which (c) the annual
growth rate of capital in absolute value exceeds 500 percent, and (d) measured ARPKj,to
exceeds 1,000 percent in absolute value. For regressions involving ARPLj,to, we further
exclude observations for which (e) the annual growth rate of labor in absolute value exceeds
500 percent, and (f) measured ARPLj,to exceeds 600,000 yuans (about US$75,000) in
absolute value. As a robustness check, we increase the threshold in (b), (c) and (e) from 500
percent to 1,000 percent, and the threshold in (d) from 1,000 percent to 10,000 percent. The
changes do not change the qualitative results of the analysis.

These rules are designed to filter out extreme outliers. The remaining sample could still
contain recording errors. So when we turn to regressions, we will also employ an additional
robustness check by trimming out certain percentage of the smallest and the largest values for
each ownership type.

                                  IV. STATISTICAL RESULTS

We start with some raw, or unconditional returns to capital across different ownership types.
We then move to account for the influence of sectors and locations on the returns to capital
using a regression framework.

Different Sources of Financing Across Ownership

It is commonly noted that private firms have a harder time than state-owned firms to obtain
financing from local banks in China. An Enterprise Survey conducted by the International
Finance Corporation, a part of the World Bank Group, supplies evidence consistent with this
notion. The IFC survey measures the perceptions of business managers and other senior staff
about the main obstacles faced by their company in a number of countries3. The China
portion of the survey, conducted in 2002 and 2003, comprises a sample of 3948 registered
businesses. Two questions are particularly useful for our purpose: one asks firms to report a
breakdown of the sources of financing for their working capital, and the other asks for a
breakdown of the sources of financing for investment.

Table 2 lists the sources of financing for working capital as reported by firms of various
ownership. While domestic private firms report to derive 22 percent of their working capital
from Chinese banks, state-owned firms are 50 percent more likely to rely on local banks,
deriving 36-38 percent of their working capital from them. In contrast, family and friends are
an important source (8 percent) of working capital for private firms but not at all for state-
owned firms.

Table 3 tabulates the sources of financing for investment. The same basic patterns emerge. In
particular, state-owned firms are much more likely to rely on domestic banks for financing
than private firms (or foreign firms), though the magnitude of the difference is moderately
smaller than for working capital. Private firms continue to rely on family and friends (8.7
percent) for investment financing while state-owned firms do not.

The Chinese security regulatory agency also favors state-owned firms over private firms in
its approval of initial public listings; this is reflected in the overwhelming share of listed
companies that are majority state-owned. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that state-
owned firms have relatively easy access to the formal financial system in China. Indeed, this
is well known in the literature. However, how much difference in the cost of capital this
actually translates into is not known. The rest of the paper aims to fill this void.

Dispersion in Returns to Capital Across Firm Ownership: Summary Statistics

Table 4 reports the summary statistics on the ratio of value added (VA) to capital stock by
firm ownership. The mean average revenue product of capital is 99 percent for wholly state-
owned firms, and 151 percent for private firms. In other words, the average return to capital
is more than 50 percentage points higher for private firms than for wholly-state owned firms.
In fact, foreign-owned and domestic private owned firms have comparably high average
returns to capital (148-158 percent). Interestingly, the average returns decline progressively
from foreign or domestic private owned firms, to minority state-owned (133 percent),
majority state-owned (124 percent), and wholly state-owned firms (99 percent). This
suggests that state ownership is systematically associated with lower returns to capital. On

the other hand, collectively owned firms appear to have high returns to capital (172 percent),
perhaps resulting from as severe discrimination in access to financing and other distortions in
much the same way as domestic private firms.

The average returns may appear high in absolute values for all types of ownership. This
could be due to outliers in the sample (in addition to policy distortions to cost of capital and
output). We consider two reduced samples that trim out additional possible outliers.
Specifically, for each ownership type, we exclude the top and the bottom 5 percent (or 10
percent) of the firms in terms of the average returns. The resulting means for these two
trimmed samples are reported in the next two columns in Table 4. The average returns do
become lower for each ownership type as we trim out more extreme values. Interesting, the
order of the returns by ownership is preserved, namely, wholly state-owned firms always
have the lowest average return, followed by majority state-owned and minority state owned
firms.

Another reason for the high returns may result from under-valued capital stock. In particular,
the value of capital stock on the firms’ book may not fully reflect (potentially higher) market
value. This could make the ratio of VA/K artificially high. Of course, firms may not take
enough depreciation on their capital stock, which could result in over-valued capital stock. If
these measurement errors are not systematically related to ownership (though related to
sector classification), then they should not affect the order the estimated returns to capital
across ownership. Arguably, state-owned firms are more likely not to take enough
depreciation (i.e., keeping some “dead” capital on the book). As a result, the true discrepancy
in the returns to capital between state-owned and privately owned firms is likely to be even
larger than reported in Table 3.

Another way to look at “typical” returns by ownership that are less affected by extreme
values is median return. By this measure, again, the same pattern of relative returns across
ownership is exhibited. Specifically, wholly-state owned, majority state-owned, and minority
state-owned firms have the three lowest median returns (57 percent, 71 percent, and 78
percent, respectively). Foreign-owned and domestic privately owned firms have returns,
between 91-100 percent, or 20-40 percentage points higher than state-owned firms. The
collectively owned firms are recorded to have the highest median returns.

Regression Approach to Control for Sector, Year, and Size Effects

The average returns to capital recorded in Table 4 do not take into account possible return
differences across sectors, times or regions. For example, let us assume that state-owned
firms do not have intrinsically lower returns. If private firms happen to be over-represented
in higher-risk, higher-returns sectors, they would on average have higher returns than state
firms. This speaks to the importance of controlling for sector-specific risks and other shocks.
As another example, let us assume that the source of inefficiency lies in regional differences
in returns to capital4. If state-owned firms happen to be over-represented in those regions

with more depressed returns, then we might incorrectly conclude that capital allocation is
biased in favor of state-owned firms if we do not correct for the regional effects. In this sub-
section, we employ a regression framework that explicitly decomposes return differentials
into ownership, region, and sector/year components.

We regress value added over capital (VA/K) on the seven ownership type dummies (with
domestic private firms being the omitted benchmark type), industry—year fixed effects, and
region fixed effects. The result is reported in the first column of Table 5. Even after
accounting for year-specific sector shocks and location differences, the returns to capital are
found to be statistically lower for state-owned firms than for domestic private firms,
suggesting that private firms face greater capital and output distortions than state-owned
firms. Wholly foreign-owned firms also exhibit lower returns than domestic private firms. On
the other hand, collectively owned firms may face even greater capital and output distortions
as they show higher returns than private firms.

In addition to working with the full sample, we also trim out 5 percent (or 10 percent) of the
extreme values on both ends for each ownership type. The new regression results with the
trimmed samples are reported in Columns 2 and 3 of Table 5. The qualitative results are
similar as before, except that the return to wholly foreign-owned firms is no longer lower
than domestic private firms once we exclude 10 percent outliers on both ends. Taken together,
these three regressions suggest that after accounting for region and sector shocks, wholly
state owned and majority state-owned firms still have 45 percent and 22 percent lower
returns, respectively, than domestic private and foreign firms. Collectively owned firms, on
the other hand, continue to appear to face even more grave distortions.

We also regress log of VA/K on the ownership type dummies, sector/year and region fixed
effects. This specification corresponds to equation (13), allowing us to interpret the
coefficients on the ownership dummies as reflecting relative capital and output distortions in
percentage terms (tax equivalent). Parallel to the previous set of equations, we implement the
regression on two trimmed samples as well as the whole sample. It turns out that the results
are qualitatively similar to the earlier regression with un-logged dependent variables.
Specifically, the combination of capital and output distortions is equivalent to giving wholly
state-owned firms a subsidy of 54 percentage points relative to foreign and domestic private
firms. Majority and minority state-owned firms are also found to face less distortions than
private firms, which in tax equivalent terms, are on the order of 20 and 10 percentage points,
respectively. We have also added a measure of firm size (total employment) to the
regressions to see if the return to capital varies systematically with size (reported in Table 6).
The answer turns out to be no.

To summarize, the data strongly suggest that the ARPK is substantially lower for wholly and
partially state-owned firms than for foreign and domestic private firms by as much as 11-54
percentage points. If all firms in the same industry have the same Cobb-Douglas production
(but may differ in their levels of TFPs), then the marginal return to capital, or MRPK, (which
is proportional to ARPK), is also substantially lower for state-owned firms than for foreign
and domestic private firms.

Alternative Calculation of Marginal Returns to Capital

Instead of inferring marginal revenue product of capital (MRPK) from estimated average
revenue product of capital (ARPK), one can also compute it directly. Specifically, we can
Compute

               MRPKj,to = (VAj,t – wj, t Lj, t)/ Kj, t                                      (22)

The advantage of this approach is to avoid the need to assume that the production function is
Cobb-Douglas and that the capital share for different firms within a sector is identical. But
the advantage comes with a cost, which is to assume that wage payment is accurately
observed.

Table 7 presents the summary statistics of raw MRPKj,to. Both the mean and the median
marginal returns line up in the same way across ownership as for the average returns reported
earlier. In particular, the marginal returns are substantially lower for the three types of state-
owned firms than for either domestic private or foreign-owned firms. The median value of
marginal returns to capital for private firms (at 0.63) is 26 percentage points higher than the
median value of marginal return for wholly state-owned firms (at 0.37).

The raw distributions in Table 7 do not take into account sector or location composition of
the firms which could bias the comparison of the returns across ownership (e.g., state-owned
firms could happen to be over-represented in sectors that have lower returns). In Table 8, a
set of regressions are run that include sector*year fixed effects as well as location fixed
effects. All regressions consistently show that returns are lower for state-owned firms than
for private or foreign-owned firms. For example, in Column 3 of Table 8, where the
dependent variable is MRPKj,to, and the sample is trimmed for 10 percent biggest and
smallest returns for each ownership type, the marginal returns to capital for wholly state-
owned, majority state-owned, and minority state-owned firms are 36, 15, and 12 percentage
points lower than that of private firms within the same sector and in the same city. All three
coefficients are statistically significant at the 1 percent level.

In Column 6 of Table 8, where the dependent variable is ln(MRPKo), and the sample is also
trimmed for 10 percent biggest and smallest returns for each ownership type, only the
coefficients for wholly and majority state-owned firms are negative and statistically
significant at the five percent level. As explained earlier, the coefficients can be interpreted
as the added cost of capital and output distortions faced by state-owned firms relative to
those faced by domestic private firms. By these point estimates, wholly state-owned and
majority state-owned firms face lower costs of capital (and/or less output distortions) on the
order of 50 and 18 percentage points, respectively. In other words, the constraints on private
firms’ ability to access financing (or other constraints that prevent them from taking
advantage of the high marginal returns to capital) are severe.
                                            13


Table 9 repeats the regressions in Table 8 with the addition of a measure of firm size by
employment. The results suggest that marginal returns to capital tend to be higher in firms
with more employment. After accounting for this, the conclusion regarding the return
differentials across ownership remains the same: state-owned firms have systematically
lower marginal returns to capital than domestic private or foreign-owned firms.

Dispersion of Factor Returns across Regions and Sectors

Under the null hypothesis of optimally allocated capital with no distortions, marginal returns
to capital should also be equalized across regions and sectors. The regressions reported in
Tables 5-6 and 8-9 also include city and sector fixed effects, allowing us to directly check for
evidence of allocative distortions by regions and sectors.

We extract all the city fixed effects from Tables 5 and 8, and order them from the lowest to
the highest. It is clear that the city fixed effects vary widely across locations. To see if the
cross-city differences in returns to capital reflect systematic inefficiency in the capital
allocation system rather than sample variations over time or measurement errors, we also
implement the regressions year by year with separate city fixed effects for each year. The
results are reported in Appendix Table 1. The scatter plots of the 2004 estimates against those
of 2003, and the 2003 estimates against those of 2002 are presented in Figures 1 and 2. The
pairwise correlations for these fixed effects are 0.79 and 0.75, respectively, between 2002
and 2003, and between 2003 and 2004. The persistence in the cross-city differentials in the
MRPKs suggests that they likely reflect systematic biases in China’s capital allocation in
favor of certain regions against others.

The Chinese government has a policy on the book to support development in the inland. This
raises the possibility that capital is systematically channeled to the inland even though the
returns may be lower there. It is also possible that provincial capitals and four super-cities
(Beijing, Chongqing Shanghai, and Tianjin,) receive special treatment in capital allocation.
To check if the capital allocation distortions are systematic, we implement a set of
regressions that include dummies for provincial capitals, super-cities, and a set of dummies
that correspond to the government’s official classification of the country into either three or
seven zones. The results are reported in Table 10. There is no evidence that returns to capital
in the provincial capital or the super-cities are systematically different from other cities.
However, in the three-zone classification (used in official documents such as in China’s
seventh five-year plan), cities in Eastern China (coastal area) are found to have higher
marginal returns than those in Middle China (near coast) by 9 percentage points, which in
turn have higher marginal returns than the Western China by 8 percentage points.

Using a seven-zone classification (used in official documents such as those of the 8th
National People’s Congress in 1996), similar patterns emerge. In particular, the benchmark
region (Northwest China, encompassing Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, Shanxi, Xinjing, and Inner
Mongolia) has the lowest marginal returns to capital. The middle group, the Central region
(Anhui, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi), Northeast (Heilongjiang , Jilin, and Liaoning),
Southwest (Guangxi, Guizhou, Sichuan, Tibet, and Yunnan), and Southeast (Fujian,
Guangdong, and Hainan) have higher marginal returns by 12-21 percentage points. The
                                                     14


Bohai Circle (Beijing, Hebei, Tianjin, Shandong, and Shanxi) and the Yangzi Delta (Jiangsu,
Shanghai, and Zhejiang) have the highest marginal returns in the country, about 30-49
percentage points higher than the benchmark region. We have also collected city fixed effects
from regressions with the average revenue product of capital as the dependent variable.
Regressing these city fixed effects on the same set of regional dummies as in Table 10
produces very similar results (not reported to save space). This suggests that the Chinese
authorities’ effort in channeling capital into the inland may have resulted in a loss in
efficiency5.

The sector fixed effects (from separate regressions of ln[VA-wL)/K] in different years) are
reported in Table 11. Similar to the city fixed effects, the ranking of the sectors by the size of
the fixed effects is also relatively stable over the three years. Printing and copying, wood
processing and products, and non-metallurgical products have among the lowest marginal
returns to capital. On the other hand, black metallurgical refinery and processing, and
tobacco products have among the highest returns to capital. In principle, some reallocation of
capital from the lower return sectors to the higher return ones could improve efficiency.
Some qualifications are needed, however. First, capital allocation to certain sectors may be
discouraged by policies because of considerations of negative externality. Tobacco products
are an example. Restrictions on investment in that sector (through a high output or profit tax)
can be socially efficient if the negative externality is sufficient high. One has to have
information on the size of the externality to make an informed judgment on whether equating
the return to capital in that sector with those of others would improve efficiency. Second, for
many sectors, the sector fixed effects are not statistically significant for any year (relative to
the benchmark of agriculture products and processing). This suggests that capital mis-
allocation across sectors is limited to a small number of sectors. For these reasons, we will
not focus our attention on the dispersion in the marginal returns across sectors.

Returns to Labor

To see whether lower returns to capital in state-owned firms reflect lower productivity, easier
access to finance, or a combination of the two, it is also useful to compute returns to capital
and compare them across firm ownership. We compute average revenue product of labor
(ARPL = VA/L) and report the summary statistics in Table 12. It is clear that wholly state-
owned and collective firms have the lowest ARPL among all ownership groups. On the other
hand, foreign firms and partially state-owned firms have the highest ARPL. Domestic private
firms are somewhere in between. We also use a regression approach to control for possible
differences across sectors, years, and locations, and report the results in Table 13. The same
qualitative pattern is repeated here. We also add a measure of firm size (log of employment)
and obtain the same results (not reported to save space).



5
  The MPK estimates computed at the province-level by Bai, Hsieh, and Qian (2006) also imply the highest
returns on coastal regions and the lowest returns in the western provinces. This is broadly consistent with the
pattern reported here.
                                             15


The joint patterns of ARPKs and ARPLs suggest something interesting. Wholly-owned state
firms have the lowest returns to both capital and labor, suggesting low TFPs in these firms.
On the other hand, partially state-owned firms have lower ARPKs than either private or
foreign firms, but an intermediate level of ARPL that is between those of domestic private
and foreign firms. If partially state-owned firms also have an intermediate level of TFP, face
greater constraint in laying off redundant workers than private firms, but are partially
compensated by preferential access to financing (as wholly state-owned firms), this pattern
can be rationalized.

We note, however, that the results on returns to labor are not as reliable as those on returns to
capital. In particular, it may make sense to differentiate skilled and unskilled labor. As the
survey lacks information on this, the results on returns to labor should be regarded as
suggestive.

Gains from Efficient Reallocation of Capital: Some Illustrative Calculations

China can improve its resource allocation through a number of ways, either by privatizing
state-owned firms, simultaneously reallocating capital from the state to the private sector and
removing the distortions faced by private firms, or changing the incentives faced by the
management of the state firms. Partial privatization, converting a wholly state-owned firm to
a partially state-owned firm, or converting the state share from a majority to a minority,
would also raise the return to capital, though not as much as full privatization or reallocation
of capital from state to private firms. We do not have the data to do an evaluation of the
relative gains across the full menu of reform options. Instead, we will examine the efficiency
gains associated with removing the dispersion in marginal returns to capital from state-owned
to private firms.

Let Chinese GDP in a given year to be the sum of value added from the state firms and the
value added from the private firms:

               GDP = Ys(Ks , Ls) + Yp(Kp , Lp)                                              (23)

Ks , Ls, Kp , and Lp denote status-quo levels of capital stock and labor in the state-owned
firms and private firms, respectively. Consider a thought experiment of moving X yuans
from the state firms to the private firms, but leaving the labor (and other input) allocation
fixed. This would result in a percentage change in GDP given by:

percent increase in GDP = [Ys(Ks-X, Ls)+Yp(Kp+X, Lp)]/ [Ys(Ks , Ls)+Yp(Kp , Lp)]-1          (24)

Subject to the equilibrium constraint that the average (and marginal) returns to capital are
equalized between state and private firms after the reallocation:

                Ys(Ks-X, Ls)/ (Ks-X) = Yp(Kp+X, Lp)/(Kp+X)                                  (25)

From the regression tables, we can infer the relative cost of capital distortions faced by firms
of different ownership types:
                                                16



               [Ys(Ks, Ls)/ Ks] / [Yp(Kp, Lp)/Kp] = ds/dp                                     (26)

It can be verified that the optimal reallocation of the capital as a share of the original capital
stock employed by state-owned firms is given by:

                         K p ⎡ d p 1−1α ⎤
                             ⎢( ) − 1⎥
                         Ks ⎣ ds           ⎦
                X / Ks =                                                                      (27)
                              K p d p 1−1α
                         1+       ( )
                              Ks ds

Where α is the capital share in the Cobb-Douglas production function. The increment in GDP
(in percent) as a result of the capital reallocation is:

                                   Kp   ⎡     K        d 1 ⎤
                            (1 +     )α ⎢1 + ( p )1−α ( p )1−α ⎥
                                   Ks ⎣       Ks       ds      ⎦
                %ΔGDP =
                                            Kp dp                                             (28)
                                       1+      ( )
                                            Ks ds

We perform a set of simulations on the percentage increment in GDP due to an optimal
reallocation of capital as a function of some basic parameters. Three parameters are key to
the simulations.

(a) The capital share in the production function. Under the assumption that both the ARPKs
in Table 2 and the MRPKs in Table 5 are valid, we can infer the capital share by the ratio of
MRPK/ARPK. As the median MRPK and median ARPK for the whole sample are 0.61 and
0.88, respectively, the capital share implied by the ratio of the two is 0.69. If we use the
values for the domestic private firms, we obtain the same implied capital share. Using
trimmed means or median values for other ownership types would yield an implied capital
share in the range of (0.64, 0.74). It is possible that the wage payment in our data does not
capture all labor compensation. Using labor compensation in the national income statistics,
Hsieh and Klenow (2006) estimated the capital share in China in the neighborhood of 0.6. In
our simulation, we vary the capital share, α, at 0.5, 0.6, and 0.7.

(b) The ratio of the capital stock employed by non-state firms to that employed by state-
owned firms, Kp/ Ks. While the share of state-owned firms in total industrial output has
declined to about 1/3 in recent years, state-owned firms tend to be larger and more capital-
intensive on average than private firms. We therefore vary Kp/ Ks at 1, 1.5, and 2.

(c) The ratio of the distortions to cost of capital faced by private firms relative to those faced
by state-owned firms, ds/dp. This ratio can be inferred from the regression coefficients
reported in Tables 3 and 4. Specifically, the coefficients for the state-owned firms in the last
three columns of Table 3 are effectively ln(ds/dp). We vary dp/ds at 1.5, 1.8, and 2.
                                              17


The simulation results are reported in Table 14. The projected percentage increase in GDP
after an optimal reallocation of capital ranges from 2-11 percent of GDP. The central case (α
= 0.6, Kp/ Ks=1.5, and dp/ds =1.8) yields an increase in GDP by 5 percent. To accomplish this,
2/3 of the capital currently employed by state-owned firms needs to be “liberated” for more
efficient use. Taking the central case literally, it implies that the most efficient reallocation of
capital could raise China’s GDP by an additional 5 percentage points. Alternative sets of
parameters would make the GDP increments a bit higher or lower, in the range of 2-11
percentage points.

One might ask whether China really needs another 5 percentage points of growth rate.
Another way to see the gains from a more efficient allocation of capital is simply more
consumption (and faster improvement in living standard for Chinese households) without
sacrificing the GDP growth. As an illustration, one could calculate how much less capital
China could work with that could produce the same amount of GDP if capital allocation is
improved. These calculations are reported in Table 15. Specifically, with the same central
case as before (α = 0.6, Kp/ Ks=1.5, and dp/ds =1.8) and an optimal transfer of capital from
state to private firms, it is calculated that the capital stock can be reduced by 8 percent (Z/K
as reported in the last column) without a negative effect on the overall GDP. Again,
alternative assumptions on the parameters could change the permissible reduction in capital
stock to somewhere between 3-14 percent.

A few comments are in order. First, the above calculations have not taken into account the
gains from eliminating the dispersion in marginal returns to capital across regions and sectors.
Second, it has not included the gains from reallocating labor either. So the true efficiency
gains are likely to be larger than the simulations indicate. Third, as a counter argument,
removing all policy distortions that generate the differentials in the marginal returns to
capital may not be the relevant policy counterfactual to consider. In particular, if the
government ceases the policy of granting preferential access to finance to state-owned firms,
the unemployment rate would have risen and budgetary outlays in the form of unemployment
payment would have risen. In other words, perhaps the subsided financing to state forms is a
form of disguised unemployment payment. As a critique to the last point, one needs to realize
that private firms would have expanded had their financing constraint been relaxed, and the
expansion would have absorbed the labor released from state-owned firms. The temporary
cost of the unemployment benefit during the transition period is unlikely to outweigh the
foregone value added due to a long-lasting inefficient allocation of capital needed to sustain
the state-owned firms.

                                        V. CONCLUSION

Using a survey of a stratified random sample of firms in China, we provide evidence that
capital is inefficiently allocated. The degree of inefficiency is economically and statistically
significant. In particular, we show that wholly and partially state owned firms have lower
marginal returns to capital than private or foreign firms by 23-54 percentage points (on a pre-
tax, pre-depreciation, and all distortions-inclusive basis). A set of simulations illustrates the
magnitude of the inefficiency for the economy: If China can raise the returns to capital on the
stock of capital currently employed by state firms, then the country can work with 8% less
capital without negatively affecting its GDP growth. In other words, the country can reduce
                                           18


its very high investment rate, raise its consumption and hence deliver greater improvement in
living standards for its households.
