       In this paper we examine the effects of publicly financed infrastructure and R&D capital

on the cost structure and productivity performance of twelve two-digit U.S. manufacturing

industries. A general framework is developed to measure contribution of demand, relative input

prices, technical change, as well as publicly financed capital on total factor productivity growth.

The magnitude of the contribution of these sources varies considerably across industries: in some

changes in demand dominate while in others changes in technology or relative prices are the

main contributors. Publicly financed infrastructure and R&D capital contribute to productivity

growth. However, the magnitudes of their contribution vazy considerably across industries and

on the whole they are not the major contributors to TFP in these industries.

       Introduction'
       Several recent studies have examined the role of public infrastructure investment
which consists of highways, airports, mass transit. etc. in increasing private sector
productivity growth. The subject has been very controversial; some, like Aschauer (1989),
have argued that infrastructure capital contributes significantly to the growth of output and
productivity, while others, such as Hulten and Schwab (1991). have denied any significant
role for it in this regard. Eisner (1993) has presented evidence based on aggregate
economic data in support of the role of public infrastructure investment as a significant
contributor to productivity growth.
       Aside from the question of whether there is a strong correlation between public
capital and productivity, there is the question of the magnitude of the effect of
infrastructure capital. The reported elasticities of output and labor productivity with respect
to changes in public infrastructure capital formation are very diverse. Using time-series
data at the national level, Aschauer (1989), Munnell (1990a), and Holtz-Eakin (1988)
report output elasticities with respect to public infrastructure capital that range from 0.30
to 0.40. At the international level Ford and Poret (1991), using cross-sectional data of
nine OECD countries, estimate the average elasticity of TFP with respect to changes in
infrastructure to be about 0.45. On the other hand, the estimates presented by Hulten and
Schwab (199 1)and Tatom (199 1)suggest there is no statistically significant relation
between the growth of infrastructure capital and output growth at the aggregate business
sector and total manufacturing levels. Estimating a cost function, Berndt and Hansson
(1991) have found significant effects of changes in infrastructure capital on labor
requirement at both the level of total manufacturing and the aggregate business sector of
the Swedish economy.
        At the state level, the output elasticity of infrastructure capital is shown to be
smaller. The elasticities reported by Munnell (1 990b), Costa et al, (1987), and Mera
 (1973) range from about 0.15 to 0.20 while Eberts (1986) and Garcia-Mila and McGuire
 (1992) report estimates ranging from 0.040 to 0.045. Finally, in a regional study Hulten
 and Schwab (1991b) find no statistically significant relationship between growth of total
 factor productivity and growth of public capital. These differences between estimates
 based on aggregate data and more disaggregated state data may reflect the fact that it is

                                                2
not possible to capture all the payoffs to public sector capital formation at the
disaggregated level.
       All of these studies are at high levels of aggregation. using national, regional, or
state data. A major beneficiary of any services of public sector capital is the production
sector of the private economy. There are, however, very few studies exploring the impact
of infrastructure capital on cost and output at the disaggregate industry level. Nadiri and
Mamuneas (1993) and Conrad and Seitz (1992) provide evidence for the positive
contribution of infrastructure services on productivity growth at the two digit industry level
in the U.S. and West Germany, respectively. Their estimates imply lower elasticities than
those at the aggregate level. Also infrastructure investment is not the only type of public
sector capital that would affect private sector productivity. Another potential candidate is
the stock of R&D capital financed by the US government. There isconsiderable evidence
that labor and total factor productivity are influenced by R&D investment, particularly when
it is financed by the private sector. The effect of public-sector financed R&D on the
growth of output and productivity at the industry level has not been extensively or properly
examined. Many of the studies at the industry level provide inconclusive evidence of the
effect of federally financed R&D performed by the industries. On the contrary, Nadiri and
Mamuneas (1993), Mamuneas and Nadiri (199 ,), and Mamuneas (1993) have estimated
that aggregate federally financed R&D, when treated as a public input, contributes
 significantly to the private cost reduction of U.S. manufacturing industries.
        In this study we analyze the effect of public sector financed capital on total factor
 productivity growth (TEP) in the context of a general framework. Our analytical framework
 following the previous work of Nadiri and Schankerman (198 la,b) distinguishes between
 the contributions of output demand, relative input prices, technical change and publicly
 financed capital. Analyzing the relative contribution of these types of capital in the context
 of a comprehensive framework may provide reasonable answers to policy questions. More
 specifically:
         (1) We disaggregate the public sector capital into two components: infrastructure
 and R&D capital. Our primary objective is to see whether any of these types of public
 capital stocks affect the level and rate of growth of private sector productivity.
         (2) We estimate the effects of the two types of public sector capital at a much more
 disaggregated industry level. We use twelve two-digit U.S. manufacturing industries as

                                                3
the base of our analysis and examine how the various types of public capital stock
influence the structure of the production in these industries and affect their total factor
productivity growth.
      (3) Unlike the prevalent approach in productivity studies, we look at both the output
demand and cost functions together to trace the effect of changes in the demand and
structure of costs on productivity growth of various industries.
       (4) Finally, we use duality theory to specify a cost function dual to a production
function, which allows us to treat the cost and input shares to be determined
simultaneously. We treat the public sector capitals as unpaid inputs affecting the
production process in the private sector.'




II.     The Model
        Let the production function of an industry be given by


(1)            Y = F(XG,T)

where Y is the output of the industry, X is a vector of traditional inputs like labor, capital,
 and intermediate factors, G is a two-dimensional vector of public capital stocks, and T is
 the disembodied technology level.
        The traditional measure of Total Factor Productivity growth (TEP) is defined by the
 path-independent Divisia index:


 (2)            TEP = V - E S X                                                      i = L, K, M



 where X denotes the rate of growth and S, = P, X, I P Y is the value share of the ith

 private input.
        Differentiating (1) with respect to time, and dividing by the output, we obtain



  (3)
                     '' 3X Y
                                              +---

                                                4
Assuming cost minimization of all inputs, public included, and letting P be the price of ith
private input and Q1 the shadow price of public input s, we get the following first-order
conditions:

where p is the Lagrangian multiplier, together with the envelope conditions


                   ac =

where C' = PX + E O,G, = C' (Y, P. Q, T) is the total cost function which
includes the shadow cost of the two types of public capital. Eliminating p from (4) and (5)
and substituting (4)-(5) in (3), we get



                                                              ac'

Firms, however, do not adjust the public capital stock. They are exogenously given. What
actually is observed is that firms minimize their private production cost subject to the
production function (1). Let the optimal private cost of production, given the output level
and public capital, be C =           PX = C (Y, P. G, T). Then the marginal benefit of an


                                                   5
increase of public capital at equilibrium will be given by

It is not difficult to show by using comparative statistics that the total cost elasticity, , *
is given by


                      8InC       alnc 1 B = q I B
                       8lnY      8lnY



where B = 1 - (3lnC)/(8InG,) = 1             and q, is the private cost elasticity with respect
to public inputs, and i is the private cost elasticity. And the cost diminution due to
technical change is


                      atnC     dlnC      B
                                aT



 Following Caves et at (1981). the total return to scale of the production function is defined
 as the proportional increase in output due to equiproportioflal increase of all inputs (private
 and public, holding technology fixed), and is be given by the inverse of i' * . The private
 returns to scale, i.e. the proportional increase in output due to equiproportional increase of
 private inputs holding public inputs and technology fixed, is given by the inverse of i.
 Thus, we identify two scale effects in our study, one internal and the other total, which is
 the sum of internal and external scale effects. Substituting (7) in (6) and then in (2) we
 have

                                                  6

AC' . According to equation (8), TFP growth can be decomposed into three components:
a gross total scale effect given by the first term, a public capital stock effect given by the
second term, and the technological change effect given by the last term.
        The next step is to further decompose the scale effect. We assume that the price
of output is related to private marginal cost according to


                  = (1 + 0)


where 0 is a markup over the marginal cost. The markup will depend on the elasticity of
demand as well as on the conjectural variations held by the firms within an industry. Using
the definition of the output elasticity, q, along the private cost function, we obtain


(9)            P=(1

Time differentiating (9), the pricing rule implies



(10)              - (1 + 0) +       +    —V



where () denotes growth rate. Differentiating private cost function with respect to time
and using Shephard's lemma, we have

                         is the share of the ith input in private cost, C.

        In order to obtain the equilibrium of '' we assume a log linear demand function (see

                                                     7
Nadiri and Schankerman (1981a)) in the growth rate form


(12)          Y—A+a           + fi Z + (1 - ) N


where Z and 1 are the growth of aggregate income and population, respectively, and A
reflects a demand time trend. Substituting (11) in (10) and the result in (1 2), we obtain
the reduced form function for the growth rate of total factor productivity.

where A = K           1(1 - a(,7 - 1)].
                  K


Equation (13) decomposes TP into components:

       (i) a factor price effect Ac

       (ii) an exogenous demand effect A (A + bZ + (1 - b)tJ ];

       (iii) a public capital effect [ Ac —    I        G,; and


       (iv) disembodied technical change I Ac -          I t.
       The underlying model is an equilibrium model in which there is minimization over all
inputs, the level of public capital is adjusted at its optimal level by the government until it
earns its social rate of return. The public capital and disembodied technical change effects
can be further decomposed into direct and indirect effects. The direct effect of
infrastructure, for instance, is given by (q/KB) G while the indirect effect is given by
Aci . Thus an increase of public infrastructure initially increase total factor

                                               8
productivity by reducing the private cost of production, which in turn leads to lower output
price and higher output growth. Change in output growth in turn leads to changes in TFP
growth.
      The important parameters in (13) are the price and income elasticities of demand
and the cost elasticities of private cost function. Note that if the demand function is
completely inelastic (a = 0) then shifts in the cost function due to real factor price
changes, public capital, or disembodied technical change have no effect on output and
hence TFP. Second if there are constant returns to scale including the public inputs,

       = K = 1, then (13) collapses to TP                - t.
Ill.     Empirical Application
         The decomposition of TP based on equation (13) requires nine parameters; on the
demand side the price and income elasticities a, fi and the parameter of the shift variable
A; on the cost side, weneed the cost elasticities with respect to infrastructure and public
R&D capital and output cost elasticities i' and q. For the markup 8 we have
o = (PY/C - f7)I!7, and we assume that x = 1. Given these parameter values, the
procedure is to compute the contributions of the demand, real factor price, and public
capital on TFP growth, and then to retrieve the technical change effect as a residual using
equation (13). Discrete (Tornqvist) approximations to the Divisia indices in (13) are used.
The demand elasticities are obtained by estimating the demand function in a rate of growth
form:


                YA+oP÷flZ+(1            -fi)N


where ? is the growth rate of industry output, P,, Z, and tJ are the growth rates of
industry output price, real GNP and population respectively.
         The cost elasticities are obtained from a generalized Cobb-Douglas average-cost
function of the following form:




                                                9
                ln(C/PM)-lnY=fio+fi',InW+fi'tT+ fl'jnWlnW

                                                                                   i, j = L, K;
                                                                                      s = I, R.

There are three private sector inputs, labor, intermediate inputs, and capital, and two public
inputs, infrastructure and R&D capital. The cost variable C is defined as C = I, PX where
P and X refer to the prices and quantities of the inputs; W is the relative input prices
defined as W, = P/PM, where M is the price of intermediates. The subscripts i and
denote the private inputs and s the public inputs. The parameters 4', and , capture the
effects generated from the public capital services, G,. Note that the above specification
implies constant returns to scale in terms of private inputs and thus by assumption, 17 is
equal to one.
       Applying Shephard's lemma, the following share equations are obtained:


(15)              =fl'1 +     fl'InW1 +fl'T +            ,lnG,,                    i,j=L,K,


where = P1 X I C. The share of the input used for the normalization is calculated by
=1-       ,. Input shares in each industry depend not only on relative input prices and

technological change, but also on publicly financed infrastructure and R&D capital.
       The effects of public sector capital on cost and input shares of our sample of two-
digit industries are captured by the magnitudes and signs of the parameters ', and ,.
The cost elasticities with respect to each public capital are computed using

IV. Data Description
         Data on quantities and price indices of output, labor, physical capital and
intermediate inputs for all manufacturing industries at the two digit level were obtained
from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). These data are the same as those used by
Gullickson and Harper (1986, 1987) to estimate total factor productivity indices for the
manufacturing sector.2 All price indices have been normalized to be equal to one at 1 982
value.
         For each industry the quantity of output is measured as the value of gross output
divided by the output price index. The labor input quantity is measured as the cost of
labor divided by the price of labor index. The price of intermediate inputs is derived from a
Tornqvist index of the price indices of materials, energy and purchased services. The
quantity of intermediate inputs is measured as the total cost of materials, energy and
purchased services divided by the price index of intermediate inputs. The prices of labor
and intermediate inputs are multiplied by one minus the corporate income tax to convert
them to after-tax prices. The physical capital stock is defined as the sum of structures and
equipment capital stock. The deflator of physical capital is derived as a Tornqvist index of
the investment price deflators of structures and equipment.
         The after-tax rental rate of physical capital is measured as Pk = Q¼ Cr + 6k) (1 -   -

u z), where q is the physical capital deflator, r is the discount rate, which is taken to be
the rate on Treasury notes of ten-year maturity obtained from Citibase, 6, is the physical
capital depreciation rate, 'K is the investment tax credit, u is the corporate income tax rate,
obtained from Auerbach (1983) and Jorgenson and Sullivan (1981), and z is the present
value of capital consumption allowances. After 1983 the corporate income tax rate is
taken to be 0.46, the constant rate over 1979-1982. The investment tax credit until 1980
is taken from Jorgenson and Sullivan (1981); 8% is used for 1981 and 7.5% for 1982to
1986. The present values of capital consumption allowances are constructed as z = p (1 -
O;K)/(r + p) (see Bernstein and Nadiri (1987, 1988,1991)), where p is the capital
consumption allowance rate obtained by dividing the capital consumption allowances by
the capital stock, and 0 takes value 0 except for the 1962-1963 period in which the firms
under the Long Amendment had to reduce the depreciable base of the assets by half the
amount of the investment tax credit.
         Annual data on fixed nonresidential government net capital stock (federal, state and

                                               11
local) have been obtained from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). The total net
government physical capital stock is measured as the sum of federal, state, and local net
capital stock of structures and equipment, excluding military, at constant 1982 prices.3
The acquisition price of capital is constructed as a Tornqvist index from the government's
gross investment series on structures and equipment obtained from the same source.
       Data on research and development financed by the government for the sample
period 1970-1986 were obtained from the U.S. Statist/ca/Abstracts (various issues). For
the period 1 953-1970 it was obtained from the series W 109-110 of Historical Statistics,
Colonial Times to 1970(1975). The implicit price deflator of government purchases of
goods and services, obtained from the above sources, was used to deflate the R&D
expenditure series. The government R&D capital stock is constructed using the perpetual
inventory method with a 10% depreciation rate. The 1952 benchmark is estimated by
dividing the R&D expenditures by the sum of government R&D depreciation rate and the
average growth rate of the infrastructure capital stock prior to the sample period.
       In our model we have used the utilized services of publicly financed infrastructure
capital. It is important to convert the stock of public capital to service measures provided
by these capital stocks. As Hulten (1990) has pointed out, public capital stock should be
adjusted for capacity utilization because there is evidence of significant variation in the
intensity with which public capital is used. We have multiplied the infrastructure capital by
the industry capacity utilization rate obtained from Klein and Summers (1966) for the
period 1956-1966and from WEFA Group (1992) for the period 1967-1986.The stock of
public R&D has been adjusted by the intensity of R&D investment of each industry. The
data of our financed R&D investment have been obtained from the National Science
Foundation (1988, and earlier issues). Finally, the GNP and Population variables have been
obtained from the Citibase Data Bank.


V. Estimation Results
        The demand function (1 2) and cost function (14) and share equations (15) are
estimated using the data for twelve two-digit US manufacturing industries for the period
1956-1986.These industries were selected because of the availability of continuous R&D
data over the sample period. In Table 1 we provide the sample mean values of the costs,
input prices, and the rates of growth of input quantities, output, cost and price of output.

                                              12
There are considerable variations among industries in terms of costs, and output and input
growth. In some industries the growth of labor input is small and sometimes negative.
Similarly, the output growth rate varies considerably and it is negative (-.5%) in Primary
Metals industry (SIC 33). There are some contrasting patterns among the input shares,
particularly with respect to the share of capital, and growth rate of output price and private
cost. The growth rates of the infrastructure and publicly financed R&D as well as the
growth rates of gross national income and population growth are shown at the bottom
panel of table 1.
       We have pooled the industry time-series data. In the case of a single industry, the
data often move closely together, thereby generating severe multicollinearity, which makes
it difficult to estimate the parameters of the production and cost functions without
imposing restrictive assumptions. The pooled industry data are generally more variable and
therefore allows for a better chance to identify parameter estimates such as scale,
technological bias, etc. of the underlying cost of production functions. In our estimation
we have allowed considerable latitude for industry effects. In fact, every parameter of the
underlying cost function incorporates industry dummy variables;4 this amounts to
estimating the model separately for each industry.
       In order for the cost function to be concave in input prices, the Hessian matrix
Ea2CIaw, wJ of the cost function should be negative semi-definite. Also, the cost
function should be nondecreasing in output and linear homogeneous in input prices. We
assume that the errors attached on the above equations are optimizing errors and are
jointly normally distributed with zero expected value and with a positive definite symmetric
covariance matrix. The underlying system of equations is estimated with full information
maximum likelihood and all regularity conditions required by producer theory were satisfied
(for more details see Nadiri and Mamuneas (1 993)). The product demand growth equations
for each industry were estimated with ordinary least squares.
       Table 2 summarizes the parameter estimates of interest of the demand and cost
functions for the twelve two-digit industries. The demand parameters are roughly similar
to those reported in the literature. There are some price elasticities which are rather low,
such as in industries 26, 29, and 38, and some elasticities that are not statistically
significant and therefore imprecisely estimated. The parameters associated with per capita
income, fi, in the output demand equation is highly significant statistically in every industry

and its magnitude varies considerably among the industries ranging from about 1 .0 in SIC
29 to 3.6 in SIC 36.
       The estimated cost elasticities of infrastructure capital and publicly financed R&D
capital are all negative and statistically significant except in industry 20 where q, is
positive but statistically insignificant. The magnitude of these cost elasticities suggest the
degree of cost diminution due to increase in public infrastructure and R&D investments.
The cost elasticity estimates in table 2 measure the productivity effect" of public sector
capitals. The results indicate that both types of public capital services reduce costs in
each industry. The magnitudes of the cost elasticities with respect to infrastructure
capital are in general much smaller than reported in previous studies, ranging from -0.1 1 in
SIC 33 to -0.21 in SIC 29. The cost elasticities for publicly financed R&D capital are much
smaller. They range from about -0.02 in SIC 26 to about -0.06 in SIC 37 and vary
considerably across industries. There is no clearly discernible pattern except that the
magnitudes of the elasticities tend to be higher in durable manufacturing industries such as
SIC 35, 36, 37,. and 38. The overall cost elasticities,   * , are all below unity, implying

increasing returns to scale and are statistically significant. The values of , * vary
somewhat among the industries, but generally they range between .82 to .97.
       We have used the demand and cost parameter estimates in table 2 to decompose
the TFP growth for each industry. The results are recorded in table 3. The decomposition
of TFP in table 3 is very comprehensive; it includes the contributions of technical change,
factor prices, exogenous output demand changes, and those of public infrastructure and
publicly financed R&D. As we noted earlier there are two effects associated with the
variables such as technology, and two types of public capital. The direct effect measures
the downward shift in the cost function associated with an increase in these variables. As
the cost shifts downward because the demand function for output is downward sloping,
the level of output changes and causes the indirect inducement effects.
       The results in table 3 point to several interesting issues. The growth of exogenous
demand plays a very significant role in determining the growth of TFP. The magnitude of
its contribution, however, varies considerably across industries ranging from 0.16 in SIC
20 to about 0.80 in SIC 38, which as a percentage of each industry's TFP is 9% to 41 %
respectively. In most cases the contribution of demand to TFP growth is about 20% to

30%. The smaller contribution of demand in industry 20 is mainly due to the lower value

of the scale parameter, 1 Itj *, estimated for the industry. There is one other exception to

note; in industry SIC 33 growth of demand contributes negatively to TFP. The reason as
we noted earlier, is that output growth in this industry has been small but more importantly
negative over the sample period.
       Rise in real factor prices contributes negatively to TP, its contribution also varies
considerably among industries; it ranges between -0.10 in SIC 20 to -0.62 in SIC 37. In
terms of percentage of TIP increase in real input prices contribute as little as about 8% in
SIC 20 and as high as 77% in SIC 37. Again the small contribution of the relative input
prices is due to the small scale parameter estimate, noted earlier for this industry. The
largest effect of price changes are concentrated in industries 30, 32, 33 and 38; in most
other industries the contribution of rise in real factor prices is about 20%.
       As noted earlier, we have distinguished between the direct and indirect
contributions of the two public capitals to total factor productivity growth. These
contributions are shown in columns (C) to (f) of table 3. The contributions of infrastructure
and public R&D capital also vary considerably across industries. In most industries the
direct contribution of infrastructure is about .30 to .35. In industry 29 and 38, it is about
.55 and .41 respectively. The indirect contribution of infrastructure capital to TEP shown
in column (d) of table 3 is positive but very small, about one-tenth of its direct effect. The
magnitude of the contribution of publicly financed R&D are smaller than those of the
infrastructure capital in most industries. The contribution of R&D capital also varies
considerably among industries, ranging between a high of almost 0.32 in industry SIC 37
to a low of about .03 in industry SIC 29. Aside from these extreme cases, the
contribution of publicly financed R&D capital to average annual growth of TFP falls about
10% to 15%, which is not negligible. The indirect contribution of publicly financed R&D is
much smaller than its direct contribution as we expect, but it is also smaller than the
indirect contribution of the infrastructure capital.
       The technical change effect is computed residually, and therefore captures all
contributory factors not accounted for by the model (including measurement error). This
residual accounts for a substantial amount of TFP growth. In fact, in terms of percentage

  of TP in a few industries it is the primary contributor, eg. SIC 20, 28. 35 and 36. The

 contribution of technical change as a percentage of TEP is on the average about 40% to
 60%. In two industries, SIC 29 and SIC 33, the contribution of technical change is
 negative which suggests that technical change in the industries accelerated at the same
 time that TFP declined. This unexpected result may also be partly due to measurement
 error.


 Conclusions
          In this paper we have formulated a general framework for decomposition of total
factor productivity in order to estimate the contribution of different sources including
publicly financed infrastructure and R&D capital to TFP growth. Demand and cost functions
were estimated using data for twelve two-digit U.S. industries for the period 1 956-1 986.
Using the estimated demand and cost function parameters, we decomposed TEP into
several components: exogenous demand effect, real factor price effect, direct and indirect
contribution of two types of public capital, and the effect of technical change.
          The contribution of each of these sources of TFP growth vary among the industries.
In some industries changes in aggregate demand or relative prices dominate, while in other
cases technical change matters more. Both types of publicly-financed capital affects
industry TP significantly. The contributions of infrastructure is about twice as large as
the contribution of publicly-financed R&D. The magnitudes of these contributions of
infrastructure capital is generally much smaller than has been reported in the literature. To
our knowledge no estimates of the contributions of aggregate publicly financed R&D
capital (as distinct from industry-specific publicly funded R&D) to growth of TFP have been
reported in the literature. We find that its contribution is significant but much smaller than
that of infrastructure. Also note that when we assess the role of infrastructure capital
within a general framework of TFP decomposition its contributions do not dominate. In
fact, it is the growth of aggregate demand, rise in real input prices and particularly the
growth rate of technical change which are the principle actors in determining TFP growth
at the industry level.
