  Dynamic Aspects of Children's Health, intellectual Development,
                  and Family Economic Status



                              ABSTRACT



     This   paper is an empirical investigation of childhood and adolescent

health and cognitive development as determined by family economic variables.

The model proposed recognizes that these processes may be jointly dependent,

and may in part be determined by common unobserved factors; these factors

may also be correleted with the observed family economic variables. A

two—factor model is estimated using panel data, and the results indicate

that when such factors are taken account of, family income is estimated

to have no significant influence on health and cognitive development, but

parents' education a strong positive influence.

       The relationships between an individual's adult health and
various economic variables have been examined empirically in a              n urn   be r
of recent studies (Grossman and Benham, 197Lt; Grossman, 1976; Lee,

 1979; Shakotko, 1979). They stem from the idea that one's st ate of
health is at least partly endogenous, reflecting one's stock of lcalth
capital, vihcse accumulation is determined to sonic extent by economic
and educational factors (Grossman, 1972).             In turn, thcse cc onomic and
educat ional      variabl es may themselves be partly determined by health.

 Invest igato rs have also recognized that an individual 5 lifetime

economic an d physi cal well—being is due in large measure to conditions

present or acquire d during childhood. Educational success, for

example, which is             significant determinant of adult earnings, may be
partly do term     I ne d   by the individual's cognitive development and
physical health as a child. Poor adult health, and its consequent

economic ha rdsh ip, may arise in many instances from poor health during

childhood or ad olescerice.1 Given this link between life—cycle

behavior and ch ildhood conditions, It is important to understand the
                                                     -
dete rmina nts of childhood development.

       This paper is an empirical        investigation   of   the determinants of
childhood and a dolescent health and cognitive development. The main
feature o f this investigation i s that it draws together into one

est irnable emp i r   ical model three classes of pos tulated determinants
of early health and cognitive d evelopment, and estimates their
cont r i but   ions si mul taneousl y.   In this sense, the model is superior to

previous studies which have analysed these determinants on a 1 iriited
                                               —2—



and piecennal             basis.      The model take S    explicit a ccount          of the
poss     I       TI i ty that I nd   iv idual —spa ci fic u no h served factors jointly
determine health and cognitive development, and recognizes t ha I

these factors may themselves                   be related to ot her observed
det e    rminants. The emphas is is on a two—facto r                      model, v:here a] 1       of tLe
heal th, cognitive development, arid background economic variables                                  e rye
as   I   ndicators of the unobserved              facto rs.     The niodel is estimated with
pa n a 1 data for approximately hi 00                cM I d   ren.

             Three main results emerge from the               Cs t I ma I e s   of this model.
First systematic
             /                 unobserved factors are found               to    play a significant
role in the determination of both health and cogni tive development.

T lies e effects are relatively stronger in the equat ions determining

cogn I tive development. Second, parents' educat ion is found to be a

positive            contributor to both processes, but family income is observed
to have no significant                 effect. Third, a        favorable history of early
childhood achievement is found to have a small pos itive effect on

future health, but poor early health has little ef fect on cognitive
development.              In fact, there is some evidence that poor health

influences cognitive development positiv ely;
         The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section I
outl ines the basic model both theoretica llyandempjrically.                                  In

Section II, there is a brief discussion of the data.                                In Section III,
the estimates of the model are presented.                            These are compared to
estimates of a model with no factor structure in terms of both effects
of different variables and predictive power.

 I. An Analytic Framework
     Three classes of variables             which have been   widely      proposed as
determinants      of chi idren's development might be latched "nurture",

"slat   ure", and ''h 1st ory."   tIhile these are broad classifications, and
perhaps at times ml sleading or         inappropriate, they serve well to
indicate the dimens ions of the         analysis.     In general, nurture refers
to the impact      of di scretionary (or interventionary) behavior on the

part of the househo ld which affects children's development. Economic

models of household production have hypothesized that this

discretionary behavior is mani fested in the form of time and income
investments in children.2 Whi le it is difficult to measure these

these investments directly, it is argued that the efficiency and
n'.nitude of the investments a re determined to a large extent by

parents' education and family income.
        The "nature" explanation of childhood development centers on

those factors which are prede termined and t herefore no t                 control lable
by the household.        In medical   literature,    t his   effect   is   often
labelled predisposition to certain health conditions.                     In terms of
cognitive development, "nature" explanation are commo nly associated
with arguments for innate abilities and IQ inheritabil                'ty. 3
                                                                      •
                                                                                It is,
however, important to point out that at the margin the dist inct ion
between nurture and nature effects is not totally resolved even
conceptually. These effects outlined above relate to physical
predispositions. But it is not clear, however, where behavioral
predispositions which cannot be explained by economic or educational
factors should be accounted.
                                —4—


       Inclusion of "history" as a determinant of health and cnpnitive
 dove] opmc n t reflects the recogniti on that t hose
                                                      processes flci'/ he

 event being the collection of healt h and     cogn I t I   ye dovelopmnnt
outcomes at a po Tnt in time) may be due I n some measure to the

occurrence of a prior event.    Stated alternativel y, even control 1 log
for nurture and nat ure inputs into developmental           p roce s   sos, observed
outcomes may not be temporal I y independent. For           cx amp 1   e, some health
conditions tend to be persisten t, such that poor health at birth or

the ecquist ion of certain condi tions in early ch I ldhood
                                                            may explain
the presence of th ese or other conditions later in the individual's

life, quite aside from interven ing or preceding nature and nurture

influences. Also, children who develop intellec tual sk ills early may
be able to use these ca rly abilities to      acquire greater          prof ic i en cy   in
other aspects of cogni tive deve 1 opme nt.    It is   I   mpo r tan t   to point
out that these history effects need not       be conce ptual ly restricted
to operate in univariate fashions.     Indeed, it is conceivable that
aspects of health and cognitive development are interc'ependent,

whereby, for example, poor early health coufd impede subsequent
cognitive development and below average levels of cognitive
development could interfere with the child's ability to maintain good
health.4

     ldhile it is likely that the child's history of health and

cognitive development is itself a function of various nurture and
nature variables, controlling for the history of these processes
will yield estimates of the structural links between different
                              —5—


ap?cts of health and cognitive development and also more precise
estimates of the effects of discretionary behavior as it is affected

by parents' education and family income. These structural links
usually cannot be identified in cross—section formulations because of

the lack of identifying restrictions provided by the underlying

theory. t'oreover, modelling these processes whereby past values of
health and cognitive development are explicitly controlled for
conforms more closely to classical experimental analysis.    Typically,
in laboratory experiments, assessment of an action's efficacy is made

by observing the initial state, administering a measured "dosage", and
then observing the final state, all in an effort to determine if and
to what extent the procedure had any impact. Different

;ital state and the intervening dosage are then related to the
observed final outcome in an attempt to explain the structure of a
process.   In the absence of a laboratory, the same conceptual

framework can be applied to the analysis of children's development by
observing a time series for a number of individuals. By treating a

particular child's history as a comparative benchmark, one can

identify temporal interdependence between processes and perhaps more
accurately measure the contributions of other variables to favorable
or unfavorable outcomes.

     In short, a completely specified model of children's develop—
rnent must be capable of incorporating all of the above as potential
sources of observed variation in measures of health and cognitive

development, as well as recognizing the possible relationships among
the three classes of determinants themselves.   It is well-knovin that
                                   —6—


Lhis latter point is a particularly troublesome stat ist ical issue,

since    "nature'' va riables   are in practice unobserved, arid even in

principle    nay not be observable or measurable.       In t be absence of

information on this potential determinant, variance in observed

outcomes may be incorrectly ascribed to other observed determinants,

especially       since it is commonly argued that "nature" is correlated

with both history and nurture.
        An analogy between this problem and the familiar ahi1ityhias
problem in estimates of earnings functions is apparent.          If aM] ity is

correlated with the observed level of completed school ing, and if both
influence earnings, then an estimated earnings function which

disregards ahil ity will yield school ing coefficients which are biased
,-ards. As a solution to this specification problem when ability is

not observed, Chamberlain (1977,1978) has proposed joint modell ing of
equations for all observed variables which may be indicators of an
unobserved factor or factors. Given a sufficient set of identifying
restrictions, the parameters of such equations, and the distributional
parameters of the, unobserved factor(s), can be estimated using a

random effects procedure.
        A linear formulation of such a model may be written

         One cautionary word should be expressed at this point. !hile the

vector structural equation (j) takes expi icit account of unobserved

variables, and while most discussions of unobserved variables in the
context of children's development have centered on genetic factors as
                                       —8—




 being the chief component of nature", unobserved variahles by their
 very nature have unobserved nan-es. The primary interest in this pnpe r
 is    not so much in assigning names and interpretations to the est!nmtL-d
 factor     structure, but rather in estimating the relationships 3n:orig

 health, cognitive development, and family background variables once
 the possibility of common determining factors is taken account of.


 II. The Data

          The model outl med in the preceding section is estimated using
 data from Cycles II and III of the U.S. Health Examination Survey
 (lIES)      Both sections of the survey collected extensive data on the
Cur ren t health and health histories for a nationally representative

 sampi e of children: Cycle II surveyed children aged 5 to 11 in the

early     1960s, and Cycle III surveyed adolescents aged 12 to 17 in the
late l960s.            In each case, data include results from a physician's
exam ination, scores from different tests, and surveys of the child's

pare nts and school.

        Ap p roxirnately 2200 of the children in Cycle II were re—surveyed
In C ycl e      III.    Of these, a final sample of 111314 was selected for
       ysi 5.     Because of cross—section evidence that the health and
cogn itiv C development processes differ significantly for blacks, they
VIC   re no t included in this sample, nor were observations with missing
data.      It   should be noted that there is considerably more ege
homogene it y in this longitudinal subset than in the overall

cross—sect ion surveys: in Cycle III, 99 percent of the adolesccmts in

the longit udinal subset were aged 12 to 15. The re—survey interval
                                 —9—



 of   this subsample averages 1j2 months, with 70 percent of the smiple

 intervals full ing between 36 and 1t8 months. While it is difficult
                                                                                 to
 assess the effects of even this limited age and interval

 heterogeneity   on the est iniates of the model   , it   is unl ikel y   that Cny
 of   the main results will be substantially affected. Using t lie s:ime
 data,   Shakotko, Edwards, and Grossman (1980) found Li-at cent roll I ng
 for these variables did not inmost cases contribute signifi cantly to
 their Inodelts explanatory power.
                                 In any case, both measures of
cognitive development and one measure of health used in this analysis
are age—adjusted•
      Specifically, the analysis examines the       relationships among
thirteen variables. The primary focus is on         two measures of cog—
nit lye development and two measures of health:           (1) the Wechsler
Intelligence Scale for Children (WSC); (2) the Wide Range Achievenient
Test (WRAT); (3) the age— and sex-adjus ted periodontal index, which is
a nleasure of oral health (APERI);6 (4) the diagnosis of a "significant

abnormality" by the examining physician (ABN). Each of these four
variables is reported in Cycles II and III, and to distinguish the two

measures of each variable, the post—scr ipt "1" is used to denote a
Cycle II value and "2" to denote a CycI e III value. WISC, WRAT, and
APERI are all continuous            and and .ABN is a dichotomous
var lab le taking the value of one if
                                      an abnormal Ity was found and zero
orwise.
     Other healt h measures included to control for

                                                                   wh i ch

affects current physical activities, or could affect future
activities8 The periodontal index (APERI) was used
                                                   because it is
perhaps the most sensitive to differential levels of family health

investment, and hence may be best indicative of preventive medical
care.

     Without doubt, this analysis is restrictive, not only in its
consideration of relatively few measures of health and cognitive
dcvelopmen, but also in its limited consideration of other ob-
servable variables that may affect developmental processes. A

detailed examination of other variables was conducted by Edwards and
Grossman (107W) arid Shakotko, Edwards, and Grossnan (1280); these

studies have shown that most other variables contribute relatively

little to explaining the variance of the measures analysed here.

are writt on             as linear functions of family income, parents' education,
and initi al             health (FYPFI, LIGHT). T o complete th e model ,             family
income is presumed to depend on the education of each                         of t he parents,
and "firs t-year              poor health" (FYPH) on low birth we i ght
education and low birth weight are not presumed to depend on any
observable variable.                It is apparen t that this ii near spec I ficat ion

corresponds to restrictions on the elements of th e matrix B in (1).
        To thi s specification of the                             links    between observable
variables is added different specifications of                       an   unobserve d factor
structure.           Est imat es of two models are report ed here.               In   the   first,
the factor space is presumed to be                                   nal, with on e     factor
operating in the heal th equations (AEN2, APERI2, ABN1, APERI2, FYPH,
LIGHT) and the other operating in the cognitive development equa—

tions (UISC2, WRAT2, WISC1, WRAT1), each with equal effects in the
equations determining income and parents' education (FArIINC, FAThED,
MUTHED). The factors are normal ized to have unit variance, and tie

  correlation between the two factors is a parameter to he

  determine   y (i.e. that A=O in (1)). In the discussion
                                                           following,
  this is referred to as the zero—factor model . In both
                                                         the two—factor
 and zero—factor specifications the
                                          unsystematic stochastic effects in
 each equation (the elements of the vector       c     in (1)) are presumed   to
 be uncorre]ated, except in the case of. the two education

 This constrains the covariance matrix
                                             to be nearly diagonal,
 with the one exception noted above.
                                          It can he verified that these
 implied restrictions are
                             sufficient to identify all the unrestricted
 parameters   of (4).
      To a large extent, the empirical

            so that the zero—factor model serves as a
                                                             comparative
 benchmark    Two empirical questions underlie       the use of a model with
unobserved factors: (1) can a model
                                     which takes account of such
factors better explain the observed pattern of health and
                                                          cognitive
development? and (2) how do the estimates of such a model differ
                                                                 from
those based solely on observed determinants?
     The two specifications
                              were estimated by maximizing (4) with
respect to the unknown and
                             unconstrained elements of B, A,      and Z
 Since B is constrained to be triangular and S nearly
                                                        diagonal, the
estimates of the zero—factor
                               model are equivale to those obtained by
estimating each structural equation
                                      in (1) by OLS. This makes these
estimates generally comparable to those reported in Edwards
                                                              and
Grossman (1978.) and Shakotko,
                                Edwards, and Grossman (1930), 2nd it is
easily verified that the estimates are very similar.

        Gie sl.ould point out that the presence of dichotomous
                                                               variables
 in   the vector    y violates the normality assumpt ion    impl icit in the
 proposed likelihood function (4), so that maximization of (4) is a
 quasi—i ikel ihood procedure. A correct likelihood specification to
 take account of the dichotomous variables, or a two—stage procedure
 such   as that   suggested by Heckman (19724, would he methodologically
 superior, but the computational difficulties for this thirteen
equation model make such techniques impractical.

        Tables 2 and 3   present estimates of the matrix B for the
two—factor and zero—factor models. Table            presents the e imated
matrix   of   factor loadings in the two—factor model. The remainder of
this    section summarizes the main results.


Ca) Interactions Cetween Health and Cognitive Development


        It was argued    in Section I that   the use of longitudinal data and
the inclusion of Cycle II data in the Cycle III equations is
                                                             one way
to assess the structural dependencies between measures of health and

cognitive deve lopment.    The underlying question is whether each
temporal event     (an event being a particular outcome for tJISC, WRAT,
APERI, ABN) de pends on previous events, or whether it        is the result of
an independent     drawing from a particular    distribution whose parameters
depend on some set of observed and unobserved background variables)-0
In terms of th e estimates reported in Table 2, the coefficient on each

variable's own lagged value is a measure of univariate dependence,

or structural persistence, in each process. The coefficients on

of APERI]. (i.e. poor oral health) are associated with high WISC

scores. Even though the magnitude of this effect is sirall (a one
standard deviation change in APERI1 re suits In a 0.0! standard

deviation change in WISC2), the coeffi cientis significant, and the
direction of the effect is contrary to what one might expect from a

structural relationship. The coeffici ent may, however, reflect a
substitution effect in                        population, in the sense that
some famil ics may choose to make time and income investments directed

toward health, and other fami lies investments directed toward

cognitive development of children.

 (b) Income and   Education Effects


       In all the c-quations reported in
                                           Tables 2 and 3, family income is
 not a significant determining factor in the two—factor model. This is
 in contrast to the est imates of the zero—factor
                                                    model,   •-here I FiCOmC
 has a significant positive effect on both VISC and
                                                    WRAT.        It should be
 noted,   moreover, that in the two—factor model, the point estftiates of
 these and other income effects are
                                    substantially smaller than those in
 the zero—factor model, so that the insignificance does not arise

 totally frorii larger standard errors.

      On the other hand, the two—factor model confirms many of the

education effects in the zero—factor model, and in some cases, the

       estimates are larger.    In the WISC2 and kRAT2 equations, the
effect of a marginal year of father's education increases from 0.223
to 0.906 and 0.1141 to 0.543 respectively.     Mother's education is less
significant in these equations, but nevertheless, the point estimates

show this same pattern of increase. The education estimates are
generally significant and of the same order of magnitude in the WISC1
and WRAT1 equations.

      In the health equations, parents' education is significant in

both APERI equations, although at marginal confidence levels. This is
not the case in the AEN equations, where neither the coefficients nor
the confidence levels are large.

     Two other equations linking observed variables were also esti-

mated jointly with the Cycles I I and III health and cognitive de—
ve1opgnc.n equations.   In the first, family income was supposed to
                                       — 21 —




   depend on parents' education.             It is found that a marginal year of
  father' s c duca t ion
                             contributes on average $528 and mother's education
  $351. Evaluated at the mean level of income,
                                               these estimates
  imp) y rates of retu rn       of 6.5 and .5 percent respectively, which are
  ccrnparable to other estimates of earnings functions.
                                                                     The second
  equation supposes t hat "first—year poor health"
                                                   depends to some Cx t en             t
  on low birth weight. A
                           positive effect is found in both models, but
  in neither case is it significant,



  Cc) Factor Loadings



            A casual inspection of Table      Ij, which   shows the estimated factor
 dings in the two—factor model , suggests
                                          that a large part of the

cont r ibut     ing Positively to WISC and WRAT. Squaring the
                                                                            of the
factor Ic ading to the standard
                                deviation ofthe
dependent variable yields the p
                                 roportion of variance explained by the
factor.   In the case of WISC, t his proportion is about 53
                                                            percent in
both Cyc les II and III.  In the case of WRAT, the proportion is
                                                                  40

that they contribute to higher levels of WISC and V/RAT and better

health, one might expect that if these factors are generationally
related, they should also be positively related to income and
education levels. The estimates confirm
                                                        this expectation, although
for neither income nor education are the estimated loadings

significantly different from zero. This insignificance may reflect
more of an attenuation in the factor communal ities between parents
and children than the absence of common factors in these "parents'"

equations, Despite the insignificance, the point estimate for

education is fairly large. One positive standard deviation in either
factor is associated with O.3!j additional years of school ing for
each parc-nt.

 with a standard error of
                            0.100, indicating a significant positive
 relationship between the health and
                                         cogniie development factors.
      One final issue should be
                                  addressed, namely that of the
 goodness—of—fit of each of the models. Under
                                              the assucrpt ion of
 normal ity, —2L(max) 5   distributed
                                    as x2 (q), where q=n(n+1)/ — p and
 p is the number of parameters to be
                                     estimated, and where n is the nun-
 her of equations. For the
                            two—factor model, x2 (10) was estimated        to he
 18.29, which falls within the 90 percent confidence region; this
 indicates that the null hypothesis of a two—factor model, together
with effects from observed
                            variables, cannot b e rejected at the 90
percent level in ex-plaining the observed relat
                                                ior.ships between health,
cognitive development, and                         As a comparison, the
x2—statistic for the zero—factor model was over
                                                 100, indicating that
rd iance on observable variables alone is not S
                                                ufficient to
satisfactorily explain the covariance structure of these variables.
     It should be noted that a similar one-facto
                                                 r model was also
estimated; the estimates, which are not repOrted
                                                  here, were very close
to those of the two—factor model, and indeed man
                                                 y of the standard
errors were reduced. The x2 —statistic for this model (with 14 d.f)
was estimated at 2g.94, which does not fall with in the 99 percent
confidence region.  In any case, it suggests    that the two—factor
estimates, and                             relate observed variables,   a r e

fairly robust with respect to specification of the factor
                                                          structure.

 IV. Conclusions and Implications
      This ann I ys is has shown   that     the introduction of unohse rved
 factors into an empirical model explaining chajidren's health and
co1;nitive development adds considerably more explanatory pouer to such
models.   tiore notably, some findings from previous empirical models

are confirmed and strengthened, and other findings rejected.            The
sionificant results from the policy—makers point of view center on
the effects of parents' education and family income. Parents'

education is a significant positive contributor to cognitive develop-
ment and oral health. No significant relationship was found between
parents' education and diagnosed abnormalities.           Contrary to other
studies, income was found to play an insignificant role in both the
health and cognitivt development processes.

     The implication is that an incomes' policy will not have a net

impact on children's development. What cannot be distinguished here,
of course, is whether increased income has both beneficial and detri-
mental effects which may be offsetting. As such, an incomes' policy

combined with other programs may yield net benefits.
     While the model considered here is limited in its consideration
of explanatory and explained variables, and while the statistical

methodology is second—best in that it makes imperfect normality

assumptions, the general techniques seem worthy of future investig—
at ion with other data and other measures of health.

6. Low values of APERI indicate better oral health.

      A dummy variable was used instead of a continuous measure of
      birth weight since it is likely that
                                           the relationship between
      birth weight and poor subsequent health is non—linear.
8. Of course, the dichotomous nature of ABN precludes measurement
   of the severity of these conditions. A more rigorous speci-
   fication of health would use a combination of AEN and a
                                                           severity
   index or else an indicator vector of different health conditions.

g Quite aside from any considerations
                                       in this model, a theory of
   matching would predict that spouses' education levels are
   Positively correlated. To purge thi s effect from the model
   a non—zero covariance between the stochastic effects in the
   education equations was permitted. An estimate of this covar-
      iance is reported in Table 4.
