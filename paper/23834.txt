                                         ABSTRACT

Ex-post firm heterogeneity can result from different strategies to overcome labor market
imperfections by ex-ante identical firms—with far-reaching consequences for the welfare effects
of trade. With asymmetric information about workers’ abilities and costly screening, in
equilibrium some firms screen and pay wages based on the true productivity of their workers, and
some firms do not screen and pay wages based on the average productivity of their workforce.
Screening firms are larger, attract better workers and pay lower effective wages. This results in
excessive consumption of resources by large firms relative to the social optimum. Trade
liberalization then has an ambiguous effect on aggregate welfare: lower trade costs improve
access to foreign goods but also exacerbate the labor market distortion as more resources are
transferred to large firms. The model highlights the need to know why firms “excel” before
drawing welfare conclusions regarding cross firm reallocations of resources.

1    Introduction
Large, multiproduct, exporting rms account for a large share of output, employment and
trade, and this share is growing (Bernard et al., 2007; Shane, 2012; Criscuolo and Menon,
2014; Caruso, 2015; Bernard and Okubo, 2016; U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2017). For
some, this outcome is the result of market forces that e¢ciently allocate resources to the most
e¢cient rms. Others are pointing out that these developments may be driven by market
failures based on factor market imperfections and call for support for small businesses (for
recent discussions of these issues see e.g. Hurst and Pugsley, 2011; Mirrlees et al., 2011;
Restuccia and Rogerson, 2013; WTO, 2016 or Hsieh and Klenow, 2017). There are also
concerns that these large rms may enjoy market power in labor markets, and that this may
have contributed to the fall in the labor share of income in industrialized countries (Autor
et al., 2017; Krueger, 2018).
    This issue is particularly important in the context of international trade. Many empirical
studies have shown that the majority of all export value is generated by large rms (Bernard
et al., 2007; Freund and Pierola, 2015; Bernard et al. 2018), and it is these large exporting
  rms that are bene ting most from reductions in international trade costs, whether they
are induced by trade policies or by technological advances. As a consequence international
trade is an important driver of the reallocations of resources towards large rms, and these
reallocations are an important component of the overall welfare e¤ects of international trade.
    In this paper we show that to assess the welfare implications of the increased concentration
of economic activity in large rms requires a knowledge of exactly why these rms are so
large. We present a new model where ex post di¤erences in rm size and productivity
are generated by di¤erent strategies to overcome labor market imperfections by ex ante
identical rms. The resulting industry structure exhibits many facts that are consistent
with recent empirical ndings: Larger rms are more productive, more likely to export (to
more destinations), produce more products, pay higher wages, employ a more productive
workforce and screen their workers more intensively. However, the resulting equilibrium
is ine¢cient because too much labor is employed in large rms. This has two important
implications: First, there is an incentive to subsidize small rms, and second, a reallocation
of labor towards large rms has a rst order negative welfare e¤ect that can even dominate
traditional gains from trade.
    The importance of reallocations for the welfare e¤ects of trade is currently debated in a
growing literature. Melitz and Redding (2015) and Dhingra and Morrow (2016) point out
that if the open economy equilibrium is socially optimal, these reallocations must necessarily
enhance the welfare gains from trade. This is an important result because it applies to


                                               1
the most popular framework in current trade theory, the monopolistic competition model
with CES demand (as in Melitz, 2003). Melitz and Redding (2015) also point out that if
the allocation is socially e¢cient, the welfare e¤ects of trade-induced reallocations are only
second order e¤ects, which follows directly from an application of the envelop theorem.
    Motivated by the importance of the social e¢ciency for these welfare results, some studies
have looked at the welfare e¤ects when the market equilibrium is not socially e¢cient. The
focus of these studies has been on ine¢ciencies in the product market. Arkolakis et al.
(2019) and Feenstra (2018) study the welfare e¤ects in the presence of demand systems that
provide variable mark-ups and show that the reallocation of resources towards rms with
larger mark-ups tends to reduce the gains from trade relative to a case with constant mark-
ups (Arkolakis et al., 2019), while a reduction in average mark-ups tends to a¤ect welfare
positively (Feenstra, 2018). The size of the two e¤ects depends on assumptions regarding
demand and the rm size distribution.
    These studies assume that di¤erences in measured productivity are driven by exogenous
di¤erences in marginal factor requirements, reecting true di¤erences in social e¢ciencies
across rms. This is where we deviate. The recent literature on the sources of productivity
di¤erences and on the matching of heterogenous workers with rms points to di¤erences
in the quality of a rms workforce as an important determinant for its productivity (e.g.
Irarrazabal, Moxnes and Ulltveit-Moe, 2013; survey by Grossman, 2013). And this matching
process is subject to many market imperfections that can lead to socially ine¢cient alloca-
tions of labor across rm types (Greenwald, 1986; Bloom and Van Reenen, 2011; Manning,
2011). A key problem in hiring talented workers is how to identify talent, and a large litera-
ture in labor and personnel economics has identi ed compensation policy as an appropriate
(and widely used) tool to induce self-selection by quality (see Lazear and Shaw, 2007, Oyer
and Schaefer, 2011, Bandiera et al., 2015, for recent overviews and empirical evidence). The
focus of this paper is to study the role of these labor market imperfections for the endogenous
formation of productivity di¤erences across rms, and for the welfare e¤ects of trade, with
a particular focus on the trade-induced reallocations across rm types.
    Our analysis is conducted in a version of the Yeaple (2005) model of endogenous rm
heterogeneity in which information asymmetries give rise to labor market ine¢ciencies. In
our model, workers ability is private information on the labor market. Firms can adopt
high-tech technologies for which high ability workers have a comparative advantage, or they
can use an old technology in which worker ability is less crucial. To implement the high-
tech technology, rms must invest in a human resources screening technology to identify the
quality of workers.
    In this setting, rms that invest in the high-tech technology have two advantages relative


                                              2
to those that do not. First, their choice of technology lowers their marginal cost as it does in
the original Yeaple (2005) paper. Second, their information advantage in the labor market
confers onto them a form of market power. Because they select the best workers, adopting
 rms pay high wages, yet in equilibrium these wages do not fully compensate workers for
their ability so that adopting rms have lower e¤ective labor costs than non-adopting rms.1
These lower e¤ective labor costs allow these rms to grow and to expand into non-core
activities, such as more product lines (as in extension 5.1) or exporting to more distant
markets (as in appendix 7.2).
    In equilibrium, the labor market recruiting advantage of large rms induces them to
consume too many resources relative to the social optimum. This is because the marginal
(most skilled) worker in small rms is paid a wage that reects the average productivity of
the labor pool and not her (higher) individual productivity. We show that an employment
subsidy to small rms can achieve the socially optimal level of output by allocating more
skilled workers to small rms.2 Many industrialized countries do, in fact, have policies in
place that favor small, non-exporting businesses. They are oftened viewed with scepticism
and criticized as being the source of misallocations themselves. Our results suggest that
these policies may deserve a re-evaluation in the light of the distortions described here. This
policy implication of subsidizing small rms, however, is exactly opposite to the implications
of models where the ine¢ciency is in the product market. Nocco, Ottaviano and Salto (2017)
point out that in a framework with ex ante rm heterogeneity and variable mark-ups, optimal
trade policy should promote the sales of large (low cost) rms. This shows once again the
need to know why some rms "excel" and other do not before drawing policy conclusions.
    Our model has important implications for the welfare e¤ects of a trade liberalization.
In the absence of a corrective subsidy to smaller rms, the impact of trade liberalization
on aggregate welfare is ambiguous. On the one hand, a trade liberalization directly raises
welfare through cheaper access to foreign produced goods as in standard models. On the
other hand, a trade liberalization leads to a reallocation of resources from small to large
 rms and so worsens the market imperfection. This constitutes a rst order negative welfare
e¤ect that can dominate the positive traditional gains from trade. Whatever the aggregate
welfare impact, our model predicts that trade liberalization worsens income inequality as the
   1
     In many models that generate the result that productive rms pay higher wages, labor institutions
require rms to share rents with workers (e.g. Egger and Kreickemeier, 2009). Here, exactly the opposite
obtains. Information asymmetries give employers an edge in the labor market and so workers share rents on
their skill with rms.
   2
     In our baseline model, we consider a scenario in which rms can enter freely as either small or large
 rms. We show in extension 5.3 that if rms are intrinsically heterogeneous that the result continues to hold.
Rather than there being too many large rms and too few small rms, large rms are too large and small
 rms are too small relative to the social optimum.

real income of high ability workers rises and the real income of low ability workers falls.
    The key assumptions of our paper that skilled workers have a comparative advantage
using low marginal cost technologies and that rms make managerial investments in hu-
man resource management have received growing support in the empirical literature that
uses matched employer-employee data. For instance, Bender et al. (2016) consider de-
tailed employer-employee data from Germany. They show that average employee ability is
higher for rms using advanced management practices and that a substantial portion of the
productivity advantages of these rms can be attributed to their use of better workers.3
Further, the authors directly document on-going selection by higher productivity rms of
better-than-average employees,4 writing

           ....better managed rms are able to build up a superior stock of employees
       through selective hiring and attrition. In particular, examining job inows and
       outows at the plants in our sample, we nd that those with higher management
       scores are more likely to recruit higher ability workers (measured by the perma-
       nent component in their earnings) and are less likely to lay o¤ or re the highest
       skilled workers in the period between 2004 and 2009. (p. 3)

    As in Yeaple (2005), our model predicts wage strati cation across rms within industries
as workers select into rms that have adopted di¤erent technologies and that wage dispersion
across rms should rise in response to trade liberalization. Unlike Yeaple (2005), our model
also predicts greater wage dispersion within large, exporting rms than within small, non-
exporters as it is these larger rms that have the informational advantage that allows them
to compete for talent in the work force. Recent research by Becker et al. (2017) con rms that
this is indeed the case among German rms: as rms become larger residual wage dispersion
within rms grows.
    Our paper is also related to Helpman, Itskhoki, and Redding (2010). In their paper,
  rms cannot observe worker ability and need to engage in costly screening to receive a noisy
signal about their ability. Firms have an incentive to screen because the productivity of
individual workers depends on the average ability of the workforce, so workers with a very
low ability have a negative marginal product. In their framework, workers and rms are
matched randomly and rents from search frictions are divided by symmetric bargaining.
   3
     Friedrich (2017) uses matched employer-employee data for Belgium to show that high productivity rms
invest in identifying more talented managers and then subsequently invest more heavily in their human
capital accumulation. He models this empirical phenomenon as stemming from internal labor markets that
arise from asymmetric learning and rm-speci c human capital.
   4
     Using similar German data, Card et al. (2013) establish that a signi cant portion of rising inequality
among German workers can be attributed to increasing plant-level productivity heterogeneity and rising
assortativeness in the assignment of workers to establishments.

                                                    4
As a result, there is endogenous ex-post heterogeneity in worker composition across rms,
but the allocation of resources is socially optimal. As in Helpman, Itskhoki, and Redding
(2010), we emphasize the imperfect observability of workers abilities and the need for costly
screening to overcome this imperfection. Unlike Helpman, Itskhoki, and Redding (2010),
our framework exhibts asymmetric information and self-selection that leads to an ine¢cient
matching of workers and rms.
    Our paper contributes to the literature that explores how market imperfections in the
presence of heterogeneous rms may a¤ect the welfare impact of trade. Much of the recent
literature has focused primarily on the product market by investigating the role of interna-
tional trade on the reallocation of resources across rms that charge di¤erent mark-ups over
their marginal cost (for example, see Arkolakis et al., 2019, Nocco, Ottaviano and Salto,
2017, and Edmond, Midrigan and Xu, 2015). In these settings, the key resource problem is
that the most e¢cient rms are too small from a social point of view because they charge
the highest mark-ups. In our setting, there is too much entry of large rms that stems from
their arti cially low cost of labor.5
    Finally, our framework also provides useful insights with respect to the measurement
of misallocations in the spirit of Hsieh and Klenow (2009). We show that in the social
optimum, measures of total factor productivity - revenue (TFP-R) are not equalized across
  rms, not even if they are adjusted for average input quality. Thus, di¤erences in TFP-
R measurements, whether adjusted for input quality or not, are neither a necessary nor a
su¢cient condition for a misallocation.
    The remainder of this paper is organized into ve sections. Section 2 introduces the
model assumptions and characterizes the equilibrium. Section 3 provides an analysis of
the welfare implications of labor market imperfections. The resource allocation and welfare
implications of international trade liberalization are explored in section 4. Section 5 provides
some extensions to our basic framework before concluding.


2       Model
In this section, we present the closed economy version of our model. We begin with the
model assumptions and then characterize the equilibrium.
    5
     Costinot, Rodriguez-Clare and Werning (2016) show that in a rm heterogeneity model a social planner
can improve a countrys welfare by raising tari¤s on the most e¢cient exporters while leaving marginal
exporters untaxed. This result is fundamentally di¤erent than ours as there is no rationale in their setting
for subsidizing little rms.

2.1     Key Assumptions
2.1.1   Demand

On the demand side, we are not making any new or speci c assumption but follow Krug-
man (1980). Consumers derive utility from the consumption of horizontally di¤erentiated
varieties. The utility function of a consumer is CES:
                                       Z                          1

    Direct demand for variety i 2 (the set of actually produced varieties) is then given by

                                            i2


2.1.2   Production

There are two types of factors of production: Management M and labor L. Management
is a homogeneous factor that is used as our numéraire. As in Yeaple (2005), labor consists
of a continuum of heterogeneous workers with skills (or productivity) z. The distribution
of skills in the economy is described by the probability density function g (z) with positive
                                                                                 R z~
support over [z; 1) (z > 0) and its cumulative distribution function G (~  z ) = z g (z) dz.
    Production of a variety x (i) requires xed costs f in units of management plus marginal
costs in units of (e¤ective) labor c~. These marginal costs are constant with respect to output
and consist of a unit labor requirement        (in units of e¤ective labor) and a factor cost
component c: c~ = c. In our baseline scenario, we abstract from di¤erences in across rms
and/or varieties and normalize to one:          = 1. In our "Extensions" sections we discuss
  rm speci c unit labor requirements as well as variety speci c unit labor requirements in the
context of multiproduct rms. The xed costs f and the factor cost component c are rm
speci c and will be indexed by a rm subscript j.
    The productivity of individual workers depends on the skills of these workers and on the
technology used by the rm. There are two technologies available. In one technology, call it


                                                   6
low-tech, skills of workers are proportionate to their e¤ective supply of labor a (z). In this case
a worker with skill z has an e¤ective supply of labor of aL (z) = z. In the other technology,
call it high-tech, a worker with skill z has an e¤ective supply of labor of aH (z) > z, where
aH (z) = aL (z) = z, a0H (z)  1 and a00H ( zj z > z) > 0. Thus, a worker with a higher skill has
an absolute advantage in both technologies, and a comparative advantage in the high-tech
technology. This is essentially the same assumption as in Yeaple (2005). Since aL (z) = z,
we can drop the index H in aH (z).
    Since the high-tech technology is superior to the low-tech technology, rms would always
prefer to use the high-tech technology. However, we assume that the high-tech technology
requires knowledge of the true productivity of workers, and this information is not available
to all rms. In the absence of a screening technology, rms do not observe the productivity of
any given worker. It is this information asymmetry that gives rise to the market imperfection.
A screening technology exists but is only available to a rm if it incurs a higher xed cost
fh (in units of management). We will refer to rms that invest in the screening technology
as high-tech rms (h) and rms that do not as low-tech rms (l) and assume that

                                               fh > fl .                                            (4)

One can think of this screening technology as an investment in a human resource sta¤ that
can accurately assess productivity. Firms that have incurred the higher xed costs fh can
immediately evaluate the productivity of all workers while rms that have not acquired the
screening technology can never observe the productivity of any individual worker. There are
no learning e¤ects. Thus, a rm that has invested in the screening technology knows the
productivity of its workers and can use the more advanced technology. A rm that has not
invested in this screening technology must use the less advanced technology.6

2.1.3    Market Structure and Timing

The market for the homogeneous factor management M is perfectly competitive, and the
wage of a unit of management is normalized to one. Workers L are fully informed about their
own productivity z but rms know only the distribution of productivity in the population,
G (z), which is common knowledge. We relax the latter assumption in an extension.
   This is a one shot game that occurs in four stages. All agents have rational expectations
and perfect foresight.
  6
     Our narrative here suggests that rms pay a higher xed cost for the screening technology and receive
the more advanced technology as a side e¤ect. But the two bene ts (screening and technology) really come
as package and our modelling is isomorphic to the alternative interpretation were rms pay the xed costs
for the advanced technology and this technology allows them to screen workers.


                                                   7
   In stage 1, rms enter and decide whether they want to pay fh and acquire the screening
technology or pay fl < fh without the screening technology. This determines their type:
Type-h rms pay fh , type-l rms pay fl . There is a continuum of rms of both types and
their masses will be denoted by nj (j 2 fh; lg).
   Once rms have made their entry and screening technology investments, two labor mar-
kets open. Firms that have made the screening investment, j = h, operate in one labor
market while rms that have not made the screening investment, j = l, operate in the other.
Let the set of workers that ultimately choose to be in labor market j be denoted as Zj .
   We refer to the labor market associated with rms j = h as the frictionless labor market
because all information regarding workers in that labor market is known by all rms. Perfect
competition implies that the wage of worker 1 relative to worker 2 with skills z1 , z2 2 Zh
and productivities a (z1 ) and a (z2 ) satisfy the no arbitrage condition w1 =w2 = a (z1 ) =a (z2 ).
   We refer to the labor market associated with rms j = l as the frictional labor market
because individual worker productivies, z 2 Zl , are known only to the workers. The inability
of rms j = l to verify workers productivities requires that there must be a single wage
w = wS for all z 2 Zl .
   In stage 2, workers choose whether to enter the frictionless or the frictional labor market.
They make this choice with perfect foresight regarding the wage they would receive in each
labor market.
   In stage 3, both frictionless and frictional labor markets clear. And nally in stage
4, production occurs and product markets are cleared. Firms compete via monopolistic
competition. Individual products are atomistic and there is no strategic interaction.


2.2     Closed Economy Equilibrium
This section characterizes the equilibrium to our closed economy model. Each stage is
analyzed in sequence starting from stage 4 and progressing backward to stage 1.

2.2.1   Product Market Clearing

Given demand (2) and a market structure of monopolistic competition, the pro t-maximizing
price of rm j is a constant mark-up over its marginal costs:

                                                        
                                        p (cj ) =               cj ,                            (5)
                                                           1
where j denotes rm type j 2 fh; lg. Since all rms have access to the same technology,
and demands are symmetric across all products, all rms within one type will be symmetric.

2.2.2   Factor Market Clearing

Worker sorting in stage two leads to segmentation of labor markets by rm type. The labor
market equilibrium for type j 2 fh; lg is

                                                     ~j,
                                             nj xj = L                                 (10)

where L~ j is the e¤ective supply of labor available to rms of type j. Since workers sort in
stage two, this variable is given at this stage, and the labor market equilibrium determines
the e¤ective labor cost, cj , facing rms of type j. In both labor markets j 2 fh; lg rms are
atomistic and take wages as given.
   Market clearing of the numéraire factor (management M ) requires that

                                         nh fh + nl fl = M .                           (11)

It is implied in general equilibrium.

2.2.3      Worker Sorting

Workers can observe whether a rm has invested in the screening technology or not. Thus,
they can decide whether they want to apply for a job in a high-tech rm (h) or in a low-tech
 rm (l) by choosing the respective labor pool. There are no di¤erences in non-pecuniary job
returns, so this decision is entirely based on di¤erences in wages.
    The labor market of high-tech rms (h) is perfectly competitive. After screening, the
true productivity of workers is known by all rms in this labor market segment, and they
can pay a wage to individual workers based on this workers true productivity. Anticipating
correctly the e¤ective wage ch determined in stage 4, rms of type-h pay

                                           wh (z) = ch a (z) .                                       (12)

   The labor market of low-tech rms (l) is only imperfectly competitive. Firms in this
labor market segment have not acquired the screening technology and hence never know the
true productivity of their workers. But they do know the distribution of productivities in
their labor market pool. Consequently, the wage rate cannot be conditioned on the true
productivity of any particular worker, but rather depends on the expected productivity of a
representative bundle of workers in this labor market segment:7

                                             wl = cl El (z) ,                                        (13)

where cl is the e¤ective wage rate in this labor market segment.
    Given that wages di¤er between these two types of rms, each worker can decide whether
he or she wants to apply for a job in the frictionless labor market of high-tech rms or in the
frictional labor market of low-tech rms. The wage of a worker with productivity z is thus

                                    w = max fcl El (z) ; ch a (z)g .                                 (14)

       The following proposition describes the sorting outcome:

Proposition 1 (Sorting) In an economy that features both high- and low-tech rms, there
exists at least one stable equilibrium that is characterized by a z~ so that workers with z > z~
will choose to work for high-tech rms, and workers with z < z~ will choose to work for
   7
    Alternatively, one can simply assume that being technologically able to pay a piece rate wage requires
some investment, so that rms that pay the higher xed costs fh are able to pay a piece rate wage and rms
that only pay fl are not. This microfoundation for the wage setting scheme does not rely on any assumption
about screening.

Proof. Assume a z~ exists, so that El (z) = z zdG (z) =G (~               z ) = zl (~

dition (15) as zl (~   z ) =a (~
                                z ) = ch =cl . Using LHôpitals rule, we can determine the limits of
zl (~
     z ) =a (~
             z ) as z~ approaches the boundaries of the support: limz~!z [           zl (~
                                                                                          z ) =a (~
                                                                                                  z )] = 1 and
limz~!1 [  zl (~
                z ) =a (~
                        z )] = 0. Since zl (~ z ) =a (~
                                                       z ) is di¤erentiable, this proves existence of (at
least) one equilibrium with z < z~ < 1 for ch < cl . Furthermore, this equilibrium implies
sorting where the most productive workers work for type-h rms and the least productive
work for type-l rms: ch a (z) > cl zl (~        z ) for z > z~ and ch a (z) < cl zl (~ z ) for z < z~. This
equilibrium is stable if for  < z~, cl zl () > ch a (), and for  > z~, cl zl () < ch a (). Thus,
stability implies that zl () =a () is decreasing in  at  = z~ and requires that

                                                z ) [~

Since zl (~
           z ) =a (~
                   z ) is decreasing globally (from 1 to 0), at least one stable equilibrium must
exist. This equilibrium is unique if zl (~         z ) is monotonically decreasing.8
                                            z ) =a (~

                                                 [FIGURE 1 here]

    In Figure 1 we illustrate the equilibrium and its stability graphically. For illustrative
purposes, the function zl () =a () is not monotonic. Clearly, if cl zl () > ch a (), a worker
with skill  earns higher wages in type-l rms than in type-h rms. Thus, if  was a sorting
cuto¤, this would not be an equilibrium because the marginal worker would want to work
for type-l rms, leading to an increase in this cuto¤. Therefore, a stable equilibrium requires
that the zl () =a ()-function intersects ch =cl from above. In our Figure 1, equilibria E1
and E3 are stable, E2 is unstable. In what follows we only consider stable equilibria, so we
assume that (16) holds.
    One important implication of the sorting equilibrium is that

                                                        zl (~
                                                             z)
                                                 ch =           cl < c l .                                (17)
                                                         a (~z)

Thus, high-tech rms that have invested in the screening technology pay a lower e¤ective
wage rate (in e¢ciency units) than low-tech rms with no access to the screening technology.
   8
       If worker skills are Pareto distributed, inequality (16) always holds.

                                                           11
This has to hold in equilibrium because the productivity of the marginal worker is discretely
higher than the average productivity of all workers with a lower productivity: z~ > zl (~z ).
Therefore, low-tech rms have to pay a premium on the e¤ective wage rate of high-tech rms
in order to compensate their above-average workers for pooling them with below-average
workers.
   Note that the di¤erence in technologies enlarges the wage di¤erences in the two labor
market segments, but is not a necessary condition for the labor market segmentation.

Corollary 1 The di¤erence in technologies between type-h and type-l rms is neither nec-
essary nor su¢cient for the sorting equilibrium.

Proof. If aH (z) = aL (z) = z equation (17) reduces to ch = [          zl (~
                                                                            z ) =~
                                                                                 z ] cl , where the term
zl (~
     z ) =~
          z is larger than the term zl (~
                                         z ) =a (~
                                                 z ) in proposition 1 but behaves identically at the
limits.
     Yeaple (2005) has shown that di¤erences in technologies combined with comparative
advantages of skilled workers in certain types of technologies can lead to positive assortative
matching of workers to rms. Here we show that this sorting is reinforced by information
asymmetries in the labor market. In fact, we even show that these information asymmetries
alone can lead to a sorting equilibrium where skilled workers choose a di¤erent working
environment than unskilled workers.
     In a sorting equilibrium, we can now also determine the e¤ective supplies of labor L          ~ j for
the two types of rms from (10):

                        ~ l = LG (~

All types of rms can enter and exit freely. Within types, rms are symmetric. This implies
that their respective pro ts are driven down to zero. Given (9), this implies that

   We can now prove the following proposition:

Proposition 2 (Co-existence) In a free entry equilibrium, both types of rms (high-tech
and low-tech rms) will co-exist.

Proof. First note from (4) that high-tech rms have higher xed costs. Therefore, a nec-
essary condition for co-existence with free entry is that ch < cl , which is met [see (17)].
Second, we can show that an equilibrium with only one type of rm is inconsistent with
free entry: If z~ ! 1 (no high-tech rms), limz~!1 ch = cl limz~!1 [       zl (~
                                                                               z ) =a (~
                                                                                       z )] = 0 and
limz~!1  h = +1. Hence, high-tech rms must exist. If z~ ! z (no low-tech rms),
limz~!z ch = cl limz~!z [
                         zl (~
                             z ) =a (~
                                     z )] = cl and  l >  h (because fl < fh ). Hence, low-tech
  rms must exist. Inequality (4) is a necessary condition for co-existence.
    Proposition 2 is at the core of our theory. It shows how rms with di¤erent cost structures
can arise endogenously from ex ante identical rms due to labor market imperfections and
di¤erent strategies to deal with them. Co-existence of low-tech rms and high-tech rms is
only possible because the screening technology leads to sorting and allows rms to segment
labor markets. In the frictional labor market, rms pay a wage based on the average pro-
ductivity of workers in this labor market segment. Such a wage scheme implies an implicit
transfer of rents from the more productive workers in this segment to the less productive
workers. In the frictionless labor market, rms pay a wage based on the true productivity
of workers so that no transfer takes place between workers. In the frictionless labor market,
the implicit transfer is from workers to rms: Because high-skilled workers want to avoid
being pooled with low-skilled workers for their wages, they are willing to accept a discount
on their wages for not being pooled. This discount on wages is why high-tech rms can
co-exist despite their higher xed costs for screening.
    The di¤erences in the wage schemes between the two labor markets have important
implications for the allocative e¢ciency of resources. In the frictional labor market, rents go
from relatively high productive workers to less productive workers. But since all workers are
paid the same wage, this does not a¤ect the allocation of resources. In the frictionless labor
market, the rents are transferred from (high productivity) workers to rms because rms are

                                                13
paying a lower e¤ective wage. This induces them to expand and implies a misallocation of
resources. This will be important in the welfare analysis.
    Our framework has a number of interesting implications that are important for empirical
work or for welfare analysis. We present them here as corollaries of propositions 1 and 2:

Corollary 2 (Size) High-tech rms have higher sales than low-tech rms.

Proof. It follows directly from ch < cl that x (ch ) > x (cl ).
  High-tech rms have higher sales because they have lower marginal production costs.

Corollary 3 (Productivity) High-tech rms are more productive than low-tech rms as
measured by revenue per worker.

Proof. Using (5), (10), and (18), revenues per worker in high-tech rms 'h can be expressed
as
                                   p (ch ) x (ch )      
                          'h                        =     ch a
                                                              h (~
                                                                  z)                  (23)
                                L [1 G (~   z )] =nh    1
Similarly, revenues per worker in low-tech rms 'l can be expressed as

                                      p (cl ) x (cl )    
                               'l                    =     cl zl (~
                                                                    z)                      (24)
                                      LG (~  z ) =nl     1

Then, using the sorting condition (15), the ratio of the two productivity measures can be
expressed as
                                     'h    h (~
                                           a   z)
                                         =        >1                                 (25)
                                     'l     a (~
                                               z)

    Note that this result depends entirely on the sorting of workers, and not on the assumption
of di¤erent technologies across rms. The di¤erence in revenues per workers also shows up
when there is only one homogenous technology available and a (z) = z also holds for type-h
                              R1
 rms. In this case, ah (~
                         z )  z~ zdG (z) = [1 G (~  z )] and 'h ='l = a
                                                                       h (~
                                                                           z ) =~
                                                                                z > 1. Therefore,
high-tech rms generate higher revenues per worker because they employ more productive
workers and not because they use a di¤erent technology.

Corollary 4 (Wages) High-tech rms pay higher average wages.

Proof. Low-tech rms pay a at wage of wl = cl zl . High-tech rms pay wages based on indi-
                                                                    R1

                                                 14
   High-tech rms appear more productive despite paying higher wages because they have
a more productive labor pool and pass on the gains from the higher labor productivity only
incompletely.
   The following gure shows the pro le of wages as a function of worker productivity.

                                        [FIGURE 2 here]

    In Figure 2, the thick green line depicts the hockey stick pro le of wages as a function
of workers productivities. Workers in the range z 2 [z; z~) self-select into the frictional labor
market and work for low-tech rms. They receive a at wage given by wl = cl zl . Above z~,
workers decide to go on the frictionless labor market, work for high-tech rms and receive a
wage wh (z) = ch a (z). This gure also illustrates nicely why a sorting equilibrium implies
that the e¤ective wage cl in the frictional labor market has to be larger than the e¤ective
wage ch in the frictionless labor market. If low-tech rms paid the same e¤ective wage as
high-tech rms, wl = ch zl , then the wage for workers with above-average productivity z > zl
would be discretely lower in low-tech rms than in high-tech rms [ch zl < ch a (z) for all
z 2 (zl ; z~)]. Consequently, this could not be a sorting equilibrium. Instead, low-tech rms
have to pay a premium on the e¤ective wage rate, cl > ch , in order to compensate their
above-average workers for pooling them with below-average worker, so that cl zl = ch a (~      z ).
Put di¤erently, high-tech rms are able to obtain a rent from their workers in the form of a
lower e¤ective wage rate. This rent comes from allowing more productive workers to avoid
being pooled with less productive workers. In this sense, workers share rents on their ability
with rms rather than the other way around as is common in much of the literature on fair
wages.

2.2.5    General Equilibrium

For completeness we derive aggregate statistics that will be important in the welfare calcula-
tions below. With pro ts driven down to zero, aggregate income consists of labor income and
compensation for managers. Since management is used as our numéraire, their compensation
is normalized to one:


              Z    1                        Z     z~                  Z    1              
        EL            w (z) dG (z) + M = L cl          zdG (z) + ch            a (z) dG (z) + M .   (27)

With CES demand, a constant fraction of revenues goes to xed costs, and variable factors
receive the remaining (constant) fraction. In our framework, this implies that E = M , and

3      Welfare Implications of Labor Market Imperfections
This section analyzes the welfare implications of the information advantage of high-tech
 rms. We begin by solving for the optimal allocation of labor to rms as chosen by a social
planner that wishes to maximize aggregate real income. We then show that this is less labor
than is allocated in a market equilibrium because too many workers self-select into the high-
tech labor pool. We conclude the section by showing that the market imperfection can be
improved by a subsidy to employment at small rms.
   Given (1), aggregate welfare W can be expressed as

    Note that for this expression of welfare we have not used the sorting condition (15) to pin
down z~. But we have used the zero pro t conditions (19). Thus, maximization of (31) with
respect to z~ yields the constrained social optimum (as de ned in Dixit and Stiglitz, 1977).

       This leads us to proposition 3:

Proposition 3 (Social Optimum) A socially optimal allocation of labor z~ 2 (z; 1) ex-
ists that satis es z~ = a (~
                             z  ).

Proof. The rst derivative of (31) evaluated at z~ = z~ yields (34). The second deriv-
ative is negative by (16). Since  2 (0; 1) (because fh > fl ), limz~ !z z~ =a (~
                                                                                  z  ) = 1 and
limz~ !1 z~ =a (~
                  z  ) = 0, we have z~ 2 (z; 1).
    Intuitively, the social optimum requires that the marginal productivity of labor and
management are equalized across rm types. For the marginal productivity of labor, this
implies that9

Together, the two conditions yield (34).
   Now that we know the socially optimal allocation of labor we can compare the sorting
equilibrium to the social optimum. This leads to proposition 4:

Proposition 4 (Sorting E¢ciency) The sorting equilibrium leads to a socially ine¢cient
allocation of labor across rm types. Compared to the social optimum, employment in high-
tech rms is too high in the sorting equilibrium.

Proof. The social optimum in (34) requires that z~ =a (~z  ) = . The sorting equilibrium in
(22) yields zl (~
                 z ) =a (~
                         z ) = . When we combine the two, we obtain z~ =a (~
                                                                             z  ) = zl (~

   When we compare the social optimum in (34) with the market (sorting) equilibrium in
(22) it is immediately obvious that z~ < z~ because z (~
                                                         z ) < z~ 8 z~ 2 (0; 1). Therefore, the
market equilibrium allocates too little employment to low-tech rms, LG (~       z ) < LG (~z  ), and
too much employment to high-tech rms, L [1 G (~     z )] > L [1 G (~   z  )]. The social optimum
and the market equilibrium are illustrated in Figure 3.

                                        [FIGURE 3 here]

    The misallocation of labor is due to the fact that workers in low-tech rms receive a wage
based on the average productivity of the entire labor pool in low-tech rms, and not on the
individual productivity of the marginal worker in that pool. And since the productivity of
the average worker in the low-tech labor pool is lower than the productivity of the marginal
worker [ zl () < 8 2 (0; 1)], relative wages in low-tech rms are too low compared to the
social optimum [wh =wl (~ z ) > wh =wl (~
                                          z  )]. As a consequence, fewer workers self-select into
the low-tech labor pool than what is socially desirable and the mispricing of labor manifests
itself in too little employment in low-tech rms. Put di¤erently, while high-tech rms have
desirable characteristics (larger economies of scale, higher labor productivity, higher wages,
see corollaries 2 to 4), from a social perspective they collectively produce too much. In this
sense, there is too much of a good thing.
    It is also interesting to note that the overemployment in high-tech rms is due to too
much entry of high-tech rms, and not due to a distortion in their sizes. In fact, we can
prove the following corollary:

Corollary 5 Relative rm sizes are socially optimal in the market equilibrium.

Proof. By combining equations (7) and (20) we obtain for the relative sizes of rms in the
market equilibrium
                                           1

This is the same as (36) and it proves that xl =xh = xl =xh .
    This corollary shows that the mispricing of wages in low-tech rms in the market equi-
librium leads to too much entry of high-tech rms compared to the social optimum. Thus,
the distortion is in the measure of rms, but not in the relative sizes of rms. This insight
has an important implication. If relative sizes xl =xh are not distorted, the ratio of e¤ective
wages ch =cl = (xl =xh )1= is also not distorted and reects true shadow prices. In fact, rms
are behaving optimally, workers make distorted decisions. The (non-e¤ective) wages that
workers face do not reect social opportunity costs and make too many of them join the
high-tech labor pool.

                                          [FIGURE 4 here]

     Figure 4 illustrates the misallocation of labor graphically. It is based on our Figure 2
and shows the market valuation and the social valuation of workers with di¤erent skills in a
speci c allocation z~. The market valuation of a worker with skill z in high-tech rms is given
by w (z) = ch a (z) (the thick black line). Workers in high-tech rms are correctly valued so
the social valuation is equal to the market valuation. The market valuation of a worker with
skill z in low-tech rms is independent of z and given by wl = cl zl (~       z ) (the thick blue line).
The intersection of the two gives the market allocation z~. However, the social valuation of
workers in low-tech rms is not aligned with the market valuation. From a social point of
view, workers with skill z in low-tech rms should be valued at cl z (the thick red line). The
socially optimal allocation z~ is then given by the intersection of the two social valuations
ch a (z) and cl z. All workers with skill levels z < z~ are optimally allocated. They work for
low-tech rms, and their social valuation in low-tech rms is higher than the social valuation
in high-tech rms: cl z > ch a (z). All workers with skill levels z > z~ are also optimally
allocated. They work for high-tech rms (z > z~), and their social valuation in high-tech
  rms is higher: ch a (z) > cl z. It is workers with skill levels z 2 (~
                                                                       z ; z~ ) that are misallocated.
These workers work for high-tech rms (z > z~), but their social valuation is higher in low-
tech rms [cl z > ch a (z)]. Thus, it is only a subset of workers that are misallocated, and we
can now turn to a straightforward option to correct this misallocation.
     The misallocation of labor creates an incentive to subsidize employment in low-tech rms.
Since z~ < z~ , it follows that @W=@ z~ (~
                                          z < z~ ) > 0, and a reallocation of labor from high-tech
to low-tech rms (an increase in z~) increases welfare. To see how such a subsidy can increase
welfare assume that the government can subsidize employment in low-tech rms and nance
this subsidy with a non-distorting per capita tax on income. This changes equations (19)
(for j = l) and (27):
                                         A [cl (1 s)]1  = fl ,                                     (38)

                                  z                    z~

where s is the subsidy rate, cl (1 s) are after subsidy e¤ective labor costs in low-tech rms,
and scl zl (~
             z ) G (~
                    z ) L is the total subsidy paid.
   The allocation of labor in (22) changes to

                                         zl (~
                                              z)
                                                 =  (1     s) .                                   (40)
                                          a (~z)

Since zl (~
           z ) =a (~
                   z ) is decreasing in z~ by (16), an increase in s increases z~ and the subsidy is


                                                  19
e¤ective in raising employment in low-tech rms.
    Since the e¤ective real wage in low-tech rms continues to be pinned down by the free
entry condition, cl (1 s) P 1 = ( 1)  1 L 1 , the expression for welfare, equation (31)
is unchanged. Thus, the subsidy a¤ects welfare only through the allocation of labor z~,
dW=ds = (@W=@ z~) (d~  z =ds), and the optimal subsidy s is where @W=@ z~ = 0. We can
calculate this optimal subsidy as the percentage di¤erence between the average and the
marginal productivity in the low-tech labor pool, evaluated at the optimal allocation:

                                                    z~         zl (~
                                                                     z)
                                             s =                        .                               (41)
                                                               z~

Proposition 5 (Subsidy) There exists an optimal subsidy rate on employment in low-tech
 rms s 2 (0; 1) that corrects the misallocation of labor and reaches the social optimum, so
that z~ (s ) = z~ .

    In this setup, the market imperfections in the labor market create an incentive to subsidize
small, low-tech rms. These rms are too small to cover the costs of screening workers, and as
a consequence need to pool their workers and pay a wage based on the average productivity of
their work force. This strategy allows them to survive, but it creates a misallocation of labor
due to the fact that the marginal worker has a higher productivity than the average worker.
As a consequence, the employment share of small, low-tech rms is too small compared to
the social optimum, and a subsidy on employment in SPF can be welfare improving.11
    The corrective subsidy raises welfare because it induces a reallocation of workers from
high-tech to low-tech rms through the exit of high-tech rms and the entry of low-tech
 rms. The workers that switch from the high-tech pool to the low-tech pool in response to
the subsidy are more skilled than the workers previously working for low-tech rms. As a
consequence, productivity rises in subsidized rms. This implication is in line with recent
evidence that shows that subsidies targeted to small rms do indeed raise value added per
worker in treated rms as implied by our model (Lombardi, Skans and Vikström, 2018).
    In the Extensions, we show that under the alternative assumption of a xed number of
 rms the misallocation of labor manifests itself as high-tech rms that are too large and
ine¢cient relative to the social optimum. In that case the corrective subsidy works by
inducing low-tech rms to expand while inducing high-tech rms to downscale.
 11
      The intuition is similar to that pointed out in Greenwald and Stiglitz (1986) in a di¤erent context.

4        Open Economy
Let us now consider international trade in an open economy setting with two identical coun-
tries. International trade is costly in two dimensions: Entering a foreign market creates xed
costs of exporting f x , and shipping goods to foreign locations is subject to variable (iceberg)
trade costs  > 1. The two types of costs are identical for all rms.
    Pro ts in the domestic market continue to be given by (9). Pro ts in the export market
are given by
                                       xj = A ( cj )1  f x ,                              (42)

and total pro ts of an exporting rm are

                                                                        

                                                                 cj1              f x,
                                                             
                                                                            fj                    (43)

where the index t refers to trade.
    Using (19) for the domestic market, pro ts of exporting can be expressed as  xj =
 1  (fj   1 f x ). Depending on the value of trade costs   1 f x relative to domestic xed
costs fh and fl , we can distinguish between three cases:

        fl < fh <   1 f x : No exporting

        fl <   1 f x < fh : Exporting only by high-tech rms (Melitz condition)12

          1 f x < fl < fh : All rms export

       Free entry ensures that pro ts of exporting rms are also driven down to zero

                                    A 1 + 1     
                                                         cj1     
                                                                       = fj + f x .
                                                     
                                                                                                  (44)

If rms of one type do not export, their free entry condition continues to be given by (19).
   By combining free entry for j 2 fl; hg with the sorting condition in (15) we can determine
the market allocation of labor in the open economy:

                                              zl (~
                                                   zt )
                                                        = t ,                                    (45)
                                               a (~zt )

where t depends on the selection into exporting, and thus ultimately on the value of trade
  12
   We refer to this case as the Melitz (2003) condition, because trade costs are higher than (low-tech)
manufacturing xed costs and the equilibrium exhibits sorting into exporting where only some (high-tech)
 rms export.

An inspection of (46) reveals that t 2 (0; 1) and, hence, z < z~t < 1. Thus, both types of
 rms co-exist and proposition 2 continues to hold.
   By comparing t in (46) with  in (21) we can establish the following proposition:

Proposition 6 (Sorting Threshold) Trade leads to a fall in the threshold value for sort-
ing, z~t < z~.

Proof. From (22) and (45) we know that z~t < z~ implies that t > . If fl <   1 f x , t > 
implies that fl (1 +  1  ) = (fh + f x ) > fl =fh , or fh >   1 f x . If   1 f x < fl , t >  implies
that (fl + f x ) = (fh + f x ) > fl =fh , or fh > fl . Both hold.
   An immediate corollary of proposition 6 is:

Corollary 6 (Employment) Since z~ falls, trade raises the employment share in high-tech
 rms L [1 G (~
             z )].

    Proposition 6 and corollary 6 show that a switch from autarky to trade pushes ressources
out of low-tech rms and into high-tech rms. The reason for this reallocation of ressources
depends on the trade regime. If fl <   1 f x < fh , only high-tech rms export. Consequently,
only high-tech rms bene t from trade, and expand. The logic behind these reallocations is
essentially the same as in Melitz (2003). If   1 f x < fl < fh , all rms export, and all rms
can bene t from the opening to trade. However, xed costs in both types of rms increase
by the same absolute magnitude (by f x ), so the increase is relatively smaller for high-tech
 rms than for low-tech rms [(fl + f x ) =fl > (fh + f x ) =fh ]. As a consequence, high-tech
 rms expand.
    The reallocation of labor towards high-tech rms also a¤ects relative (real) wages. Using
(12), (13) and (15), the relative wage of a worker in a high-tech rm relative to a fellow
worker in a low-tech rm is
                                        wh (z)     a (z)
                                                =         ,                                (47)
                                          wl       a (~z)
and this is clearly decreasing in z~. Thus, as trade reduces z~, it raises relative wages in high-
tech rms and lowers relative wages in low-tech rms. The intuition is rather straightforward:
Since high-tech rms are hiring and low-tech rms are ring, the change in relative wages
simply reects relative demand for labor in the two types of rms.
    Now let us turn to a comparative static analysis of a reduction in variable trade costs.
For this we assume that the Melitz condition holds, fl <   1 f x < fh , so that t is given by
                                                                                            1
t 1 = fl (1 +  1  ) = (fh + f x ), as stated in (46), and d ln t =d ln  = (1 +   1 ) < 0.

two types of rms. They are given by

    If the Melitz condition holds, only high-tech rms are exporting and only high-tech rms
are bene ting from the reduction in variable trade costs. They expand, their employment
share increases, and the increase in demand for labor translates into higher e¤ective real
wages (ch =P increases). Since non-e¤ective real wages, wh (z) =P = a (z) ch =P , depend on
the productivity of individual workers, a (z), and not on the composition of the workforce,
they increase by the same percentage. Low-tech rms, on the other side, are not exporting,
and their e¤ective real wages are pinned down by the zero pro t condition in the domestic
market (cl =P = ( 1)  1 =L). Hence, e¤ective real wages in low-tech rms are una¤ected
by changes in variable trade costs. The change in non-e¤ective real wages is driven entire by
the change in the composition of the workforce in the low-tech labor pool. Since z~ falls, the
most productive workers in this pool move to the high-tech labor pool, so that the average
productivity of workers in the low-tech labor pool falls. As a consequence, their real wages
also fall. This is summarized in the following proposition:

Proposition 7 (Real Wages) Trade raises real wages in high-tech rms/for high-skill work-
ers and lowers real wages in low-tech rms/for low-skill workers.

   Finally, let us turn to welfare. Welfare can be expressed as in (31):

The change in welfare in response to a reduction in variable trade costs can be decomposed

where  (z) = 0 and limz~t !1  (~    zt ) = 1. The direct e¤ect is negative, indicating that
a reduction in variable trade costs tends to raise welfare. It depends on the labor share
in (exporting) high-tech rms, 1  (~        zt ), and on the share of trade costs in total costs,
 1  = (1 +  1  ) = 1 +   1 . The larger these two shares are, the larger is the impact of a
reduction in variable trade costs on total costs, and thus the reduction in the price index of
consumption.

is the indirect e¤ect working through the reallocation of labor z~t , where d ln z~t =d ln t is
calculated from (45). Here,  (~    zt ) is a measure of the extent of the deviation of the market
equilibrium from the social optimum that consists of the relative di¤erence between z~t and
zl (~
     zt ) as well as the relative inverse Mills ratio at z~t :

                                            z~t       zl (~zt ) g (~
                                                                    zt ) z~t

                                 (~                                         > 0.             (57)

The indirect e¤ect is positive, indicating that a reduction in variable trade costs tends to lower
welfare. This second e¤ect exists because the market equilibrium is not socially optimal.
There is already too much labor in high-tech rms so that @ ln W=@ ln z~t > 0 (see gure
3) and an additional boost of employment in high-tech rms through trade liberalization
exacerbates the misallocation. This e¤ect depends on the labor share in low-tech rms,
   zt ), on the size of the misallocation,  (~
 (~                                          zt ), as well as on the extend of the reallocation of
labor d ln z~t =d ln t .
    Given that the two e¤ects are counteracting and weighed by the share of labor in the two


                                                       24
types of rms, we can establish the following proposition:

Proposition 8 (Welfare E¤ects) The welfare e¤ects of trade liberalization depend on two
e¤ects: A direct e¤ect of the reduction in trade costs that tends to raise welfare, and an indi-
rect e¤ect of the reallocation of labor that tends to lower welfare. The welfare reducing e¤ect
dominates when trade costs are high and low-tech rms have a high share in employment,
and the welfare increasing e¤ect dominates when trade costs are low and high-tech rms have
a high share in emploment.

Proof. To prove that the welfare reducing e¤ect dominates when trade costs are high we
                                                                  R z~

                                 zh (~zt ) = 0.13 Hence, inequality (58) holds for su¢ciently high
values of z~t , and the indirect e¤ects dominates the direct e¤ect.
    There are two explanations for the ambiguity of the welfare e¤ects: (i) An income-
based explanation and (ii) an e¢ciency-based explanation. For the income-based explanation
remember that welfare is a function of the average real wage in the economy. However, the
real wages in the two types of rms are moving in di¤erent directions: They increase in
high-tech rms and decrease in low-tech rms. The aggregate e¤ect depends on the share of
the two types of rms in employment. That is why real income rises when high-tech rms
have a large employment share in the economy and falls when low-tech rms have a large
emplyoment share.
    The e¢ciency-based explanation highlights how trade liberalization a¤ects labor produc-
tivity. On the one hand, the reduction in variable trade costs lowers labor costs of exporting
and this tends to increase labor productivity (the direct e¤ect). On the other hand, marginal
productivities of labor are not equalized across rm types because of the labor market im-
perfection. The marginal productivity of labor in low-tech rms is discretely higher than in
high-tech rms: dX=dLh = [          zl (~zt ) =~
                                               zt ] (dX=dLl ) which implies dX=dLh < dX=dLl [see (35)

and the footnote there]. By reallocating the marginal worker to high-tech rms, aggregate
labor productivity falls (the indirect e¤ect). The magnitude of the indirect e¤ect depends
on the extent of the misallocation, i.e. on the di¤erence between zl (~   zt ) and z~t . And since
this di¤erence is increasing in z~t , the indirect e¤ect with its negative welfare implication is
larger for larger employment shares of low-tech rms.
    There is one important case where the welfare e¤ect of trade liberalization is clearly
positive: When the optimal subsidy s is in place. With the optimal subsidy in place,
marginal productivities of labor are equalized across rm types, and the negative welfare
e¤ect disappears. This is a straightforward application of the envelop theorem: The optimal
subsidy is chosen so that @ ln W=@ ln z~t (s ) = 0. In this case, only the direct e¤ect remains
and the welfare e¤ects of trade liberalization are clearly positive:

Corollary 7 (Welfare with Subsidy) With the optimal subsidy s in place, the welfare
e¤ects of trade are unambiguously positive.


5     Extensions
In this section we want to address some extensions of our basic framework that will either
serve as robustness checks of our main result with respect to speci c assumptions of our
framework or illustrate how a little more structure is able to generate additional propositions
that may be particularly useful when taking this framework to data.


5.1    Multiproduct Firms
Our framework can be extended to make contact with the literature on multiproduct rms
and international trade. In the baseline model we focus just on single-product rms, but
in this extension we adopt the exible manufacturing apparatus present in Eckel and Neary
(2010) and demonstrate that multiproduct and single product rms can arise endogenously
in our framework. As in Eckel and Neary (2010) and Bernard, Redding, and Schott (2011),
trade liberalization induces rms to pare their high cost product lines that are sold only
domestically but the reallocation of labor from small to large rms has the implication that
the share of multiproduct rms in total output expands.
    In order to extend this framework to multiproduct rms, we follow Eckel and Neary
(2010) and assume that all rms possess a certain core competency for a speci c variety
where their unit labor costs is lowest for all products in their product range. All other
products in their product range can then be identi ed by their (unidimensional) distance to
the rms core competency, denoted by ! > 0. Production of multiple products is subject

                                                26
to exible manufacturing, which implies that rms can add and drop products to and from
their product range freely, but as they add products to their product range and move away
from their core competency, unit labor requirements of these products increases. Thus, unit
labor requirements depend on the position ! of a product in a rms product range, and
are increasing in !:
                                                0
                            = (!)      and        (!)  @ =@! > 0.                     (59)

To simplify notation we normalize unit labor requirements at the core to one:                              (0) = 1. In
addition, there is a xed costs per product of f p .
   The pro ts of a multiproduct rm are

   Depending on the size of f p there are three possible outcomes:

    fl < fh  f p : All rms are single-product rms

    fl  f p < fh : High-tech rms are multiproduct rms, low-tech rms are single-product
      rms

    f p < fl < fh : All rms are multiproduct rms

  For this extension suppose that f p < fl < fh so that all rms are multiproduct rms.
Combining zero pro ts with the optimal product range yields

The left hand side is increasing in ! j and the right hand side is increasing in fj , so fh > fl
implies

   Using the same procedure as in section 2.2.4 we obtain the following equation that de-
termines the allocation of labor across rm types:

                                                   zl (~
                                                        zmpf )

Here, mpf depends on the measure of product ranges and is de ned as

Since ! h > ! l and fh > fl implies that mpf < 1, z~mpf 2 (z; 1) and both types of rms
coexist. Furthermore, (15) implies that ch < cl . Thus, the misallocation and the welfare
e¤ects are qualitatively identical. We focused here on the closed economy but extending this
extension to an open economy is rather straightforward.

Proposition 9 (Multi-product Firms) High-tech                        rms produce and export more prod-
ucts.

    High-tech rms pay a lower e¤ective wage rate than low-tech rms (ch < cl ). This allows
them to expand into less e¢cient activities and produce varieties further away from their core
competency with higher unit labor requirements. They have an incentive to do so because
the screening technology is applicable in all divisions within the rm, so that by adding
products to their product range they can lower the xed costs per product.
    In the appendix we provide an additional extension to multiple export destinations that
is methodologically very similar to this extension here.


5.2     Multiple Screening Technologies
In this extension we illustrate that our assumption of just two technologies, and consequently
just two types of rms, is not critical for the mechanism we describe. The simple case with
just two types of rms is very useful for understanding the forces behind the mechanism,
and for providing intuition, but it needs to be extended for empirical work. Here we show
a straightforward way to extend this framework to include multiple screening technologies
that lead to a higher degree of rm heterogeneity.
    Suppose there are N screening technologies j 2 f0; :::; N g with labor productivity aj (z),
where a0 (z) = z, aj+1 (z) > aj (z) 8z > z, a0j+1 (z) > a0j (z)  1, a00j ( zj z > z) > 0. A
screening technology j allows rms to screen up to skill level zj , so that all skills with z < zj
can be observed and all skills with z > zj cannot. Technologies are ranked by the skills they
can observe (  zj ), so that zj+1 > zj . Technology j = 0 is essentially our low-tech technology
in previous sections and implies no screening (    z0 = z). A better screening technology (with a
higher zj ) is more expensive and requires strictly higher xed costs, so that fj+1 > fj > 0.14
  14
    Our modelling with many screening technologies is similar to a discrete version of screening in Helpman,
Itskhoki and Redding (2010).


                                                     28
We consider only e¢cient screening technologies so that no screening technology exists that
is characterized by the same level of observable skills but higher xed costs.
    Given that a rm with screening technology j (type-j rm) can only observe skills up
to level zj , it can only pay a wage based on the workers true productivity up to this level.
Above this level, it has to pay a wage based on the expected productivity.15 Hence, the wage
paid by a type-j rm to workers with skill z depends on the skill of these workers:
                                          (
                                                 aj (z)        for z~j < z < zj < z~j+1
                        wj (z) = cj                                                     ,                           (66)

                                                  zj ; z~j+1 ) for z~j < zj < z < z~j+1

where a
labor pool of type j is Zj = fz : z 2 (~    zj ; z~j+1 )g, so that z~j and z~j+1 denote the lower and
upper boundary of skills in rms of type j.

                                                   [Figure 5 here]

    The pro le of wages in type-j rms is illustrated in Figure 5. In the range between z~j
and zj , rms of type j can fully observe the true productivity of individual workers and
pay a wage based on this productivity: wj (z) = cj aj (z). Above zj , these rms only know
the average productivity of their workforce because they use a technology that does not
allow them to screen workers with these skills. As a consequence, the wage is based on a                               j :
wj (z) = cj a   j (zj ; z~j+1 ). All workers in a type-j labor pool receive the same e¤ective wage
rate cj .
    Note that there is a discrete jump in the wage pro le within a labor pool. This jump is
due to the fact that aj (           zj ) < aj (
                                                 zj ; z~j+1 ), i.e. that the productivity of the worker with the
exact observable skill zj is discretely lower than the average productivity of workers in the
range ( zj ; z~j+1 ). This jump is ultimately due to the fact that we are assuming that rms know
the distribution of skills in their labor pool and can therefore pay wages based on expected
productivity. If rms did not know this distribution, they could only pay wages based on
the highest skill they observe, i.e. wj (z : z 2 (                 zj ; z~j+1 )) = cj aj (
                                                                                           zj ). In this case there is no
jump and the wage pro le is a continuous function of skills. This alternative assumption
has no qualitative e¤ect on our results and even increases the ine¢ciency described earlier
because aj (    zj ) < a  j (
                               zj ; z~j+1 ).
    The boundaries of a particular labor pool are determined by the sorting conditions. In
the case of N + 1 technologies there are N sorting conditions. For the boundary between
  15
       We maintain the assumption that rms know the distribution of skills in their labor pool.

 rms of type j and j       1, this sorting condition is

                                                           j   1 (
                                                                   zj 1 ; z~j )
                                                       =                                             (67)

If this condition is ful lled, workers with a marginal skill z~j receive the same wage in the
two labor pools j and j 1. Since z~j > zj 1 , their skill is above the observable skill in
type-(j 1) rms, so their wage in the type-(j 1) labor pool is cj 1 a          j 1 ( zj 1 ; z~j ). In the
type-j labor pool their skill is below the threshold of observability, so rms with technology j
will pay them a wage based on their true productivity of cj aj (~   zj ). We assume that condition
                              j 1 (
(16) holds locally, i.e. that a     zj 1 ; ) =aj () is decreasing in  at  = z~j .
    Given this sorting condition, the marginal skill z~j is then determined by

                                         a
                                         j        1(

Proposition 10 (Multiple Screening Technologies) With multiple screening technolo-
gies, sorting leads to multiple labor pools where all e¢cient screening technologies can coex-
ists. Firms with a better screening technology (a higher observable skill level z) recruit more
productive workers and exhibit higher revenues per worker and higher average wages.

    The market equilibrium in the case with multiple screening technologies is similarily
distorted as the equilibrium with only two technologies. Because wages of workers with
above average skills in each labor pool receive wages based on their average productivity and
not on their marginal productivity, the skill set of workers sorting into a particular labor
pool (j > 0) is too low compared to the social optimum (~    zj < z~j ). As a consequence, for
any technology j > 0, employment in rms with a lower productivity is too low and in rms
                                                                                              
with a higher productivity too high compared to the social optimum: G (~       zj ) L < G z~j L
                               
and [1 G (~  zj )] L > 1 G z~j L.
    Finally, we want to point out that the assumption of a discrete number of technologies is
important. If N goes to in nity, each labor pool becomes in nitesimal and the boundaries

                                                               30
of the pools collapse onto their observable skills. Formally, z~j approaches zj from below, and
z~j+1 approaches zj from above. Then,

                                    lim a
                                        j (

and there is no more pooling in the labor market and no more uncertainty about skill levels.
Each rm gets exactly the skill level that they target with their screening technology, and
e¤ective wages are equalized across screening technologies. As a consequence, the ine¢ciency
associated with pooling also disappears.

Proposition 11 (Continuous Screening Technologies) With a continuous screening tech-
nology, there is no more pooling in the labor market and the ine¢ciency associated with
pooling disappears.


5.3    Exogenous Firm Heterogeneity
In section 3, we showed in our benchmark model with endogenous rm entry into h and l
technologies that the distortion created by imperfect information manifested itself as excess
worker sorting into the screening pool. The resulting labor supply misallocation meant that
there were too many rms using the h technology from the perspective of a social planner
but free entry had the implication that both h and l rms were individually of optimal size.
    In this section, we consider the case in which the measure of each type of rm, ni where i 2
fh; lg, is exogenously xed.16 We will show that when rms are exogenously heterogeneous
that the distortion created by imperfect information manifests itself as h-type rms that are
too large relative to the social optimum and l-type rms that are too small. In this case,
from a social point of view it would be better if bigger rms were smaller.
    We will also show that naive measures of total factor productivity - revenue (TFP-R)
that fail to account for variation in worker quality should be higher at h-type rms than
at l-type rms. In this situation the reallocation of resources from low to high measured
TFP-R rms would worsen the distortion. This result highlights the need to know the source
of observed exceptional rm performance before drawing policy conclusions in general and in
the need to properly control for worker composition in the calculation of TFP-R in speci c.
    Without free entry, there is no zero pro t condition and the size of rms is determined
by the labor market clearing condition:

                                                   ~ j =nj .
                                              xi = L                                            (72)
  16
    This could be due to a xed measure of managers that had the ability to screen workers or due to a
single free entry condition that yielded rms that can screen with probability nh =(nh + nl ).

                                                   31
Consequently, relative sizes are given by

Given (7) and using  to represent the ability of the cuto¤ worker, we show that the relative
labor market equilibrium can be written

                                                R            ! 1

                                   cl      nl  a()dG()

Equation (74) is depicted in gure 6 as an increasing locus in (ch =cl ; ) space ("Labor Market
Equilibrium"). It is increasing because a higher cuto¤ level  implies a higher relative supply
in the type-l labor pool and requires in equilibrium a lower relative e¤ective wage in that
pool to boost relative labor demand.

                                          [Figure 6 here]

    As in the benchmark model, the "Sorting Condition" is given by ch =cl = z l () =a () and
is decreasing by condition (16). In the market equilibrium, the cuto¤ skill is given by z~ and
the relative e¤ective wage facing producers is ch =cl = z l (~
                                                             z ) =a (~
                                                                     z ).
    Also as in the benchmark model, the "Social Planner" would allocate labor so that
the relative shadow price of labor in each of the labor pools equates the marginal social
return of the cuto¤ worker in the two pools, i.e. ch =cl = =a (). This condition is shown
as a decreasing curve in gure 6. Crucially, this locus lies everywhere above the "Sorting
Condition" curve [since  > z l ()]. It follows immediately from the gure that too much
labor is allocated to the h-type labor pool, i.e. z~ < z~ , and the e¤ective cost of labor
at h-type rms is too low relative to l-type rms, i.e. ch =cl (~      z ) < ch =cl (~
                                                                                     z  ). The latter
result contrasts with the benchmark model where ch =cl is at at its optimal level due to
the technologically imposed free entry condition. With exogeneous rm heterogeneity, a low
equilibrium z~ reduces ch =cl in order to make h-type rms grow to absorb the excess labor
and to induce l-type rms to shrink to conserve labor. The following proposition follows
immediately from gure 6.

Proposition 12 (Optimal Firm Size) Without free entry, high-tech rms are relatively
too large compared to the social optimum.

    In their e¤ort to avoid pooling with less able workers, workers at or just above the cuto¤
ability choose to share rents on their ability with their employers and this has the implication

                                                 32
that their employers grow excessively large relative to the social optimum.17
    According to this proposition, a reallocation of labor from h-type rms to l- rms would
raise aggregate welfare. We now show that our model has the implication that this requires
that resources be reallocated away from rms that exhibit high TFP-R to rms that exhibit
low TFP-R when TFP-R measures do not control for worker heterogenity. We show this
by calculating TFP-R for each rm type when labor input is simply measured as the count
of workers employed by each rm type. We then show that if labor inputs are measured
appropriately in e¢ciency units that the TFP-R rankings of the two rm types switch.
    As in section 2.2.4 let 'i be the revenue per worker of the average i-type rm. In the one
factor model considered here, this corresponds to measured TFP-R of rms of type i. As
shown in corollary 3 and reproduced here for convenience, naive TFP-R measurement (i.e.
does not control for ability composition) yields

such data, zi (~

(1999).19

Based on these ratios we can establish the following proposition:

Proposition 13 (TFP-R at Social Optimum) At the optimal allocation z~ , adjusted and
non-adjusted TFP-R measurements are not equalized. TFP-R in type-h rms is always larger
than in type-l rms.
  17
     Were we to introduce multiproduct rms as in section 5.1, h-type rms would also opt to manage
an excessive number of product lines while l-type rms would be ine¢ciently proscribed in their product
o¤erings.

                                        z ) = zl (~
                                                   z ).
  19
     Alternatively, correcting TFP-R using wage data should remove variation in TFP-R across rms.

       This proposition indicates that adjusted and non-adjusted TFP-R measurements are not
equalized, even when the allocation of workers is socially optimal. This is important to
recognize because it implies that the quantitative analyses of misallocation that are done in
the spirit of Hsieh and Klenow (2009) may draw inappropriate conclusions in the presence of
worker heterogeneity and adverse selection. In this case, di¤erences in TFP-R measurements,
whether adjusted for input quality or not, are neither a necessary nor a su¢cient condition
for a misallocation. The fact the even the adjusted TFP-R measurements are not equalized
is due to the fact that there are increasing returns to skills in the high-tech technology
(a00H (z) > 0) and an adjustment by average input quality overadjusts low quality inputs and
underadjusts high-quality inputs.


6      Conclusion
The share of employment in large exporting rms is rising, and international trade is playing
an important role in this process. We show in this paper that to assess the implications of
these reallocations requires a knowledge of exactly why these rms are large. If di¤erences
in rm size are driven by (exogenous) di¤erences in social e¢ciencies across rms (as in
most of the heterogeneous rms literature), then these reallocations may improve aggregate
productivity and lead to a more e¢cient allocation of resources. However, if di¤erences in
 rm size are driven by market failures based on factor market imperfections (as emphasized
by a large labor market literature), then these reallocations can exacerbate the misallocation
of resources and reduce overal welfare. Our study highlights the need to know why rms
excel before drawing welfare conclusions and policy recommendations regarding cross rm
reallocations of resources.
    In our model ex post di¤erences in rm size and productivity are generated by di¤erent
strategies to overcome labor market imperfections by ex ante identical rms. The resulting
industry structure exhibits many facts that are consistent with recent empirical ndings:
Larger rms are more productive, more likely to export, produce more products, pay higher
wages and employ a more productive workforce. However, the resulting equilibrium is ine¢-
cient because too much labor is employed in large rms. This has two important implications:
First, there is an incentive to subsidize small rms, and second, a reallocation of labor to-

                                                         34
wards large rms has a rst order negative welfare e¤ect that can even dominate traditional
gains from trade.
    In our framework the superior human resources management capabilities of large rms
are a mixed blessing from the point of view of e¢cient resource allocation. On the one
hand, because knowledge of workers skills is necessary to use a technology adapted for
skilled workers, human resource management capabilities allow skilled labor to be used more
e¢ciently. On the other hand, the market power conferred on large, multiproduct rms
arti cially lowers their labor costs and induces too much entry of large, exporting rms. In
such a world, subsidization of employment at small, non-export oriented rms is optimal
and gains from trade liberalization can only be ensured given a proper subsidy.
    We have analyzed only one type of factor market distortion that can give large rms
an advantage relative to smaller rms. In an environment in which larger rms are better
equipped to inuence government policy, it is likely that there are other, perhaps more
pernicious forces, that induce large rms to be too large from a social point of view. We
hope that this will become a vibrant area of research.

Since fh > fl , l = h is a su¢cient condition for co-existence.
    But co-existence is also sustainable if high-tech rms have a lower unit labor requirement.
In this case, it is important that the relative di¤erence in unit labor requirements is not too
large relative to the di¤erence in xed costs:

                           (   1) (ln   l       ln      h)    (ln fh     ln fl ) .      (80)


                                                      35
   One interesting case is where the investment fh can be interpreted as an innovation
that does not only allow rms to use the high-tech technology, but also reduces unit labor
requirements. Suppose

In this case, co-existence requires that the responsiveness of unit labor requirements with
respect to xed costs is not too large, or

                                                                    1

7.2    Multiple Export Destinations
Suppose the world is a circle with a continuum of countries, each located at a point on this
circle. The distance between countries  is the shortest arcdistance on the circumference
of the circle. Variable trade costs between countries i and j are increasing in distance:
 ij =  (),  (0) = 1,  0 () > 0,  00 () > 0. Note that there is no index on  () so this
function is symmetric across all locations. In addition, there are xed costs f x per country
exported to.

    Since  (0) = 1 and variable trade costs of exporting to the closest destination are in ni-
tesimally small, our conditions for exporting from section 4 have to be slightly altered:

    fl < fh < f x : No exporting

    fl < f x < fh : Exporting only by high-tech rms

    f x < fl < fh : All rms export




                                                       36
   For this extension suppose that f x < fl < fh so that all rms export. Aggregate pro ts
for rm of type j are then given by

                                                             j                      
                                                                                                       fj

     Since the left hand side of (86) is increasing in  j and the right hand side is increasing in
fj , fh > fl implies
                                              h > l .                                        (87)

   Using the same procedure as in section 2.2.4 we obtain the following equation that de-
termines the allocation of labor across rm types:

                                                    zl (~
                                                         zmx )
                                                               = mx .                                             (88)
                                                     a (~zmx )

Here, mx depends on the measure of export destinations and is de ned as
                                               R h                           !

                                                                                                       
                       1
                     mx                      R0l                                                        <1      (89)
                                     1+       2 0      ()1         
                                                                         d           2 h f x + fh

Since  h >  l implies that mx < 1, z~mx 2 (z; 1) and both types of rms coexist. Fur-
thermore, (15) implies that ch < cl . Thus, the misallocation and the welfare e¤ects are
qualitatively identical.

Proposition 14 (Multiple Export Destinations) High-tech rms export to more desti-
nations and ship longer distances.
