The Value of Broadband and the Deadweight Loss of Taxing New Technology

                                            ABSTRACT

With fixed costs of developing technology, taxes can generate large efficiency costs by slowing the
rate of diffusion and these costs are not accounted for in conventional analyses. This paper illustrates
this by analyzing the impact that taxes would have had on broadband Internet access at an early stage
of its diffusion around the country, combining data on individual demand by area with data on
supplier entry in those markets. Applying a tax to broadband in 1998 would have reduced the
quantity and generate a large deadweight loss in the conventional model but when the analysis
accounts for the fixed costs of entering new markets, taxes would have also delayed entry in several
markets. In these places, the lost consumer surplus from delay is an additional deadweight loss and
it more than doubles the estimated efficiency costs of taxation. The conventional model also
dramatically understates the share of tax burden that would have been borne by customers.

1. Introduction
        Despite a growing literature dealing with the importance of new goods, there has been little

analysis of the whether the continued introduction of new goods has any implications for tax policy.1

This paper shows that the impact of taxes on technology diffusion has the potential to be quite

significant if there are fixed costs associated with introducing the new goods. Using, as a practical

example, data on the market for broadband Internet access when it first began to spread widely, the

results suggest that the true deadweight cost of taxation can be several times larger and the incidence

born much more by consumers than indicated by a traditional tax analysis.

        The case of taxes and broadband is interesting in its own right, as well. Considerable debate

arose over the Internet Tax Freedom Act and its subsequent extensions which placed a moratorium on

state taxation of Internet access. Legislation currently before Congress would permanently ban taxes

on internet access. The states have opposed these measures, realizing the large revenue potential of

such taxation.2 On top of that, there is considerable interest on the part of policy makers and the

general public in the spread of broadband and the existence of a "broadband gap" between the U.S.

and countries thought to be farther along the technology frontier, as well as concern about a "digital

divide" separating rich, urban people from their poorer and more rural counterparts in their use of

advanced technology.3 Though the market was decidedly different in the early years of broadband

than it is now, many of the same issues that faced larger markets then may apply in smaller markets


1 The recent work in Industrial Organization is discussed in Trajtenberg (1989), Bresnahan and Gordon (1997),
Hausman (1999), Petrin (2002), Nevo (2003) and Goolsbee and Petrin (2004). There are a few examples of
work on tariffs and new goods (Romer, 1994; Feenstra, 1995; Klenow and Rodriguez-Claire, 1997) and papers
on the welfare costs of regulatory delay such as Hausman (1997; 1998).
2 Goolsbee (2001) points out that the potential revenue from applying sales tax to Internet access probably
exceeds the entire revenue loss from not enforcing sales taxes on Internet purchases. Mazerov (2003)
summarizes the states' position opposing the ban on access taxes because it will deny them considerable
revenues.
3 Popular discussion of the 'broadband gap' can be found in Bleha (2005) or Rosenbush et al. (2004). Academic
work on the spread of Internet access and the 'digital divide' include Downes and Greenstein (1998), Hoffman
and Novak (1999), Compaine (2001), and Goolsbee and Guryan (2006). There has been work on how people’s
use of the Internet responds to prices (see, for example, Varian, 1999, Beckart 1999, the discussions in Mackie-
Mason and Varian, 1995 or the papers in McKnight and Bailey, 1997). This literature has become less relevant
for analyzing taxes on access, however, since most Internet Service Providers (ISPs) currently charge a flat
monthly fee for unlimited use. Bruce et al. (2004) examine the impact of taxes on overall Internet access rates
today.

         The paper will use data on individual level demand for broadband across locations to

construct market specific demand curves and use them to do an analysis of broadband taxation. The

results suggest that at the time of the survey (late 1998/early 1999), the consumer surplus from

broadband was about $667 million per year in markets where it was available and that the demand

was highly elastic. As a result, the deadweight loss from taxing broadband in 1998, as computed in a

standard analysis, would have been quite high, at almost 200% of the revenue such a tax would have

generated. The tax would have been borne about 55% by consumers.

         Looking deeper, however, the paper is able to use the computed producer surplus in each

market to estimate the implied size of the fixed costs of entering a new market (or at least of entering

on the more limited scale that characterized entry at that time). It then shows that in several medium

sized markets, applying a tax on broadband would have reduced the potential producer surplus enough

that suppliers would not be able to cover their fixed costs and would choose to delay the diffusion of

broadband in those markets. By doing so, however, the tax would have eliminated the entire potential

consumer surplus from those markets (as well as the firm profits) in the interim. Those losses are

pure deadweight loss (DWL) and are large. Taking account of the impact of taxes on the spread of

the new technology more than doubles the estimated DWL from the tax as compared to the standard

model. The incidence of the tax is also substantially more heavily born by the consumer than in the

conventional calculation.

         The paper proceeds in six sections. Section 2 presents an overview of the theory behind

evaluating taxes on new technologies. Section 3 describes the industry and the data and estimates the

demand curves. Section 4 presents a conventional tax analysis. Section 5 then estimates the fixed

costs of entry into new markets and adds an analysis of how taxes affect diffusion in this market and

the ways that changes the main tax results. Section 6 concludes.


and find no effect. Likewise, Goolsbee (2000) finds no significant impact of sales taxes on access. Both of these
2. Theory

        The basic idea of why taxes might have a different impact when there are new goods rests on

the existence of fixed costs and follows on the insight of Romer (1994) that tariffs can have large

negative welfare effects if they lead to fewer goods being imported into a small country.

        Consider the market for broadband where the supplier has market power as in Figure 1.4 In a

conventional analysis of taxes in such a market, imposing a tax will reduce the quantity and create a

deadweight loss that depends on the elasticity of demand (see Sumner, 1981 for a traditional

exposition). Without taxes, the supplier sets marginal revenue equal to marginal cost and produces Q0

which it sells to consumers at P0. A per-unit tax on the seller, this raises the marginal cost curve to the

dashed line in the figure. The after tax price to the buyer rises to PT and the quantity falls to QT. The

government raises revenue equal to area D from this tax. The consumer surplus after the tax falls

from A+B+E to just A. The producer surplus goes from C+D+F+G to B+C. The DWL of the tax is

the entire area of lost consumer and producer surplus, net of taxes: E+F+G. To compute the

incidence, one simply compares the increase in consumer prices (PT –P0) to the amount of the tax to

get the consumer share.

        But now think of a world in which there are many potential markets such as the one presented

in figure 1. They have different sizes and before the firm can produce in the market, it must first

decide whether to enter at all. If it does so, the firm must pay some fixed cost FC. Without a tax, a

firm will enter if the producer surplus in the market, C+D+F+G, exceeds FC. After the tax, though,

the potential producer surplus in the market is just B+C. So long as B+C stays greater than FC, the

firm still enters the market and the conventional tax calculation is correct. Wherever C+D+F+G > FC

> B+C, however, the tax reduces producer surplus enough to prevent entry.


papers relate mainly to dial-up Internet access so are less relevant to the issue of rolling out broadband.
4 At the time of this sample, residential broadband was provided almost exclusively by local cable monopolies.
Faulhaber and Hogendorn (2000) show that for almost all realistic levels of demand growth that providers might
         The DWL from the tax in those markets equals the entire producer and consumer surplus.

This certainly has the potential to be large, since the entire surplus in a market usually dwarfs a

traditional DWL triangle, but the practical importance of this kind of efficiency cost depends entirely

on the actual magnitude of the fixed costs and the number of places that might be on the margin of

being bypassed. This paper will use the case of broadband at an early point in its diffusion to

illustrate that, in practice, the idea may be quite important indeed.

         The incidence of the tax in figure 1 will also be changed. Rather than compute the consumer

share of the burden as the change to after tax prices relative to the size of the tax, as in the standard

approach, one ought to also account for the losses in markets that are bypassed just because of the tax.

To the extent that new goods generate large consumer surplus but only modest producer surplus (in

excess of the fixed costs), the incidence will tend to be borne significantly more by consumers than in

the typical estimate.



3. Industry Background and Data on the Demand for Broadband

A. Broadband and Cable Modems

         Broadband, and specifically cable modems allow Internet users to receive data from the

Internet over their fiber-optic cable line rather than over conventional telephone wires. This allows

the user to access the web at speeds up to 100 times faster than standard dial-up modems. At the time

of this sample broadband accounted for only 2-3 percent of online users (Mines, et al., 1998; Strategis

Group, 1999), but was growing rapidly. The subscriber base grew from less than 40,000 in 1996 to

about 750,000 by mid-1999, and analysts at the time forecast that by 2002 or 2003, the number of

broadband users could range between 4 million and 27 million (Mines et. al, 1998; Kinetic Strategies,

1999; Kasrel et al., 1999; CATC CyberLab, 2000; Gillett and Lehr, 2000). The actual number in

2002 was 20 million (C.B.O., 2004).



have made at the time, there would be oligopoly at the least.
        Although the major current residential competitor to cable modems is DSL, a service

provided over telephone lines, at the time of this sample residential DSL had extremely limited

availability (see Gillett and Lehr, 2000). Indeed, even now, cable modems continue to have a

dominant market share of residential customers. At the time of the sample in this paper, cable

modems were widely regarded as the superior consumer choice (PC World, 1999). For purposes of

analyzing the broadband entry decision circa late 1998/early 1999, the local cable monopoly can be

viewed as, effectively, having a local monopoly on residential broadband access. The typical fee for

broadband access through a cable modem at the time of the survey was about $40 per month.

        In considering the cost structure of the cable modem industry, it is important to note that the

standard marginal cost in the sense of the cost of providing an additional minute of access, is close to

zero. The marginal costs facing the system are best thought of as marginal costs per customer rather

than per minute. Fixed costs, in this setting, will be costs that are shared across customers in the same

metropolitan area. For a cable company to provide service in an area, they must incur the fixed cost

of entering the market and then a one time marginal cost for each household that signs up for the

service. From those subscribers, then, the cable company receives a flow of revenue. For simplicity,

I will sometimes compute this as a lump-sum NPV equivalent assuming that the cable company has a

10 percent discount rate and expects to have the customer for five years at current prices, after which

time the cable company gets nothing—either new technology makes the current cable modems

obsolete or new competitors drive profits to zero. The choice of discount rate and customer life

makes virtually no difference to the main results.

        In practice, the marginal costs of adding a customer include the installation and upgrade of

the coaxial cable "drop" to the individual home, at least some part of the customer acquisition costs,

customer premises equipment (cable modem, etc.), and whatever expected maintenance might be

required. In total, JP Morgan (2001) estimates this to be between $600 and $1200 in 2001. Gillett

(1995) suggest that just the engineering cost side was likely to be greater than $2000 in 1995. Owen
(1999) and Carriere (2001) also report costs somewhere between these estimates. So these per

customer costs could be considerable at the time of the sample in late 1998.

        The fixed costs include all costs shared over multiple customers in the same market including

upgrading the shared cable line to be two-way and digital, upgrading the head-end electronics, the

costs of extensive marketing efforts, the costs of establishing and operating a new type of billing and a

customer care center, among others (though some of these costs would be incurred anyway if a cable

system upgraded to digital in order to compete with satellite, as I will discuss later). The size of these

fixed costs can be quite substantial and they are the reason that cable providers do not offer cable

modem service to any customer willing to pay for the marginal costs of hooking up their individual

home. They must get a large enough group of subscribers to make it worthwhile to enter a market.

These fixed costs are the key to understanding the impact of taxation in an innovative industry.

        There may be some costs that are not marginal in the sense of being per customer but nor are

they fixed across the entire city. Cable companies might have fixed costs at a smaller level than city-

wide, for example, if they were going to upgrade part of their local networks or something like that.

In this sense, the most accurate model might be to look at markets at the neighborhood level rather

than at the city level. Practically speaking, the data are not sufficient to allow a more detailed

geographic analysis. That said, many of the fixed costs will be at a broader level than the

neighborhood and in most urban areas, upgrading the network involves the expensive digging up of

the street to get to the cable lines. There are some definite economies of scale to doing such work

simultaneously rather than piece by piece. It is also expensive to have part of the network being

modern and part being antiquated so companies tend to upgrade most everything at one time. A

general piece of evidence supporting the idea of fixed costs at a broader level than just the

neighborhood is that although there were some pilot programs testing broadband in limited areas,

cable companies in large markets typically offered service to a large number of areas and they did not

offer any service in smaller metro areas even if there were small pockets of potential highly educated,
high-income customers. Indeed, outside of the top 50 metro areas, virtually no company offered

residential broadband whatsoever.



B. Data

          To estimate the impact of taxes in this market, I combine several sources of data. The

availability of cable modems at the time of the survey (late 1998) comes from PC World (1999). It is

important to note that entry at that time was less dramatic than today. When cable companies

introduced capacity, take-up rates were typically very low—around 3-5%. While it would be

preferable to model the entry into smaller geographic units than the metropolitan area, the data do not

allow it.

          Next, I match the PC World data to individual level data on people’s willingness to pay for

broadband as given in the surveys of Forrester’s Technographics 1999 program. Forrester is a leading

market research company which studies the information economy. Each year it conducts a survey of

close to 100,000 people about their usage of various products as well as demographic information.

More detail on the Forrester survey can be found in Bernhoff et al. (1998). The precise question

involved asks how much the consumer would be willing to pay (in dollars per month) for high-speed

Internet access up to 100 times faster than on conventional modems. Their answers are of the form

“Less than $5”, “$5-$15”, “$15-25”, and so on, up to “$65+.” Summing these individual demand

curves in each of the top 69 metro areas gives market level demand curves even for markets where

there is no broadband access yet. These 69 areas account for approximately 75% of the U.S.

population. I will use only people reporting reservation prices of at least $15 per month to keep those

people with reservation prices far from the equilibrium prices from influencing the shape of the

estimated demand curve.

          Although these demand curves are not based on transactions data, such transaction data has

limited value for calculating consumer surplus. One wants to know the area under the entire demand
curve and transaction data estimate the demand curve only in places near the equilibrium. One

typically extrapolates a functional form out to the price axis to make the welfare calculation. Here,

rather than assume a functional form from the demand around the equilibrium points, the demand

curve will take the functional directly from the respondents' stated preferences. To verify that the

stated preferences also match the observed transaction data in the range surrounding actually observed

prices I will present several independent pieces of confirmatory evidence.

C. The Demand Curves

         As an example of the market level demand curves, Figure 2 presents the results from the San

Francisco metropolitan area. There are 69 such curves: one for each market. Price per month is on

the vertical axis and the number of respondents who would purchase broadband at that price is on the

horizontal axis. As there are 1,680 respondents from the Bay area and 2.4 million households in that

market, each respondent represents about 1410 households (Nielsen, 1999).

         For each of the markets, I then fit a quadratic inverse demand curve to the data and use that

equation for the tax analysis.5 There was no qualitative difference for the results from using a log

linear demand curve and capping reservation prices at the highest reported level or from using a

piecewise linear demand curve.6 The demand curve estimated for the San Francisco metro area, for

example is

                  P = 57.15 - .2814 Q + .00044 Q2 + ε
                      (5.63) (.0839)   (.00019)                   R2=.90, n=6




5 These demand estimates will not include prices of dial-up Internet service. Although this would seem to be an
important substitute for broadband, the data do not bear this out. In independent merger cases where they
evaluated the evidence on the subject, both the Department of Justice and the FCC have ruled that the two are
separate markets (FCC, 2001; U.S. Department of Justice, 2001). Using micro data, Rappoport et. al (2001)
estimate the cross-price elasticity of broadband demand with respect to dial-up price and find it to be miniscule
(elasticity of broadband only 0.02).
6 I will use the quadratic rather than the piecewise linear because it is easier to deal with and because a standard
result from the public finance literature is that the incidence of a tax on a monopolist with a linear demand curve
is split evenly between the producer and the consumer. Since incidence is one of the main topics of interest, I did
not want to impose linearity. In a previous version of this paper, I also checked the robustness of this functional
form by allowing for a log-linear demand curve with a cap on the valuations at the highest stated price. The basic
findings about DWL and incidence were the same in that case.
         At the market price of about $40 per month, the elasticity of demand in San Francisco is -

2.65. The elasticities at that price are listed for all of the markets in the first column of table 1. They

range from -2.15 to -3.76 with an average of around -2.75. The R2 in every equation was quite high.7

         Several things suggest that these demand curves match well to contemporaneous estimates of

broadband elasticities using transaction data. The price elasticity of demand for high bandwidth in

the Berkeley INDEX randomized experiments was generally between -2 and -3. Kridel et al. (2000)

use cross-city variation in prices to estimate an elasticity of demand for broadband and find it to be

about -1.8 at a price of $49.95. A previous version of this paper used the price differences for

broadband between cable television subscribers and non-cable television subscribers to identify the

price elasticity of subscribing to broadband (in markets where it was available at the time of the

survey, of course), while controlling for extensive household level demographics. Depending on the

specification, the elasticity ranged from -2.8 to -3.5.

         In addition, the reservation price data suggest that among Internet users who live in places

without cable modem access, about 4.7% would be willing to pay more than $35 per month and about

2.0% more than $45 per month for broadband access. The actual take-up rates in the data in the areas

that did have access (where prices were about $40 per month) was about 2.2% and the take-up rate

among those actually having the ability to get access computed in other sources was somewhere

between about 3 and 5% (see Kinetic Strategies,1999 and Gillett and Lehr, 1999).

         The match also works well by education level. The share of people in the Forrester data with

only a High School education who claim they would pay $45 or more for broadband was 1.4%

compared and 3.8% at $35. Kridel et al (2000) show that the actual take-up rate among people with a

high-school diploma was comfortably in between at around 2.5%. For people with some college

education, 2.5% say they would be willing to buy at $45 and 6.0% at $35. The actual was around 4%.




7 To save space, the tables do not list the coefficients separately for all 69 regressions. These are available from
        Income tabulations also show similarity. In the Forrester data, the share of people earning

$75,000 or more who would buy at $45 was 2.8% and at $35 was 6.3%. In the transaction data,

where the market price was in between those two levels, the actual adoption rate was 5.5%. For

people earning $45-75,000, 1.9% would buy at $45 and 4.8% at $35. The actual data put the take-up

at 3.2%. Given the rather tight match of these results with the ones using transaction price data, I will

take the reservation price information in the survey data as accurate.



4. Equilibrium and a Conventional Tax Analysis

        From these demand curves, if all the top 69 markets in the United States had broadband

access at the time of the sample, aggregate demand in late 1998 would be about 1.6 million

households. The market price for each market comes from assuming the local cable monopolies have

constant marginal cost and price in a Bertrand manner according to the standard monopoly mark-up

formula. The average elasticity in markets that actually had cable modem access at the time of the

sample was -2.75 and the average actual market price was approximately $40. This implies a MC of

about $25 per month or $300 on an annualized basis. This is in the same ballpark as the actual per-

customer costs described in Owen (1999) and very close to the cost estimates in Carriere et al. (2000).

I will assume it to be equal across markets.

        Given this marginal cost, the quadratic inverse demand curves imply a marginal revenue

function in each market. Setting the two equal yields the quantity sold and plugging into the demand

curve yields the market price. In the calculations here, the projected market prices across areas form a

relatively tight band around $39.50 per month. This prediction comports well with reality in that

there was not much actual variation in prices of existing broadband services across markets at the time

of the sample.

        The consumer surplus and producer surplus in each market, as derived from the estimates, are



the author upon request.
listed in the second and third columns of Table 1. 8 There are 69 but the table lists only the top 50

markets to save space. Summed across all the markets, the total consumer surplus adds up to about

$955 million per year (restricting to only those markets that actually had service at the time of the

survey, the total was $667 million).

        Using this demand and cost set up, a standard tax analysis is straightforward. Although the

Internet Tax Freedom Act forbid the states from applying sales tax to internet access, we can explore

the impact of a tax of that magnitude in these data. The median state sales tax at the time was 5%

which would correspond to something like a $2 per month tax on a $40 per month service. To avoid

any complications associated with the differences between ad valorem and specific taxation, let us

consider the simplest form of the tax, a $2 per month Internet access tax paid by the cable company

which is the equivalent of raising the marginal cost from $25 to $27 per month. Solving for the

equilibrium in each market, this would raise the average equilibrium price to $40.60 from $39.50

(differently in each market, of course). The share of the tax born by consumers in different locations

ranges from 50 to 60%. After the tax, the total quantity summed across all the markets falls from 1.63

million to 1.51 million. The total revenue raised from the tax ($2 per month for every customer)

yields an annual revenue of about $36 million. The new consumer surplus falls by about $80 million

to $875 million per year and producer surplus falls about $20 million to $250 million. The net $64

million drop in social surplus is the deadweight loss and it amounts to more than 180% of the revenue

raised by the tax. This large efficiency cost arises because of the large elasticity of demand at

equilibrium prices.



5. Fixed Costs and Adjusting the Tax Analysis to Account for Technology Diffusion

        This was not a conventional market, however. It was a rapidly growing one where most

communities did not yet have access. With fixed costs of entering a market the conventional


8 To get the numbers into comparable units, I will weight each city by the average number of households per
approach can miss a great deal. Looking at the producer surpluses in table 1, it is clear that they vary

greatly across locations depending on the elasticity of demand and the size of the market. The largest

potential producer surplus—New York City with $23.2 million—is much larger than the median

market's producer surplus, for example, of only about $2.5 million. With fixed costs of entering a

market, the chances the cable company will wait to rollout service until demand grows further are

high. At the time of the sample more than 90% of markets with producer surplus in the top 20 had

access to broadband while less than 30% of markets ranked 50 and below did.9 This is certainly

suggestive evidence that fixed costs played an important role in the diffusion of the product. If the

fixed costs were only at the neighborhood level, for example, then the diffusion pattern would tend to

be small roll outs into the high-income, highly educated neighborhoods in all markets rather than

more extensive rollouts in large markets and no service in the small ones.



A. Estimating the Size of the Fixed Cost

        To estimate the fixed cost of serving a market, table 2 lists the results from probit regressions

of whether the metro area had access to cable modems at the time of the survey as a function of the

producer surplus. This treats the entry as a binary variable at the market level for two reasons. First,

the share of people with the service seem relatively similar across markets that have access so it seems

like the size of entry must be fairly similar (relative to the overall market size). Second, the data do

not allow more detailed geographic analysis of the entry. With this in mind, there were a few metro

area where cable modems were available in only one small neighborhood or as part of a limited pilot

program—i.e., not generally of the same size as the more general entry locations. I do not count these

as entry in the Probit because in such circumstances the provider would not yet have incurred the



survey respondent (about 1220 on average).
9 I restrict the sample to the top 69 metro areas so as to have enough observations to estimate the demand curves
in each one and because in these markets almost none of the population lacks access to cable the way some
people do in very rural areas. The principle holds even more so in the markets below this top 69 group, however,
since virtually none of them had access to broadband at the time of the sample.

(recall that DSL was hardly available in any location at the time) so the regression will, arguably, not

require adjustments for strategic behavior as in Bresnahan and Reiss (1990; 1994) or Berry (1994). A

direct measure of the fixed cost of entering the market can be computed by just dividing the constant

term by the coefficient on producer surplus (since it is a cost, it is a negative number). This measure

gives the dollar value of producer surplus past which the probit index is greater than zero. In other

words, it indicates how high the annual producer surplus needs to be in a market before they are

predicted to have broadband. The first column uses only the measure of consumer surplus and the

constant term in the regression. The imputation predicts about 75 percent of markets correctly (about

5 percent of the time a market did not have access when the model predicted it would and 20 percent

of the time a market had access but was predicted not to). The value of the fixed cost here is the same

in every market. It suggests that entry does not occur until the annual producer surplus exceeds about

$3.4 million per year. 10 This would correspond to a fixed cost of about $16.4 million in NPV terms at

the discount rate and customer life discussed above. So a market needed to generate as much surplus

as somewhere like Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania or Austin, Texas to warrant entry in 1998.

         Columns 2 and 3 of the table allow a more nuanced estimate of the fixed costs by allowing for

reasonable variation in costs across locations. Column 2 recognizes that higher population density

could reduce the costs of rolling out broadband in a market and could reduce the fixed cost of entry.

By adding population density (as measured by Census Bureau, 1996) to the regression, the

specification asks what level of producer surplus is needed to justify entry but allows the level to be

lower if the market is highly concentrated. In the data, however, the density variable itself is



10 Of course the absolute value of the fixed cost depends on the assumptions in the NPV of revenue calculation.
The calculation of which cities are on the margin, however, and the additional DWL in those cities relative to the
conventional will not be affected by that choice because they are computed as a share of revenue. Changing the
NPV assumptions will adjust the implied producer surplus, implied fixed cost and future tax revenue by the same
proportion.
completely insignificant, small, and of the wrong sign. Column 3 repeats the same exercise but uses

the growth rate of population in the metro area in the preceding decade, since a location with the same

current producer surplus but a higher growth rate of population might lead the cable company to incur

the fixed cost and enter the market. Here the variable is the correct sign and is of more consequence

but the coefficient is only borderline significant. That said, this does generate a range of implied

fixed costs across markets. They range from cities needing current annual producer surplus of only

$2.1 million to warrant entry in markets at the 90th percentile of population growth to almost $5

million at the 10th percentile. Whether one uses the fixed costs from column 1 or column 3 will not

change the results, as demonstrated below. I also tried variables that might influence the demand or

cost of upgrading the cable lines such as the mean education in the market or the share of people in

the market who subscribe to satellite television. More education is typically associated with faster

adoption rates for new technology (Goolsbee and Klenow, 2002). Competition from Direct Broadcast

Satellite services like DirecTV, which are digital and have very high picture quality, was viewed by

many as forcing the most threatened cable systems to upgrade their networks irrespective of the

demand for broadband (see the discussion in Goolsbee and Petrin, 2004). When a company upgrades

its system, it is much cheaper to provide broadband service as an additional feature. Neither of these

factors had any significant effect on the observed deployment rates, however. The results indicate

that there is somewhat robust evidence that there some important fixed costs facing the providers of

residential broadband.



B. Computing the Actual Deadweight Loss from Taxing New Technology

        If the fixed cost of entry to a market is the size indicated above, the standard analysis of

taxation will be highly misleading. The conventional analysis of taxation is only accurate in markets

where producer surplus after taxes is sufficient to cover the fixed cost (or in places where they have
already entered).11 These markets together account for about 46% of the U.S. population. Similarly,

there is no problem in the smallest markets since the tax on broadband access has no effect of any

kind in places where entry would not occur regardless of the tax rate.

        In the middle markets, however, the impact of taxes on diffusion makes a big difference. In

these estimates, there were four market where the producer surplus with no tax on access would

warrant entry but the surplus with a tax on access would not warrant entry. These were Miami,

Cleveland, Tampa, and Milwaukee. If the government had put a tax on broadband (and did so before

diffusion took place) the firms would delay entering. In the interim, all of the consumer surplus and

producer surplus (but minus the fixed cost of entry) in these markets will become deadweight loss

from the tax.12

        At least in this case, that adjustment makes a big difference. In the 19 markets served both

before and after the imposition of the tax (where the conventional tax analysis is completely correct),

the sum total of DWL from the tax is $43 million per year and the revenue is $23 million per year. In

just the four markets where entry is delayed because of the tax, however, the DWL arising from lost

consumer surplus is $56 million—greater than the DWL in the 19 'normal' markets combined. The

lost producer surplus (minus the fixed costs) adds an additional DWL of $14 million. Thus the

deadweight loss adjustment associated with the impact of taxes on diffusion, $70 million, exceeds the

conventional deadweight loss by a factor of 2 (raising the total DWL from around 180 percent of

revenue to 434 percent of revenue).

        This finding of dramatically higher DWL from taxation is robust to how one defines the

marginal markets. Above, the analysis relied on the hard {0,1} entry cutoff and counted only four

markets as being delayed for certain and the ones above the threshold as having broadband for certain.

Using, instead, the continuous variable of the predicted probability of entry from the Probit


11 Though the producers must now subtract off the fixed cost of entry in each market when computing their total
profit, of course.
12 This is similar to the argument made in Faulhaber and Hogendorn (2000) and Owen and Rosston (1998) that
regression and recomputing the DWL and revenue for each market and summing across markets,

weighting by that probability before and after the imposition of a tax, the total DWL as a share of

revenue was even higher at 515%. Accounting for the fact that some markets might be growing faster

than others and might induce entry even if the 1998 level seemed insufficient by using the results

from the modified entry probits and repeating the same analysis yielded a smaller (but still

dramatically larger than in a conventional analysis) DWL of 346% of revenue.



C. The Actual Incidence of Taxing Broadband

         The conventional analysis does not just understate the DWL of taxing new goods. In terms of

incidence, it also significantly understates the share of the tax ultimately borne by consumers.

Typically, the share of the tax borne by consumers is calculated by comparing the pre-tax to the post-

tax consumer price. This will completely miss the problem arising in the bypassed markets. In those

places, consumers bear a large burden from taxation since they lose all of their consumer surplus even

though the tax collects no revenue. They are invisible because the tax shuts the market down. This

will disproportionately hurt consumers because in the marginal markets, almost by definition, the

suppliers were close to indifferent between entering and incurring the fixed cost and choosing not

entering. The tax leads producers to lose a small amount by choosing to delay entry and forgoing the

small net profit from the market but leads the customers to lose a great deal because of the lost

consumer surplus.13

         In the case of broadband, the overall burden of the tax calculated the conventional way shows

that the average price before tax went from $39.50 to $40.60, suggesting that consumers pay about 55

percent of the $2 tax. Accounting for the bypassed markets, however, the total burden of taxation on



forcing universal access to cable modems could slow deployment in medium sized markets.
13 I am indebted to Don Fullerton for pointing out that this argument arises because the monopolist is not able to
perfectly price discriminate. If the monopolist could do so, they would capture all the consumer surplus in the
market and would, therefore, internalize the impact that their decision to bypass a market has on the small
number of high valuation customers.
producers and consumers (equal to revenue paid plus the lost consumer and producer surplus minus

fixed costs) is $136 million on an annual basis. Of that $136 million, 70 percent ($93m) is borne by

the consumers. The standard calculation understates the consumer share substantially because it

disregards the large losses to consumers in the markets where entry gets delayed.14



6. Conclusion

         This paper argues that the deadweight loss from taxing a new technology that has fixed costs

associated with adoption can be much higher than taxing a conventional good because it can lead to a

delay in adoption and a subsequent loss of consumer and producer surplus. The paper uses empirical

evidence on the market for broadband at an early stage of its development as an empirical illustration

that the conventional DWL calculation of a tax can, in practice, understate efficiency losses from

taxation by a factor of 2-3 and understate the share of the tax burden borne by consumers by 15

percentage points. Given the importance attached to new goods in recent work in industrial

organization and macroeconomics, the findings in this paper suggest that taking into account the

impact of taxes on innovation and technology may be fundamental for understanding the role of

government policy in the new economy.




14 This also raises the possibility that a subsidy (negative tax) could generate an overall welfare gain to society if
it increased consumer surplus in markets where it induced entry by enough to outweigh the normal DWL. See
Goolsbee (2002) for a discussion.

Source: Estimates from a quadratic demand curve for each market. These are the top 50 markets, the next 19
markets are excluded to conserve space but are included in the estimates. The elasticity is calculated at a price of
$40 per month. The producer and consumer surplus calculations are computed as described in the text.

Notes: The dependent variable in each Probit is whether or not the metro area had general
access to broadband in 1998. The producer surplus is calculated as described in the text. The
measures of population density and the population growth rate come from the U.S. Census.
The implied fixed cost is calculated in NPV terms assuming a discount rate of 10% and a
customer life of five years.
