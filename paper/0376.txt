            Towards a Reconstruction of Keynesian Economics:
                 Expectations and Constrained Equilibria


                               ABSTRACT



      A two-period model of temporary equilibrium with rationing is

presented, paying particular attention to agents' expectations of

future constraints. it is shown that with arbitrary constraint

expectations many different types of current equilibria may be con—

sistent with the same set of (current and
                                            expected future) wages and
prices, and that constraint expectations tend to be self-fulfilling

(e.g., a higher expectation of Keynesian unemployment tomorrow

increases the probability that it will prevail today).

      In addition, rational constraint expectations (i.e., perfect

foresight of future constraint levels) are shown to enhance rather

than reduce the effectiveness of
                                   government policy.

1. INTROVUCT1ON


       This paper provides an old answer to an old question: how can

we explain unemployment equilibria?                The answer, provided both by

Keynes and by more recent equilibrium analysts, is that there is some

rigidity in prices (of factors or commodities) in the economy.                   It

is well known that, if all prices are flexible, equilibrium will be

characterized by full employment of all factors (which are not in

absolute surplus).          Although the precise articulation of the nature

of equilibrium when prices are not flexible (Hansen (1951), Solow and

Stiglitz    (1968)   ,   Hicks   (1974) ,   Benassy (1975), Grandniont (1977))

including   the   derivation of demand and supply curves when participants

are constrained in their purchases and/or sales of factors and commo-

dities (Patinkin (1965), dower (1965), Leijohnufvud (1968) , Barro and

Grossman (l97l),Malinvaud (1977)) is of a more recent vintage, the basic

insight that when there is a rigidity in some factor or commodity price

then the only equilibria will entail rationing in some markets, remains

unaltered1.
                                   2




       That leaves two critical questions to be answered if we are to

understand the nature of unemployment in our economy: which prices are

rigid, and why are they rigid.     The recent works of Barro and Grossman

and Malinvaud do not attempt to answer the latter question; they simply

posit that money wages and prices are rigid.       We provide an alternative

answer to these questions: because of the absence of futures markets,

individuals must base their current decisions on expectations; for

certain expectations, there may be no values of current variables

(wages and prices today) at which labor is fully employed.2


       More generally, it is our belief that the short—run analysis of

Malinvaud, I3arro—Grossman and Solow-Stiglitz misses out an essential

part of the Keynesian story: the role of savings and investment,

interest rates and expectations.       We show that the constraints which

households and firms expect to face in the future are critical in

determining their current behaviour.      A major implication of this

approach is that it becomes very likely that there exist multiple self—

fulfilling expectational equilibria, e.g. if households expect that

they will be unable to sell all their labor both this period and next,

then in fact, it will turn out that they will be unable to sell all

their labor; but had they expected there to be inflationary pressures

this period and next, then that might indeed turn out to be the case

instead.
                                     3




         Even more surprising is the result that there may exist temporary

equilibria   which exhibit unemployment or excess demand for labour when
expectations are rational (where we use the term rational expectations
in   the conventional sense, that agents possess full information now, not

only about the prices, but also about the constraints, not only

qualitatively, but quantitatively, which they will face in the future).

The paper thus serves to clarify the distinctive roles played by the

assumptions of rational expectations and price flexibility in some

recent models of macro—economic equilibrium: rational expectations

are consistent both with full employment and unemployment equilibria;

it is perfect wage and price flexibility which is necessaly (but not

sufficient) to ensure full employment, in general.


         The model we construct has policy implications which differ in

some significant ways from those of the Barro—Grossman—Malinvaud one—

period   model as well as from those of the more recent rational—
expectations literature. The latter, for instance, has emphasized
the inefficacy of government policy; we show, on the contrary, that
having rational expectations actually results, in certain situations, in

the multipliers associated with government fiscal policy being greater

than they would be with, say, static expectations: an increase in

government expenditure today has a spill—over effect in raising national

income at a future date; if the equilibrium at that date is also a

Keynesian (demand—constrained) equilibrium, then that increases the

demand   for labour at that date; the anticipation of this increased
demand for   labour   reduces   savings currently, and hence current aggregate
demand rises.
                                   4




        Our model also has different implications with respect to the

effect of wage and price cuts.      There is considerable evidence, for

example, that the real wage did not vary significantly in the course

of the great depression; assuming plausibly that the aggregate

production function did not shift significantly during that period,

this evidence would imply that the economy was at the Wairasian equili-

brium real wage: According to the Barro—Grossman-Malinvaud analysis,

"all" that was required in this situation was a proportionate reduction

in wages and prices, which would have restored full employment by means

of the real—balance effect.      'Ie argue, however, that these real—

balance effects are quantitatively insignificant, and that the short-

run dynamics of expectations (and, after all, it is the short run with

which we are concerned here) are such that reductions in wages

and prices may actually exacerbate the unemployment.      Our model is

thus   much more in the tradition of Hansen and Solow-Stiglitz who
questioned the relevance of the real—balance effect for 6hort—rw.
macro—economic analysis.


         We believe that the model we have constructed, simple as it is,

captures much of what was contained in Keynes, but seems so missing in

the one—period macro—economic models, in which savings nd investment,

interest rates and expectation formation play no critical role.


         The plan of the paper is as follows.    In Section 2 we outline

the micro—economic foundations of the model, illustrate the determination

of notional equilibrium when all wages and prices are flexible, and

examine the various types of effective equilibrium which can prevail
                                       5




when the current and expected future wage rate and the expected future
output price are sticky.          In this section we assume that agents have
Wairasian expectations (i.e., they do not expect to face any quantity
constraints       in the future), while in Sections 3 and 4 we investigate

the consequences of arbitrary and rational constraint expectations

respectively.         Section 5 considers the comparative statics properties

of the model, while Section 6 re—examines its behaviour when the current

real wage is assumed to be perfectly flexible.            Finally, Section 7

summarises the paper's conclusions and notes sons directions for

further research.



2.     NOTIONAL    MV   EFFECTIVE EQUILIBRiA WiTH CQALRASIAN EXPECTATIONS


         The model to be examined is a two—period one,        in which agents
base   their behaviour in the present, period 1, on their subjectively

certain point expectations concerning prices, wages and          constraint
levels   in the future, period 2.          considering first the behaviour of

households, we abstract from distribution effects, and so assume that

the behaviour of the household sector can be characterized as if it were

the outcome of the maximization of a single aggregate utility function.

Since we assume for simplicity that total labour supply is fixed and

since we are excluding a real—balance effect, utility depends on

present and future consumption only.            This is written in a simple

additive form, where the discount factor c equals (1 +

     being   the household sector's discount rate:
                                         6




(1)                  U =           +
                            u(c)       cu(c2)


When households are unconstrained, maximization of (1) is carried out

subject   to two    budget constraints, the lifetime budget constraint (2)

and the requirement (implied by the assumption of imperfect capital

markets) that current consumption cannot exceed current income:



(2)
               C1    + p2c2   <    Y=        rn   +
                                                      w1L+   w2L



(3)                  c1 <     rn+w1L


where the current output price, p1, is normalized to equal unity,

rn is the value of the household's initial endowment, L is the

household's labour supply (assumed not to change between periods) and

w2 and p2 are the present values of the currently expected future

wage and price level respectively.3                   Note that we assume that firms'

profits are not redistributed to households, but instead are absorb'ed

by the government through 100 per cent profits taxation.                     This is an

undesirable assumption, both because it implies that government policy

is state—dependent, and because, by assuming a zero propensity to

consume out of profits, it leaves the model open to the criticism

that it is biased in favour of fiscal policy.                      However, this assumption

permits a considerable simplification of the model and it does not

affect any of its qualitative properties.
                                      7




       Ignoring boundary solutions (where the current income constraint

 (3) bites so that savings are forced to equal zero) ,   maximization   of (1)

subject to (2) and (3) leads to unconstrained or notional demand

functions for current and future consumption:



(4)             c1(p2, Y)       and   c2(p2, Y)
                   ?   +                 -   +


where the signs of the partial derivatives of the functions in (4) are

as indicated.     As is well known, the effect on current consumption of

a change in the price of future output (i.e., the effect on savings of

a change in the interest rate) is indeterminate in general, since the

income and substitution effects of such a change work in opposite

directions.     In the diagrams below we assume for convenience that

the substitution effect dominates, so that c1/p2 is always positive,

but this assumption is not crucial.


       Turning next to firms, we assume that their behaviour can be

viewed as the outcome of the actions of a representative firm which

maximizes the discounted sum of current and future profits:4



(5)                         =



When the firm faces no constraints, it chooses current and future

employment levels, e1 and e2, as well as I, the quantity of current

output which it holds over as investment to augment the productivity of

labour in the future:

profit maximization leads to notional employment and investment demand

functions, which also imply notional supply functions for both current

and future output:6

                                                                     +    -

 Wenote that, when firms face no quantity constraints, current employ-
 ment demand depends only on the current real wage: a change in expected
 future wages or prices changes the amount of current output held over
                                     9




as investment and so changes current sales, but it does not affect

current employment and output decisions.              Similarly next period's

employment   and output decisions are independent of the current real
wage.


       The third and final agent in the economy is the government, which,
in addition to taxing firms' profits, can make direct transfer payments
to households, increasing their initial endowments rn, or can make
direct purchases of goods in both present and future periods, g1 and
g2.


        Having made these assumptions about the individual agents in the
economy, we can now characterize a full Walrasian equilibrium as a
triple (w1, p2, w;) which simultaneously satisfies the              notional

current   and future goods market equilibrium loci (GMEL) and the
notional current and future labour market equilibrium loci (LMEL):


(10)          GMEL1: c1(p2, Y) +               =
                                     g1            y1(w1, p2, w2)


(11)          GMEL2: c2(p2, Y) +               =
                                     g2            y2(p2, w2)


(12)          LMEL1: L =    e1(w1)


(13)          LMEL2: L = e2(p2,          w2)
                                   10




By Wairas' Law the four equations are mutually dependent and so we may

omit any one from consideration.        For the present, we chobse to drop

the GMEL2I which leaves us with three equations in three unknowns.

However,   in order to permit a two—dimensional representation, we focus
on only two variables, w1 and p2. In the remainder of this paper,
therefore, we assume that w2, the wage rate currently expected to
prevail next period, is parametrically fixed (and it is convenient,

though quite inessential, to assume in most of the paper that it equals

the "full" Wairasian equilibrium value, w2), but the analysis would

not be substantially affected if we assumed instead that                 real-wage

expectations were unit elastic (i.e., w2/p2 =
                                                     w1)


         For any given future wage, we can illustrate these loci in

(w1, p2) space, as in Figure 1.         The LMEL1   uniquely   defines

points above this locus representing excess supply of, and points

below representing excess demand for labour, while the GMEL1 is a

downward—sloping locus, points above it corresponding to excess demand

for   goods and points below to excess supply of goods.          (We assume that

the fall in supply of current output following a rise in p2 is more

than sufficient to offset any fall in demand.)         Finally, the future

LMEL2 uniquely defines a value of p2, which equals the equilibrium

value, p, only if the value of w2 underlying the diagram equals the

full equilibrium value, w. It may be noted that the equilibrium at

A is globally stable if w1 and p2 change according to ttonnement

processes.    This may be seen more easily by noting that the GMEL1 is
                                         11




in effect an IS curve, with points above           it representing situations
where investment demand exceeds savings, requiring a rise in the interest

rate (i.e., a fall in p2) to restore equilibrium and conversely for

points below the locus.


         When w1     and   p2
                                 are   rigid, however, the division of the space

into disequilibrium regions cannot be the same as in Figure 1, for the
by—now well known reason that a disequilibrium in one market will
affect decisions in the other market, so affecting the location of the
equilibrium loci at all points other than the full Wairasian equilibrium
point A.      In the remainder of this section we show how the regions are
affected when disequilibrium is allowed, on the crucial assumption (to
be   relaxed in the next section) that all agents expect a Wairasian

equilibrium to prevail in the next period.              We also assume for simplicity

that the same expectations of future wage arid price levels are held by

all agents arid that   expectations of future wages are completely inelastic
at   the Wairasian level w2.


         Consider   first the goods market equilibrium locus under conditions
of excess supply of    labour: firms face no constraints but households are

unable to   sell the   full amount, L, of their endowment of labour          services
in   the current period.        Hence the GL1 becomes:7



(14)       GMEL1(ESL, W): c1(p2, Y)           + g1 =   y1(w1, p2, w2)

where
                                       12




 (15)               Y =   rn   ÷ w1e1(w1) + w2L,        e1(w1), < L




Since constrained income, Y, is less than notional income, Y, it

follows that households' effective consumption demand is reduced as a

result of the unemployment they face, and so a point of notional goods

market equilibrium in (w1, p2) space corresponds to effective excess

supply of current output.          In passing from notional to effective regions,

therefore, the GMEL1(ESL,W) lies to the right of the notional
                                                                                 GMEL1,
as shown in Figure 2.          However, the two loci only differ for values

of w1 greater than w1, since it is only in this range that the

employment constraint facing households is binding (i.e.,                  e1(w1) < L)


           A similar argument applies to the GMEL1 when the labour market

exhibits     excess demand: households are now unconstrained whereas
firms' current production is constrained by the labour they can obtain:8

where e1 is simply L and is less than the notional labour demand

e1(w1) .     We may note that, under our assumptions, the excess demand for

labour does not affect firmst investment plans (assuming, of course,

that the constraint does not become so severe that their maximum output

level falls below their desired level of investment).                Comparing (16)
                                 13




with (ii), it must follow, since the employment constraint bites, that

effective supply is less than notional supply, implying that the con-

trajned GMEL1 lies to the left of the notional locus when excess

demand for labour prevails (i.e., when w1 is less than w1)


         The LMEL1 is affected in a similar manner when the goods market

is out of equilibrium.    Thus, in a situation of excess supply of goods,

households are unconstrained but firms are unable to make their notional

level of sales.    This forces them to recalculate their employment and

investment decisions, with the result that the LMEL1 becomes:



(17)          LMEL1(ESG, W): L =
                                      1l'   ":i' 2'


(17')                            =
                                      F1[y1 + @l; Wjj 2'       W;)]



where:



(18)          y1 = c1(p2, Y) + g1 < y1(w1, p2, W;)


We may note that, by contrast with (8) ,   current   employment demand now

depends on much more than just the current real wage: the demand for

labour is determined both by what firms are able to sell and by what

they decide to store.    The latter is itself in turn affected by the

sales constraint, by contrast with an employment constraint which, as

illustrated in equation (16'), does not affect the relative profitability
                                   14




of selling and investing.      Comparing equations (12) and (17), since

constrained employment demand,          ,   is   less than notional employment

demand, e1 , a point of notional labour market equilibrium must

correspond to effective excess supply of labour when excess supply of

goods prevails;      (17) therefore lies below (12) in Figure 2.        However,

comparing (17') with (16'), since constrained investment demand I

must be greater than notional investment demand I, it follows that

these two loci do not coincide and that (17) lies above (16).           Allowing

investment to be carried out by firms therefore leads to an effective

region of excess supply of goods and excess demand for labour, or, in

the terminology of Muellbauer and Portes (1978), a region of under-

consumption.


        Finally, when excess demand for goods prevails and the labour

market is in equilibrium, firms are in equilibrium, and though households

are rationed in the goods market, the assumption that labour is supplied

inelastically ensures that this does not affect their labour supply.

The   effective   labour market equilibrium locus therefore coincides with

the notional locus.


        These shifts from notional to effective equilibrium loci are

summarized in Figure 2 (where the notional loci are shown as dashed

and the effective loci as solid lines).            Following Malinvaud the four

regions are labelled K, for Keynesian unemployment, C, for classical

unemployment, R, for repressed inflation, and U, for underconsumption.

It may be remarked that region K corresponds to a low expected price
                                   15




of future output, and   so   to a high interest   rate: although this   might

be thought to contradict the Keynesian notion of a liquidity trap, it

is in fact fully consistent with Keynes, as will become clearer after

the explicit consideration of expectations, to which we now turn.




3.   CONSTRAIWT EXPECTATIONS    MV CON.STRAINEV EQUILiBRIA

       So far, except   for   the change in state variables implied by the

explicit consideration of two per4ods and the neglect of the real-

balance effect, the present model is extremely similar to that of

Barro—Grossman—Malinvaud.9       However, some new features are intro-

duced when we abandon the assumption, made throughout the last section,

that all agents expect a Walrasian equilibrium to prevail in the future.

Instead, we assume in this section that agents expect to face given

constraint levels in one or both markets next period.        (For simplicity,

we retain the assumption that firms and    households   have the same

expectations about which regime will prevail next period.       The analysis

may easily be extended to examine the implications of heterogeneous

expectations).


       The first point to emphasize is that if agents expect to be con-

strained next period this will affect their current behaviour even if

w1 and p2 are flexible; in other words, it will shift the notional

equilibrium loci.    Admittedly, this is not true of the LMEL1, equation

(12), since   labour supply is fixed and, when firms face no constraints
                                       16




in the present period, their current employment decisions are determined

only by w1.     However, the notional GMEL1         will be          affected.       Consider

first the case where agents expect regime K (exbess supply of both

labour and goods) to prevail next period.               Equation (10) therefore

becomes:



                                                        =                    w
(19)           GMEL1(W, K):         c1(p2, ) + g1                       ''


(19')                                                   =                    —
                                                                 F[e1(w1)]


where:




(20)              =   In + wL   +                   <       L)
                                    w;L2


                  <
(21)
                      y2p2'   w2)




Relative to equation (10), (19) implies an expansion of the region of

notional excess supply of goods on two counts: both because households,

whose lifetime income is now lower, have a lower consumption demand, and

because firms, expecting to face a sales constraint in the future, have

a lower investment demand, and so would like to increase their current

sales.     These two effects are illustrated in Figure 3.                        The expectation

of unemployment by households shifts the notional GMEL1 to the right at

all points, from the line (W,W) to (W,L2).                        The expectation of a
                                     17




sales constraint also shifts the locus to the right (since a reduction

in y2 raises l' and so increases the region of current excess

supply of goods).      However it does not shift it throughout its length,

since a given value of the expected sales constraint y2 is only

binding when it satisfies (21) .          The shift therefore takes place only

for values of p2 above p, where p (which must be less than p2)

is the value of p2 which satisfies (21) with equality and is therefore

a function of w2 and y2.           The resulting locus is shown by the line

denoted (W,K)     in   Figure 3.


         The effects of other constraint expectations on the notional

GMEL1 may be illustrated in a similar fashion.             Consider, for example,

the effect of an expectation of Classical unemployment.             The notional

GMEL1 now becomes:



(22)
               GMEL1(W,C):       c1(c2;
                                           p2' Y) + g1 =   y1(s41, p2, w)


where



                         C2 <             Y)
(23)
                                c2(p2,


The location of (22) in Figure 3 is easily determined.             Assuming that

the    level of the expected employment constraint            is   the same as in

(19),   this constraint alone shifts the notional locus as before from
(W,W) to (W,L2) .        The   expected consumption   constraint c2     then has
the    additional effect of shifting the locus to the left,         since such a
                                     18




constxaint raises current demand (because households, expecting to be
unable to     purchase all the goods they wish in the future, have a reduced

incentive to save) and so the region of current excess supply contracts.

However, as with (21) ,    this   constraint is only effective for those

values of w1 and p2 which satisfy (23).            It is easily seen that

this inequality defines a region to the left of an upward—sloping

locus in Figure 3, which locus must itself lie to the right of A,

and so the notional GMEL1 when Classical unemployment is expected

pivots to the left around point D, the intersection of this locus

and the (W,L2) locus.


         Finally,   since our main concern is to locate the effective

equilibrium loci in the diagram, we note that the two effective loci

corresponding to (19) and (22) differ from these only in replacing the

current notional labour supply L by the corresponding effective

supply, e1(w1); i.e., in replacing Y by Y where:



(24)                =    + w1e1(w1) +



Hence, moving from notional to effective loci implies (since the current

employment     constraint is binding only for values of w1 above w) that
the two loci pivot to the right around their points of intersection
with the notional LMEL1, i.e., points A' and A", as shown in
Figure   4.     Moreover, for the same reasons just given   which require
the    notional GMEL1 when Classical unemployment is expected to lie to
                                    19




 the left of the corresponding locus when Keynesian unemployment is

expected, so the locus   marked   (ESL,C)   in   Figure 4 must lie wholly to

the left of that marked (ESL,K).


       This analysis has three important implications.            Firstly, even

when w1 and p2 are flexible, there is a continuum of possible

"Walrasian" equilibria lying along the notional
                                                       L11EL1   (including,   for

example, all points on the segment AA"), each one corresponding to a

given configuration of constraint expectations.          Secondly, when

and p2 are sticky, there is a large region of
                                                        (w1, p2) space (including
the whole of the area between the two solid lines in Figure 4) which is

compatible with either   regime   C or K prevailing today, the only

difference being the state of constraint expectations.11            Thirdly,
constraint   expectations tend to be self—fulfilling3 in        the sense that

regime K is more likely than regime C to prevail today if it is

expected to prevail tomorrow, and conversely.


       A similar analysis may be carried out for the effects of other

constraint expectations on all four effective equilibrium loci, and

broadly similar conclusions follow.         However, two qualifications to

this statement must be noted.      In the first place, the L?L1 under

conditions of excess demand for goods turns out to be completely inde-

pendent of the state of expectations about future constraints, just as

we found in the last section that with Wairasian expectations it

coincides with the notional LMEL1.       The reasons for this are simple:

the assumption of an inelastic labour supply ensures that households'

expectations do not affect their current labour supply; while the

assumptions that the labour market is currently in equilibrium
                                       20




and that firms can sell all they currently wish to produce mean that

firms' demand for labour depends only on the current wage rate and is

independent of whether or not they expect to be constrained in the

future.     A second qualification is that the complementarity assumed

to exist between employment and investment in the second period production

function H(.) yields some exceptions to the rule that expectations tend

to be self—fulfilling in the sense defined above.               To illustrate this,

consider   the effective GMEL1 when excess demand for labour prevails.
When all agents expect to be unconstrained in the future, this is given
by equation (16) above.         Now suppose instead that they expect regime
R to prevail in the future.            This yields an alternative locus:


(25)        GIyIEL1(EDL;R) :    c1(.c2,   p2, Y) +   g1
                                                          =
                                                              1e      e1 p2)

(25')                                                     =           —
                                                              F(e1)       I(e2;
                                                                            + p2)
                                                                                +

where


(26)               <             and         < e2(p2, w2)
                       e1(w1)


Since consumers expect to be constrained in the goods market in the
future,    this reduces their incentive to save, and so encourages them

to spend more in the present, thus increasing the likelihood that

excess demand for goods will prevail today.               However, the fact that

firms expect to be unable to hire as much labour as they will wish in

the future leads them, because of the complementarity between labour and
                                   21




investment,    to reduce rather than increase their current investment

demand.      Since their current output is unaffected, this tends to make

it more likely that excess supply of rather than excess demand for goods

will prevail today.      In this case, therefore, the expectation that

regime R will prevail tomorrow leads to two effects, one of which

makes it more likely but the other of which makes it less likely that

regime R will prevail in the present, and there is no presumption in

general as to which of these effects will dominate.      (Clearly, however,

unless the values of e2 and             are such that I in (25') is

considerably less than I in (19'), equation (25) must lie to the left

of (19)


          Subject to these qualifications, the location of the equilibrium

loci under different assumptions about agents' constraint expectations

tends   to confirm the general points made above: the prevalence of a
given regime today depends on the expectations held about which regimes
will   prevail tomorrow, and in most cases these expectations are of a

self—fulfilling kind in the sense already discussed.      It is clear that

to the extent that the government can influence these expectations,

then it possesses an important instrument capable of influencing to a

considerable degree the current state of the economy.




4. RATiONAL CONSTRAINTEXPECTATIONS


          In the last section we examined the effect of arbitrary parametric

constraint expectations on the location of the effective equilibrium loci
                                    22




 in     (w1, p2) space.   In this section we explore an alternative approach

 which aVoids this arbitrariness of expectations by postulating that

 households and firms have full information concerning each others'

 intended future actions.     Thus, for example, the labour supply con-

 straint which households expect to face in the next period equals the

 employment level which firms currently intend to demand in that period.

By analogy with the widely studied phenomenon of rational expectations

 of prices, we label this hypothesis one of rational constraint

expectations.


         One immediate consequence of the assumption of rational constraint

expectations is that the set of regimes which can be expected to prevail

next period is restricted.      Consider first regime U: if, at a given

 (w1,p2) combination, firms are pursuing a production and sales plan

which implies that regime U will prevail next period, they must be

acting irrationally.      For, if they are to be rationed in both labour

and goods markets next period, they will end that period with unsold

inventories, so foregoing an opportunity to increase their profits.

Hence   with rational constraint expectations neither households nor
firms can expect regime u    prevail next period. A similar argument
                              to

applies to regime C: households cannot rationally expect to be con-
strained in both markets next period, and so with rational constraint
expectations both households and firms will adjust their plans to ensure
that   they do not imply such a double rationing in the future,   Of

course, these conclusions are a consequence of the assumption that the

world ends at the end of the second period.     Nevertheless, while
                                    23




allowing for more than one future period would a3Toid the stark conclusion

that (ignoring boundary cases) only regimes K and R can be rationally

expected, there remains a presumption even in a multi—period model that

these regimes are more likely to be expected than C or U, since

under each of the latter regimes one group of agents is involuntarily

building up stocks (of savings or inventories), which is only consistent

with rationality if one of the two constraints which these agents face

in such a regime is expected to be relaxed in a subsequent period.


       Having established which regimes can be rationally expected to

prevail next period, we now wish to locate in (w11p2) space the regions

which are consistent with different disequilibrium regimes when constraint

expectations are rational.     As in previous sections this requires us to

locate in (w1,p2) space various equilibrium loci, and we illustrate

this construction for the case of the current GMEL, assuming that

excess supply of labour prevails today and that Keynesian unemployment

is rationally expected to prevail tomorrow.     This locus is given by

solving the following set of four equations in five variables (w1,p2,

L1,L2 and y2) for a single equation in w1 and p2 only:



(27)                                                =
       GMEL1(ESL,K;RCE): c1[P2;-i-w11+w2] + g1


(28)
                      e1(w1)

                          —     *
(29)           L2 =   e2(y2;w2)
                                    24




(30)                y2 =            +           +   w2L2] +
                                         W1L1



         The construction of the desired equilibrium locus proceeds by

substituting from (28) and (29) into (27) and (30), locating these two

equations in (w1,p2) space for different values of y2, and then

tracing the locus of their intersection points as y2 varies.                      This

is illustrated in Figure 5.       The line      ctci.   is the Wairasian locus,

equation (10), which passes through the full Walrasian equilibrium

point    A.     Even if firms do not expect to be sales-constrained next
period, rational households will realise that they will face an employ-
ment constraint next period if e2(p21w2) is less than L, i.e., if
       is less than p2.     Hence, amending (10) to:



                                                              =
(31)             ci[p2 ;   + w1L + w;e2(p2,w;)] + g1               y1(w11p2,w2)


causes it to pivot around point A to give the locus A. Next,

for a given expected sales constraint, y2, this locus must shift to

the right,except at points to the left of D, where p2 is less than
 0                                       —                *
       (the   solution, as before, of y2 =
                                                y2(p2,w2))
                                                                  and so the expected

sales constraint is not binding.          This yields the locus DA' ,             which

is identical to (19) except that the knowledge by households of the

dependence of their expected employment constraint on the firms'

expected sales constraint is allowed for by substituting for L2

from (29).       The locus DA'     is therefore the notional GMEL1
                                    25




conditional     on a sales constraint of y2 being expected by both firms
and households.       The áorresponding effective GMELI1   is therefore
obtained in the usual way by substituting for              from (28) , which
causes the locus to pivot around A'          to give yA' ,         the equation of

which   is:




                                                                      +        =
(32)
         GMEL1(ESL,K;y2):
                                     ;
                                         rn+w1e1(w1)+w22(y2w2             g1



         The next step in deriving the rational—constraint-expectations

locus is to locate (30) in the diagram, after substituting from (28)

and (29), for given values of y. We note first that this locus is

upward-sloping if and only if the current elasticity of demand for

labour   is less than unity (i.e., (w1/e1)e1/w1 <         1)   .     Making        this
assumption      for diagranimatic convenience, we note also that the locus

must pass through A if the        expected sales constraint just equals the
notional      Wairasian supply next period (i.e., if           =
                                                                   y2(w11p2,w2)),
and that reductions in           move it progressively to the right.

Moreover it may be shown that (provided c1/p2 is positive but not

too large) a given reduction in             will move (30) to the right by

less than it moves (32).        Hence corresponding to the locus yA'

 (equation 32)) is a locus such as S         (equation   (30)), with both

loci conditional on the same value of y. The intersection of

these two loci at E therefore represents a point on the effective

         under rational constraint expectations.

         By varying the expected sales constraint y2 continuously, the

desired locus may be traced out, as shown by the heavy line AF.                          In

a similar manner the other effective equilibrium loci under rational

constraint expectations may be derived.                   Without presenting the details

of this construction, it is clear that rational constraint expectations

do not eliminate the possibility that Keynesian unemployment will

prevail today.         On the contrary, by working through a similar

derivation    in order to locate in the diagram the effective LMEL1(ESG,K)
under rational constraint expectations, it may be seen that the region
in (w1,p2) space consistent with Keynesian unemployment today                       is

greater when the same state is rationally expected to prevail tomorrow

than when Wairasiari equilibrium is expected.                     At the same time, of

course,   there are some points (such as ó                  and    A' )   which are consistent

with   Keynesian unemployment today when expectations of future demand
constraints     are arbitrarily pessimistic, but not when they are rational.
Nevertheless,      relative at least to the situation where Walrasian
equilibrium     is expected tomorrow, rational constraint expectations

necessarily     increase the likelihood that regime K, and also regime
R, will prevail in the current period, for                    any given (w1,p2)

combination.1


          Having outlined some of the consequences of rational constraint
expectations for the location of current disequilibrium regions, we

turn   in the next section to a brief consideration of their implications
for    the comparative static responses of the model to exogenous shocks.

5.   COMPARATIVE STATICS: MULTIPLIERS ANP SHIFTS ETh'EEN REGIMES



          As is now well known, an analysis of the effects of changes in

exogenous variables in a model of temporary equilibrium with rationing

must take account of both their effects on the endogenous variables

within each region and their effects on the location of the regions

themselves.


          Considering the latter first, Figures 6 and 7 illustrate the

effects of changes in current government expenditure and the state of

technology (or, equivalently, the level of profitability), on the

location    of the four disequilibrium regions assuming Wairasian expec—
tations.     An increase in g1 shifts the Walrasian equilibrium from
A to B in Figure         6, implying that, if   the economy is initially in
Wairasian    equilibrium, a cut in government spending will give rise to

Keynesian unemployment while a rise in government spending will induce

excess demand for goods (without immediately disturbing labour—market

equilibrium)   .     Similarly, Figure 7 shows the effects of supply-side
shocks    on the   diagram.   An exogenous improvement in profitability
(due,    for example, to technological progress) affects the loci as shown,

assuming (plausibly) that it raises the demand for labour at a given

real wage.      Hence point A, which represents initial Walrasian

equilibrium, moves into a state of Keynesian unemployment, requiring

(paradoxically) a rise in the real wage if Walrasian equilibrium is to

be restored.       Conversely, an exogenous decline in profitability (due,

for example, to an increase in the price of an imported input) converts
                                      28




 an initial state of Wairasian equilibrium into one of Classical unem-

ployment, so requiring the Classical remedy of a real wage cut.


          These   effects of changes in current exogenous variables are
virtually identical to those which hold in the Barro—Grossman—Malinvaud
model.      One additional feature of our two—period model is that it

permits an examination of the effects of exogenous changes in expec-

tations,    both of future constraint levels and of   future wages and

prices. The effects of changes in the former have already been con-
sidered in Section 3. As for an increase in w2, the expected future
wage rate, it has an ambiguous effect      on the diagram:   on the one hand,

it has a substitution effect on production, reducing firms' desired

employment next period and so (because of the complementarity in the

production function H(.)) reducing current investment demand and

therefore raising the current supply of output.        On the other hand,

a rise in w2 increases households' lifetime income, so raising their

current   demand for output.      To the extent that this income effect
dominates,    then an increase in    w2 has exactly the same effect on the

diagram as an increase in g1 in Figure 6, implying that an expected

future wage cut will shift the economy from Walrasian equilibrium into

Keynesian    unemployment in the current   period.


         These    relationships between changes in exogenous variables and

shifts in the equilibrium loci continue to hold whatever assumptions

are   made about constraint expectations.      In addition, rational
                                    29




constraint expectations permit a further role for, government policy

through the "announcement effects" of a perfectly foreseen change in

future government spending.      Thus, an increase in g2 relaxes the

expected future sales constraint on firms, which both raises their

current investment demand and (by raising their future labour demand)

relaxes the expected future labour—supply constraint facing households.

On   both counts, the region of excess demand for current output is
enlarged, and so with rational constraint expectations a perfectly
anticipated   increase in g2    has exactly the same effect on the diagram
as an increase in g1 has in Figure 6.        similarly, an anticipated

increase in future profitability enlarges the region of current excess

supply of goods, and so has effects similar to those of an increase in

current   profitability in Figure 7.

          Turning next to the comparative static properties of the model
within different regions, a great many results    could be presented, but

many   of these   are familiar from previous studies of the Barro—Grossman—

Malinvaud   model, and it would be tedious to present them in detail.
However, one issue which is of considerable interest is the effect
of   rational constraint expectations on the magnitudes of the comparative
statics   derivatives, and especially of the Keynesian employment multiplier.

To examine this, consider first the multiplier when Keynesian unemployment

prevails in the current period, but agents make no allowance for future

constraints (i.e., they assume that Wairasian equilibrium will prevail

next period).      Current employment and sales are therefore jointly
                                               30




determined   by the two equations:




(33)               =



                   =                 in    + w11    +          +
                        c(p2;                           w2L)



This   implies a simple one—period multiplier, very similar to the usual

Keynesian expression (the only difference arises from the fact that in

our model the marginal propensities to consume out of wages and profits

are different, by assumption):



                                                         —l
                            r                 e1 c11           —
(35)                        Il—w              ——I
                            L


However, if regime K both prevails today and                       is   rationally expected

to prevail tomorrow, then, since all agents take into account the effect

of   current events on future             behaviour, (33) and (34) must be replaced

by the following set of four simultaneous equations:


                       1
(36)           Ii =    e1(y1, '2' w1, w2)


(37)              =                 rn    +         + w22) +


(38)               =                 rn +           + w22) +
                           c2(p2;
                                         31




 (39)
              L2     e2(y1, y2 W11 w2)



 Routine calculations show that under these circumstances the multiplier

 is:




 (40)
                        r
                        Ii—

                                                          w2B    a

                   l
where:

                    A                    A

 (41)        A =   — c1             +
                   y1 '
 (42)        B =   2
                   —        c1 2 c2
                                        '2

There are three distinct reasons why (40) exceeds (35).            Firstly,
as shown in the Appendix, /y1 exceeds                           (at least

locally); i.e., a relaxation of the current sales constraint faced

by firms has a greater impact effect on their current demand for

labour when they expect to face a similar constraint in the future than

when they expect to be unconstrained.         This result, which reflects the

Le Chatelier principle, does not arise because expectations are rational

but solely because they are "Keynesian": hence government policy has a
greater expansionary effect when firms are pessimistic about their
future sales prospects. Secondly, a relaxation of the current sales
constraint also causes firms to revise their future employment plans
                                    32




upwards, but with rational constraint expectations households know

that this raises their lifetime income and so they increase their con-

sumption in both periods thus having a further impact effect on firms'

current demand for labour.      Finally, and probably most importantly,

with rational constraint expectations the multiplier itself is increased,

or rather, it might be more correct to say that there are now not one

but   many multipliers, operating both within and between periods.             Even
though the government    injection is not repeated next period, the

relaxation    of a current constraint on one group of agents has an
enhanced    expansionary effect by relaxing the constraints which the

other group expects to face in the future, and so on.


              findings illustrate the important point that the implications
          These

of rational expectations for the effectiveness of government policy
depend completely on    whether or not they are accompanied by sufficient
price   flexibility to ensure market clearing without rationing.          When

prices are rigid, rational constraint expectations, at least in the

present model, actually enhance the effectiveness of traditional fiscal

policy.




6. VISEQJJILI8RIUM REGIMES OJITH CURREWr WAGE-PRICE FLEXI8ILITY


          So far we have followed both Solow-Stiglitz and Barro-Grossman-

Malinvaud   in assuming that at least one current price or wage rate is

inflexible in the current period.        If we relax   this   assumption and
                                     33




assume that w1 is perfectly flexible (though p2 and w2 are still

exogenbus) then there are two     possibilities:       w1 may move to clear

either   the current labour market or the current goods market.

         If   w1 is assumed to move to clear the current labour market,

then for a given value of p2 the only possible equilibrium is at

the    corresponding   point on one of the two effective labour market

equilibrium    loci in Figures 2 to 7.      With this    qualification much of

the    analysis in previous sections continues to be relevant, the only
additional feature being that the slope of the effective LMEL1, when
excess supply of goods prevails, now becomes a crucial determinant of
the efficacy of wage flexibility in ensuring continual full employments
Consider, for example, this locus when agents expect to be unconstrained
next period - equation (17) -      and totally differentiate it (substituting

for      from (18))




(43)               L+—I l =               r1             l1
                         w1J              Li       2     2J
The coefficient of dp2 will generally be negative, but the coefficient

of dw1 will be positive -        implying   that this locus, which is the

boundary between regions K and U            in   Figure 2,   is   downward-sloping

-   if the first or "Keynesian" term in parentheses dominates the second
"Classical" term, 1/Bw1.            If this happens, then even a small dis-

placement of p2, the expected future goods price, below its Walrasian

equilibrium level, may require a considerable fall in the current real
                                   34




wage, possibly even to zero, if labour market equilibrium         is to be
restored.     This suggests that under    the   presentsetof assumptions

current wage flexibility may be anything but a painless means of

ensuring continual full employment, if expectations of future wage and

price   levels are inelastic.


         But in any case the assumption of the preceding paragraph, that

the real wage moves to clear the current labour market, runs counter

to a long tradition in macro-economics which argues that goods markets

clear rapidly by price adjustment whereas the labour market does not.

It would be more consistent with this tradition (which finds expression,

of course, in Keynes's General Theory and in the IS-LM model of income

determination) to assume that w1 ,        or    rather its inverse, the price of

current output in terms of "wage—units", adjusts to clear the current

goods market rather than the current labour        market.   With this change

in assumptions, the model becomes one with current wage—price flexibility,

but in which the given expectations of future wages and prices can give

rise to either excess demand for or excess supply of labour in the

present period.


         It is most convenient to analyse the model under this new

assumption by setting up the diagrams      in (w2, p2) space.      Considering

notional    equilibrium first, the notional GMEL1, equation      (10), may be

solved   for the value of w1    which   clears the current goods   market, as

a function   of parametric wage and price      expectations and of the level
                                 35




of current government expenditure:


 (44)              w1 = (p2,    w2    g1)



The signs of the partial derivatives of ft.) imply that an increase in
either p2 or w2 gives rise to excess demand for current output (so
requiring a fall in w1 to restore equilibrium) . The former effect
has already been assumed in Section 2;      the   latter assumes that the
income effect on households of a higher expected future wage rate

raises current consumption demand by more than the substitution effect

on firms lowers current investment demand.        Substituting from (44)

into    (12) yields the notional LMEL1 in (w2,p2) space:



(45)                             L=
                LMEL1(W,W):             e1[(P2    W2;   g1)]


As shown in Figure    8, equation (45) defines a   downward—sloping   locus in
(w21p2) space, with points above corresponding to excess demand         for

and    points below to excess supply of labour in the current period.

The diagram also shows equation (13), the notional future labour market

equilibrium locus, which is upward—sloping and intersects (45) at the full

Walrasian equilibrium point (w2, p2).


          Moving from notional to effective equilibria does not affect

either locus, as long as we continue to     assume that constraint expec-
tations are Walrasian, since the current goods market always clears.
                                    36




Of course, at all pointsoff the IMEL1       the   equilibrium value of w1 is

determined not by (10) but by either (14) or (16), and this must be

taken into account in evaluating the comparative statics properties of

the model.     Notice that under these assumptions there can be no

multiplier, since there is no market on which both buyers and sellers

are simultaneously subject to constraints.


       Suppose next that agents have arbitrary expectations of future

constraints.13     If excess supply of labour is expected then current

consumption demand is lower than when expectations are Wairasian, and

so a rise in the current real wage is required to choke off the incipient

excess supply of current output.         This causes a fall in the current

demand for labour, and so the region of current excess labour supply

expands.     Formally, (45) must now be replaced by:



(46)
       LMEL1(W,ESL):
                              L =
                                    e1[c(L2;   p2, w2; g1)]



where (.)      givs   the solution for w1 of equation (10) with households'

lifetime income equal to Y (equation (20)) rather than Y.             As in

Section 3,   therefore,   expectations of unemployment exhibit a "bootstraps"

property:    the region of (w2,p2) space consistent with unemployment
today is larger the more pessimistic the expectation of unemployment
tomorrow.


       By contrast, if excess demand for labour is        expected to prevail
tomorrow, the likelihood of current excess supply of rather than
                                    37




demand for labour is increased, arid so the "bootstraps" phenomenon does

not emerge.     As in Section 3, this arises because of the Oomplementarity

between employment and investment next period: if firms expect to

face    a labour—market constraint their current investment demand falls;
to   avoid a current excess supply of goods w1 must       rise, and so the
region    of current excess supply of labour expands.         Of course, as in

Section 3, this argument must be qualified by the fact that an arbitrary

expected    employment constraint         is only binding if it is    less than

the    notional future demand for labour:


(47)                    e2 <   e2(p2, w2)


When e2 equals L equation (47)           with equality is simply the LMEL2;

if firms    (irrationally) expect to face     an employment   constraint less
than     L then (47) with equality is an upward-sloping locus with the

same slope as, but to the left of, the LL2. In either case the area

within which (47) binds is to the right of this locus, and so arbitrary

expectations of excess demand for        labour affect the diagram as shown in
Figure    9, causing the region of current unemployment to expand rather

than contract.


          What if constraint expectations are rational?         Once again, this

does    not rule out unemployment or excess demand for labour in the
current period.      However, under the assumptions of the present section
it introduces a new feature: not all (w2,p2) combinations are now
                                          38




 consistent   with a rational—constraint_expectations equilibrium, because

 at most only two markets in both periods can            be   out of Wairasian

 equilibrium.     To illustrate this point, consider the possibility of

 a rational-constraint_expectations equilibrium exhibiting excess supply

 of labour in both periods.         Such an equilibrium must        lie   in the region

to the left of both loci in Figure 8.           But the (w2,p2) coordinates of

an arbitrary point in this region uniquely determine a second-period

level of employment (since the latter always equals               e2(p2,w2) in this
region);when combined with the requirement that the first-period goods
market must clear this in turn determines unique values for    and
                                                                               w1
the    first-period level of employment.        But with rational constraint

expectations it is necessary that these values of
                                                                (w11p2,w21f1,2)
be such that the second—period goods market is guaranteed to clear.

In other words, their values must satisfy the relevant
                                                                    GMEL2:

These two equations define a locus in          (w21p2) space, whose location

may be determined by means of the same         geometric      techniques      that were
                                   39




used in Section 4, and which is illustrated by the dashed line in

Figure 8.


         This construction (which may be repeated for other kinds of

equilibria)   illustrates the point that only some (w21p2) combinations
are   consistent with rational constraint expectations when the current
wage rate is flexible and the goods market clears in both periods.         But

it   also shows that even current wage flexibility combined with rational
expectations does not eliminate    unemployment: any   rigidity, even if
only   in expected future wages and prices (which are generally unobserv-

able, of course), is sufficient to rule out the necessity of full

employment prevailing today and hence to provide a role for anticipated

changes in government policy.




7. SUMMARY MV CONCLUSION


        This paper has presented a simple two-period model of temporary

equilibrium with rationing which lays considerable stress on agents'

expectations    of the constraints which they may face in the future.
Arbitrary constraint expectations were shown to permit multiple
equilibria, with more than one regime in the present period being
consistent    with a given vector of current and expected future wages

and prices.      Moreover, such expectations were shown to exhibit a

"bootstraps" property, so that, for example, Keynesian unemployment
                                    40




is   more likely than Classical unemployment to prevail today if it is

expected to prevail tomorrow, and vice versa.


         It was also shown that Wairasian equilibrium and the impotence

of goverment policy are not guaranteed by rational constraint expec-

tations, in the sense of perfect foresight of future constraint levels.

On the contrary, such expectations actually increase the probability

that Keynesian unemployment will prevail today relative to Walrasian

expectations, and they raise the value of the government multiplier.

Even when all current prices and wages are flexible, as in Section 6,

rati:onal expectations do not guarantee full employment: any rigidity

in wages or prices, even if only in the expectations of their future

levels -   which in any case is highly likely, given the absense of
futures markets -   is   sufficient to generate excess demand for or excess

supply of labour in the current period.       These results suggest that

the critique of the effectiveness of government policy presented by

"new Classical macroeconomists", such as Lucas (1973) and Sargent and

Wallace (1975), rests primarily on their assumption that wages and

prices move instantaneously to clear markets, and not on their use of

the rational expectations hypothesis.


         One obvious objection to our concept of rational constraint

expectations (obvious at least to Robert Barro, whom we thank for

pointing it   out) is   that with so much information available agents

should   be able to change prices directly to attain the first-best
Walrasian equilibrium.      We believe, however, that this type of argument
                                   41




 greatly underestimates the difficulties of concerting individual

behaviour in a decentralised economy with highly imperfect information.

In any case, we defend rational constraint expectations, not on the

grounds that we believe in their descriptive realism, but because they

isolate   the role of wage—price rigidities (including rigidities in
expected future wages and prices) in giving rise to unemployment, inter—
market   spillovers, and other such Keynesian phenomena.


         Finally, we would argue that even though wage-price flexibility

may eventually bring the economy to Wairasian equilibrium it is unlikely

to do so by a swift or easy route.      The facts that shifin expectations

may bring about   substantial changes in the wage-price vector required
to   achieve Walrasian equilibrium, and that (as noted in Section 6) the

market whose price is sticky need not be the one which fails to clear,

suggest a sort of "dynamic second-best theorem": with limited flexibility

of some prices, increasing the flexibility of other prices may reduce

rather than increase the ability of the system to return to Walrasian

equilibrium. A full consideration of such dynamic problems, as well

as   an evaluation of the ability of the real-balance effect -   excluded
by assumption from our model — to ensure the reattainment of equilibrium,
are topics to which we hope   to return.

                                   APPNVIX



                      THE      BEHAViOUR OF THE FIRM



          The behaviour of the firm under different constraint regimes can

be derived directly bY solving (6) subject to (7), (8) and appropriate

additional constraints, but it is easier and more illuminating to adopt

a dual approach, along with the concept of "virtual" prices used by

Neary and Roberts (1979).


          Consider first the case of no constraints in either period,

where we may define the unconstrained profit function as follows (note

that it is convenient throughout this Appendix to work with p1 explicity):



(A.l)       Tr(p1,w1,p2,w2) =       Max
                                               [P1{F(e1)_I}_we1+ p2H(e211) — w2e2]
                                  e11e2,I


By Shephard's Lemma the partial derivatives of this function give the

unconstrained employment demand and output supply functions for each

period:



(P.2)                 =   y1       'ii     =-e           11   =y 2
                                                              -
                                                                       TF    =-e 2
                 p1                  w1                                 W2


          Suppose now that the firm       faces    a sales constraint in the current

period: y <    y1.     Its behaviour in this case may be deduced from the
                                           43




constrained profit function, (y1;p1,w11p21w2), and as in Neary and

Roberts (op.cit.), the properties of the latter are most easily

determined by relating it to the unconstrained profit function evaluated

at the virtual price p1:



(A.3)                                      Max
         (1;p11W11p2,w2)                          [(P1iw1P2iw2):           yl<



(A.4)                              =                              +
                                           ¶(p1,w1,p21w2)             (p1—p1)y1


where the virtual price, that price which would induce an unconstrained

firm to produce y, is defined implicitly by:



(A.5)                 =




It is easily seen that the constrained and unconstrained current
employment demand functions coincide when the latter is eva1itated at

the virtual price



(A.6)             =   -'ii     =       -          - (ii    - y—   )
                                                                      pl = -
              1                                       p1       1 w1               w1
                          w1                W1


Hence the effect of a change in the sales constraint on current employ-

ment demand is found to be:



(A.7)             — = —iTW         1 1 cy1
                                            —
                                            2i;
                                               44




(A.8)                                          =    -r     wipi        P1P1
                                                                              > 0


Other properties of the firm's behaviour in the face of the sales

constraint may be deduced in a similar manner.                             For example:



(A.9)           — = -r -r —
                w1              w1w1           w1p1 w1




(A.1O)                 =            + ii               —l
                                                     'ii          iT
                               wl      wlpl p1p1                   p1w1


Since    the second term in (A.lO) is positive this yields a Le Chatelier-
type result:     the imposition of a sales constraint reduces (at least

locally)    the responsiveness of employment demand to a change in wages.

         Consider    next the case where the firm faces a sales constraint

in   both periods:         <
                               y1
                                    and y2 <           y2.        We may proceed in an analogous
fashion    to define a doubly-constrained profit function:

           1
(A.ll)     ;(112;p1,w1,p21w2) =
                                                   Max[iT(y1;p1w1iQ2,w2):            y2 y2]

(A.12)                                     =                                  +
                                                   1T(y1;p11w1,p21w2)             (p2—p2Y2


(A.13)                                     =                              +               +
                                                   Tr(p1,w112,w2)             (p1—p1)y1
                                                45




The two virtual prices,                   and            corresponding to the two con-

straints        and              are now        jointly determined by (A.5) (with

replacing    p2) and (A.14):


(A.14)                           =   1T
                                                (p11w1,p2,w2)


As before the doubly—constrained and unconstrained labour demand
functions   coincide when the latter is evaluated at                                    and


                                            A

(A.15)                     1
                                 =    -rw1           =   -T
                                                           w1
                                                                    = -Tr
                                                                               w1


Hence:



(A.16)         —      =                   ——                  —
                               w1p                       w1p1 l
This   may be simplified by recalling that ir                             is zero (i.e.
                                                                   1p2.

unconstrained   current employment demand is independent of the future

output price) and by solving (A.5) and (A.l4) for p1/y1.                                      This

yields:


                                      r
                                                     -                              1-1
(A.17)                =   - iT        Iii                     Tr          11        I

                               w1p1p1p1                  p1p2 p2p2 P2P1J


This is clearly greater than (A.8), which proves that (as was asserted
                                46




in Section 5) the presence of an expected future sales constraint

increases the responsiveness of current employment demand to a

relaxation of the current sales constraint.


       It should be clear how these techniques may be used to deduce

the behaviour of the firm in the presence of other combinations of

constraints.

     by Hildenbrand and Hildenirand (1977) ,   Hool (1978), and Muellbauer and

     Portes (1978); its dynamic behaviour (under ttonnement-type assumptions)

     price rigidities, see Stiglitz (1978)



3.   Note that the model is a monetary one, but only in a rudimentary way.

     Wage payments in the first period are made in the form of money, since

     if they were made in the form of goods the model would always satisfy

     Say's Law.   However the purchasing power of money is fixed in terms of

     current output, and so the model contains only three relative prices:

     w1, p2 andw2.


4.   If capital markets were perfect, the discount factor         would equal

     unity (since p2 is a present—value expected price, and so has already

     been deflated by one plus the discount rate).     Allowing       to differ

     from unity is therefore an artificiality attempting to capture the effects

     of imperfections in the capital market.

 5.    If the state of technology is given, the current production function

       F(.) may be viewed as identical to the future production function H(.)

       with a predetermined level of investment:
                                                       F(e1) =       H(e1,f),   We explicitly
       assume that H(.) exhibits diminishing returns to scale (thus ruling out,

       for example, the form    H(e2, I) =
                                             F(e2) +   I)    since    otherwise future—
       period production levels would be indeterminate unless firms expected

       to face a sales constraint next period.

      Appendix.



7.
      Henceforward each effective equilibrium locus is specified as contingent

      on two regimes, indicated in parentheses: the first is the regime which

      prevails in the current period, and the second that which is expected to

      prevail next period.



8.    As in Neary (1979) we adopt the following notational convention: a bar

      over a variable (e.g., e1) indicates that, from the point of view of

      the agent under consideration, its value is predetermined in the current

      period; a tilde (e.g., y1) indicates a function or parameter arising

      from behaviour in the face of a labour—market
                                                            constraint; a circumflex

      (e.g., )     indicates   behaviour in the face of a goods—market constraint;

      and corresponding symbols are used to indicate behaviour in the face of

      multiple constraints (e.g., l'           etc.)

 9.   Figures 1 and 2 are in fact identical to the corresponding diagrams

      illustrating the regions of notional and effective éqüilibria in

      (w/p, m/p) space in the Barro-Grossman-Malinvaud model, provided

      it is assumed that labour is supplied inelastically and that investment

      may be carried out by firms.      When reinterpreted in this way, Figure 2

      may be used to illustrate a Point! made in Section 1 above: Consider a

      Barro—Grossman—Malinvaud economy where the real wage is at its Walrasian

      level but initial nominal money balances are too low to achieve full

      employment (i.e., the initial equilibrium lies directly to the left of

      point     A in the diagram corresponding to Figure 2) .   In these circum-
      stances a proportionate reduction in w and       p will necessarily restore
      full    employment through the real-balance effect.



10.   Because of our assumptions about the form of the household's utility

      function, the constrained consumption function in (22) is determined

      by   the budget constraint alone, and so takes the particularly simple
      form:        = Y —
                           p2c2.   We continue to assume that the effect of an
      increase    in p2 in reducing current supply outweighs its depressing

      effect on demand; i.e., that a fall in the interest rate raises

      investment demand by more than it raises the supply of savings.



11.   It should be clear that multiple equilibria follow in our one-consumer

      model from the presence of parametric constraint expectations, by

      contrast with the model of Hildenbrand and Hildenbrand (1977) where
                                      50




      multiple equilibria arise from the assumption of general utility

      functions combined with a disaggregated consumer sector, in a model

      which is otherwise identical to Malinvaud's.



12.   whether or not rational constraint expectations are consistent with

      multiple equilibria is still an unresolved question.   Guy Laroque has

      proved, in a model which is formally rather similar to ours, although

      its interpretation is different, that rationing equilibria are unique

      in the neighbourhood of the Wairasian equilibrium, which suggests that

      the multiple equilibria which (as we showed in Section 3) are very

      likely to arise when constraint expectations are arbitrary, cannot

      arise when constraint expectations are rational.   Of course, multiple

      equilibria are still possible in the sense that a given
                                                                (w1, p2)
      combination may be consistent with a number of different current regimes

      when constraint expectations are rational, depending on the (unobservable)

      value of the expected future wage rate
                                               w2.



13.   We assume for simplicity that agents never expect disequilibrium in
