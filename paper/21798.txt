                                              ABSTRACT

We use variation in historical state centralization to examine the impact of institutions on cultural norms.
The Kuba Kingdom, established in Central Africa in the early 17th century by King Shyaam, had more
developed state institutions than the other independent villages and chieftaincies in the region. It had
an unwritten constitution, separation of political powers, a judicial system with courts and juries, a
police force and military, taxation, and significant public goods provision. Comparing individuals
from the Kuba Kingdom to those from just outside the Kingdom, we find that centralized formal institutions
are associated with weaker norms of rule-following and a greater propensity to cheat for material gain.

1. Introduction

Increasing evidence suggests that both culture and institutions are important for economic

development.1 Institutions are typically defined as the external ‘rules of the game’ that shape

individuals’ expected material payoffs for different actions. Culture, by contrast, is often defined

as the collection of internal values and beliefs of individuals in a society. While culture and

institutions are typically treated as separate, it is plausible that they interact. In this paper we

consider the effects that institutions have on culture. There are a number of plausible ways that

institutions may affect cultural traits. It is possible that institutions that incentivize people to

take particular actions may also generate cultural norms that lead individuals to want to choose

these same actions. For example, institutions could incentivize patterns of behavior that over time

come to be viewed as the ‘right’ behaviors, causing individuals to experience disutility when they

deviate from them. In this case, institutions inculcate cultural norms that further reinforce the

institutions themselves.

   A number of scholars have argued for such complementary between institutions and culture.

For example, sociologist Norbert Elias (1994) argues that in early modern Europe, a “civilizing

process” took place that represented a “psychological change in the course of civilization”.

During this process a “more complex and stable control of conduct is increasingly instilled in

the individual from his or her earlier years as an automatism, a self-compulsion that he or

she cannot resist even if he or she consciously wishes to” (Elias, 1994, p. 367). According to

Elias, this change in behavior was driven by state formation, which induced people to internalize

rule-abiding behavior, a cultural complement to the underlying institutions.2 A related argument

was also put forth by Eugene Weber (1976), who argued that the formation of the French state

in the 19th century transformed France’s diverse population into a citizenry socialized to obey

the rules, and in particular, to pay taxes and to serve in the military. Finally, similar ideas were

extensively developed by Michel Foucault (1995), who argued that modern society had moved

from a situation where people obey the law because they fear punishment to one characterized

by “disciplinary power” whereby individuals obey because they absorb the laws as their internal
   1 For evidence of the importance of institutions for economic development see e.g., North and Thomas (1973),

Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson (2001), and Acemoglu and Robinson (2012). For evidence on the importance of
culture see e.g., Greif (1994), Tabellini (2008a), Tabellini (2010), and Algan and Cahuc (2010).
   2 Elias writes that the “peculiar stability of the psychological self-restraint which emerges as a decisive trait built

into the habits of every civilized human being, stands in the closest relationship to the monopolization of physical
force and the growing stability of the central organs of society” (Elias, 1994, p. 369).


                                                            1
norms. Individuals are unwittingly disciplined to accept as “normal” what the state and the other

disciplinary institutions deem as normal. Foucault describes this as a process of “normalization.”

   An alternative hypothesis is that the institutions associated with state formation undermine

norms of rule-following and of engaging in socially desirable behavior more generally. This

scenario is illustrated by Tabellini (2008b), who models parents’ decisions to instill cooperative

values in their children. When institutions are effective at punishing undesirable behavior, parents

know that their children will be incentivized to cooperate. Since, in the model, parents only care

about the actions of their children, and not their motivations, better enforcement of the rules –

i.e., better institutions – causes parents to invest less in cultivating an intrinsic desire to cooperate

in their children. Here, formal institutions crowd out internal motivations.3

   In this paper, we empirically test the impact of state formation on individuals’ propensity to

follow rules and obey laws. Our analysis exploits a unique historical episode in Central Africa: the

creation of the Kuba Kingdom in the 17th century. A number of characteristics of the formation of

the Kingdom make this historical episode particularly well-suited for examining our relationship

of interest. First, during the medieval period, about two centuries prior to the formation of the

Kingdom, there was a large migration of related Mongo peoples to an area near the confluence

of the Kasai and Sankuru rivers. This migration is shown in figure 1, along with the boundaries

of the Kuba Kingdom some two centuries later. These groups, according to oral histories, are

descendants of a mythical ancestor named Woot. One implication of this migration is that, prior

to the formation of the Kingdom, societies in the region were culturally similar, a homogeneous

group of peoples who had recently migrated from the Northwest. The common origins of the

peoples inhabiting the study region help alleviate concerns of reverse causality, namely that initial

cultural differences caused the formation of the Kuba Kingdom.

   The second significant aspect of the historical episode is the idiosyncratic manner in which the

Kingdom was established. The Kingdom was formed when Shyaam, an institutional entrepreneur

and an outsider, united a group of villages and small chieftaincies under the rule of the Bushong
  3 Benabou  and Tirole (2003) have a seminal model that also shows how extrinsic rewards can crowd-out intrinsic
motivations. Their setting and mechanism is very different from that in Tabellini (2008b). In their principal-agent
framework, the crowding-out effect arises because the rewards offered by the principal provides information to the
agent about her intrinsic ability which then affects her decisions.

(Vansina, 1978, p. 127).4

   Third, geographical features of the area had a decisive impact in determining the boundaries

of the Kuba Kingdom. As shown in figure 1, the region where the “children of Woot” settled

is naturally divided by the Kasai and Sankuru rivers. Shyaam established the Kingdom to the

south of the Sankuru and to the east of the Kasai. During his reign and those of subsequent

kings, the Kingdom expanded to the natural limits defined by these rivers. The boundaries of

the Kuba Kingdom remained stable and clearly defined by the Kasai river (to the west), Sankuru

river (to the north), and Lulua river (to the south). Although the specific location of these natural

boundaries was otherwise unimportant, the rivers determined which villages were inside and

outside of the Kuba Kingdom. We therefore argue that the establishment of the Kingdom to

the east of the Kasai, rather than to the west, occurred for idiosyncratic reasons, not because of

pre-existing differences in the populations or the enviroment.

   Finally, the Kuba Kingdom had many characteristics that are associated with modern states,

making the estimated effects of the Kuba state on cultural norms of general interest.                                   The

Kingdom had a capital city where the king and members of numerous executive councils lived.

Additionally, it had a professional bureaucracy, an unwritten constitution, a sophisticated legal

system that featured trial by jury and courts of appeal, a professional police force, a military, a

system of taxation, and extensive public goods provision.

   The causal impact of state formation depends on the nature of the state being considered

relative to the absence of a state.5 It is possible that ‘predatory’ or ‘authoritarian’ states, which

lack legitimacy, might have very different impacts on rule-following than democratic or legitimate

states.6 Thus, the fact that the Kuba state approximated a legitimate bureaucratized state with

the rule of law makes it an attractive context in which to study the hypotheses of interest.

   In sum, the idiosyncratic origins of the Kuba Kingdom, amidst the culturally homogeneous

Mongo peoples, provides a compelling natural experiment that we use to estimate the impact of
   4 In many ways it is remarkable that an outsider was able to create a large centralized state in what oral histories

describe as a peaceful process. The next section considers a number of explanations for Shyaam’s ability to unify
the Kingdom peacefully, which mirror a broader literature on the historical prevalence of “stranger kings” (e.g., de
Heusch, 1982, Sahlins, 2008).
   5 There is no consensus in the social science literature on the taxonomy of different types of states. The recent em-

pirical literature discusses the extent of state capacity, tending to associate it with the ability to raise taxes and impose
effective regulation (Besley and Persson, 2011). Other scholars have tried to measure the extent of bureaucratization
(Evans and Rauch, 2000) or centralization of authority (Dincecco, 2011).
   6 For example, some hypothesize that the Soviet state created a culture (known as ‘blat’) of illegality and informalism

designed to circumvent the rules (Ledeneva, 2006).

state formation on rule-following. While the villages on the Kuba side of the rivers that formed

the Kingdom’s boundaries were unified into a centralized state, the villages on the other side of

these rivers continued to exist in small chieftaincies.7

   Our empirical analysis estimates the effect of originating from the Kuba Kingdom on the

propensity of individuals to obey rules even when there is a strong monetary incentive not to do

so. We use two sets of behavioral experiments. The first is the resource allocation game (RAG).

In the experiment, there is a cost to following the rules and a benefit to cheating. Although

it is impossible for us or anyone else to know if any specific individual cheats, we are able

to measure whether groups of individuals cheat by observing the frequency of outcomes in a

larger sample.8 The second experiment is a version of the standard ultimatum game, in which
   7 Previousscholars have also identified this event as a near natural experiment, and have tended to focus their
analysis on comparisons of the Kuba with the societies on the other side (i.e., west side) of the Kasai River, namely
the Lele ethnic group. The differences between the Kuba Kingdom and the Lele (observed in the early and mid
20th century) are documented in a series of publications by historian Jan Vansina (1963, 1964, 1978, 1990, 2010) and
anthropologist Mary Douglas (1962, 1963).
   8 The experiment was developed by Hruschka, Efferson, Jiang, Falletta-Cowden, Sigurdsson, McNamara, Sands,

Munira, Slingerland and Henrich (2014).

participants physically allocate money in a private setting (rather than play on a computer). This

provides an opportunity for individuals to steal money during the course of the experiment.

   Our analysis compares individuals whose ancestors lived within the Kuba Kingdom to in-

dividuals whose ancestors lived just outside the Kingdom. The sample is taken from the local

provincial capital, Kananga, the largest city in the region. Thus, individuals in our sample no

longer live in their ancestral villages. They or their ancestors migrated to the provincial capital.

Examining this population has several benefits. First, it is logistically easier to work in one city,

rather than a number of villages in a region in which the transportation and communication

infrastructure is extremely poor. Second, by considering a population of immigrants removed

from the institutional environments of interest, we are better able to estimate the impact of these

institutions on cultural norms.9

   Our analysis examines three samples of interest. The first is the largest and includes all individ-

uals whose ancestors lived inside and just outside the Kuba Kingdom. The second sample exploits

the particular history of the region by including only the descendants of Woot, the population

that was culturally homogeneous prior to the creation of the Kuba Kingdom. The descendants of

Woot who remained outside the Kuba Kingdom are today called the Lele. Therefore, our second

analysis compares the central Kuba (the Children of Woot who were inside the Kuba Kingdom)

to the Lele. This is the cleanest comparison, as it exploits the cultural regression-discontinuity

that arises due to the historical natural experiment described above. The third sample focuses

specifically on the core peoples of the Kuba Kingdom, the Bushong, and compares them to the

Lele. This comparison has two motivations. The first is the existing anthropological literature,

which has focused on comparisons of the Bushong and Lele (e.g., Douglas, 1962, 1963, Vansina,

1963, 1964, 1978, 1990, 2010). Second, focusing on the Bushong helps address the issue of whether

the Kuba institutions were viewed as legitimate by its citizens. The Bushong lived in the heart

of the Kingdom and were disproportionately represented in the capital city and the government

bureaucracy. Thus, the Bushong, of all groups, were most likely to view Kuba institutions as

legitimate.10

   According to our experimental measures of rule-following, a consistent and robust set of
  9 The strategy of examining immigrants from different cultural backgrounds but in the same current environment
has been widely used in the cultural economics literature (e.g., Giuliano, 2007, Fernandez and Fogli, 2009, Alesina,
Giuliano and Nunn, 2013).
  10 The full sample has 499 individuals, 80 of which are Kuba. Of these, 62 individuals are central Kuba, including

38 Bushong. The sample also includes 45 Lele.



                                                         5
empirical results emerge. We find that Kuba ancestry is associated with more rule breaking,

more theft, and more cheating. This is true for both experiments and for all three samples of

interest, most notably when we compare the central Kuba to the Lele and the Bushong to the

Lele. These findings demonstrate that culture can be shaped by state institutions. They also

show that culture and state institutions are not necessarily complements, as hypothesized by

Elias, Weber, and Foucault. Instead, our findings are more consistent with other mechanisms,

including those suggested in the model of Tabellini (2008b). Our findings are consistent with

Kuba state crowding out internal norms of rule-following.

   The difference between the conclusion of our analysis and that of the historical studies of Elias,

Weber, and Foucault highlights an important methodological point. Observational studies like

theirs infer underlying cultural norms based on observed actions, or in other words, equilibrium

outcomes. However, the outcomes observed by Elias, Weber, and Foucault were surely influenced

by the institutional environments in which they occurred; they are therefore unreliable measures

of cultural norms. Our study attempts to sidestep this pitfall (i) by studying a population removed

from the original institutional environments of interest, and (ii) by using experiments to directly

measure individuals’ propensity to follow rules and obey laws (in the absence of enforcement).

   With the same methodology as Elias, Weber, and Foucault, one would also likely conclude

that the Kuba Kingdom created a civic citizen with respect for rules. The Kuba Kingdom had less

conflict and was more prosperous than the neighboring Lele territory. However, these outcomes

reflect the direct effects of the Kuba institutions on individual actions, not the population’s

underlying cultural norms, which are observable only in the absence of the direct effects of Kuba

institutions.

   After estimating the reduced-form relationship between the Kuba state and rule-following, we

then check to see whether these differences arise spuriously due to either selective migration into

our sample or to differences in the geography of the traditional Kuba and non-Kuba homelands. It

is possible that the differences we find arise due to differential migration from within and outside

of the Kuba Kingdom to Kananga. Relying on information of individuals’ migration histories,

we find no systematic differences in this dimension between Kuba and non-Kuba descendants

in our more restrictive samples. In addition, controlling for these observable characteristics does

not affect our baseline estimates. We also check whether the differences we find can be explained

by differences between the geography of the Kuba and non-Kuba ancestral villages. Using fine-


                                                 6
grained crop suitability data from the FAO, we show that the geography of the two groups is

very similar – especially for the more restrictive samples. In addition, our estimates are robust to

controlling for geographic differences.

   We then turn to alternative explanations for our findings.                    The first that we consider is

income and prosperity. Due to the presence of a state, the Kuba were, by all accounts, more

prosperous than surrounding groups. The persistence of such prosperity may explain part of

the difference in rule-following that we observe. Examining a number of measures of prosperity

today, we find some evidence – though not robust across all measures and all samples – that

Kuba descendants are more prosperous than non-descendants. However, we find that accounting

for these differences tends to strengthen the Kuba and non-Kuba differences we estimate. This is

intuitive. Kuba descendants are more prosperous, and greater prosperity is often associated with

less cheating (e.g., Hruschka et al., 2014).

   Another alternative explanation for our finding is that it is due to the Kuba being treated

differently during the colonial or post colonial-periods. We check for this using information on

colonial investments, namely mission stations, electrical power stations, railway lines, and mines.

During the post-colonial period there were virtually no public goods provision nor taxation in

our area of study. We thus undertake an alternative strategy by measuring respondents’ attitudes

towards the former president Joseph Mobutu who was in power from 1965–1997. If Mobutu

treated the Kuba and non-Kuba differently during this period, then this would likely be reflected

in respondents’ attitudes today. We measure these using both survey questions and, due to

concerns about truthful self-reporting, we also administered an Implicit Association Test (IAT).11

   Using these measures of colonial and post-colonial experience, we test for differences between

the Kuba and non-Kuba and check the sensitivity of our results to controlling for these differences.

Our estimates suggest that these factors are not able to explain the lower rates of rule-following

that we observed among the Kuba.

   Lastly, we consider the possibility that other cultural traits could have been affected by the

Kuba Kingdom and that these could affect behavior in the RAG and the UG with theft. If this

were true, then this could invalidate our interpretation of behavior in the games as reflecting

cultural norms of rule-following. In particular, we consider whether differences in individuals’
  11 The IAT was developed by psychologists to examine individuals’ implicit attitudes toward a particular target (see

Banaji and Greenwald, 2013). In the IAT we develop, the target is Mobutu.




                                                          7
trust in foreign researchers and/or differences in altruism towards the player 2’s in the RAG

explain part of the Kuba effect we estimate. Using survey questions to measure trust and using

behavior in the dictator game to measure altruism toward player 2, we test for this explanation.

We find that neither trust nor altruism is able to account for the lower incidence of rule-following

among the Kuba.

   Our findings shed light on the relationship between culture and institutions, and they are

consistent with a large existing body of evidence showing that socially desirable laws and

regulations (as well as monetary incentives) can crowd out beneficial norms. Like our research,

these studies find that the presence of laws and institutions – relative to their absence – can

undermine intrinsic motivation. In other words, institutions can crowd out cultural norms. The

literature documenting these effects is summarized in Bowles and Polania-Reyes (2012), while

Deci, Koestner and Ryan (1999) provide a meta-analysis of a large number of experimental studies

that generally verify that extrinsic rewards can crowd out intrinsic motivations.12

   On the other hand, our findings contrast with a number of prior studies that have examined

how different aspects of institutions affect various cultural traits.                 These studies often find

evidence for a complementarity between culture and institutions. For example, Becker, Boeckh,

Hainz and Woessmann (2015) estimate the impact of differences between the more bureaucratized

Habsburg and the Ottoman Empires and find that the former is associated with higher levels

of trust and lower levels of corruption today.13 Tabellini (2010) examines differences in states’

constraints on the executive, finding that within Western Europe, a history of a more constrained

executive is associated with higher levels of social capital and trust today. Hruschka et al. (2014)

find that people in countries with higher scores in a World Bank index of public good provision

cheat less in the resource allocation game.14

   There are a number of potential explanations for the differences with our results. The main

distinction is that the studies are examining different ‘treatments’ than we do here. Both Becker

et al. (2015) and Tabellini (2010) compare different types of states to each other, while our study
  12 See also Piff, Stancato, Cote, Mendoza-Denton and Keltner (2012) and Falk and Szech (2013).
  13 See also Grosjean (2011).
  14 Other experimental research also finds complementarities between institutions and culture. For example, Cassar,

d’Adda and Grosjean (2014) have participants play a sequence of games, randomly varying the institutional structure
of a market game prior to identical one-shot trust games. They find that stronger formal enforcement of cooperative
behavior in the market game results in more trust and trustworthiness in the subsequent trust games. Peysakhovich
and Rand (2015) use a similar strategy but instead administer repeated prisoner’s dilemma games with different
institutional structures followed by one-shot games. They find that institutions that generate cooperative behavior in
the repeated games generate cooperative spillovers in the one-shot games.

compares the presence of a state to the absence of a state. Hruschka et al. (2014) use variation

in public good provision on the national level as the explanatory variable. They also recognize

the possibility of co-evolution between their variables of interest and so are therefore interested

in estimating the correlation between the two measures without necessarily imposing a causal

interpretation. The methodology of our study, on the other hand, is aimed at identifying the

causal effect of state formation on rule-following. Due to reverse causality and the presence of

omitted factors, this causal effect could be very different than the correlation one observes in the

cross-section.

   In the spirit of Weber, Johnson (2014) empirically documents a relationship between state

institutions and civic mindedness in 17th and 18th century France. The notion that political

institutions, particularly state formation, inculcate particular types of values is widespread in

the literature on nationalism (e.g., Anderson, 2006, Gellner, 2009). Other scholars have made

the opposite argument. In particular many authors have proposed that states induce perverse

cultural dynamics which ultimately lead to their collapse, ancient Rome being perhaps the most

prominent example (Gibbon, 1996, MacMullen, 1990).

   The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the historical episode

we exploit in our analysis. Section 3 describes the fieldwork undertaken, including the sampling

framework and data collection. Section 4 describes the details of our two experimental measures

of rule-following and our main findings regarding differences between Kuba and non-Kuba

descendants, while section 5 undertakes a more formal analysis estimating the reduced-form

effect of the Kuba state. Section 6 tests for omitted factors that may be biasing our estimates,

namely selective migration to Kananga and geographic differences between the homelands of the

two groups. Section 7 turns to an examination of other potential explanations for our findings,

including differences in the colonial and post-colonial experience, current income differences, and

current differences in trust and altruism. Section 8 concludes.


2. Historical Background

A. Migrations Prior to the Formation of the Kingdom

Prior to the formation of the Kuba Kingdom there was a series of large migrations to the region,

including the migration of the Mongo people who came from the northwest and crossed the



                                                 9
Sankuru river sometime in the Medieval period. Historian Jan Vansina describes this migration

as “part of the general expansion of the southern Mongo. . . The historian visualizes an expansion

over a [broad] front, all along the Sankuru and parts of the lower Kasai. The Leele [Lele] crossed

first, then the Bieeng and the Pyaang, then the Ngeende, and then the Bushong.” (Vansina, 1978,

   The migration included many different groups, some of whom were to be integrated into the

Kuba Kingdom (the Bushong, Ngeende, Pyang, Bulaang, and Bieeng), and others of whom were

not (the Lele).15 Vansina (1978, p. 5) refers to the group of five clans that later became a part of

the Kuba Kingdom as “central Kuba,” distinguishing them from other groups that became part

of the Kingdom but were not part of the same migration. He refers to this latter group as the

“peripheral Kuba” (Vansina, 1963).

   The oral history of the central Kuba traces the origin of the world to Mboom who had a son

called Woot, the first man. Woot committed incest with his sister Mweel and they were cast out

of the primeval village leading to their migration. From this relationship, a series of children

were born who are the progenitors of the central Kuba and the Lele (Vansina, 1978, p. 32). In

the case of the Lele, Torday (1925, pp. 127–128) records how Woot had a son Nyimi Lele from his

incestuous union, but when it became public “there was such an outcry of indignation amongst

the people that Woto [Woot] had to order his son to leave the country. With his adherents, Nyimi

Lele travelled till he reached the River Katembo (the Loange) which he followed, and there he

founded the nation of the Bashilele (sons of Lele) and his descendants were their chiefs.”16

   The oral history, which attributes a common ancestry to the central Kuba and Lele, is con-

sistent with linguistic evidence. The central Kuba, along with the surrounding groups, speak

Bantu languages descended from Mongo and, according to Gunthrie’s (1971) classification, both

Bushong and Lele diverged from it, indicating common linguistic and cultural roots, while the

languages of the Ngeende and Bieeng, for example, are dialects of Bushong.


B. The Formation of the Kuba Kingdom

The Kuba Kingdom formed in the early 17th century (probably in the 1620s) when an outsider

named Shyaam first made himself the chief of the Bushong by overthrowing and killing the exist-

ing chief. He then united the independent villages and small chieftaincies into one large kingdom.

His success in forming the Kingdom was likely due to several idiosyncratic characteristics. He

was a magician and medicine man, he had travelled widely, and had access to long-distance trade

networks. In particular, he participated in the Mbuun trade, which itself was connected with the

external Atlantic trade via the Kongo Kingdom. It is believed that he introduced a number of

new technologies, including many new world crops (e.g., tobacco, cassava, and maize), and ideas

(e.g., knowledge of how to make raffia cloth and palm wine). He is also credited with a number

of institutional innovations, such as initiation rituals, ceremonial knives, the royal charm, and the

belt of office (Vansina, 1978, pp. 59–65).

   The fact that Shyaam was an outsider may seem surprising. However, as discussed by Sahlins

(2008), the presence of “stranger kings” is not uncommon historically. He argues that outsiders

were often effective at arbitrating existing conflicts because they were not associated with any

side or vested interest.17 The origins of the Kuba state, particularly its idiosyncratic origins, is

consistent with the general view by archaeologists regarding the formation of states in Africa

(e.g., MacIntosh, 1988, Monroe, 2013, Monroe and Ogundiran, 2012, Dueppen, 2014).

   Shyaam united a collection of independent Bushong chieftaincies east of the Kasai river (rather

than a collection of Lele chieftaincies west of the Kasai river) for idiosyncratic reasons. After the

establishment of the Kingdom, it expanded to the boundaries shown in figure 1. The Kingdom

was naturally separated from several neighboring societies by three rivers: the Kasai (on the

West), the Sankuru (on the North), and the Lulua (on the South). The peoples on the other sides

of the rivers, even other “Children of Woot” (namely the Lele) who had migrated to the region

with the Bushong, were never unified under a centralized state.

   Conventional explanations of state formation in Africa does not explain why the Kuba devel-

oped a state but the surrounding peoples did not. Fenske (2014), for example, examines how

geographical variability can induce trade, which stimulates state formation. Yet there are no

significant geographical differences between the areas inside and outside the Kuba Kingdom.

(We examine this more formally in section 6.) According to other theories, such as that of Herbst

(2000), population density stimulated state formation in Africa. However, there is no evidence

of large differences in population density when the Kuba Kingdom was established. After the
  17 This is an argument similar to the one about the origins of the Podesta system of government in medieval Genoa

(Greif, 1998).




                                                        11
unification of the Kingdom, the population within the Kingdom did indeed expand more rapidly

than the surrounding areas. But this was a consequence of state formation and the resulting

improvements in agricultural productivity (Vansina, 1978, pp. 177–186).18

   The Kuba Kingdom was not the only large state in Central Africa, but it was the only state

among the peoples living in the region of interest (Vansina, 1966b). None of the surrounding

groups, including those who migrated with the Bushong but stayed outside of the Kuba Kingdom,

achieved anything close to the same degree of political centralization. Nor did any other groups

who occupied the region. For example, the Luluwa, the dominant ethnic group in Kananga and

in our sample, are a western offshoot of the Luba. The ethnic group “Lulua” appears to have

been created during the colonial period (Vansina, 1966b, pp. 14–15). At the time of colonization,

the Luluwa were organized into separate villages under nascent chiefs. Martens (1980, p. 40)

notes “The Lulua were organized into small chiefdoms or independent clan groupings with the

leader usually being a senior member of the clan.” This organization was typical for the groups

surrounding the Kuba. This was true of the Chokwe to the southwest (McCulloch, 1951), of

the Luntu and the Songe (Vansina, 1966a, pp. 168–169) and the Sala Mpasu to the south (Pruitt,

1973). Other ethnic groups were even less centralized. Douglas (1963), for example, focuses on

the lack of centralization and authority among the Lele, noting that they lacked chiefs with any

authority, let alone professional bureaucrats, judges, or policemen.19 In short, none of the groups

surrounding the Kuba Kingdom had the same types of state institutions as the Kuba.

   The closest states were the Luba Kingdom, hundreds of miles to the southeast in modern-day

Katanga, which formed slightly earlier, the Lunda Kingdom, also hundreds of miles to the

south in northern Angola, which formed around the same time as the Kuba Kingdom, and

the Kanyok Kingdom, which formed in the 18th century to the southeast of the Kuba King-

dom (Reefe, 1981, Bustin, 1975, Yoder, 1992). Oral histories of these states suggest that they

developed independently.20 Our sample does not contain individuals whose ancestors lived in

these three kingdoms. It does contain individuals who report their ethnicity as ‘Luba’. These
  18 Moreover,  available empirical evidence fails to find a correlation between historical population density and state
formation in Africa (Osafo-Kwaako and Robinson, 2013).
  19 The residual Mongo north of the Sankuru were kinship based societies without any level of political centralization

and the Cwa even lacked elaborate systems of kinship (Vansina, 1966a, pp. 87–89). Vansina (1978, p. 5) notes that the
“Kete and Coofa had only village government. They did not form chiefdoms.” Torday and Joyce (1922) describes in
detail the political organization of the Songe and Tetela, who were not unified politically, but rather divided into many
chiefdoms in which chiefs had intermittent rights to tribute and land and dispensed justice.
  20 The formation of the Luba state seems to be a consequence of a model of governance spreading to Katanga from

the east (Reefe, 1981).

Tshiluba-speaking individuals descend from migrants from Luba territories who formed separate

communities (outside of the Kuba Kingdom) that were not incorporated into a centralized state.

An example are the stateless Coofa, who descend from such Luba migrants. Today, in Kananga,

descendants of the stateless migrant Luba are known as ‘Luba’, while descendants of the Luba

Kingdom are known as ‘Lubakat’, a combination of the words ’Luba’ and ‘Katanga’. Our sample

includes descendants of the stateless ‘Luba’ and not the ‘Lubakat’.


C. The Organization of the Kuba Kingdom

The territory of the Kuba Kingdom was divided into nine provinces that were themselves subdi-

vided into counties, each of which had a head chief (Vansina, 1978, p. 128). The Kingdom had

executive councils, professional bureaucracies, a military, and police forces. The executive, apart

from the king, comprised a system of title holders, called kolm. There were 120 distinct titles in

the late 19th century. Though some of these titles were reserved for members of 18 aristocratic

clans, the majority were appointed meritocratically, with status being achievement-based. The

king interacted with four main councils. The most significant of these was the ishyaaml, which

did not include the king. The ishyaaml had fixed rules for establishing a quorum and a fixed

membership that included: the kikaam, the highest official in the bureaucracy; the kum ashin, the

provincial governors; and the mbyeemy, the ritualist of the court. The ishyaaml met frequently and

could veto the king’s orders and edicts. If a veto occurred, the issue went to another council,

the mbok ilaam, which met in a particular square deep within the palace and included all kolm as

members. This council dealt with current affairs and had procedures for reaching a compromise

when conflicts arose between the king and the ishyaaml. The other two main councils were the

ibaanc and the iyoot, both of which met in special circumstances. The iyoot, for instance, was

connected to warfare, and it was where the king informed the kolm about military events and

decisions (Vansina, 1978, pp. 145–152).

   Thus, an important characteristic of the Kuba state is its division and balance of power.

Vansina (1978, p. 147) writes that “The power of the kolm was balanced by that of the king.

A refined balance of power between the different groups competing for decision making was

also established through overlapping memberships in other councils and in the representation in

ishyaaml of all the groups except the potential successors [to the king].”




                                                 13
   The Kingdom conducted annual censuses which reported births and deaths to the central

administration, and it levied annual taxes on all villages in its domain. It also required corvée

labor, for example, to build and maintain a kingdom-wide system of roads and bridges, and

to build, maintain, and provision the capital. It also regulated economic activity and markets.

Overall, the Kuba Kingdom was among the most bureaucratized pre-colonial states in all of

sub-Saharan Africa. At time of colonization the central administration in the capital of Mushenge

had more than 100 full-time officials (Vansina, 2010, p. 46, Torday and Joyce, 1910, pp. 53–56).

   Law enforcement was formally institutionalized in the Kuba Kingdom. In 1892, the police force

in the Bushong territory consisted of 40 men, who were led by the son of the king (Sheppard,

1917, pp. 99–100, 139–140); each village in the Kingdom had two policemen (Vansina, 1971, p.

138). Also distinctive, and relevant to our study, is the Kuba Kingdom’s elaborate judicial system,

which included trial by jury and appellate courts. In this system, there were two judicial fora,

the moots and the courts, as well as different levels: the clan, the village, the chiefdom, and the

Kingdom. Minor disputes were dealt with by moots, informal assemblies of relatives and kinsmen

who heard evidence and arbitrated in public meetings. More serious offenses went to courts, in

which a panel of judges with particular expertise or experience in the crime or dispute under

consideration, would be selected. From the basic court, appeals could be made to another court

headed by a particular kolm, called a baang. From this court, appeal could be made to yet a higher

court presided over by the kikaam, the highest bureaucrat in the Kingdom. A final appeal could

then be made to what Vansina (1971, p. 138) describes as the “supreme court,” where the senior

members of the 18 aristocratic clans took part and the king acted as a spectator, ready to grant a

stay of execution if necessary. All cases of murder in the Kingdom went directly to the supreme

court.

   Court cases had well defined procedures. If a person brought a case to a judge (kolm), he or

she had to deposit 700 cowrie shells. The case was then directed to the judge most competent

in the relevant dispute, who then formed a panel of judges and chose a day for the trial. The

defendants were informed of this date, and when the time came, they and the witnesses, called

by the defendants or the judges, appeared and gave testimony. The judges then adjourned and

made a decision, which could include fines if a guilty verdict was reached. A defendant, if found

guilty, could then follow a well-defined procedure to appeal to a higher court, which began by

paying a 150 cowrie shell fee to the court that had just handed down the verdict.


                                                14
   Though the Kuba did not have writing, Vansina describes their “corpus of substantive law”

based in part on the principle, “the graver the offense, the heavier the penalty” (Vansina, 1971, p.

141–142). “Kuba courts do not seem to have invoked specific precedents, but legal analogy was

used. The scale of penalties alone indicates that comparison between cases was made” (Vansina,

1971, p. 146). Vansina also notes that the legal terminology used clearly indicates that the courts

served to provide “justice”. For instance, a “case” is referred to as matyeen: “things looked at

with care” and “things scrutinized” (Vansina, 1971, p. 144). Statutes and orders by the king also

became law.

   The sophisticated legal system of the Kuba state made it unique in Central Africa, even when

compared to the other large states in this part of the continent. For instance, the Kuba’s legal

system can be contrasted to Yoder’s (1992, p. 96) description of the legal system of the Kanyok

state: “even serious crimes, when committed against one’s own family, were left to the discretion

of the lineage which punished the offender as it saw fit.”


D. The Kuba-Lele and Bushong-Lele Comparison

Our study is not the first to recognize that the Kuba Kingdom provides a near natural experiment

suitable for assessing the long-term impacts of state formation.        Historian Jan Vansina and

anthropologist Mary Douglas have written extensively comparing the Kuba Kingdom with the

stateless Lele. Douglas (1963) compares the Bushong and Lele, writing that “they are historically

related, and share many cultural values. On the surface, Lele material culture looks so like a

counterpart of Bushong that it is worth comparing the two tribes. . . Everything that the Lele have

or do, the Bushong have more and can do better. They produce more, live better, as well as

populating the region more densely than the Lele.” (pp. 41–42) Turning to the differences in

political institutions, she writes: “The Bushong managed to develop a well-organized political

system embracing 70,000 people. . . By contrast, the largest political unit of the Lele, the village,

was smaller than the smallest political unit in the Bushong system.” (pp. 50–51)

   Just like any society the Lele had disputes and conflicts, but they dealt with them in a different,

less institutionalized way than did the Kuba. A central point in Douglas (1963) is that there was

no overarching system of authority in Lele territory. She notes that “anyone who has lived with

the Lele will agree at once that there was no authority. There was no person or body in a village

who could give orders and expect to be obeyed by anyone else.” (Douglas, 1963, p. 84).


                                                 15
   In the absence of courts or other legal institutions, murder cases between villages created

“blood debts" that were resolved through negotiation of compensation (such as the exchange of

a female pawn) between clans (Douglas, 1963, Chapter 8). However, there were no institutions to

enforce such compensation, and instead disputes were brokered in a political process known as

ku utera. “But in itself [utera] was a neutral piece of political machinery. It could as well be used

by the strong against the weak” (pp. 171–172). Indeed, Douglas points out that in such cases, and

in stark contrast to the Kuba legal system, “A village did not consider the rights and wrongs of

the case offered to them.” (p. 172)


E. The Kuba Kingdom during the Colonial and Post-Colonial Periods

The first European contact with the Kingdom occurred in 1885 when Ludwig Wolf, a doctor

who was second in command on the mission of explorer Hermann Wissman, visited the King-

dom.21 Wolf never made it much beyond the fringe of the Kingdom, however, and it was an

Afro-American Presbytarian minister named William Sheppard who first reached the capital city

of Mushenge in 1893. After Sheppard, there is a long series of visitor accounts (e.g. Verner,

1903), culminating in the first fully fledged ethnography/history by Torday and Joyce (1910),

who visited the region in 1907.22

   During the period of the Congo Free State (1885-1908), all parts of Kasai were part of a

concession granted to the Compagnie de Kasai, which engaged in intense and brutal rubber

collection.23 Importantly for our analysis, the impact of the Compagnie de Kasai seems to have

been fairly uniform across Kasai in general, and across our area of study in particular (Martens,

1980). Moreover, in 1910 after the Congo had become a Belgian colony, a colonial decree set up

a system of indirect rule, whereby African chiefs and traditional political institutions functioned

as the lowest level of government of the colony. In the Kuba Kingdom, this form of indirect rule

“had a great deal in common with colonial rule elsewhere in Congo” (Vansina, 2010, p. 208). The

Kuba were subject to the usual colonial impositions, such as forced crop production, head taxes,

and labor services.

   Overall, the historical evidence suggests that the Kuba suffered in similar ways to other

surrounding peoples during the periods of the Congo Free State and the Belgian Congo. Existing

 22 Also see the account of Hilton-Simpson (1911), who accompanied them on their expedition.
 23 See the report of British consul Wilfred Thesiger (1909) for an eye witness account of the impact on the Kuba.




                                                         16
first-hand accounts of the Kuba (particularly the Bushong) and the Lele, before and after the

colonial period, suggest a great deal of continuity in their institutions and culture. Part of

this is no doubt because the Belgian colonial state ruled a vast territory with very few colonial

officials and because the region of our study was far from the main hubs of Belgian colonial rule.

Historians tend to agree that Kasai was relatively less affected by colonial rule than other parts of

Congo.

   Unlike other large kingdoms on the African continent, the Kuba Kingdom remained intact

during and after colonial rule. In fact, Vansina (2010) titles chapter 7 of his book “A Kingdom

Preserved”, noting that the Kuba Kingdom was “the only precolonial kingdom to survive nearly

intact, the only territory of its kind and its size encapsulated in the colony’s administrative grid

like a fly in amber” (Vansina, 2010, p. 179). Thus, many of the Kingdom’s pre-colonial institutions

persisted until independence. This continuity informs the interpretation of our findings. It is

unlikely that the low rates of rule-following we observe among Kuba descendants are a function

of the collapse of the state or the reduced accountability of traditional rulers that occurred during

the colonial period in other parts of Africa (e.g., Mamdani, 1996)

   Less information is available on the post-colonial period. After an ill-fated attempt at secession

between 1960 and 1962 (Dedeken, 1978), the Kasai region fell into sustained decline during

the kleptocratic regime of Joseph Mobutu between 1965 and 1997.24                      Mobutu’s regime was

characterized by a severe neglect of infrastructure and public goods provision. There was also

very little collection of data; existing censuses from the period are regarded as highly unreliable.

Despite this, the Kuba Kingdom persisted, although not immune to the institutional decay that

affected all traditional political structures during this period. The Kingdom’s persistence was

verified by the authors during a visit to Mushenge, the capital of the Kingdom, in the summer of

2013.25


3. Data Collection

Our sample comprises individuals living in Kananga, the capital of the local province, Kasai

Occidental. Kananga lies to the south of the Kuba Kingdom and is about a 300 kilometer drive

from the center of the Kuba Kingdom and its capital Mushenge. Thus, none of the individuals
  24 See
       Callaghy (1984), Turner and Young (1985), and Van Reybrouck (2015) for a description of this experience.
  25 Duringthe trip, we met with the royal court to confirm information from the secondary literature and to learn
more about the Kingdom’s surviving customs and institutions.


                                                       17
in our sample were living in or surrounding the Kuba Kingdom at the time of the survey. As

noted in the introduction, a Kananga-based sample allows us to better identify cultural channels.

By examining individuals removed from their original institutional environments, but now living

in the same city, we can be more confident that our findings are driven by differences arising

from internal norms, rather than differences in the external setting.26 It was also more feasible to

collect data in the city given the poor transportation infrastructure of the region.

   The data were collected in June, July, and August of 2013 and 2014, the dry season in Kananga.

Because a census for the city does not exist, we used Google satellite imagery to randomly sample

households. We first divided Kananga into nine cells, which are shown in figure 2. We then

selected a random sample, using a two-stage cluster sampling method. We selected a fixed

number of polygons in each grid cell, with a probability of selection proportional to population.

We then randomly selected a fixed number of houses within each polygon. The polygons are also

shown in figure 2. In total, our random sample consists of 2,097 households (1,031 in 2013 and

1,066 in 2014).

   The random sample yielded a relatively small number of ‘treated’ observations with ancestors

who were from the Kuba Kingdom. To increase the number of households from the ethnic

groups of interest, we used an additional sampling strategy. Neighborhoods/polygons that were

likely to have Kuba and Lele inhabitants were identified in consultation with local Kuba and Lele

leaders. These neighborhoods were deliberately selected, but the sampling procedure within the

resulting polygons remained random. That is, within the polygons, households were randomly

selected. The targeted sample includes 788 individuals from 33 targeted polygons from 2013, and

1,908 individuals across 66 targeted polygons from 2014. Therefore, the total sample from 2013

includes 1,819 individuals and 3,345 individuals from 2014. The finer details of the sampling

procedure are provided in the paper’s online appendix.

   From our sample, we then selected the subset of individuals relevant for our study. These

included all individuals who: (i) have an origin village or birth village in Mweka, a district whose

borders are nearly identical to that of the historical Kuba Kingdom; (ii) have an origin or birth

village in the districts contiguous to Mweka; or (iii) have an origin village or birth village in other

districts, but who belong to an ethnic group represented in Mweka, namely Kete, Kuba, or Lele.
  26 This is analogous to prior studies that examine migrants to the United States or Europe, to try and understand

cultural differences arising from the home countries. See for example Giuliano (2007), Fernandez and Fogli (2009) or
Alesina et al. (2013).

In total, 499 individuals satisfied this criterion.

   Participants in our study were visited by enumerators three times after the initial screening

survey.       In the first visit, we collected information on individuals’ migration history, basic

demographic information, measures of income, trust, and political attitudes. During the second

visit, we administered the dictator game (DG) and the ultimatum game (UG) with the potential

for theft. During the third visit, we administered the resource allocation game (RAG). The results

we present here include all of the behavioral games that were administered as part of this project.

We are not selectively reporting results from a larger set of games. The RAG and the UG with

theft are used as measures of rule-following.27 We describe the details of these games below.
  27 As we explain in section 7, we use the behavior in the DG as a measure of altruism when examining this as a

potential alternative mechanism that explains our baseline finding.

Characteristics of the sample

The ethnic composition of the sample is reported in table 1. In total, there are 80 individuals

(14%) who report being Kuba. Ancestral villages and their relation to the historical boundary of

the Kuba Kingdom are shown in figure 3. The figure also shows Kananga, the study location. The

449 individuals in our analysis are from 15 different ethnic groups. The dominant ethnic group

in the region and in Kananga is the Luluwa. The other large ethnic groups in the sample are the

Kete, Luntu, Lele, and Bindi.

   Among the 80 Kuba descendants, 62 (77%) are descendants of the “central Kuba”, namely

those who descended from Woot. Further, 38 of the 80 (48%) are Bushong. This distribution is

very similar to the distribution reported in Vansina (1978, p. 5). In 1953, he calculated that 63% of

the villages within the Kingdom were occupied by the “central Kuba”.


4. Description of Experimental Measures of Rule-Following and Cheating

Resource Allocation Game (RAG)

Our primary experimental measure of interest is the recently developed resource allocation game

(RAG), a non-strategic game that measures the extent to which participants follow the rules


                                                 21
(Hruschka et al., 2014).28 For a single round of the game, the individual is given a six-sided

die with three sides black and three sides white. The individual is also given a stack of thirty

100cf bills (3,000cf in total). This is a significant amount, approximately $US 3.25, which is

equal to about 2–3 days wages. The participant is told that the stack of bills is to be divided

between herself and another party. The other party is either a citizen from Kananga, a coethnic

from Kananga, a non-coethnic from Kananga, or the local provincial government (to be used in

a public works project). The participant is told to allocate the money according to the following

procedure. First, the participant associates black with one of the two parties (e.g., herself or the

government) and white with the other party. Then she rolls the die and observes the color that is

rolled. If it is white and she had mentally associated white with herself, then she puts the 100cf

bill in an envelope marked for her. If she had mentally associated white with the other party,

then she puts the 100cf bill in the envelope for the other party.

   Participants repeat this procedure 30 times, each time making a new color association decision.

The task is performed by the participant alone in the privacy of a tent, and is not observed by

anyone including the person administering the game. Participants are to seal both envelopes in

private, keep the envelope that is for themselves, and place the envelope for the other party in

a bag outside of the tent. Participants play the game four times, dividing the money between

themselves and one of the four parties mentioned above.29 After all games were played, the

enumerator brought the bag back to the central office. Thus, the enumerator never physically

handled the envelopes directly.          Prior to the game being played, it was made clear to the

participants that the envelopes would not be opened by the enumerator and would be brought

back to a central office, where they would be opened by one person, who would never tell anyone

the contents of the envelope.

   The baseline difference between Kuba and non-Kuba descendants is shown in figure 4a, which

reports the average amount allocated to the other party. The figure reports this for each of the four

different versions of the RAG, as well as the average across the four versions. If individuals were

following the rules, then on average the other party should receive half of the 3,000cf endowment,

or 1,500cf. Yet for both Kuba and non-Kuba participants, the average amount allocated to the
  28 Fora similar experiment that also tests for rule breaking see Fischbacher and Follmi-Heusi (2013).
  29 Afterthe games were completed, we distributed the money to the other parties as stated to the participants.
Further details of the RAG, as well as other experimental games administered, are reported in the online appendix.

other party (across the four games) is 1,002 (or 33%), which is well below 1,500cf (50%).30 In

addition, we find that Kuba descendants consistently allocate less to the other party than non-

Kuba descendants.

   In figure 4b, we report the same summary measure of cheating separately for the six largest

ethnic groups in the sample (see table 1). We see that not only do the Kuba contribute less than

the average of the other ethnic groups, but they contribute less than all of the other primary ethnic

groups in the sample (including the Lele).31


The Ultimatum Game with Theft

The RAG imposes a set of unfamiliar rules and instructions on our participants. The benefit of

this is that because the rules are foreign to all, they are likely viewed equally by everyone in our

sample, facilitating a credible comparison of the control and treatment groups.32 Using a more

familiar set of rules generates the possibility that the rules have differential legitimacy across

different groups. However, we recognize there is a trade off and one may be concerned that the

rules of the RAG are arbitrary and unrealistic to participants. Given this concern, we supplement

our RAG measure with an alternative measure of rule-breaking, where the rule being broken is

less ad hoc and strange to participants.

   The second measure of rule-breaking is based on participants’ actions in a variant of the

standard ultimatum game (UG). In the game, player 1 proposes a division of 1,000cf between

herself and the other player. Player 2 then chooses whether to accept or reject the division. If

player 2 accepts, then the players receive the corresponding amounts offered by player 1 in the

suggested division. If player 2 rejects, then both players receive zero.

   Each participant played the one-shot anonymous game six times, three times as player 1 and

three times as player two. In the three games as either player 1 or player 2, the player was paired
   30 Hruschka et al. (2014) implemented the RAG across eight samples from six countries. In their game player 2 was

a randomly chosen person that belonged to a an outgroup, with the definition varying by sample. The behavior varied
across the samples, ranging from 37.4% being allocated to player 2 (in Fiji) to 55.1% being allocated to player 2 in a
religious urban sample from the U.S. McNamara, Norenzayan and Henrich (2014) implemented the RAG in Fiji with
religious primes and a secular authority prime. The average allocation to player 2, who was an out-group member was
37%. By comparison, in our full sample and across all games, approximately 33% was allocated to the other player.
   31 In appendix figure A9, we report the full distribution of offers for Kuba and non-Kuba respondents, and for each

of the three samples of interest. The support of the distributions is similar between the two groups, but lower-than-
average allocations are relatively more frequent among Kuba descendants and greater-than-average allocations are
relatively less frequent.
   32 If individuals have different views about foreign researchers, then they may have different views about the

legitimacy of the rules. We address this possibility in section 7.

with an anonymous partner: (i) a citizen of Kananga, (ii) a coethnic from Kananga, and (iii) a

non-coethnic from Kananga. For each round, respondents chose their strategy as player 1 (the

proposed division of the 1,000cf) and as player 2 (making acceptance and rejection decisions for

the possible divisions proposed by player 1).

   An important difference between our version of the UG and standard implementations of the

UG is that we did not use computers or tablets. Instead, participants made their offers as player

1 in private (in a tent) by dividing a stack of ten 100cf bills into two piles. The portion of the

proposed division for player 2 was placed in an envelope marked for player 2, and the portion

for player 1 was placed in an envelope for player 1. Both envelopes were sealed by player 1 and

placed in a bag sitting just outside of the tent. Prior to the game being played, it was made clear to

the participant that the envelope would not be opened by the enumerator and would be brought

back to a central office, where their offer would be randomly matched to acceptance-rejection

decisions of another anonymous individual in our sample. Then, the payouts of the two players

would be determined and given to two participants during the next visit.

   Because individuals made decisions in private and physically handled the money, they had the

opportunity to steal by hiding some of the money on their person (e.g., in a pocket). Although

doing this would reduce the amount offered to player 2 in the game, it ensured that they received

this amount with certainty, independent of the decision of player 2.

   In our sample, 4.8% of participants stole money in at least one round of the UG. Among the

Kuba, 10.0% stole, while among the non-Kuba 3.8% stole. The distribution of the average amount

missing by ethnic group is shown in figure 5.33 Consistent with the results from the RAG, we see

that the Kuba are the group most likely to break the rules and steal money during the game.


5. Baseline Estimates

We now turn to a more formal test of the long-term effects of the Kuba Kingdom. Specifically, we

estimate the following equation:

                                            yi = α + βIiKuba + Xi Γ + εi                                            (1)

where i indexes individuals. IiKuba is an indicator variable that equals one if individual i’s self-

reported ethnicity is Kuba. Notice that we collected data also on sub-ethnicities, so that the

individual participated in 2014 (rather than 2013).

   Motivated by the historical natural experiment, we estimate equation (1) using three different

samples: (i) all observations in the sample, and (ii) descendants of the Central Kuba and the Lele

only, (iii) descendants of the Bushong and the Lele only.

   Estimates of equation (1) are reported in table 2. Panel A reports estimates of equation (1)

without covariates, while panel B reports estimates with the baseline set of control variables.

Columns 1–3 report estimates using the average amount allocated to the other party in the four

rounds of the RAG as our measure of rule-following; each column reports estimates from one

of the samples of interest. We find that with or without covariates and for all three samples,

the coefficient for the Kuba ethnicity indicator is negative and statistically significant.34 The size

of the Kuba effect tends to increase slightly as we move to the more restrictive samples that

compare ethnic groups that were culturally homogeneous prior to the formation of the Kingdom.
  34 Aswe report in appendix table A4, one reaches the same conclusion by estimating equation (1) using the outcomes
in each of the different rounds separately. The behavior in the different games also provides a check on the sensibility
of the RAG measure. For example, we find that cheating (less allocation to the other party) is greater when playing
against a non-coethnic than a coethnic, and that the amount of cheating when playing against a citizen of Kananga is
between these two (see the means reported appendix table A4).

Although there are a number of potential explanations for this pattern, it is consistent with an

upward bias arising from pre-existing cultural differences that affected selection into treatment.

That is, the ethnic groups that were naturally more inclined to have a greater respect for authority

might have been more likely to have become a part of the Kuba Kingdom.

   Columns 4–6 of table 2 report estimates using the total amount missing in the three rounds

of the UG as the dependent variable.35 Using this second measure, we also find that Kuba

descendants are less likely to follow rules. The coefficient on the Kuba indicator variable is

positive and significant. As with the RAG measure, we find larger estimates of the Kuba effect

when we restrict the sample to ethnic groups that were culturally homogeneous prior to the
  35 The results are qualitatively identical if one uses an indicator variable for the incidence of any missing money

rather than the amount missing.



                                                                  27
formation of the Kingdom.

  Taken together, the evidence suggests that the Kuba state is associated with a deterioration of

intrinsic motivations to follow the rules. This does not mean that the Kuba Kingdom was not

a successful and well-functioning state. From the historical and anthropological literature, we

know that it was. Although the state was prosperous and orderly, the evidence suggests that it

eroded the intrinsic propensity of its subjects to follow rules even when enforcement is absent.


6. Examining Potential Confounders: Migration and Geography

A. Differential Selection of Migrants

As discussed, by examining individuals who no longer live in the treatment or control regions,

we are better able to identify a purely cultural channel. All individuals in our sample either

migrated from their origin village themselves, or their ancestors migrated at some point in the

past. The vast majority of migration to cities is from rural villages, due to the better economic

opportunities available in cities. Among the 195 individuals in our sample who were born outside

of Kananga and migrated as adults, 144 (74%) migrated because of greater educational (87 people)

or economic (57 people) opportunities in the city. Most of the remaining, an additional 23 (12%),

migrated because of marriage. See appendix table A3 for the full distribution of reasons for

migration.

  Despite the economic motivation behind migration, there remains the concern that individuals

who live in Kananga today underwent a selection process that differed systematically between

Kuba and non-Kuba descendants, thereby biasing our estimates. We check for differences in

observables between the Kuba and non-Kuba populations in each of our three samples of interest.

These are reported in table 3.

  The first set of characteristics we examine are measures of whether individuals in our sample

are recent migrants. We asked participants if they were born in Kananga and the year in which

they moved to Kananga, which combined with their year of birth, could be used to calculate

the fraction of their life that was spent living in Kananga. We also constructed three variables

aimed at measuring the extent to which individuals are integrated into the broader community in

Kananga rather than into an ethnic enclave. We asked individuals about their five closest friends

and used this to calculate the fraction of these friends that are coethnics. Using information

on the ethnic composition of neighborhoods in Kananga from the screening surveys (with a

sample of approximately 5,500), we calculated for each participant the share of individuals in their

neighborhood that are of the same ethnicity, as well as the ethnic diversity of their neighborhood,

measured as one minus the Herfindahl index of ethnic concentration.

   Looking at the five measures, we find statistically significant differences between Kuba and

non-Kuba. Kuba descendants have spent less of their life in Kananga on average. We also find

that Kuba descendants have fewer close friends who are coethnics, live in neighborhoods with

fewer coethnics, and live in more ethnically diverse neighborhoods. Thus, the Kuba sample

appears to more strongly reflect characteristics typical of immigrants than the non-Kuba sample.

However, in the restricted samples, these differences disappear. We find no statistically significant

difference in any of the measures between central Kuba and Lele, or Bushong and Lele. As well,

the lack of statistical significance is not due to larger standard errors, but to differences that

converge towards zero.

   To be as conservative as possible, we re-estimate equation (1) while controlling for the five

measures from table 3. The estimates, reported in table 4, show that overall our estimates are

robust to the inclusion of these controls. Thus, we feel that it is unlikely that our baseline findings

are due to differential selection of migrants to Kananga.

B. Geography

Another possible source of bias are geographic differences between the historical Kuba Kingdom

and the surrounding areas. In fact, Mary Douglas (1962, 1963) conjectures that potential differ-

ences in crop suitability across the Kasai river may partially explain differences between the Kuba

and Lele. If geographic differences do in fact exist, and these factors had an independent effect

on cultural evolution, then these may bias our estimates.

    We examine this possibility using data from the FAO’s GAEZ database on the agricultural

suitability of land in our sample region for the cultivation of crops. The data are available for

grid-cells that are 5 arc minutes by 5 arc minutes (approximately 6 miles by 6 miles). We consider

the two staple crops in the region: maize and cassava. The suitability indices range from 0 to

100. Figures 6a and 6b show these indices along with the origin villages for the participants in

our sample. From the figures, the suitability for both crops appears similar inside and outside

the Kuba Kingdom. We test this formally by measuring the suitability of the grid-cell of each

participant’s origin village.

Notes: The table reports balance statistics for the suitability of a respondent's ancestral village for the cultivation of maize and for the
cultivation of cassava. An observation is an individual in our sample. Statistics are reported for each of our three samples of interest.




   A balance table showing the mean of these measures for Kuba and non-Kuba descendants, and

their difference, appears in table 5. The table shows no differences between Kuba and non-Kuba

observations for all three samples. While the average maize suitability in the sample is approx-

imately 23 (of 100), the average difference between the Kuba and non-Kuba observations range

from 0.08 to 0.25. For cassava suitability, the mean suitability measure is higher at around 47,

while the gap only ranges from 0.14 to 1.17. In addition, none of these differences is statistically

significant.36


7. Examining Causal Channels

We now turn to an examination of other potential channels and alternative interpretations of our

finding of greater cheating among Kuba descendants.


A. Income and Prosperity

A potential mechanism underlying the effects we find is the greater historical prosperity of the

Kuba Kingdom. The historical formation of states in sub-Saharan Africa is on average associated

with greater economic activity today (Gennaioli and Rainer, 2007, Michalopoulos and Papaioan-

nou, 2013, 2104). This might also be one of the legacies of the Kuba state. Historically, the Kuba

Kingdom facilitated trade, specialization of production, agricultural productivity, technological
  36 As shown in appendix table A5,   our estimates of equation (1) are robust to the inclusion of these controls. Although
the standard errors increase slightly, the point estimates remain nearly identical to the baseline estimates.

innovation, and a higher standard of living. If income differences persist until today, they might

be an important channel that explains the differences in rule-following that we observe.37

   We examine this potential channel by first checking for income differences between Kuba and

non-Kuba descendants. We re-estimate equation (1), substituting various measures of income and

prosperity as the dependent variable.38 Estimates are reported in table 6. Since income is noisy

and difficult to measure in resource-poor settings, our strategy is to examine a variety of different

measures.

   Our first measure is an index of individuals’ perceived income status. Respondents were asked

to imagine a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the poorest level on the scale and 5 is the richest. They

are then asked to report the level at which they are situated relative to other people in Kananga.
  37 This possibility is particularly important given evidence that being from a higher social class is associated with

more unethical behavior (Piff et al., 2012), and that the physical presence of money causes individuals to behave more
unethically (Gino and Pierce, 2009).
  38 Alternatively, we could have produced a balance table that shows difference between the two groups without

conditioning on our baseline covariates. Doing this yields very similar results. We prefer to condition on our baseline
covariates because it is highly likely that age and gender are important determinants of income.




                                                          33
This scale could be interpreted as capturing either income or wealth. Estimates using the 1-5

scale are reported in column 1. We also directly measure an individual’s earned income, over

the past year and over the past month (both measured in Congolese Francs). While the annual

measure has the advantage of providing an income estimate over a longer period of time, recall

over a full year may be less accurate than that for the past month. Estimates using these measures

are reported in columns 2 and 3. The last measure is an individual’s current employment status

(results reported in column 4). Although this measure is coarse, it has the benefit of being known

with certainty and therefore accurately reported.

   The results provide weak evidence that Kuba descendants might be slightly more prosperous

relative to other groups. In the full sample (panel A), the self-reported income scale is higher

for Kuba descendants (column 1), although this difference disappears in the restricted samples

(panels B and C). In all three panels, we find no statistical difference in self-reported income over

the past year or over the past month (columns 2 and 3). However, we find that the Kuba appear

less likely to be unemployed (column 4). In the restricted samples (panels B and C), the Kuba are

about 15 percentage points less likely to be unemployed.

   We explore this channel further by re-estimating equation (1) while controlling for these four

measures of income. Estimates, reported in table 7, show that higher frequency of rule breaking

and theft among the Kuba is robust to controlling for available measures of income. The income

channel does not appear to explain our main results.


B. The Colonial Period

Another potential explanation for the greater propensity of Kuba descendants to break the rules

is that they were treated differently during the colonial period. It is possible that because of

the Kingdom’s pre-existing formal institutions, the Belgian colonists treated the Kuba differently

than they treated other groups. This in turn could have affected beliefs and behaviors concerning

following the rules.

   We explore this mechanism by measuring colonial investments and missionary activity. The

measures are taken from Mantnieks (1951), who reports the location of mission stations, electricity

stations, railroads, and mines. Figures 7a and 7b show the locations of these colonial investments

(as of 1951), as well as the Kuba boundary.

   Using digitized data from Mantnieks (1951), we construct indicator variables that equal one

if any of these colonial investments were located within 30 kilometers of an individual’s origin

village. The differences in the means of the measures across Kuba and non-Kuba observations

are reported in table 8. Kuba ancestors were less likely to be near a power station, but more likely

to have been near a railway line. Both of these differences are significant and exist in each of the

three samples. We do not see any significant difference in proximity to missions or mines.

   Motivated by these differences, we re-estimate equation (1) with the colonial control variables,

clustering standard errors at the village level. The estimates, reported in table 9, show that

our reduced-form Kuba effect remains robust to the inclusion of the set of the colonial control

variables. Although the standard errors increase slightly, comparing the estimates of table 9 with

the baseline estimates of table 2, the point estimates are stable. In four of the six specifications,

the magnitude of the Kuba effect actually increases after controlling for the colonial covariates.

This suggests that it is unlikely that the effect we find is working through differential colonial

contact.

   Among the forms of European influence during the colonial period, missions and religious

conversion is a particularly important potential channel.                       Previous research has shown that

missions in Africa had a long-term impact on religiosity (Nunn, 2010), which in turn might affect

individuals’ propensity to break rules and steal. If, for example, descendants of the Kuba are

less religious, they might have a weaker spiritual interdiction against breaking rules. To examine

this issue, we use respondents’ answers to survey questions to construct composite measures

of the strength of Christian beliefs and of traditional beliefs. (These measures are described in

detail in section A6 of the online appendix.) According to these measures, however, there are

no differences in religiosity between Kuba and non-Kuba descendants. Further, controlling for

religiosity does not affect our baseline estimate (see appendix tables A9 and A10).


C. The Post-Colonial Period

The Kuba might also have been treated systematically differently by the government of President

Joseph Mobutu Sese-Seko during the post-colonial period, which could explain the experimental

differences that we observe today. Since there is little available data from this period, we focus

on self-reported attitudes of President Mobutu, which should capture unobserved impacts of the

Mobutu regime. If the regime treated locations in systematically different ways, this will likely

be reflected in individuals’ attitudes towards the regime.

   We collected two survey-based measures of attitudes towards Mobutu. First, we asked re-

spondents to report their view of former President Mobutu, choosing between: very positive,

somewhat positive, neutral, somewhat negative, and very negative. We also asked respondents

their view of the overall impacts of Mobutu, using the same scale.

   Because participants might be unwilling to answer truthfully questions about potentially

sensitive political figures, we also measured individuals’ attitudes towards former President

Mobutu using a single-target implicit association test (ST-IAT). The test was recently developed

by Bluemke and Friese (2008). It is a variant of the original IAT and is intended to measure the

positivity or negativity of individuals’ implicit association of a single target (which in our case is

Mobutu).39
  39 Elsewhere,we have used the single-target IAT to examine individual attitudes towards other ethnic groups (Lowes,
Nunn, Robinson and Weigel, 2015). The paper also describes a test of the IAT’s validity in this setting using ST-IATs
with food, spiders, and snakes as targets. Consistent with expectations, the ST-IAT scores indicated that participants
view food very positively and spiders and snakes negatively. See section A3 of the appendix for more details.




                                                                      38
   The IATs were played on ten-inch Samsung Galaxy Tab III tablets. During the IAT, participants

are asked to sort images into two groups, one group on the left side and one group on the right

side. Three different types of images appear on the screen of a tablet: images of happy people,

images of sad people, and images of Mobutu. The sorting is done by pressing a button on the

lower left or the lower right of the tablet’s touch screen. Screen shots from the IAT, showing the

buttons at the bottom left and bottom right of the screen as well as the image in the center of the

screen, are provided in figure 8.

   The IAT has two blocks, in both of which happy images are sorted to the left and sad images

are sorted to the right. In one block, images of President Mobutu are sorted to the same side as

the happy images (left), and in the other block, images of Mobutu are sorted to the same side

as the sad images (right). The order of the blocks is randomized across individuals. During the

activity, the sides that the images are to be sorted to are indicated by small anchor images on the

top left and top right. These are also visible in the screenshots shown in figure 8. Figures 8a–8c

show screenshots for the block with Mobutu sorted to the same side as the sad images (right),

while figures 8d–8f show screenshots for the block with Mobutu sorted to the same side as the

happy images (left).

   The logic of the ST-IAT is as follows. If a participant has a positive view of Mobutu, then

sorting will be faster when the participant has to sort Mobutu images and happy images to the

left and sad images to the right. Subconsciously, they can exploit the heuristic: ‘good things to the

left bad things to the right’. If the participant has a negative view of Mobutu, then this heuristic

does not apply. Instead, sorting will be quicker when the Mobutu images are sorted to the same

side of the screen as the sad images (right). Then the heuristic is: ‘good things to the left and

bad things to the right’. Again, this heuristic is not effective if Mobutu is viewed positively. By

comparing the speed at which the participant sorts images during the two blocks, we can infer

their implicit view of Mobutu.40

   From the ST-IAT we calculate the standard D-score, which is defined as:


                  D-score = [M ean(latency −ve ) − M ean(latency +ve )]/SD (latency both )


where M ean(latency −ve ) is the recorded average response time (measured in milliseconds) for the

block in which the Mobutu images are sorted to the same side as sad images, M ean(latency +ve )
 40 The   finer details of the ST-IAT are provided in the paper’s online appendix.

blocks. The constructed D-score is increasing in the positivity of the participant’s view of Mobutu.

   With our three measures of individuals’ perception of Mobutu, we test whether there is evi-

dence that Kuba descendants have a different view of Mobutu than non-Kuba descendants. The

estimates are reported in table 10.41 In all but one of the nine specifications, the coefficient on the

Kuba ethnicity indicator variable is statistically insignificant. Not surprisingly, if we re-estimate

our baseline equation (1) while controlling for these covariates, we obtain qualitatively identical

estimates (see appendix table A6). Thus, the evidence suggests that the reduced-form Kuba effect

is not due to differential treatment of the Kuba in the post-colonial period.
  41 Note that we are missing IAT information for a number of observations. This is because the IAT was implemented

for the first time in 2014. Therefore, some individuals from the 2013 sample could not be located again in 2014.

D. Other Cultural Characteristics

a. Trust in foreign researchers

Another factor potentially affecting behavior in our experiments is participants’ trust of our

research team. Although our enumerators themselves all hailed from Kananga, participants were

aware that the survey and experiments were conducted by researchers from Harvard University.

Their actions in the RAG might have been affected, for example, by the extent to which they

trusted that we really would give the amount allocated to the other party in the RAG and UG as

we said we would (and in fact did).

   We measure participants’ self-reported trust in universities, in international organizations, and

in people from other countries. When asked their level of trust, respondents chose between: not

at all, not very much, somewhat, and completely. We assign integer values of 1, 2, 3, and 4, to the

responses so that the constructed variables are increasing in reported trust.

   Estimates of equation (1) with the trust measures as dependent variables are reported in table

11. As shown, we do not find strong evidence that the Kuba are less trusting. Although most

coefficients are negative (8 of the 9), their magnitudes are small, and all estimates are statistically

insignificant.

   Nonetheless, we further check the trust channel by re-estimating equation (1), while controlling

for each of our three measures of trust.               The estimates are reported in appendix table A7.

Controlling for the three trust measures has little impact on the estimated Kuba effect. Overall,

the evidence suggests that the Kuba effect we estimate is not due to a greater distrust in our

research team among Kuba descendants.42


b. Altruism towards others

A plausible alternative explanation for our findings is that historical state formation did not

affect individual rule-following but instead impacted altruism. If the Kuba were less altruistic

towards the recipients in the RAG, then this, rather than rule-following, could explain why they

are more likely to cheat. To check that altruism is not confounding our interpretation of behavior
  42 For  the version of the RAG in which the other party is the provincial government, participants’ confidence in the
provincial government may be an important determinant of the amount allocated to the government. If a participant
has little confidence in the government he or she may be less likely to allocate the ‘correct’ amount to the government.
As we show in section A7 in the appendix, this mechanism does not explain the difference between the behavior of
Kuba and non-Kuba in the version of the RAG where player 2 is the provincial government.

in the RAG, we also had participants play the dictator game (DG). In the DG, participants divide

1,000cf between themselves and a second player. The division was done in the privacy of a

tent and was made by placing the money for the other party in an envelope, sealing it, and

then placing it in a bag outside the tent. Each participant played four rounds of the DG, in

each round dividing 1,000cf between themselves and another anonymous individual, either (i)

someone from Kananga, (ii) someone from the same ethnic group in Kananga, (iii) someone from

a different ethnic group in Kananga, or (iv) the provincial government.

  We re-estimate equation (1) with the amount given to the other player in the DG as the

dependent variable. The estimates are reported in table 12. Columns 1–4 report estimates for

each of the four versions of the DG.43 In column 5, we report estimates using the average amount

given in the four games as the dependent variable. The estimates show that there is no statistically

significant difference between the measures of altruism for Kuba and non-Kuba descendants.

This suggests that the differences in cheating and stealing we observe are not due to underlying

differences in altruism towards the other player.44


8. Conclusions

We have investigated the impact of living under a centralized state on internal norms of rule-

following. Though this relationship is the subject of numerous famous hypotheses in social

science, to our knowledge it has never been studied empirically before. Modern states created
  43 We have fewer observations for the DG with the provincial government. This is because in 2013 we originally

implemented only three versions of the dictator game. The version with the provincial government was implemented
in 2014. Therefore, some individuals from the 2013 sample could not be located again in 2014.
  44 We also find that our baseline RAG results are robust to controlling for altruism towards player 2 as measured by

play in the DG. See appendix table A8.



                                                                 44
monopolies of violence, bureaucracies, fiscal structures, and legal institutions. But, do they also

create a different sort of person? Elias (1994), Weber (1976), and Foucault (1995) argued yes, and,

in particular, that they create a population that is intrinsically motivated to obey rules. Studying

such an issue is complicated because culture and institutions are endogenous to each other, and

also jointly determined, making it difficult to identify the causal impact of state formation on this

cultural characteristic.

   We explored a unique historical natural experiment of state formation in a region that today

lies within the Democratic Republic of the Congo: that of the Kuba Kingdom in the early 17th

century. The Kuba Kingdom, which shares many of the features of modern states, arose idiosyn-

cratically due to an institutional innovator named Shyaam, and its boundaries were determined

by the local system of rivers in the area. The historical episode is attractive from an empirical point

of view because it took place in an region inhabited by a population that was ex ante culturally

homogeneous, some of whom, specifically the Lele, did not end up within the Kuba state.

   Using two experiment-based measures of rule-following – the resource allocation game (RAG)

and the ultimatum game with the potential for theft (UG) – and examining three samples moti-

vated by the historical natural experiment, we found a robust negative effect of the Kuba Kingdom

on norms of rule-following and against stealing. That is, Kuba descendants are less likely to follow

rules and more likely to steal. In the RAG, Kuba descendants allocated significantly less to the

other party than non-Kuba descendants. In addition, Kuba descendants were more likely to steal

money when participating in a version of the ultimatum game in which they physically handled

the money when proposing their division as player 1.

   Examining potential confounders, we showed that these differences are not due to differential

selection of migrants to Kananga, the location of the study, or to geographical differences in

the regions historically inhabited by Kuba and non-Kuba ancestors. We then examined a host

of alternative channels. We examined whether our findings are due to differences in income,

altruism, or trust of our research team. We also examined whether the Kuba were differentially

impacted by colonial rule or the Mobutu regime. We found that none of these alternative channels

explains the lower incidence of rule-following among the Kuba.

   Overall, our findings provide evidence that institutions can crowd out intrinsic motivations

for following the rules. More broadly, they raise doubts about the hypotheses proposed by Elias,

Weber, and Foucault. While these studies inferred individuals’ respect for rules from their actions,


                                                  45
our study used direct experimental measures among a population removed from the direct effects

of the institutional environment.

   In an observational study of the Kuba Kingdom, one would be tempted to arrive at the

same conclusion as Elias, Weber, and Foucault. The Kuba Kingdom had less conflict and was

more prosperous than the neighboring Lele. However, this outcome reflects the direct effect of

Kuba institutions, not necessarily the population’s underlying cultural proclivities. Our findings

therefore suggest caution in interpreting observational accounts of the co-evolution of institutions

and culture. Their joint determination likely confound such analyses. We feel that our natural

experiment, combined with our lab-in-the-field methodology generates variation that is better

suited for examining the long-term impacts of institutions on culture.
