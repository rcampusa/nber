                                             ABSTRACT

From 1980 to 1992, emerging and developing countries grew by 3.4 percent per year. Their annual
rate of growth increased to 5.4 percent between 1993 and 2012. No such increase occurred for advanced
nations, whose average growth from 1980-2012 was roughly constant (excluding the impact of the
2008-09 Recession). Developing nations turned themselves around by embracing discipline—sustained
commitment to a pragmatic and flexible growth strategy. Three illustrations of discipline through
the lens of trade, fiscal, and debt reforms in the developing world offer relevant, practical lessons for
recovery in advanced economies and continued catch-up growth in developing nations.

Introduction

           Not long ago, developing and emerging economies were known as “Third World” nations

mired in poverty, debt crises, stratospheric inflation rates, and chronic instability while advanced

countries seemed to hold the keys to prosperity. Tables have turned. The first decade of the 21st

century brought unprecedented economic progress in the developing world, which now produces

half of global GDP and is expected to account for almost three quarters of global growth by

2017. It has been a less auspicious time for developed countries, evidenced by the epic Financial

Crisis of 2008–09 and its consequences for the United States and Europe.

           As the fortunes of nations ebb and flow, it is important to distinguish between cycles and

trends. Recent statistics suggesting an upswing in advanced countries and decreased growth in

emerging markets divert our attention from the most important story about the world economy

since the end of the Second World War, even as it continues to unfold. Namely, that through

their struggle to reject failed models of development such as dependency theory and central

planning—often at the behest of advanced-nation governments in the past—a critical mass of

developing countries turned themselves around by embracing the true key to success: a

disciplined approach to economic policy. 1

           Discipline is a sustained commitment to a pragmatic growth strategy executed with a

combination of temperance, vigilance, and flexibility that values the long-term prosperity of all

over the short-term enrichment of any single group (Henry, 2013). Figure 1, which we

constructed using data from the International Monetary Fund’s World Economic Outlook (WEO)

database and which plots the average growth rate of real GDP in advanced as well as emerging

and developing economies from 1980 through 2012, tells the central story that the rest of this

economies during the Great Recession of 2008–09, the figure presents two salient facts.

                    First, the growth rate of real GDP in the developing world has been dramatically higher

in the last two decades than it was in the 1980s. Between 1980 and 1992, the average growth rate

of real GDP in developing countries was 3.4 percent per year versus 5.4 percent from 1993 to

2012. The significance of this two-percentage-point increase in growth is profound: for a country

whose population grows at 1 percent per year, annual GDP growth of 3.4 percent means that per

capita income doubles once every 29 years; with 5.4 percent growth, per capita income doubles

in just 16.

                    Second, excluding the years 2007–2012, which was a period of slower growth in

developed countries because of the recession—a negative shock that had little to do with

developing countries per se—there has been no substantive decline in advanced-country fortunes


                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        3
following the acceleration of growth in the developing world. Developed countries grew by 2.9

percent per year from 1980 to 1992—almost identical to the 2.8 percent rate at which they

expanded from 1993 to 2007. There is little if any evidence to support an argument that faster

growth in the emerging world came at the expense of average living standards in advanced

nations.

       The relatively flat line for growth in advanced economies also suggests that the

accelerated rise of living standards in developing countries was not caused by an aggregate shock

to the global economy, but points to the idiosyncratic set of reforms (e.g., inflation stabilization

and trade liberalization) that were adopted during the 1990s as an unprecedented number of

countries rejected ideological approaches to economic policymaking and instead embraced

discipline. The pages ahead provide specific illustrations of discipline, seen through the lens of

economic reform in the developing world—a story of turnaround in three acts, each of which

offers practical lessons for welfare-improving outcomes.



I. The Trade Trap: Discipline Avoids Mercantilism

       The recent slow growth in advanced nations has lured their governments into the

mercantilist trap of thinking that exports are good, imports are bad, and a large trade surplus is

the key to renewed prosperity. Measured by the number of protectionist measures imposed since

November 2008, France, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom are all on the list of the

world’s top 10 most protectionist countries (Evenett, 2013). The opening act of economic reform

in the developing world—South Korea’s rise from impoverished nation in the 1950s to

manufacturing juggernaut—predates the WEO’s time series on global growth, but it

demonstrates that discipline in the context of free trade lies not in running surpluses but in




                                                                                                       4
driving up productivity through a sustained process of easing restrictions on both imports and

exports.

           In the 1950s, the Cold War occupied center stage, and countries like Singapore and South

Korea were far from the economic “tigers” they would become. In keeping with dependency

theory, the dominant intellectual paradigm in the developing world at the time, both countries

eschewed trade with developed nations in order to pursue a policy of industrialization through

import substitution, but the strategy was not successful in either country. As of 1960, South

Korea’s GDP per capita was US$1,100. Evaluating South Korea’s prospects for the future at the

time, the U.S. Congress argued there was “little or no hope for sustained growth,” while World

Bank studies claimed “industrial growth in Korea was not feasible.”2

           In 1964, the Korean government confronted the shortcomings of import substitution and

began liberalizing trade. The reduction of import restrictions was a key element of Korea’s

successful pivot to export-oriented growth. Although policymakers maintained high tariffs on a

wide range of imports, they understood that certain capital goods, intermediate inputs, and

transportation equipment were vital for production and therefore the country’s economic

development. Accordingly, they created a minimal “positive” list of permissible investment

goods that they allowed to expand over time. By 1967, the commitment to opening up had grown

to the point where policymakers replaced the previous list with a “negative” one—a new

protocol under which importers were automatically granted permission for any item not

enumerated.

           Korea’s import liberalization strategy had at least two positive effects on the economy.

First, it reduced the cost of production by providing workers and firms with critical inputs at

lower prices. Second, it enabled Korean companies to reverse-engineer everything from

Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute), Korean companies were able to

assimilate and improve upon a variety of technologies that helped them leapfrog the learning

curve and become world-class firms such as Hyundai and Samsung.

          The Korean government unquestionably played a significant role in the country’s rise to

economic prominence, and critics of economic reform often cite this involvement as evidence

that extensive government intervention and industrial policy are viable alternatives to more

market-oriented economies. But this critique misses the larger point. The key to Korea’s

turnaround was not so much an ideological tilt toward a large role for government as it was the

discipline to enact and sustain policy changes that empowered firms to take advantage of the

international marketplace. For example, the decision in 1964 by Korean policymakers to devalue

the won helped drive the success of their import liberalization strategy. By offsetting the impetus

for real exchange-rate appreciation created by Korea’s remaining import barriers, the devaluation

restored external competitiveness and set the stage for the takeoff of the country’s manufacturing

sector.

          The Korean government’s willingness to reject import substitution and embrace trade

radically altered the country’s economic trajectory. From 1960 to 2005, Korea’s average

standard of living increased twelvefold, with imports and exports working together to drive

productivity gains from comparative advantage. Korean exports increased from 4.8 percent of

GDP in 1963 to 34 percent in 1980. Over the same period, imports as a fraction of GDP rose

from 15.9 percent to 41.4 percent. It bears emphasizing that Korea’s trade balance was negative




                                                                                                    6
in both 1963 and in 1980. Indeed, between 1965 and 1990, Korea grew by 7.1 percent per year

while running persistent trade deficits.



II. Fiscal Follies: Discipline Does Not Equal Austerity

       From international trade to public finance, the appropriate role of government in

economic activity remains a controversial topic. The Great Recession triggered a contentious

debate over whether fiscal consolidation (austerity) is helpful or harmful in restoring developed

economies to full employment and sustainable debt trajectories. These debates intensified during

the U.S. sequestration standoff and deliberations over the European Fiscal Compact.

       Economic commentators from both ends of the political spectrum mistakenly conflate

discipline with the false courage to implement extreme policies. When it comes to whether to

impose fiscal austerity, however, studying the historical (and objective) responses of developing-

country stock markets to implementation of austerity programs demonstrates the error of

unyielding views. Thirty years of data from emerging markets suggest that the disciplined course

of action depends largely on the prevailing level of inflation in the country at the time austerity is

being considered.

       The stock market is a useful tool for determining what discipline means in the context of

fiscal policy, because it internalizes both the short- and long-run effects of austerity (Henry,

2002). To the extent that austerity creates expectations of slower growth and higher discount

rates in the short run, it will depress present values. But the potential of higher growth and lower

discount rates in the long run creates an offsetting effect. If the expected long-run benefits

outweigh the short-run costs, then the country’s stock market will rise when its government




                                                                                                    7
announces an austerity program. If the expected costs outweigh the benefits, the market will fall.

If the anticipated net effect is zero, there should be little to no market reaction.

        The response of the Brazilian stock market to President Henrique Cardoso’s plan to end

hyperinflation in 1994 illustrates this kind of cost-benefit analysis at work. The Cardoso

government instituted fiscal consolidation, unveiled a new currency (the Real) and stopped

printing money to pay its bills. In the anticipation of the Real Plan, the Brazilian stock market

experienced cumulative abnormal returns of 75 percent in real dollar terms during the twelve-

month period prior to implementation. The plan worked. Over the course of the next three years

Brazil went from hyperinflation to single-digit annual price increases. The permanent reduction

in inflation along with other economic reforms placed the economy on a new path. The growth

rate of Brazilian GDP in the two decades beginning with stabilization was 3.2 percent per year—

no Asian miracle, but 1.2 percentage points faster than in the prior decade. Growth was

particularly strong between 2001 and 2011—3.6 percent per year—a time during which the

combination of growth and antipoverty measures lifted twenty million Brazilians out of poverty.

        Unlike Brazil in the early 1990s, inflation was not the principal problem facing Chile

when its policymakers implemented austerity under three successive agreements with the

International Monetary Fund (IMF) between 1983 and 1989. (The Pinochet regime ended triple-

digit inflation in the 1970s.) In anticipation of the future economic impact of austerity, Chile’s

stock market experienced negative cumulative abnormal returns in each of the twelve-month

periods preceding the agreements. Across all three episodes of cold-turkey approaches to

macroeconomic stabilization, the average cumulative abnormal return was negative 87 percent.

In line with these negative market forecasts, real GDP also fell sharply and did not return to its

pre-recession level until 1986.




                                                                                                     8
                   The differing reaction of the stock market to austerity programs conditional on the level

of inflation is not a phenomenon exclusive to Brazil and Chile. Figure 2 demonstrates that

average cumulative abnormal returns of 44 percent occurred in response to the twenty-five

separate austerity programs announced in the midst of high inflation (greater than 40 percent)

across twenty-one emerging nations between 1973 and 1994. Conversely, the fifty-six separate

programs announced in the midst of moderate inflation (less than 40 percent) triggered average

cumulative abnormal returns of negative 24 percent.

                   With inflation rates in the United States and the Euro Area below 2 percent in 2010,

Figure 2 suggests that, rather than changing swiftly from stimulus to austerity that year, a more

gradual approach to fiscal consolidation for those countries might have been optimal. Indeed,

Europe’s prolonged decline in economic activity in the aftermath of the Great Recession stands

in contrast to the rapid recovery experienced by East Asia following its own crisis in 1997


                                                                                                                                             9
(caused by similar factors such as property booms and excess leverage). At least part of the

difference in the post-crisis paths of employment and output in the two episodes appears to be a

result of greater fiscal flexibility on the part of Asian policymakers than their European

counterparts (Chari and Henry, 2014).

        A gradual approach to deficit reduction need not imply a lack of seriousness—altering

the speed of progress toward a specified fiscal target is not the same as abandoning it. On the

contrary, gradualism can be a powerful tool in helping achieve the objectives of a broader growth

strategy (Dewatripont and Roland, 1995). The goal is not to balance the budget in one fell

swoop, but to implement positive net present value measures that place government debt on a

sustainable trajectory.



III. Discipline Applies to Borrowers and Lenders

        When public debt does hit crisis-inducing levels, historical data on stock-market

responses in emerging markets also provide important insights about the most efficient way to

address the debt overhang and insolvency that inhibit the recovery of European countries such as

Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain. Because there are many parallels between the

economic troubles of Europe and the landscape of heavily indebted, middle-income developing

countries in the late 1980s, the policy changes that resolved overhang following the Third World

Debt Crisis are deeply relevant to advanced economies. A quick review of events and data

demonstrates the following principle: when a government’s liabilities exceed its ability to pay,

discipline requires borrowers and lenders to bear the burden of adjustment in order to reach an

efficient resolution.




                                                                                                   10
       Following seven years of restructurings and forgone growth in the Crisis countries, and

despite prior insistence that debt relief had no place in the solution, the U.S. Treasury changed

tack in 1989. Then-Secretary of the Treasury Nicholas Brady unveiled a plan that called on

international commercial banks to provide approximately US$65 billion of debt forgiveness to

the sixteen nations in question. The anticipation of the official announcement of a Brady deal

generated average cumulative abnormal returns of 60 percent over a twelve-month

preannouncement window in the stock markets of the recipient countries. It is tempting to

conclude that the revaluation of assets simply reflected a transfer of wealth from bank

shareholders, but additional data reject this explanation. Publicly traded U.S. commercial banks

with large developing-country loan exposure experienced average cumulative abnormal returns

of 35 percent during the relevant time frame.

       Debt relief, however, also carries a price tag. It was given to Brady countries in exchange

for their agreement to implement growth-enhancing reforms: inflation stabilization, trade

liberalization, and privatization of badly run state-owned firms whose lack of profitability was a

drag on public finances and helped give rise to debt overhang in the first place. Countries that

instituted and sustained subsets of the reforms that were most relevant to their circumstances

experienced significant improvements in economic performance. Countries that failed to honor

their reform commitments (Jordan, Nigeria, and the Philippines) experienced a much smaller

initial rise in the value of their stock markets than other Brady countries—30 percent versus 60

percent—and even those increases completely evaporated within a year as lack of commitment

to reforms became obvious (Arslanalp and Henry, 2005).

       The lesson seems clear. Reducing the debt burden can be an important part of a pragmatic

growth strategy for countries that suffer from debt overhang. But debt relief will only succeed




                                                                                                    11
when implemented in concert with reforms that raise productivity and provide a business

environment in which firms have an incentive to generate output, invest in capital, and hire

additional workers. Resistance to writing down debts that cannot be repaid places Europe at risk

for the extended malaise that has plagued Japan for two decades and stood in the way of Third

World resurgence until Secretary Brady’s bold change of course.



IV. Conclusion

       As advanced and emerging nations struggle to regain their footing in the aftermath of the

Great Recession, they face somewhat different challenges. Developed nations seek to return their

economies to pre-crisis levels of growth and employment while responsibly addressing income

inequality. Developing countries must consolidate their hard-won gains of the past several

decades and implement second-stage reforms required in key areas (e.g., infrastructure and labor

markets) to maintain their high rates of catch-up growth. The historical examples presented in

this article provide wisdom that applies with equal relevance to the varied tasks ahead. The

analytical insight at the heart of each narrative is unique, but all three stories of economic

transformation contain a common truth: discipline drives turnarounds. If both advanced and

developing nations internalize the lesson and embrace a disciplined approach to economic

policy, they can grow in concert and create greater prosperity for all.
