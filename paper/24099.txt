                                           ABSTRACT

This paper examines the impact of a property rights reform in rural China that allowed farmers to
lease out their land. We find the reform led to increases in land rental activity in rural households.
Consistent with a model of transaction costs in land markets, our results indicate that the
formalization of leasing rights resulted in a redistribution of land toward more productive
farmers. Consequently, the aggregate productivity of land increased significantly. We also find
that the reform increased the responsiveness of land allocation across crops to changes in crop
prices.

1        Introduction

Growth in agricultural productivity has long been viewed as central to the process of structural

transformation and economic growth (Gollin, Parente and Rogerson 2002, Ranis and Fei 1961).

Yet labor productivity in agriculture remains remarkably low in most developing countries, and

this can (at least mechanically) account for most of the overall differential in labor productiv-

ity between rich and poor countries (Caselli 2005, Restuccia, Yang and Zhu 2008). Research

suggests that this phenomenon cannot be explained by low capital per worker (Chanda and Dal-

gaard 2008, Vollrath 2009, Lagakos and Waugh 2013), implying that residual factors, or total

factor productivity, must be the major source of the productivity differential in agriculture.

        Some recent studies suggest that the observed productivity differentials in agriculture may

be a result of frictions that produce a misallocation of productive resources (Adamopoulos and

Restuccia 2014, Restuccia and Santaeulalia-Llopis 2017). This idea extends an influential liter-

ature that emphasizes factor misallocation as a source of low productivity in the manufacturing

sector (Chari 2011, Hsieh and Klenow 2009, Midrigan and Xu 2014, Restuccia and Rogerson

2008). The argument is supported by the stark differences in the inputs and scale of agricul-

tural production in developing and developed countries (Foster and Rosenzweig 2012). These

differences may reflect market failures or institutional frictions in developing countries that act

as a constraint on the growth of more productive farmers.1 Understanding which policies and

institutions underlie these frictions, and quantifying their associated costs, is important for both

researchers and policy-makers.

        We contribute to this literature by leveraging a property rights reform in China. Specifically,

we analyze the impact of the Rural Land Contracting Law (RLCL), a reform that gave farmers

legal rights to lease their land while re-iterating existing protections for the security of land

rights, on land allocation and efficiency in agricultural production. This occurred in a context

where farmers do not have full ownership rights to their land, but rather only use rights granted

by the local government. The RLCL provides a valuable opportunity to estimate the importance

of land market imperfections in generating misallocation and the potential for property rights

reforms to improve outcomes in the agricultural sector.
    1
    A possible alternative is that the differences do not reflect market failures in developing countries. For
example, low wages in developing countries may not be caused by market failures and may correspond with
labor-intensive, small-scale production being the most efficient market outcome.



                                                                                                            2
       In theory, well-defined property rights over land should facilitate efficiency-improving trans-

actions. In practice, however, the extent to which property rights in land markets matter is

unclear. First, there may be other market failures or constraints that prevent the efficient re-

allocation of land, and which may not (at least in the short run) be relieved by restoring the

missing market for land. Second, the importance of formal rights has itself been questioned in

the literature: some evidence on the role of property rights in agriculture suggests that infor-

mal institutions that adequately substitute for lack of formal land titles and tenure may arise

(Besley 1995, Carter et al 1994, Brasselle, Gaspart and Platteau 2002). However, other pa-

pers suggest an important role for tenancy rights and tenure security in agricultural outcomes

(Banerjee, Gertler and Ghatak 2002, Goldstein and Udry 2008). The impact of formalizing

exchange rights therefore remains an open empirical question.

       Our approach for addressing this question is to exploit variation across provinces in the

timing of their implementation of the central reform that was announced in 2003.2 We collected

novel data on the timing of implementation in each province and use the staggered timing to

identify the impacts of property rights. We combine this information with panel data on input

decisions and output realizations of agricultural households collected from the Chinese Ministry

of Agriculture (called the National Fixed Point Survey or NFP) from 2003 to 2010. In addition

to the long panel dimension, this data set is somewhat rare among agricultural household surveys

in its large sample size and broad geographic coverage.

       We begin our analysis with difference-in-difference estimates of the impact of the reform.

We find evidence of a significant increase in land rental activity following the reform, with the

probability of new renting transactions increasing by about 10% and the area of land rented out

increasing by 7%. At the village level, overall output and the productivity of land also increase

significantly by about 7%.

       While the previous set of results have the advantage of not requiring any assumptions on

the agricultural production process, we are also interested in testing for reallocation of land

across producers and quantifying the extent to which this may be responsible for the observed

improvement in aggregate output and productivity. To examine whether the share of land within
   2
    Deininger and Jin (2009) and Zhao (2014) examine the same property rights reform in China, but they
focus on different outcomes (land reallocations by the government and labor market outcomes, respectively).
Furthermore, their identification is based on a before-after 2003 comparison whereas we utilize the staggered
nature of implementation across provinces.



                                                                                                           3
villages farmed by the more productive farms increases, while the share of land cultivated by

less productive farms falls, we use a production function approach to estimate farmer TFP

after controlling for a variety of inputs.3 We find that the reform increased the amount of land

farmed by relatively more productive farmers, while reducing the amount of land cultivated

by relatively less productive farmers, consistent with the notion that reducing frictions in the

land market should produce a more efficient allocation of land. The results on reallocation are

very similar if we look for land reallocation along the gradient of marginal product of land or

agricultural profits instead of TFP.

    We also observe a corresponding reallocation of labor, which is a complementary input to

land: the amount of hired labor increase on relatively more productive farms but decline on

less productive farms, suggesting a within-village reallocation of labor. Interestingly, we do not

find evidence of labor moving out of agriculture (within the village) or into migration (out of

the local area). We apply a simple decomposition of aggregate productivity to find that nearly

85% of the observed increase in aggregate productivity can be attributed to input reallocations

associated with the reform.

    In addition to their effect on income and productivity, land market restrictions also hinder

farmers’ ability to respond to economic fluctuations. This is an important implication in the

context of the agricultural sector, where agricultural households’ profits and incomes are sensi-

tive to price changes. We examine whether the reduction in land transaction costs due to the

reform allowed farmers to respond better to changes in agricultural prices, an important source

of risk in the agricultural sector.4 We find that an increase in the price of a crop induces greater

reallocation of land toward that crop in the post-reform period (relative to the pre-reform pe-

riod). This result provides some insight into one way in which the reform has reduced frictions

in the efficient allocation of land resources.

    In the context of agriculture in developing countries, ownership and use rights over land are

often poorly-defined and this plausibly affects the ability and incentives of farmers to transact in

land. Our results establish both the importance of land misallocation as a source of productive
   3
     This builds on a large existing literature on agricultural production function estimations. See Gollin and
Udry (2017) for an overview. A concurrent working paper by Adamopoulos, Brandt, Leight and Restuccia (2017)
estimate farm-level production functions in China to examine the misallocation of land and capital. In addition
to examining a later period in China, the approach in our paper is quite different in that we exploit a reform
that aimed to improve the functioning of rural land markets.
   4
     This relates to an existing literature in agricultural economics that estimates the response of yields to crop
prices (see for example, Choi and Helmberger 1993, Houck and Gallagher 1976, Menz and Pardey 1983).


                                                                                                                 4
inefficiency in the agricultural sector, as well as the positive role that well-defined property

rights can have in ameliorating the problem.5

        Our paper constitutes a distinct contribution to the literature on property rights in agricul-

ture that has largely focused on the ability to leverage land as collateral or on the implications of

land tenure for agricultural investments, but has paid relatively less attention to the importance

of exchange rights in achieving a more efficient allocation of land. Studies of the relationship

between exchange rights and efficiency in rural areas are Ravallion and van de Walle’s (2003)

examination of the 1993 Land Law in Vietnam which bundled selling rights with a titling system

and Chen, Restuccia and Santaeulalia-Llopis’ (2017) analysis of leasing behavior and efficiency

in Ethiopia. The approaches of both papers are different from ours. In the absence of data

on agricultural production and data prior to the reform or a control group, Ravallion and van

de Walle (2003) use consumption outcomes to measure efficiency in a counterfactual exercise.

In a concurrent working paper, Chen, Restuccia and Santaeulalia-Llopis (2017) demonstrate a

positive relationship between land leasing and productivity, but in the absence of data prior to

the leasing reform; their analysis requires the assumption that post-reform changes in observed

leasing activity are exogenous to the outcomes of interest.

        The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides detailed institutional background on land

tenure laws and reform in China. Section 3 presents a simple theoretical model that provides

intuition for the empirical analysis. Section 4 presents the empirical analysis, and Section 5

concludes with a discussion of the results.



2        Institutional Background

Beginning in 1979, the Household Production Responsibility System (HRS) was created to dis-

mantle the existing collective organization of agricultural production and to give households

control of farming decisions and output. After 1979, farmers had private use rights to agricul-

tural plots but these land rights were relatively insecure as local governments could reassign

plots until the late 1990s. In 1998, the Land Management Law granted farmers 30-year formal

land contracts from their village governments, providing security of land tenure. This paper
    5
     Our study also contributes to an existing literature that documents sources of inefficiencies related to land
allocation and agricultural production. Udry (1996) studies inefficiencies in the intra-household allocation of land
in Burkina Faso; in contrast, we document inefficiencies in land allocation across agricultural households within
villages.


                                                                                                                  5
focuses on the property rights reform that occurred with the official announcement of the Rural

Land Contracting Law (RLCL) in 2003. In addition to re-iterating the existing policy of 30-

year contracts between village governments and farmers, the RLCL provides farmers the legal

right to rent out and rent in land.6 Prior to 2003, there were instances of informal land rental

agreements, including contracts based on verbal agreements among family and neighbors. The

2003 reform offered legal security to both parties of a leasing contract.7

       Regarding the RLCL, Li (2003) writes, “This landmark law represents the most important

legal breakthrough for securing land rights for China’s 210 million farm households since the

adoption of the HRS.” The RLCL makes no statements about inheritance rights and does not

reverse a prior law’s prohibition of using land rights as collateral. Thus, the main mechanisms

of the RLCL are the decreased threat of expropriation and legal protections offered to rural

households who lease land.

       Summary statistics presented in Zhao (2014) suggest that a large drop in government-led

land adjustments occurred starting 1998 (following the Land Management Law) but that there

was very little change in government-led land readjustments occurring after 2003.8 The share of

villages engaging in major government-led land reallocations was under 4% from 2001 to 2006

and zero in 2007 and 2008.9

       While the central government adopted the RLCL in 2003, it also stated in Article 64, “The

standing committees of the people’s congresses of the provinces, autonomous regions and munic-

ipalities directly under the Central Government may, in accordance with this Law and in light

of the actual conditions of their administrative areas, work out measures for implementation of

this Law.”10 This follows many other market reforms that started after 1978 where the central

how to address land disputes in leasing contracts.
    7
      In cases of disputes over rental contracts and private negotiation between the two parties fail, they can ask
the village or town government to assist in the negotiations. If that fails, either party can initiate arbitration or
a lawsuit in the local court system.
    8
      We reprint Figure 1 from their paper in Appendix Figure A.1. This figure is based on data that were collected
by the author and we do not have access to them. The main data of our analysis (NFP) do not have questions
on perceptions about security or the occurrence of reallocations.
    9
      In later data collected by some of the authors of this paper (Liu, Wang and Wang) from 1930 households
across 22 provinces in 2012, only 2.5% of households had experienced a government land reallocation in the past
five years.
   10
      We discuss a few articles of the central RLCL with Jilin province’s law in 2005 to shed some light on the
scope of changes at the provincial level. Provinces can add regulations; for example, Article 14 of Jilin’s law
states that the county-level and town-level governments must build a database registering the land leases, and
publicize information on this leasing registry. The provincial law can also remove requirements stipulated at the
central level; for example, Article 27 of the central RLCL states a requirement of a two-thirds vote to adjust
contract terms between villagers and the local government in the case of natural disaster, but Jilin doesn’t allow


                                                                                                                   6
government issued general guidelines on the priorities, and local governments were encouraged

to implement and to experiment within the guidelines (Xu, 2011). Thus, we use subsequent

province-level variation in the implementation of the property rights reform. By the end of 2014,

24 provincial governments have made official announcements about the local implementation of

RLCL.11 According to a World Bank (2002) report on land tenure in China, local authorities

are the major obstacle to the implementation of central initiatives over agricultural land tenure.

In a report by Li (2003), a former Chinese representative for the Rural Development Institute

also suggests that local capacity and cooperation are key to the successful implementation of the

RLCL. Thus, we use the dates of the provincial-level implementation of RLCL as the relevant

time in which agricultural households could exercise these new land rights.

    Anecdotal evidence supports the idea that farmers responded to the reform by changing their

leasing behavior and substantially increasing their income. After the law was implemented in

the province of Ningxia in 2015, a newspaper article describes an interview with a farmer named

Xueying Wang: “he rented out all 29 mu of his land to a large-scale farm at the price of 700 RMB

per year. Thus, he can get 19,600 RMB per year from the land, and at the same time, his wife is

working for that farm and she can earn 24,000 RMB per year... His income doubled compared

to the past [before receiving the right to contract out land]” (Ningxia Daily 2015). This case

also highlights the potential changes in the distribution of land within villages following the

reform.

    The number of people potentially affected by changes in rural land institutions in China is

enormous. According to data from the Chinese Statistics Yearbooks, 768 million people were

living in rural areas in China in 2003; this is 60% of the population. Correspondingly, agriculture

remains an important source of employment, representing 49% of total employment.



3    Model

We outline a simple model to provide intuition for the analysis. Consider a village economy

populated by a fixed number of farmers, producing an undifferentiated agricultural commodity

(crop). The price of the crop, denoted by p, is assumed given (i.e. exogenous to production and

consumption decisions in the village); this is a reasonable assumption given that each village is
for re-adjustment in this scenario at all.
  11
     Appendix Table A.1 provides the timing of implementation for each province in our data.


                                                                                                 7
quite small relative to the market for the crop.12

       We assume for simplicity that production depends only on the quantity of land (this as-

sumption will be relaxed in the empirical analysis). Suppose the production function has the

following form:

                                                    y = φlα                                                    (1)

where y denotes the farmer’s output, l denotes the land input, and φ denotes the total factor

productivity (TFP) of the farmer. Each farmer has a fixed level of TFP, which is assumed

to be a random draw from a distribution over the interval [φ, φ]. There are no fixed costs of

production.

       The total amount of land in the village is denoted by L. The endowment of land is assumed

to be independent of TFP.13 For simplicity, we assume that all farmers in the village are endowed

with the same quantity of land. Each farmer decides whether or not to engage in farming the

crop, and how much of her land endowment she will utilize with the remaining land endowment

supplied to the market at the going land rental rate, denoted by r. The land market is local in

the sense that all land transactions are assumed to occur within the village. The rental rate r

is therefore determined by supply and demand within the village.

       To model the effects of land reform, we introduce land market frictions. Assume that farms

that want to rent in land have to pay a transaction cost, which is modeled as a proportional tax,

denoted by t ∈ [0, 1], such that the effective rental price is r(1 + t).14 ,15 The farmer is assumed

to maximize net income (i.e. profit plus rental income).16
  12
     In addition, in Table 9, we also demonstrate that cash crop prices at the province-level in China are strongly
correlated with U.S. prices, suggesting that farmers respond to global prices in these crops.
  13
     This assumption is consistent with the findings of Adamopoulos et al (2017) and is also approximately borne
out in our data. This assumption can be relaxed; our results can be explained by simply assuming that the
distribution of land endowments is such that high TFP farmers are not cultivating more land than optimal in
the pre-reform period.
  14
     In the model presented here, the transaction cost is assumed to be paid by the renter rather than the owner,
but the tax can be shifted with no difference to the final outcome.
  15
     The assumption of a proportional tax can also be motivated as follows: Consider a farmer who rents out an
acre of land at the price r, to be paid at the end of the farming season. In the absence of secure leasing rights,
there is some probability, say π, that she will not get repaid and will be unable to enforce her claim in the court
system because leasing rights are not legally protected. Alternatively, if the main mechanism of the reform is a
reduction in the fear of government reallocation, π can be thought of as the increased probability of expropriation
associated with renting out land. This is similar to the idea that agricultural households fallow their land for
shorter durations because of the concern that fallow land is more likely to be allocated to another household
(Goldstein and Udry 2008). The farmer’s expected rental income is then proportional to the rental price, and is
given by r(1 − π).
  16
     We assume that household consumption and production decision are separable, so that each household acts
as a profit-maximizing farm. Because land is not directly consumed by the household, this assumption is valid,
but will fail if there are also imperfections in other markets (see Singh, Squire and Strauss 1986).


                                                                                                                 8
Figure 1: The relationship between own-cultivated area and TFP for three different values of
the transaction cost




       Appendix A derives the equilibrium in the economy. Figure 1 graphs the associated rela-

tionship between (own-cultivated) area and farmer TFP. The figure also shows two polar cases:

When there are no frictions to trading land (and t = 0), own-cultivated land area is strictly

increasing in TFP, but when t = ∞ each farmer is constrained to farm his own land endowment.

The equilibrium in the intermediate case (with 0 < t < ∞) lies in between the two polar cases.17

The figure indicates that a reduction in the transaction cost will result in a reallocation of land

from low-TFP farmers to high-TFP farmers. This simple prediction can be taken to the data

to test for productivity-improving reallocations following the reform.18

       The essential insight of the misallocation literature is that frictions in factor markets (such

as the land transaction cost in our model) can reduce aggregate productivity by skewing the

allocation of productive inputs away from the most productive individuals. Removing these

frictions will therefore increase aggregate productivity even if no individual firm or producer

becomes more productive (in a TFP sense). To formalize this point in the context of our model,
  17
     The intuition for the intermediate case is that low-TFP farmers will rent out part of their endowment to
high-TFP farmers who will consequently farm more than their endowment, while there will exist a middle range
of TFP in which farmers will neither rent in nor rent out land.
  18
     In theory, if pre-reform land endowments had been too highly skewed toward high-TFP farmers, it might
even be the case that the reform would reallocate land towards low-TFP farmers. As we have noted earlier,
however, this does not appear to be the case in the data.




                                                                                                           9
Appendix A shows that land shares can be cast in the following general form:

                                                           τi θi
                                                     si = P                                          (2)
                                                             τi θi

                                                                                  1                  1
where si = li /L denotes farmer i’s share of village land and θi = φi1−α . Finally, τi = (r/M Pi ) 1−α

can be interpreted as a wedge between the rental price r and farmer i’s marginal product of

land (M Pi ).19 Note that when the transaction cost is removed (τi = 1), the marginal products

are equalized, so that land shares are simply proportional to θi . This formulation mirrors that

of Hsieh and Klenow (2009), in which producers are assumed to face idiosyncratic taxes on

factor usage that result in a dispersion in marginal products. To see how these wedges affect

aggregate productivity, consider the aggregate output of the economy:

                                              X           X             X
                                     Y   =         yi =       φi liα = (  φi sαi )Lα                 (3)
                                               i          i             i
                                         ≡ ΦLα


                          α
                 P
where Φ =           i φi si   can be interpreted as aggregate TFP. This formulation shows that aggregate

productivity Φ depends not only on the individual TFPs, but also on how land is allocated vis-

a-vis TFP, and as equation (2) above shows, this allocation is in turn influenced by the factor

price wedges. It can now be verified that Φ increases when the transaction cost is removed,

confirming the intuitive expectation that land reform will increase aggregate productivity, and

hence aggregate output, even in the absence of any changes in individual TFPs (see Appendix

A).



4         Data

The analysis combines agricultural outcomes and inputs from a household-level panel data set

with a dataset that we assembled on the timing of provinces’ implementation of the RLCL.
    19
         An analogous expression can be derived in the case of multiple inputs into production.




                                                                                                     10
4.1      National Fixed Point Survey

Our primary data source is the National Fixed Point Survey (NFP), a panel survey collected

by the Research Center of Rural Economy (RCRE) of the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture,

beginning in 1986. We use annual waves of data between 2003 to 2010 for data comparability

as the questions and the structure of the survey changed substantially in 2003. For the period

of 2003-2010, our dataset covers more than 19,000 households in 399 villages from 32 provinces.

NFP villages were selected for representativeness based on region, income, cropping pattern,

population, and non-farm activities. The NFP data contain detailed information on household

agricultural production, employment, and income.

       Benjamin, Brandt and Giles (2005) demonstrate that the data are of high quality and provide

a detailed overview of the data. The key advantages of the data for our analysis are the panel

structure and the detailed information on agricultural inputs and outputs at the household-

crop-year level. However, unlike some other data sets of agricultural production, we do not

have any information broken down at the plot level and there are no measures of land quality.

Finally, we do not observe the specific terms of land rental contracts.20

       Summary statistics for the main outcome variables are presented in Table 1. The structure

of the household survey is that some questions are asked at the household level regarding the

past year, while questions on agricultural input and output are asked at the household-crop

level. Panel A provides summary statistics on variables available in the NFP at the household-

year level. The average household in the data cultivates 12.4 mu of land (or about 2 acres). The

survey asks about new renting transactions over agricultural land in the past year.21 About

14% of households engage in new land renting transactions, which includes either renting in or

renting out land.22 For the last years of the data, 2009 and 2010, we also have information

about the amount of land rented out to individuals and to firms. In these years, the amount

of land rented out to individuals is much greater (0.33 mu) than to firms (0.03 mu). Total

household income (from all sources) is on average 29,000 RMB.23
  20
     In other words, we do not see the length of the contract or the payment terms.
  21
     Thus, if a household is renting in land but the contract began two years ago, this flow variable would not
pick it up.
  22
     Land leasing is not spatially concentrated; the NFP data indicate that 81% of village-year observations have
some new household leasing activity in the sample period.
  23
     This is approximately 3600 USD. We convert income and cost variables into real 2002 RMB using a province-
level consumer price index from the Regional Economy Database.




                                                                                                              11
       We have a few measures of labor supply decisions of household members. Unlike most

of the other variables that are asked at the household level, these labor supply questions are

asked for each member of the household, where out of the 365 days of the year, they are asked

the number of days that they worked off-farm (not in agriculture) in the same township, as a

migrant worker and on-farm (in agriculture). We aggregate the individual-level measures for

each household and year. Over half of the household in the sample had at least one individual

engage in migration and 42% of households engaged in off-farm labor in the past year.

       In order to examine the aggregate effects of the reform, we aggregate some measures from

the household-level to the village-level. Panel B presents aggregate agricultural revenue and

aggregate agricultural revenue divided by land. At the village level, the average revenue per

year in the sample is 427041 RMB and 727 RMB per mu.

       In the questions on agricultural production, the survey asks households to report all inputs

and output at the household-crop level.24 In addition to having information on output in terms

of revenue, we also have the physical amount of output (as measured in kilograms). As shown

in Panel C, on average, a household utilizes 4.7 mu of land per crop. This measure includes

both their own land as well as land that they have rented in. They spend 86 RMB per crop

per year on machine costs. Labor inputs, which includes household labor and hired labor,

averages at 68 days per crop. Given the Cobb-Douglas estimation approach, we combine other

agricultural inputs which individually contain many zero values. This includes chemical and

organic fertilizer, pesticides, irrigation, small tools, agricultural covers, animals and other costs.


4.2      Data on the Timing of the Reform Implementation

We collected information on the local province-level implementation of the RLCL that was

passed at the national level in 2003 from several different sources. The main source is PkuLaw,

a database that provides comprehensive coverage of local laws and regulations in China. We use

the following keywords to search in the database: “Tudi Chengbao (land contracting)”, “Tudi

Liuzhuan (land subcontracting)”. For completeness, we also search several other law databases,

including Xihu Law Library (www.law-lib.com), Beijing Zhongtian Nuoshida Technology Com-

pany Law Database (www.law-star.com) and Zhengbao Online Education Company’s database
  24
    These refer to production on land that the household cultivates. If they rent out their land, the inputs and
outputs on land they rent out and do not cultivate are not included.



                                                                                                             12
(www.chinalawedu.com). After this initial search, we read through all of the legal documents

found. For consistency across provinces, we discarded the ones that are issued by governments

below the provincial-level since we focus on province-level variation. Next, we dropped docu-

ments that are issued by departments rather than by the provincial government directly (e.g.

some documents are issued by lower-level provincial departments such as Jiangsu Department

of Agriculture that discuss the implementation of the policy). Finally, we further filter out

documents that are not about the implementation of the RLCL.25 These multiple stages of

filtering leave us with the final set of legal documents that allow us to codify the timing of local

implementation of the 2003 RLCL for each province, summarized in Appendix Table A.1.

       In Appendix Table A.2, we use province-level data from the Chinese Statistical Yearbooks

to examine the question of why some provinces implemented the reform at different times than

others. We estimate an equation where the sample is limited to the periods including the reform

year and the years prior, and the dependent variable is an indicator for the reform year. In

particular, we examine whether variation in urban and rural income and in employment in

different sectors predicts the timing of the reform. The results suggest that increases in urban

income is strongly correlated with the province implementing the reform; a 10% increase in

urban income corresponds with an 8.2% increase in the probability of reform and this estimate

is significant at the 1% level.26 However, with the inclusion of the year and province fixed

effects, the relationship is no longer significant or even positive. Given that we are looking

at the impact of the reform on agricultural outcomes, it is reassuring that rural income and

agricultural employment are not significantly correlated with the timing. These results provide

some reassurance against the idea that agricultural outcomes are directly driving the decision

of the provincial government regarding the reform.


4.3      Crop Price Data

We collected provincial-level agricultural price indices from China Rural Statistics Yearbooks

for the period 2003 to 2010 where the indices are set to 100 for the year 2002. Appendix Figure

A.3 present the average price indices across all provinces for each. Panel A shows the price
  25
     In other words, the keywords appear in the title or the main body, but the document is not about imple-
mentation of the RLCL.
  26
     One possibility is that provincial leaders were hoping that the implementation of the reform would facilitate
rural-to-urban mobility. While our results in Appendix Table 6 suggest this reform did not increase migration
out of the rural areas, it may still be the case that the timing decisions were driven by this motive.


                                                                                                               13
indices (averaged across provinces) for each of the five staple crops and Panel B shows the

corresponding price indices for each of the four cash crops for which we have price data.27 The

figures indicate strong trends in prices over time.28 They also show there is more variation in

the prices of cash crop than staple crops. This is likely because cash crop prices are driven by

global market forces while the Chinese government may intervene to control the prices of staple

crops.



5     Estimating the Impact of the Property Rights Reform

5.1      Effects on Household-level Rental Activity

We begin by examining whether the implementation of the property rights law affected land

renting activity. For this household level outcome, we estimate the following equation for each

household h in province p and in year t:


            yhpt = α + β0 P ostRef ormpt + β1 Ref ormY earpt + γp t + γt + γh + hpt                           (4)


where P ostRef orm is an indicator variable for the years following the implementation of the

reform (not including the reform year itself) and Ref ormY ear equals one in the year that

the reform was implemented in province p.29 In addition to fixed effects for household and

for calendar year, we allow for province time trends (denoted by γp t). The standard errors

are clustered at the province level. This strategy exploits the panel nature of the data and

examines the same households before and after the leasing reform, using the staggering of the

implementation of the reform across provinces.

    In Table 2, the outcome is an indicator for any land renting. The first column includes

the full sample while the second column limits the sample to villages for which we have data

both before and after the implementation of the reform.30 We see a 1.4 to 1.5 percentage point
  27
     There is no price index for hemp, and we do not assign a single price to categories in the NFP data that refer
to several crops such as the ”other staple crops” category.
  28
     In the regressions, we will address this by controlling for linear crop-province-specific trends.
  29
     As shown in Appendix Table A.2, many of the reforms were implemented in October or November of the
calendar year. Given that the reform tended to be implemented late in the year, we separate the effects of the
reform year from the years after the implementation.
  30
     We may not see households both before and after the reform for a variety of reasons mainly due to the
exclusion of observations from provinces that reformed in 2003 and provinces that had not yet reformed by the
end of the sample period. To a lesser extent, the drop in the both sides sample size is also driven by villages
or households being added to the survey sample after the reform in their province, and villages or households


                                                                                                                14
increase in the probability of engaging in land rentals in villages after the implementation of

the reform. Relative to the average rate of land renting, this is a 10% increase. This estimate is

significant at the 5% level in the full sample and at the 10% level when the sample is restricted to

villages for which we have data on both sides of implementation, respectively. This suggests that

the property rights reform allowed households to adjust their land-holdings through renting.

    To look at pre-reform and post-reform trends, we can also estimate a specification that uses

the leads and lags around the implementation:

                                   3
                                   X
                      yhpt = α +          βk Ref ormpt,k + γt + γp t + γh + hpt                (5)
                                   k=−2


where Ref ormpt,k is an indicator variable that indicates the period relative to the reform im-

plementation in the province. Thus, Ref ormpt,−2 refers to two years prior to the year of

implementation and Ref ormpt,2 refers to two years after implementation. The omitted cate-

gory is k = −1. The sample here is restricted to the six waves around the implementation year

in each province. Equation 5 takes advantage of the panel nature of the data to allow us to

test the identification assumption that the timing of the implementation of the reform in each

province is exogenous to our outcomes of interest.

    Figure 2 displays the estimates corresponding to Equation 5.31 We observe a shift in both

the magnitude and significance of the coefficients after the implementation of the reform. Fur-

thermore, there are no significant trends in these outcomes prior to the implementation. This

provides support for the identification assumption that the timing of the implementation of the

reform is not driven by changes in land rental activities in the province.

    The estimated impact of the reform on the amount of leasing may be underestimated in

the main variable used so far, which is an indicator for whether the household engaged in new

leasing contracts. Thus, that measure may miss changes in the intensive margin of land leasing.

We exploit the fact that the survey includes a question on the amount of land rented out to

individuals in the 2009 and 2010 waves. Given that there are only two waves, these regressions

exploit provinces that implement their reforms in 2009 or 2010. Table 3 shows that the reform

led to a 7% increase in the amount of land rented to individuals, and this estimate is significant
attriting from the survey.
  31
     The corresponding table is in Appendix Table A.3.




                                                                                                 15
at the 1% level.32


5.2      Estimation Concerns

A common concern with difference-in-difference estimates is that there are other changes hap-

pening at the same time that are driving the results. For this concern to be valid, the roll out

of the other change across provinces would need to follow the implementation of the RLCL.

The other important law change for rural households around this period is the reduction and

elimination of the agricultural tax.33 All the provinces in our sample began reducing this tax

in 2004. Any aggregate change before versus after 2004 would be removed with the year fixed

effects in our regressions. As an additional robustness check, we included the tax rate which

declines at different rates across provinces starting in 2004 in the regressions and as shown in

Appendix Table A.4, this inclusion has little effect on the magnitude and significance of the

coefficients on the implementation of the RLCL.

       Given that we are interested the reallocation of land within villages, there is a possible

concern with an estimation strategy that uses a representative sample of households in the village

rather than a village-level land census. We might be concerned that land rental transactions

are occurring but that land is being transferred to agricultural firms that are not surveyed in

the household-based survey. A similar concern is that land is being transferred to a very small

number of households, and our sample covering 399 villages includes very few of the households

that are amassing land. Both of these concerns would lead to underestimates in the effects of

the property rights reform on our outcomes of interest.

       We do two things to evaluate whether downward bias driven by the random sample is likely

to be substantial. First, we examine the impact of leasing to agricultural firms by using the

survey question on the amount of land rented out to firms in the 2009 and 2010 waves. Column

2 of Table 3 show a small (1.85%) negative effect on the amount of land rented to firms. Second,

we examine whether the total village-level area of land reported under use by households in the

sample declines. Appendix Table A.5 shows there is no significant change in the area of land

under use in the survey sample. Both results provide reassurance that the downward bias in
  32
      The dependent variable is transformed using the inverse hyperbolic sine (IHS) function. The IHS function
is similar to a logarithmic transformation but is well defined for values of zero. Thus, we use it for continuous
outcomes whose distribution includes preponderance of zeros and a long right tail. We use the logarithmic
transformation for continuous variables without any zeros.
   33
      See Wang and Shen (2014) for more background on the agricultural tax.


                                                                                                              16
our estimates due to household sampling is unlikely to be substantial.


5.3    Effect on Aggregate Productivity and Output

We now examine the predictions of the model on the effect of the reform on aggregate agricul-

tural output and productivity.34 Aggregate output is defined as village-level aggregate revenue;

in this section, we refer to village-level aggregate revenue per mu as aggregate productivity (this

can be interpreted as aggregate yield). We estimate the following equation, where the unit of

observation is village v in province p and year t:


           yvpt = α + β0 P ostRef ormpt + β1 Ref ormY earpt + γt + γp t + γv + vpt                      (6)


and where the standard errors continue to be clustered at the province level. Table 4 presents

the estimates where real village-level revenue and revenue per unit of land are in logarithms.

The point estimate in column 1 indicates that land reform has increased aggregate output by

approximately 7 percent (significant at the 5% level). Unsurprisingly, this is also mirrored in

the aggregate productivity of land (column 2). These are significant gains, albeit more modest

than the potential gains hypothesized in the previous literature (see for example, Restuccia and

Santaeulalia-Llopis 2017).35


5.4    Constructing Total Factor Productivity and Marginal Product Measures

To test the model’s predictions in terms of land reallocation, we first construct measures of

total factor productivity (TFP) and the marginal product of land (MPL) using the detailed

survey information on crop-specific inputs and output. We assume a Cobb-Douglas crop-specific

production function that can be written in logs as follows:


                yicvt = αc log Licvt + βc log Nicvt + γc log Kicvt + δc log Micvt + φicvt                (7)


where yicvt denotes log (physical) output of farmer i growing crop c in village v in year t; Licvt ,

Nicvt , Kicvt and Micvt denote the area, labor days, machinery cost and all other input costs,
  34
     See Appendix Table A.6 for the impact of the reform on household-level income (rather than village-level
revenue).
  35
     However, Gollin and Udry (2017) argue that a significant proportion of the hypothesized gains stem from
measurement errors and unobserved heterogeneity in land quality.


                                                                                                          17
respectively.36 The logarithm of total factor productivity (TFP) is given by φicvt . Consistent

estimation of the parameters of the production function depends on what we assume about

unobserved TFP, because this is likely to be correlated with input decisions (Marschak and

Andrews 1944). We assume that TFP can be decomposed into (i) a fixed farmer-crop component

that captures the farmer’s fixed ability to farm a given crop, (ii) a farmer-year component that

captures time-varying shocks to productivity that are common to all crops grown by the farmer,

(iii) a time-varying component that is common to all farmers in the village that are growing

crop c (for example, weather shocks or pest infestations), and (iv) an idiosyncratic shock that

is specific to the farmer and the crop in a given year:


                                       φicvt = φic + φit + φcvt + eicvt .                                      (8)


    Because farmers grow multiple crops in any given year, we can estimate the regression

specification (Equation 7) jointly for all crops (i.e. we are estimating a single regression in

which the coefficients on inputs are allowed to be crop-specific), while absorbing φic , φit and

φcvt by farmer-crop, farmer-year and village-crop-year fixed effects. The farmer-crop effect φic

absorbs all time-invariant productive characteristics such as farmer education and gender, in

addition to capturing the farmer’s crop-specific productive ability; the farmer-year effect φit

absorbs changes in household composition, health shocks, rainfall shocks, etc; the village-crop-

year component additionally absorbs shocks such as pest infestations which may be crop- and

location-specific. Additionally, assuming that the idiosyncratic component of TFP, eicvt , is

unobserved by the farmer at the time that input decisions are made, the inclusion of these

fixed effects addresses omitted variable bias arising from the dependence of input choices on the

farmer-observed component of TFP.37

    Appendix Table A.8 presents the estimated (crop-specific) production function coefficients.38

On average across all crops (i.e. if we restrict elasticities to be equal across crops), the elasticity

of output with respect to land is 0.47, which is slightly larger than estimates for China obtained
   36
      Appendix Table A.7 shows that input intensity does not change significantly following the reform. This result
isn’t necessary for consistent estimates of the production function, but it is interesting to note that the reform
doesn’t lead to an increase in mechanization.
   37
      Note that the inclusion of farmer-year and village-crop-year fixed effects also absorbs any changes in the
village-level average TFP arising from the land reform, thus allowing us to consistently estimate the production
function while using data on the entire sample period.
   38
      See Appendix Figure A.4 for the distribution of TFP calculated from these production function estimates.



                                                                                                                18
from aggregate data that range from 0.35 to 0.38 (Chow 1993, Cao and Birchenall 2013), al-

though it should be noted that our estimates of elasticities exhibit substantial variation between

crops.

       In Appendix Table A.9, we assess the importance of selection due to entry and exit, by

estimating the production function using a balanced sample of farmer-crop combinations that

span the period 2003 to 2010. The production function coefficients are largely similar to those

obtained before, indicating that selection driven by unobserved productivity shocks is not a

serious problem.

       In Appendix Table A.10, we examine the sensitivity of the estimates to a more stringent

estimation strategy, in which, in addition to the inclusion of the fixed effects described above, the

inputs are also instrumented by their lagged values (Arellano and Bover 1995). This specification

further allows input choices to be correlated with the unobserved eicvt . The coefficient estimates

are generally similar to those obtained under the simpler specification, but are less precisely

estimated and occasionally negative. More importantly for our purposes, the estimated TFP

residuals are highly correlated with the estimated TFPs obtained from the simpler fixed effects

specification, with the correlation coefficient being 0.993. In the analysis that follows, we

therefore work with the TFP estimates derived from the simple fixed effects specification.


5.5      Evidence for Land Reallocation

The model presented in Section 3 leads us to expect that the reform should result in a reallo-

cation of land towards high-TFP farmers. Figure 3 examines this hypothesis descriptively by

graphing total farm area against farm TFP, 2 years prior to and 2 years after reform, where farm

TFP is calculated by averaging TFP over the crops grown by the farmer.39 In the pre-reform

period, farm area correlates weakly with TFP, suggesting that the pre-reform regime may have

been characterized by an inefficient allocation of land. After the reform, as predicted, high-

TFP farmers (those in the top decile of the TFP distribution) cultivate more land following the

reform with low-TFP farmers cultivating less land.40

       We now establish this result more rigorously by testing for within-village land reallocations,
  39
     To average TFP across crops, we use revenue TFP rather than physical TFP, where the former is obtained
by multiplying physical TFP by the farmer-crop-specific price.
  40
     The curves cross at approximately the 90th percentile of the TFP distribution.

where φjic is an indicator for whether the TFP of farmer i growing crop c in year t is in quintile

j of the TFP distribution of village v.41 The dependent variable, licvt , is the logarithm of crop

area. The regressions include village fixed effects and year fixed effects. As before, standard

errors are clustered at the province level. In this regression, the δ coefficients capture the

heterogeneous effects of the reform on crop area with respect to TFP.

          Panel A of Figure 4 graphs the estimated δ coefficients, along with the associated 95%

confidence intervals. The corresponding regression results are reported in Column 1 of Appendix

Table A.11. The reform significantly reduces cultivated area, by approximately 13%, for those

in the bottom two TFP quintiles. These reductions are matched by an increase in crop area in

the top of the TFP distribution, with the majority of the increase occurring in the top quintile.

These results accord well with the descriptive evidence of land reallocation presented in Figure

3.

          A potential concern with the interpretation of these results is that measured TFP has a

time-varying component which could be endogenous to the reform. Thus, the results reported

earlier may be an artefact of compositional changes among the TFP quintiles, instead of re-

flecting an actual reallocation of land.42 To rule out such compositional effects, we estimate

the specification in equation 9, but this time using only the time-invariant component of TFP,

φic , to construct the TFP quintiles, as this component of TFP should not be affected by the

reform. The results are reported in column 2 of Appendix Table A.11 and presented in Panel
     41
     In the Chinese context, it is reasonable to assume that land is not traded across village boundaries, so that
the village is the natural level at which the land market is defined. The quintiles are calculated with respect to
the village TFP distribution aggregated across all years.
  42
     For instance, if the reform increased the TFP of some farmers so as to move them from the fourth to the fifth
quintile, and if these farmers had large amounts of land to begin with, this might increase the average crop area
associated with farmers in the top quintile, even if no actual reallocation were to accompany the increase in TFP.
Changes in measured TFP may also be triggered by increased land transactions: If the land transactions that
occur after the reform systematically transfer either high or low quality plots from low to high TFP farmers, such
transfers would have the effect of changing measured TFP (since land quality is unobserved to the econometrician
and therefore enters into measured TFP).




                                                                                                               20
B of Figure 4. The estimated effects retain similar magnitudes as before, suggesting that our

results are not an artefact of compositional effects.

       In addition to the total land cultivated, we examine whether the reform had heterogeneous

effects by TFP on leasing behavior. Because the outcome variables, the amount of land rented

out to individuals and firms, are asked at the household level, we return to household-level

regressions. Furthermore, the key regressors are the interactions of the quintiles of the fixed

component of TFP (φi ), aggregated up from the household-crop level to the household level, with

the standard reform indicators. Consistent with expectations on the gradient of the relationship,

the results in column 1 of Table 5 show that households with low TFP are more likely to rent

their land out to individuals after the reform than households with high TFP.43 The difference

between the interaction between the post reform year with the lowest quintile and the top

quintile is statistically significant at the 5% level.44 Overall, the results confirm the idea that

the reform allowed land to move from low-TFP farmers to high-TFP farmers.


5.6      Land Reallocation Using Alternative Measures to TFP

Given that the identification of TFP requires a number of assumptions, we examine whether

the results are robust to two alternative measures of productivity: Agricultural profits (per mu)

and the marginal product of land, both measured at pre-reform levels.

       First, we consider whether after the reform, the distribution of land moves towards farmers

who had higher pre-reform agricultural profits per mu. While we have rich information on

agricultural revenue and the cost of inputs at the household-crop level, a key obstacle to this

approach is valuing labor that a household provides on their own land. We take a simple but

standard approach by constructing village-level wage rates using information on the cost and

number of days of hired labor.45 Agricultural profits are then calculated by valuing family labor

inputs at the market wage rate. However, in nearly one-third of villages in our sample, zero

households in the sample hire any labor in the pre-reform years. Thus, we lose a substantial

share of the sample in this approach.
  43
     While high TFP farmers are ultimately cultivating more land (as shown in Figure 4), they also increase the
amount of land that they are renting out. This is consistent with the idea that they are renting in more land
than they rent out (and may be adjusting other characteristics of the land that they are cultivating).
  44
     The interaction between post reform year with the lowest quintile and the second and fourth quintiles are
statistically significant at the 10% and the 5% levels, respectively.
  45
     This ignores the possibility of agency costs in hired labor that are not present in family labor (Eswaran and
Kotwal 1986, Feder 1985).


                                                                                                               21
       We estimate the equation 9 where we replace φjic with an indicator for whether the average

pre-reform agricultural profits of farmer i growing crop c is in quintile j of the distribution in

village v. The coefficients of δj and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals are presented

in Figure 5.46 There is a gradient in the magnitude of the coefficients across the quintiles

suggesting that farmer-crop units with lower pre-reform agricultural profits cultivated less land

after the reform while those in the higher quintiles gained land. However, it is important to

note that none of the coefficient estimates are significant at the standard levels.

       In our second alternative measure, we test whether land is reallocated along the gradient

of marginal productivity (essentially, we would expect that land should be reallocated to those

who are most productive at the margin). We calculate the revenue marginal product of land

(averaged over pre-reform years) for each farmer-crop, and then categorize the latter into quin-

tiles based on the within-village distribution of marginal products.47 We then estimate equation

9 where φjic is now an indicator for whether the pre-reform marginal product of land of farmer

i growing crop c is in quintile j of the distribution in village v.

       The coefficient estimates of δj and 95% confidence intervals are graphed in Figure 6.48

Farmers in the highest quintile of pre-reform marginal product of land gain the most land

(12%) after the reform and this estimate is significant at the 90% level. Farmers in the lowest

quintile cultivate 12% less land after the reform and this estimate is significant at the 5% level.

       While the construction of the measures of pre-reform agricultural profitability and the pre-

reform marginal product of land require different assumptions than the TFP measures, the main

conclusions remain similar. Overall, we conclude that there is robust evidence of land being

reallocated towards more productive farmers.


5.7      Labor Effects

We now consider the effects of the reform on labor market outcomes. To start with, because

labor is a complementary input to land, we would expect that the reallocation of land from low-

TFP farmers to high-TFP farmers would reduce the labor demand of the former and increase

the labor demand of the latter. This is indeed the case, as we show in Table 6, where we examine
  46
     The corresponding regression table is in Column 1 of Appendix Table A.12.
  47
     Under the Cobb-Douglas production function assumption, the marginal product of land equals the average
product of land (i.e. output per unit of land) multiplied by the (crop-specific) elasticity of output with respect
to land.
  48
     Column 2 of Appendix Table A.12 presents the corresponding estimates.


                                                                                                               22
heterogeneity in the response to the reform by TFP quintiles with the dependent variables being

the IHS function of hired labor days (column 1) and hired labor costs (column 2). The results

show that farmers with the highest TFP within a village hire in 22% more days of labor after

the reform and spend 48% more on hired labor after the reform. Farmers in the second highest

TFP quintile use 9% more hired labor after the reform, spending 21% more on hired labor. All

four coefficients are significant at the 1% level. In contrast, those in the bottom two quintiles of

TFP hire significantly less labor after the reform. The anecdotal evidence presented in Section

2 suggests the increased demand for labor among high-TFP farmers may be met by in increases

in wage labor supplied by low-TFP farmers.49

       It is also interesting to examine whether there is an increase in local off-farm (i.e. non-

agricultural) and migrant labor supply on the part of the low-TFP farmers. Table 6 presents

estimates that examine heterogeneity by TFP quintiles with the dependent variables being the

IHS function of off farm labor days (column 3) and the IHS function of migrant labor days in

column 4.50 There are no significant changes in the probability of migration or off-farm labor

activities by TFP after the reform. The lack of evidence of any increases in migration following

the property rights reform may be explained at least in part by the institutional barriers to

migration in China.51


5.8      Decomposing the Productivity Gains from the Reform

The previous evidence suggests that land reallocation may be an important source of aggregate

productivity gains following the reform. We now attempt to quantify the contribution of the

reallocation channel to the observed increase in aggregate productivity. To do so, we consider

the following decomposition of aggregate productivity suggested by Olley and Pakes (1996):

                   X                                 X
           Ivt =       wict φict = E(φict |v, t) +       (wict − E(wict |v, t))(φict − E(φict |v, t))         (10)


where the index Ivt denotes village-level aggregate TFP at time t, and is defined as the output-

share weighted average of log TFPs, with wict denoting the real output-share of the i-th farmer-
  49
     There are no survey questions on labor supplied for agricultural wage work so we cannot test this directly.
  50
     Note that unlike hiring labor inputs which are reported at the household-crop level, these are household-level
regressions because migration is measured at the household level.
  51
     See Kinnan, Wang and Wang (forthcoming) for an overview of the household registration (hukou) system in
China.



                                                                                                                23
crop.52 The aggregate index is decomposed into two components: A component that measures

the productivity of the average farmer-crop, E(φict |v, t), and a covariance term that measures

the extent to which size (measured here by output) is correlated with TFP.53 As Bartelsman,

Haltiwanger and Scarpetta (2013) show, the Olley-Pakes covariance term is a reliable measure

of the efficiency of resource allocation that varies systematically with changes in the economic

regime. Our expectation is that land reform should result in an increase in the Olley-Pakes

covariance, as land gets reallocated from low- to high-productivity farmers.

       We can now estimate reform effects on the separate terms of the decomposition to understand

the source of aggregate productivity growth. Table 7 reports the regression results. The point

estimates indicate an aggregate TFP increase of approximately 9.3% (significant at the 1%

level), which is consistent in magnitude with the observed increase in total output. There is a

significant increase in the covariance term, which accounts for approximately 84% of the increase

in aggregate TFP. The remaining increase in aggregate TFP is attributed to an increase in

average productivity, although this effect is not statistically distinguishable from zero.54 These

results strongly suggest that the effects of land reform on aggregate productivity arise from input

reallocations, in line with the predictions from the theoretical framework outlined in Section 3.

To shed more light on the reallocational flows, we apply a decomposition of covariance term:

                                X
                  cov OP   ≡        (wict − E(wict |v, t))(φict − E(φict |v, t))

                           = N ∗ cov(wict , φict )

                           = N ∗ E[cov(wict , φict |c)] + N ∗ cov[E(wict |c), E(φict |c)]                  (11)


where, to avoid notational clutter, we have now suppressed the conditioning on v and t. The

number of household-crops is denoted by N . The equation above shows that the Olley-Pakes

covariance term can be decomposed into within-crop and across-crop components.55

       Table 8 reports the results from regressing these components on the reform indicators.

The average values of the covariance components are reported at the bottom of the table.
  52
     In order to aggregate TFP across crops, we convert physical TFPs by multiplying by the crop-specific price.
  53
     The “covariance” term in this decomposition is really N times the covariance between output shares and
TFP, where N is the number of household-crops. That is, the decomposition can be seen to be a simple rewriting
of the expression for the covariance between output shares and TFP.
  54
     This shift can also be seen in Appendix Figure A.4.
  55
     This decomposition is sometimes referred to as the law of total covariance.



                                                                                                             24
Column 1 reiterates the results for the full covariance term from the prior table, and columns 2

and 3 display results for the within-crop and across-crop components, respectively. The point

estimates suggest that across-crop reallocation is almost twice as important as within-crop

reallocation.56 This may not be surprising given that in our sample, across-crop covariance is

on average much smaller than within-crop covariance (shown in the bottom row), signaling a

distortion in the (aggregate) mix of crops. It appears therefore that an important source of

productivity gain from the reform arises from a correction of this distortion.



6         Responses to Price Changes

Land reform may not only correct the allocation of land in a static sense, but may also increase

the responsiveness of land allocation to productivity shocks. In this section, we consider relative

price changes (across different crops) as a particular type of shock. The idea that the land reform

may have increased farmers’ ability to respond to such shocks is also suggested by our finding

that there is more across-crop reallocation following the reform. We examine this hypothesis

by examining the effect of crop price changes on the allocation of land across crops before and

after the reform.

         Specifically, we estimate the following equation for a crop c in household h, village v, province

p and year t:


                      Yhcvpt = α + β0 P ricecp,t−1 ∗ P ostRef ormpt + β1 P ricecp,t−1 ∗ Ref ormY earpt +

β2 P ostRef ormpt + β3 Ref ormY earpt + β4 P ricecp,t−1 + β5 OtherP ricecp,t−1 ∗ P ostRef ormpt +

                 β6 OtherP ricecp,t−1 ∗ Ref ormY earpt + β7 OtherP ricecp,t−1 + νcp t + γt + γvc + hcvpt (12)


The lagged province-level crop price index is given by P ricecp,t−1 . This variable is a provincial

level crop-specific price index where each crop price in 2002 is set as 1. We use a one-year lag

for multiple reasons. Agricultural decisions are often months in advance of harvest in which

case the relevant price on which farmers can make planting decisions is from the prior year.
    56
     This result stands in contrast with findings from the firm literature, where within-industry reallocation tends
to dominate (e.g. Davis and Haltiwanger 1999, Foster, Haltiwanger and Krizan 2001), but the present setting
differs not only in that we are studying the agricultural sector which may exhibit fundamentally different patterns
of reallocation from the manufacturing sector, but also in that we are arguably studying a transition between
steady states.



                                                                                                                 25
This also sidesteps the issue that contemporaneous prices may reflect endogenous agricultural

production decisions. We also include an aggregate index of prices in all of the other crops

(excluding crop c), OtherP ricec,t−1 , and its interactions with the timing of the reform. The

regressions also include year fixed effects, province-crop time trends and household fixed effects.

All of the regressions are clustered at the province level. The outcomes here are those that are

measured at the household-crop-year level by the survey.

   We also estimate the equation with the leads and lags around the implementation of the

reform:

                   3
                   X
     Yvcpt = α +       (βk P ricecp,t−1 ∗ Ref ormpt,k + ηk Ref ormpt,k ) + δ1 P ricecp,t−1 +
                   k=−2
      3
      X
          (θk OtherP ricecp,t−1 ∗ Ref ormpt,k + µk OtherP ricecp,t−1 ) + δ2 P ricecp,t−1 +
     k=−2
                                                                     νcp t + γt + γh + hcpt   (13)


where Ref ormp,t+k is an indicator variable that indicates the period relative to the reform

implementation in the province. In these regressions, the sample is restricted to the six waves

around the implementation of the reform. The reference year is the one prior to the reform

implementation (t = −1).

   A key concern with these regressions is whether local agricultural prices are exogenous to the

reform. To address this, we present all of our crop-level estimates for both the full sample and

the cash crop only sample. The all crop sample offers the advantage of presenting a full picture

of the agricultural portfolio and decision-making of agricultural households. However, there

may be some concerns about staple crops in this analysis. First, if the Chinese government

sometimes intervenes in these markets, agricultural production decisions in these crops may

be less likely to be driven by market dynamics and market prices (Deng 2009). Second, we

may have some concerns that the timing of the reform at the provincial level responds to local

economic conditions, which are largely defined by output in staple crops. Third, we may be

concerned about the reverse, that crop prices are driven by the reform. Given that we are

exploiting variation in prices of nine different crops that are not that highly correlated with

each other, it seems unlikely that the results are driven by the endogeneity of prices to the

reform.


                                                                                                26
    However, we address this concern by demonstrating that cash crop prices are likely to be

exogenous to the timing of the reform by estimating the relationship between crop prices in

Chinese provinces and in the United States. In Table 9, the dependent variable in column 1

is the price of the four cash crops in Chinese provinces for which we have price data (oilseed,

sugar, cotton, and tobacco). The dependent variable in column 2 is the price of the five staple

crops. The results in column 1 indicate that price movements for cash crops in China move

closely with changes in U.S. prices, suggesting that much of the variation in these prices is driven

by global markets rather than by agricultural investment decisions of households in China. In

contrast, the Chinese prices for staple crops do not move that closely with U.S. prices. Thus,

we look at the estimates of Equations 12 and 13 for a sub-sample of only cash crops, which are

more plausibly exogenous, in addition to the full sample of all crops.

    The all crops sample includes both staple crops, which are corn, potato, rice, soybean and

wheat, and cash crops.57 For cash crops, we focus on four available in the data, cotton, sugar,

oilseed, and tobacco. We exclude fruits and vegetables products, which are also cash crops,

from the analysis because the NFP data lumps production questions on all fruits into one single

category and all vegetables together so we are unable to match these broad categories to a

single agricultural price. We also do not have price data for hemp, so we exclude this from the

crop-level analysis.58


6.1    Results on Price Changes

In Table 10, we estimate equation 12 where the outcomes are different measures of land used for

cultivation of cash crops. The dependent variable in columns 1 and 2 is the inverse hyperbolic

sine function of the land cultivated for each crop, while it is an indicator for any land cultivated

for each crop in columns 3 and 4. In both the all crops sample (column 1) and the cash

crops sample (column 2), we see that the reform leads to more land under cultivation of a

specific crop in areas with positive changes in prices of that crop in the years after the reform is

implemented.59 In the sample including all crops, a standard deviation increase in the price of

a crop (0.45) corresponds with a 1.7 percent increase in the area in the village allocated to that
  57
     We follow the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture’s definition of what constitutes a staple crop versus a cash
crop.
  58
     As shown by the number of observations in Appendix Table A.8, there is much less activity in hemp relative
to all the other crops.
  59
     This is given by the coefficient β0 in Equation 12.


                                                                                                            27
crop after the reform relative to before the reform. The estimate is significant at the 5% level.

In columns 3, we also see a 1.2 percent increase in the probability that any land in the village

is used for production in that crop corresponding to a standard deviation change in crop price,

and these estimates are significant at the 5% level. Column 2 and 4 show that the magnitude

of responses to prices is similar for the sample of cash crops as for all crops and these estimates

are significant at the 10% level.

    In all of the specifications, the impact of price changes in the year of implementation (β1 )

is positive but not significantly different than in the years prior. Furthermore, the magnitudes

of the estimates are much smaller as compared with the estimates for the following years.

Finally, the coefficients on lagged price are positive, indicating that there was reallocation of

land towards crops experiencing price increases prior to the reform.60 However, the interactions

discussed above show that the price response increased following the protection of property

rights.

    In the estimates of equation 13 presented in Appendix Table A.13, we see the sign and the

significance of the coefficients shift immediately following the implementation of the reform for

both the all crops sample and the cash crops sample. These results suggest that by allowing

land to be legally rented across villagers, households are better able to optimize the amount of

land devoted to the production of different crops in response to price changes. Furthermore,

the similarity of the estimates and significance of the coefficients between the full sample and

the cash crop sample in Table 10 and Appendix Table A.13 suggest that it is unlikely that an

endogenous relationship between crop prices and the timing of the reform is driving the results.



7     Conclusion

Despite a unique history and set of land institutions, agricultural production in China is typical

of a number of developing countries in many important aspects. The median farm is small

(approximately 1.3 acres), and is largely operated using household labor. Therefore, this is an

instructive setting in which to study the effects of easing land market frictions.

    Our paper emphasizes the importance of property rights institutions for the efficient alloca-

tion of land across farmers and of labor across sectors and space. By exploiting provincial-level
  60
     These estimates are significant at the 10% level or less for the all crop sample, and not significant at the
standard levels in the cash crop sample.


                                                                                                              28
variation in the implementation of a central reform in China that formalized leasing rights, we

are able to evaluate the impact of the rural land reform. We find that the reform increases

leasing transactions and led to increases in agricultural output of over 7%. We argue that these

gains can be attributed to a better allocation of land resources. While this is in line with the-

oretical predictions, empirical evidence has been scant. For example, Besley (1995) finds that

rental and sale rights have no significant effect on agricultural investments in Ghana.

       While our estimates of the effect of the reform on output and aggregate productivity are

economically significant, they are considerably more modest than those implied by other stud-

ies. Adamopoulos, Brandt, Leight and Restuccia’s (2017) study of misallocation in Chinese

agriculture suggests that moving to an efficient allocation of land and capital would increase

village-level productivity by 50%, while Restuccia and Santaeulalia-Llopis’ (2017) study of mis-

allocation in Malawi implies potential efficiency gains of more than 300%. One potential expla-

nation for this discrepancy is that the RLCL has not succeeded in entirely removing all frictions

in the land market in China, so that substantial gains remain yet to be realized. At the same

time, it is also possible that the diagnostic measures of misallocation used in the literature

tend to overstate the extent of misallocation, at least when they are applied to the agricultural

sector, a point that is emphasized by Gollin and Udry (2017).61

       In many developing countries, much emphasis continues to be placed on land structures

with communal ownership or on policies that aim for equality in the distribution of land across

farmers rather than on allowing free exchange in land markets. Indeed, households still do not

have the right to sell property in China.62 Our research demonstrates that households cannot

fully solve the contracting problem in informal ways and that legal protections for exchange

rights are important for the efficient allocation of resources, including land and labor. An

important related question, that we leave for future research, is the potential trade-off between

efficiency and equity accompanying such changes in institutions.

     See also Bils, Klenow and Ruane (2017) and Rotemberg and White (2017) who show, in the context of man-
ufacturing data, that measurement error and data inconsistencies tend to inflate the importance of misallocation.

     Similarly, the law does not allow for leasing or sales rights over grazing land in Mongolia.

A     Extended Model

We first describe the equilibrium in the intermediate case (0 < t < ∞) of the village economy.

It is intuitive that the size of each farm (i.e. cultivated land area) will depend on the farmer’s

TFP. Figure A.5 graphs the marginal cost and marginal product of land, for low-, medium- and

high-TFP farmers, denoted by φ1 , φ2 and φ3 respectively. The kink in the marginal cost occurs

when farmers need more land than their own endowment (and thus need to rent in land from

others).

       Figure A.5: Marginal Cost and Product of Land for Farmers with Varying TFP




    As the figure implies, an equilibrium will feature three categories of farmers, based on their

level of TFP, as depicted in Figure A.6: More specifically, we have farmers in category A for

whom φ ∈ (φ, a). These farmers will supply some of their land to the market and use the rest in

their own farm (but will not rent in any land). These farmers are not land-constrained: Their

optimal farm size is small enough that they can meet its land needs with their endowment.

Thus, these farms are using only household land up to the point that its marginal product

(denoted by M PL in the figure above) equals its opportunity cost, r.

    Category B farmers are defined by φ ∈ (a, b), those with TFP above the level a would ideally

like to operate larger farms that utilize more land than they are endowed with. Once the land

endowment has been exhausted, however, the opportunity cost of land increases discontinuously



                                                                                               56
                          Figure A.6: Thresholds Defining Three Types




because of the transaction cost. Because of this jump, some farmers will not find it profitable to

rent in land. For these farms, the marginal product is greater than r, but is less than r(1 + t),

implying that they would have rented in land in the absence of a transaction cost.

   Finally, in category C, we have the farmers who are productive enough that they find it

worthwhile to rent in land in spite of the transaction cost. Their TFP lies in the interval (b, φ).

Farmers in this category rent in land until its marginal product equals its marginal cost r(1 + t).

   We now derive aggregate (village-level) TFP. Recall that aggregate output is given by:

                                        X          X
                                  Y =       yi =       φi sαi Lα = ΦLα                        (14)
                                        i          i


where L denotes the total quantity of land in the village (which is assumed fixed), and si denotes

the land share cultivated by farmer i, i.e. li /L. Equilibrium land shares can be derived from

the first-order conditions for profit maximization:


                                             αφi liα−1 = ri                                   (15)


where ri denotes the equilibrium marginal value of land for farmer i. For farmers who are at a

corner solution, ri is defined to equal the marginal product of land. The first-order condition

can be rewritten to solve for li :

                                                  α 1
                                            li = ( ) 1−α τi θi                                (16)
                                                  r

                              1                                     1
where τi is defined as ( rri ) 1−α and we have defined θi = φi1−α . Adding over all farmers in the

village, we have:

                                             α 1 X
                                        L = ( ) 1−α τi θi                                     (17)
                                             r
                                                         i


                                                                                                57
   Farmer i0 s land share is therefore given by:

                                              τi θi
                                        si = P                                            (18)
                                                τi θi
                                               i


Thus, aggregate TFP simplifies to:

                                                 τ αθ
                                                Pi i α

Finally, note that because τi ≤ 1 for all i and α < 1, it follows that

                                   τ αθ             τθ
                                Pi i α ≤         P i αi α = [

                               ( τi θi )        ( τi θi )

which confirms the intuitive expectation that land reform will increase aggregate productivity,

and hence aggregate output.
