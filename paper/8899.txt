                                              ABSTRACT


        We examine the recent increase in hospital advertising expenditures. We first illustrate that the
rise in hospital advertising has not been universal. Large, not-for-profit, teaching hospitals have, by far,
experienced the largest increase in spending. Adjusting for size, for-profit hospitals over this period have
actually decreased their marketing expenses. This increase in advertising spending is best explained by
managed care penetration. There is a small and marginally significant relationship between increases in
for-profit presence in hospital markets and an increase in advertising spending by the not-for-profit
hospitals in those markets.

Introduction


         Advertising is a pervasive component of many product markets in the United States, from

soda to real estate to clothing. Until recently, the providers of health care in America had been

conspicuously absent in this activity. In fact, for a great deal of the last century, advertising by

physicians and hospitals was explicitly banned by their respective professional organizations. In

the American Medical Association’s first code of ethics, it was written that “[advertising is]

highly reprehensible in a regular physician.”1

         Although still relatively small compared with other industries2, advertising among

hospitals has increased dramatically in recent years. Figure 1 shows average advertising

expenditures among hospitals in the United States from 1995-1998. Of the roughly 5,000 acute

care hospitals in the United States, 1,800 advertised in 1995. Among those hospitals, the average

advertising budget was $79,000. By 1998, 2,500 hospitals advertised, and the average spending

among those hospitals had increased by 56% in real dollars to $123,000 per hospital.3 Over this

same period, average hospital expenditures increased by only 10% in real terms.4 Figure 2

illustrates the increase in participation in advertising for hospitals over this time period. Less than

40% of hospitals advertised in 1995, compared with a little more than half by 1998.

         Average advertising spending across all hospitals masks the most dramatic increase.

Figure 3 breaks out the hospitals into five categories: not-for-profit teaching hospitals, other not-

for-profit hospitals, for-profit hospitals, religious hospitals, and public hospitals. Figure 3

illustrates that the true source of the overall advertising increase among American hospitals has

been the not-for-profit teaching hospitals. The spending levels in figure 3 are adjusted for bed

size, so that any differences in ad spending due to differences in hospital size are removed. The

average not-for-profit teaching hospital has increased its bed-adjusted ad expenditures by 140%.

For-profit hospitals, however, have actually decreased their spending in real terms over this time.

           In this paper, we examine the underlying cause of this rapid increase in advertising

among hospitals. We utilize a panel data set of hospital and market characteristics along with a

unique data set of hospital advertising expenditures. In the end, a critical component of the

explanation is the rise of managed care across the country. Those hospitals – and in particular the

large, teaching hospitals – in markets that have experienced the greatest rise in managed care

influence, had the most rapid increase in advertising.

           The paper continues as follows. The next section discusses the history of hospital

advertising along with a discussion of the economics behind advertising for hospitals. The third

section presents various hypotheses as to why hospitals would have changed their advertising

behavior at this time. In the fourth section, we discuss the data. The next to last section presents

the empirical results, and the final section concludes.



The History and Economics of Hospital Advertising



           One basic model of health care consumption in the United States involves patients

depending on their physician as a well-informed, benevolent agent. When a patient needs to

receive treatment in a hospital, the physician suggests the course of treatment and the hospital in

which it will be done. Within this view of medical care, advertising direct to patients can play

very little positive role, and may, in fact, be detrimental to patient outcomes.

           If the advertising signals lead the patient to disagree with the well-informed, benevolent

physician, then the patient may seek alternative treatments. This may positive if the physician

was not fully informed, or if the physician was not truly acting in the patient’s best interest. But

if the physician was truly acting in the patient’s best interest, then the patient will only disagree

                                                                                                        2
with the physician’s choices when the advertising is false and the patient is unable to determine

its veracity. This appears to have been the argument behind the restriction of advertising by

hospitals and physicians for the bulk of the twentieth century.

        In 1847, when the AMA discussed advertising in its Code of Ethics, the concerns focused

on exaggerated or outright fictitious claims perpetrated by some supposed healers. Until the late

1970s, the American Medical Association (AMA), as well as the American Hospital Association

(AHA) explicitly banned advertising for its members. A successful Federal Trade Commission

suit in 1980 made advertising a legal, if not accepted, part of medical care. Prior to the final

decision, the AHA had already decided to allow some regulated advertising for its member

hospitals, as long as the “truthful” advertising was not done at the “expense of the competitor.”

(Rosenstein 1985) Even now the AMA is careful to remind its members that although there are

no restrictions on advertising, there is a concern that the public will be easily “deceived” and that

information transmitted to the public should done in a “readily comprehensible manner.”5



Not-for-Profit Hospitals and Advertising



        Prior to the recent upsurge in advertising, not-for-profit hospitals historically engaged in

less advertising than their for-profit counterparts. Figure 3 shows that at the beginning of our

sample in 1995, not-for-profits advertised less than for-profits, adjusting for the size of the

hospital. The anecdotal evidence, and the fact that the AMA and the AHA had so long banned

the practice, suggests that not-for-profits had never relied on advertising in the hospital industry.

The non-reliance on advertising among not-for-profit hospitals has several possible explanations.

        A situation in which not-for-profits all choose to do little advertising requires some

degree of collusion among the market participants. Two facts about not-for-profit hospitals may

help the hospitals collude not to advertise: first, not-for-profits are typically thought to have more




                                                                                                        3
complicated objective functions than the typical profit-maximizing for-profit hospital, and second

once a not-for-profit generates profits it is restricted in how those profits are distributed. Both of

these facts may make it easier to reach a collusive agreement in which the hospitals are

essentially agreeing not to attempt to increase profits.

           There are many theories that suggest that the managers at not-for-profits may care less

about profits, and are instead concerned with the provision of public goods, such as charity care

and research (Weisbrod, 1988), or are concerned with providing high quality care (Hansmann,

1996). In those theories, hospital managers may not advertise because the increased profits that

the advertising brings are not the core concern of those operating the organization. The non-

distribution constraint also may create less of an incentive for management to increase profits,

since there are no official owners to distribute the money.

           Additionally, the managers at not-for-profits may simply feel that advertising, in its own

right, is not an honorable activity. This is consistent with the historical view of the AMA and the

AHA. Hospital managers may like profits, because they help the hospital provide all of the

services they want to provide, but some methods of achieving that profitability are simply not

worth the moral cost.

           Finally, not-for-profit managers may enjoy spending their time on activities other than

marketing and advertising. Without the pressure to do all that is necessary to maximize profits,

perhaps the managers would simply prefer to use their time to do other things – i.e. focus on

medical services, research, etc. Whichever reason was the principle reason behind the historically

low level of advertising among hospitals prior to the 1990’s, something has occurred to change

the reality in the healthcare marketplace.

Theories of Advertising Changes



        There are several possible explanations for the current rise in hospital advertising. The

first possibility is the unraveling from one equilibrium – where few hospitals advertise – to

another – where many hospitals advertise. Perhaps all hospitals, particularly the large teaching

hospitals, would do little advertising as long as all of the other hospitals follow suit. Once that

equilibrium begins to unravel, it will unravel quickly, hence the rapid increase in advertising.

        Another hypothesis may be that the not-for-profit hospitals have undergone a

fundamental change in their objectives. One explanation as to why hospitals have historically

done so little advertising, as we indicated above, is that marketing is unbecoming for a not-for-

profit institution – hence the statement in the code of ethics. The corollary to that idea is that

marketing is a perfectly acceptable activity for an organization concerned with profits. Perhaps

advertising is increasing because for-profit hospitals and their ethics are becoming more dominant

in today’s hospital market. This hypothesis leads to two predictions. First, for-profit hospitals

should advertise more than not-for-profits, and second, that advertising should increase more

rapidly for not-for-profit hospitals that have more contact with for-profit competitors.

        Another explanation is that hospitals and their executives are more willing to engage in

activities, such as advertising, that were once shunned because the new financial realities in

health care have made them necessary. If the financial strains become large enough, the choice

for the hospital can be to stay open and advertise, or not to advertise and close or curtail valued

activities. The financial situation for hospitals has gradually deteriorated through the 1980s and

1990s as reimbursements from government and private payers have decreased. In addition to

price reductions, hospitals have experienced a steady decline in admissions and inpatient days.

This decline has been caused by both technological improvements that render some inpatient

procedures obsolete (cataract surgery) or have greatly reduced the length of stay for other

procedures. In addition, hospitals have faced pressures form managed care organizations to


                                                                                                      5
reduce lengths of stay. The result has been that inpatient days in U.S. hospitals have fallen by

roughly 35% over the last twenty years.6

           A final hypothesis is that changes in the market structure and the manner in which

hospital reimbursements are determined have resulted in an increased return to advertising.

Perhaps the return to hospital advertising had historically been very low, and the hospital

executives chose not to advertise because they had little to gain. If the marketplace changes such

that there are significant gains to be had by advertising, then hospital managers will begin to

advertise.

           One major change in the health care market structure over the last twenty years has been

the rise of managed care. In 1998, Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) provided health

insurance to roughly 30% of the U.S. marketplace.7 Only 4 years earlier, that percentage had

been less than 20%. Twenty years ago, that percentage was essentially zero. HMOs reduce

health care costs, at least in part, by negotiating lower reimbursement rates with providers. They

achieve leverage in those negotiations by only offering a subset of a market’s providers in their

ultimate network. It is the threat to leave a provider out of the network that provides HMOs with

their power.

           In a market with managed care organizations, advertising can potentially provide

leverage to the providers. To the extent that providers can render themselves indispensable in the

eyes of the patients, then the threat for managed care companies to leave them out of the networks

is much more empty. In the extreme, if an insurer has very little chance of being able to sell a

product that lacks one key hospital, then that hospital has all of the power in setting the

reimbursement fees. Advertising direct to patients may be a tool for the hospitals in creating this

sense of necessity. To the extent that advertising plays this new role in the negotiation process

between hospitals and managed care, then the rise of managed care has increased the returns to

advertising.

        In the sections that follow, I test several of the hypotheses outlined above. Given the

large variation across hospitals and hospital markets, it is possible to test each of the hypotheses

empirically. The change in objective function hypothesis can be tested using variation across

markets in the influence of for-profit hospitals. In particular, those markets that have experienced

the greatest increase in for-profit influence should experience the greatest impact on the

objectives of the other hospitals in the market.


        • Change in Objective Function Hypothesis: Not-for-profit hospitals with more
        and increasing contact with for-profit hospitals will advertise more.


        The financial distress hypothesis can be tested using variation in financial performance

across hospitals, and with differences in market structure changes across markets. Theoretically,

if the financial distress story is driving the change in hospital advertising, then hospitals that

experience more financial distress should advertise more. The alternative story is that hospitals

with less money will do less of everything, including advertising.


        • Financial Distress Hypothesis: Hospitals in financial distress will respond by
        increasing advertising expenditures


        The penetration of HMOs into markets is a form of financial distress for hospitals. This

means that the relationship between HMO penetration and hospital advertising will combine two

effects: the effect of financial distress and the effect of HMO presence on the returns to

advertising. Empirically, it is possible to disentangle these two effects if the returns to

advertising do not change universally for all hospitals.

        In the returns to advertising hypothesis, advertising by hospitals would focus on hospital

quality, in order to create the sense of necessity among the patients. Some hospitals, particularly

those that are large or are teaching hospitals, may be more credible in their advertising than


                                                                                                       7
others. Those hospitals for which their high-quality claims are more believable should increase

their ad spending more than those hospitals for which their claims are less credible. The

empirical test is then whether hospitals that are more likely to be credible (teaching and large

hospitals) increase their advertising by more in response to HMO penetration than other hospitals.


        • Increased Returns to Advertising Hypothesis: More credible hospitals in
        markets with higher HMO penetration should respond with more advertising than
        other hospitals.


         I will not focus directly on the initial hypothesis – that the increase in advertising is due

to an equilibrium shift from no advertising to everyone advertising. If none of the other

hypotheses were to be supported in the data, then the cascading equilibrium theory could be the

explanation. Even if the other hypotheses prove to have some validity, it is impossible to prove

that some form of equilibrium cascade did not occur. For instance, in the data, it appears that

large teaching hospitals responded to increased HMO penetration by increasing ad spending.

That provides support to the increasing returns hypothesis, and it may also be true that once some

teaching hospitals decided to advertise, many others decided to follow. More generally, it may be

that any of the other hypotheses can act as triggers in creating a cascade from one equilibrium to

another. Additionally, if not-for-profit hospitals were not advertising before because their lack of

concern for profits made collusion easier, then any change (in objective function, financial

distress, increased pressure from insurers) that would increase their concern for profits could lead

to an equilibrium cascade.



Data



        The data we employ in this paper comes from four sources: the American Hospital

Association (AHA), the Medicare Cost Reports, Interstudy, and VoiceTrak. Each source

provides a panel of data across U.S. hospitals from 1995-1998. The AHA data contains


                                                                                                         8
information on hospital ownership, size and location. The AHA data is also used to generate data

characterizing a hospital’s market, including information on the number of competitors. The

Medicare data contains financial information for the hospitals, including revenues, expenses and

income numbers. The Interstudy data provides the data on HMO penetration over time at the

Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) level.

        VoiceTrak is the source for the hospital advertising data. VoiceTrak surveys roughly

11,000 media outlets each year, achieving a response rate of over 85% by offering the

respondents some of the survey results. VoiceTrak surveys radio, print and TV outlets and

compiles an annual advertising spending number for each firm, including hospitals. The

VoiceTrak data was merged with the other data sources to create a panel of roughly 5,000

hospitals over four years. Any advertising expenditures attributed to hospital holding companies

or hospital networks were distributed among the member hospitals in the market according to size

to the amount possible. The network and affiliation data in the AHA is far from complete. To

the extent that some expenditures are not distributed, that should dampen the advertising numbers

for hospitals more likely to be in networks.



Empirical Results



        The first hypothesis as to why hospital advertising has increased in recent years is that the

objectives of the hospitals have changed. In order to test this, we first examine whether hospitals

of different ownership types in fact exhibit different behavior with respect to marketing. If the

difference in advertising expenditures is caused by differences in objectives, then that is

presumably driven by not-for-profits having an objective function that differs from profit

maximization. Most of the differences that would be proposed, such as ethical concerns, should

lead to not-for-profits advertising less than for-profits. If the objectives of the hospitals are

changing, then not-for-profits should behave more like for-profits through time.


                                                                                                    9
        Table 1 presents results of a simple least-squares regression to illustrate the average

advertising behavior by hospital types. The following regression is estimated:



(1) AdSpending h ,t = α + γ t + β 1 * Beds + FPh ,t + Pubh ,t + Teachh ,t + ε h ,t




        The regression includes the VoiceTrak advertising expenditures as the dependent

variable. The number of hospital beds as well as dummy variables indicating hospital ownership

type are included on the right hand side.

        The results help illustrate that the general pattern is not entirely consistent with the

change in objectives hypothesis. If the hypothesis is correct, for-profits should advertise more

than not-for-profits, but the relationship should narrow over this period of time while advertising

spending is increasing so rapidly. In the regressions, the omitted hospital category is non-

teaching, not-for-profit hospitals. The regression in column 1 shows that over the whole time

period, for-profits do advertise more than not-for-profit, non-teaching hospitals and public

hospitals, but less than teaching hospitals. The difference between for-profits and non-teaching

not-for-profits is not significant at standard levels of significance.

        The regression in column 2 presents results with each hospital type interacted with the

year effects. These results highlight the regime shift in hospital advertising that was evident in

figure 3. By the end of the period, for-profit hospitals advertise significantly less than all not-for-

profit hospitals, and the teaching hospitals have increased their advertising expenditures

significantly.

        Again, this result is a little too strong for the change in objectives hypothesis, since the

not-for-profits not only begin to advertise as much as the for-profits, but even surpass them. It is

possible that a change in objectives could still be a driver behind the rise in advertising if it were

true that the returns to advertising are higher for the not-for-profits and the teaching hospitals, in




                                                                                                       10
particular. Then once all hospitals are comfortable advertising, the not-for-profits would actually

do more, not just the same amount.

        Another test of the change in objectives hypothesis is to see whether hospitals that

interact more with for-profit hospitals advertise more. The assumption behind this theory is that

not-for-profit hospitals have historically had an ethic of not advertising, while for-profit hospitals

have not felt restricted with respect to marketing. As not-for-profit hospitals increasingly interact

with for-profits, they may begin to absorb some of their behaviors. In table 2, the following

fixed-effects regression is estimated:



(2) AdSpending h ,t = α h + γ t + β 1 * FPMktShareh ,t + β 2 * X h ,t + ε h ,t




        Again, the advertising expenditures are the dependent variable. Year and hospital fixed

effects are included on the right hand side along with other hospital and market characteristics

including; ownership status (for-profit, public, religious), teaching status, hospital occupancy rate,

net income, and whether the hospital is a local monopoly (no other hospital within ten miles).

The key variable of interest is the percentage of hospital beds in the hospital’s ten-mile market

that are in for-profit hospitals – the for-profit market share. This variable, as well as interactions

of this variable with the various ownership types, are included in the regression. The hypothesis

is that as a hospital is increasingly interacting with for-profit hospitals, the more likely that

hospital is to begin behaving as a for-profit.

        The results are presented in table 2. The only difference between columns 1 and 2 is that

teaching status is not included in the first regression. The coefficient on for-profit market share,

86,845, represents the impact of increased for-profit market share on the omitted category, non-

teaching, not-for-profit hospitals. This coefficient is marginally significant and positive, but the

magnitude is small relative to the overall change in advertising. The result suggests that an




                                                                                                     11
increase in for-profit market share of 10% leads to an increase in advertising of $8,600. The

average change across hospitals in for-profit market share from 1994-1998 is less than 1%. The

standard deviation is 15%, so there were some hospitals that experienced a significant increase in

for-profit influence. The effect for teaching hospitals is essentially zero. Since the largest

increase in hospital advertising over this time period has been from large, teaching hospitals, the

impact of for-profit hospitals does little to explain the general trend.

         The coefficients on net income and occupancy rate are not significantly different from

zero. This is the first test of the financial distress hypothesis. The regressions in table 2 provide

no evidence that tougher financial conditions lead to an increase in advertising.

         Table 3 presents results on the relationship between HMO penetration and hospital

advertising. These results provide insight into both the financial distress and change in returns to

advertising hypotheses. At one level, an increase in HMO penetration is a negative financial

shock to hospitals. This may affect advertising in either direction. The financial distress

hypothesis suggests that the rise in advertising may be due to increasing financial strain on

hospitals. Alternatively, a strain on hospital budgets may require a decrease in all types of

spending, including advertising. At another level, the presence of HMOs in the market may

increase the returns to advertising. This affect may differ across hospitals, as some hospitals may

have more credibility in their claims of high quality. The regressions in table 3 estimate the

following regression:



(3) AdSpend h ,t = α h + γ t + β 1 * FPh ,t + β 2Th ,t + β 3 Lh ,t + β 4 * Th ,t * Lh ,t + β 5 * HMOmsa ,t + ε h ,t




         As with equation 2, the regression includes hospital and year fixed effects, as well as

controls for hospital type (T – teaching hospital, L – more than 200 beds) and the HMO




                                                                                                               12
penetration at the MSA level. The regression in column 2 contains interaction terms between

HMO penetration and the for-profit, teaching, large, and large teaching variables.

        The coefficient on the HMO penetration variable is the result of interest. Without the

interaction terms (column 1), there is no significant relationship between HMO penetration and

hospital advertising. The coefficient is positive, but not significant at normal levels. Once the

interactions are included, an interesting pattern is revealed. The omitted group – non-teaching

not-for-profit hospitals – responds to increased HMO penetration by advertising less. Every 10%

increase in HMO penetration leads to $8,800 less in advertising. For-profit hospitals also respond

to increased advertising with less advertising, not more as either the financial distress or the

increased returns hypotheses would suggest. Increased financial distress appears to lead to less

spending on advertising for small and for-profit hospitals.

        The final groups – teaching and big hospitals – provide evidence consistent with the

increased returns to advertising theory. Both teaching hospital and large hospitals respond to

increased HMO penetration with additional advertising. The effect for a large, non-teaching

hospital is not significantly different from zero, although the effect is no longer negative like the

previous groups. For large, teaching hospitals the effect of HMO penetration on advertising is

significant and large. Each increase in HMO penetration of 10% leads to an increase in hospital

advertising of $43,000. Among large, teaching hospitals, the average change in HMO penetration

from 1995-1998 was 8% with a standard deviation of 14%. On average, this category of hospitals

increased its advertising spending by $150,000. The increased influence of managed care appears

to explain a significant percentage of that change.



Conclusions



        The rise of hospital advertising in the late 1990s is best characterized by the significant

increase in marketing activity by large, not-for-profit teaching hospitals. There is little evidence


                                                                                                      13
to suggest that any increased influence of for-profit hospitals explains the recent pattern in

marketing behavior. Over this time period, for-profit hospitals have actually decreased their

marketing expenditures. Non-teaching, not-for-profit hospitals that were exposed to more for-

profit competition increased their ad expenditures in a marginally significant manner, but the

magnitude of the effect is small.

        Changes in managed care penetration are positively correlated with increased advertising,

but only for the teaching hospitals, and particularly for large, teaching hospitals. For all other

hospitals, increased managed care reduces ad spending, suggesting that HMOs represent a

financial shock to hospitals. For the large, teaching hospitals, the results with respect to HMOs

suggest support for the increased return to advertising hypothesis. The presence of HMOs in the

marketplace introduces a new negotiating dynamic, in which hospitals can attain higher

reimbursement fees if they can dampen the HMOs’ abilities to threaten to leave them out of

insurance contracts. Advertising direct to patients, if effective, can perhaps help to create a sense

of necessity for a hospital. Only hospitals for which their quality claims will be credible (large,

teaching hospitals) will gain through this type of advertising. For all the other hospitals, HMOs

are simply a financial shock, and advertising expenditures should fall.
