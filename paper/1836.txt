     The paper presents a non—technical szrvey of soue of the issues involved

euphasis on policy responses to external shocks. First, the six imost inortant
external economic paraneters of develcping countries are reviettd; I) the
terms of trade5 2) the growth of t'nrld arkets, 3) the cost and auai lability
of private external finance, 4) the cost and availability of official and
other concessional finance, including aid, 5) the nrld rate of inflation and
6) the exchange rates bett'een the cirrencies of the jor industrial
countries.
     The paper then reviews the nacroeconomic policy arsenal and the denand
and supply effects of the various policy instrunents (nDnetarv and credit
poiicy, the entire array ot fiscal nstrunents, exchange rate policy, the use
of exchange and capital controls and incones policy). Finally, there is a
discussion of stabilization responses to I oir esternal shocks: a
deterioration in the terms of trade, a slovdovn in the rate of qrowth of
export dEmand, an increase in the interest rate at itxchdeveio?ainq countries

                              Introducti on

      Policy responses by developing countries to changes in the external

 economic environment can conceptually be subdivided into macroeconomic

stabilisation policy and structural adjustment policy.1 Stabilizatiofl

policy aims to influence (and, one hopes, to minimize) deviations from

full employment equilibrium or full capacity utilization equilibrium.

Structural adjustment policy or allocative policy aims to influence the

full employment equilibrium configuration itself.2

     While the distinction between stabilisation policy and structural

adjustment policy is clear in principle, in practice (both in the real

world and in the ulpracticer of the theoretical aodels we tend to work:

with) virtually every fiscal, firancial, monetary or regulatory policy

2Note that accordino to this definition there can be no stabilization
policy in the instantaneous Wairasian equilibrium models o the New
Classical School. It is possible to modify the definition by
differentiating between a "full information equilibrium, i.e. an
equilibrium in which agents possess complete information on all relevant
contemporaneous and past endogenous and exogenous variables, and an
incomplete information equilibrium. Even in the hyperactive
invisible—hand models of the New Classical School, alternative budgetary
and financial policy rules can, in qeneral, alter the information
content of currently observed endogenous variables such as prices and
thus influence the deviation of the actual from the full information
equilibrium. (Turnovsky £1980], Weiss £1980], Buiter [1980, l98l) king
(1982], Marini (1985]). Such "stabilization" policy can then be
distinguished from ailocative policy actions or rules which aim to
influence the full information equilibrium itself.
action will have both stabilisation and allocative (and indeed also

distributional) consequences. Consider e.g. a policy of cutting

exhaustive public spending on goods and services and reducing tax rates

simultaneously, in such a way as to keep the public sector deficit

constant. The objectives are the allocative or structural adjustment

ones of freeing resources for private absorption and of creating more

favorable tax incentives for the supply of effort.   If there is any

merit in the balanced budget multiplier theorems this budgetary action

will have contractionary stabilization consequences. The distributional

consequences both of the spending cuts and of the ta reductions are

likely to be important but are seldom analyzed satisfactorily.

Unintended longer—term allocative consequences from public spending cuts

are possible if the important distinction between current and capital

spending is overlooked and exhaustive spending cuts fall

disproportionately on public sector capital formation.

     One operationally useful but not completely satisfactory way of

fleshing out the distinction between stabilisation and structural

adjustment is the following. Macroeconomic stabilisation policy

concerns monetary, fiscal, exchange rate, exchange control, capital

control and incomes policy actions within the historically given

inmtitutional framework and the domestic and international market
              3
 structure.

      Structural adjustment policy concerns changes in the in5titutioraJ

 framework and in the laws, rules and regulations that govern property

 rights, liability, incentives and the flow of information, which

 together constitute the parameters within which production, exchange and

 distribution take place. Structural adjustment is about changes in

 regime. Macroeconomic stabilization policy is about policy actions

 within a regime, that is for a given institutional framework and a given

market structure and/or non—market allocation and distribution
              4
mechani mm.

     A problem with this characterization is that it suggests that

stabilisation policy actions can always be implemented more swiftly than

structural adjustment policy actions and that they have short—run

effects only, i.e. effects which do not last longer than a typical




There is a rich and varied literature on stabilization policy in
developing countries. Important references are Diaz—Alejandro Ei3,

business cycle. While monetary stabilization policy can4 in 'cst

countries, be adjusted promptly, fi5cal stabilisation policy often is

the prisoner of unwieldy budgetary procedures. The "inside lag° of

fiscal policy may therefore range from weeks to years. To the extent

that stabilisation policy affects domestic capital formation, its

effects may be long—lasting instead of merely cyclical.

     Structural adjustment may be a long drawn—out process e.g.

achieving a significant change in the sectoral composition 04 production

and employment) or a once—off shift of short duration (replacing a

system of price controls for a single commodity by one of subsidies and

a market—determined price). The administrative and expert knowledge

required for the design and implementation of successful stabilisation

policy is not a world removed from that necessary for an effective

structural adjustment policy.

     A final practical distinction between stabilisation and structural

adjustment is that the former tends to be formulated at the

macroeconomic or aggregative level and concerns the overall balance

between effective demand and effective supply and their relationship to

the full employment levels of output and employment. Structural

adjustment policies frequently are disaggregated or microeconomic in

design and are aimed at the sectorai industrial or regional composition

of production and employment.

     Structural measures can be differentiated along many different

dimensions. A useful two—dimensional classification distinguishes first

between measures aimed at domestic markets and measures affecting the
                                                                       5



 conditions   of international exchange and second between reform of

 financial markets and reform of urealu goods and factor markets. The

 matrix in Table 1 represents this classification and provides some

 illustrative examples of the structural adjustment policies in question.

      While this paper is concerned with macroeconomic stabilisation

 policy in response to external shocks and disturbances, it is clear that

 structural issues cannot be ignored, even in the discussion of

 stabilisation   policy narrowly conceived.   At the very least, the

 institutional setting and rules oi the game, and the domestic and

 international financial and real market structures condition the

 appropriate monetary, fiscal, exchange rate and incomes policy responses

by developina countries to a change in the external environment. A

temporary worsening of a countrys terms of trade, for instance, will

call for a very different macroeconomic policy response if the country

has easy access to private international financial markets than if it is

effectively excluded from further access to private international credit

markets. Where optimal maroeconomic policy responses to external shocks

depend on the nature of the structural adjustment policies that are

being pursued, this dependence will be made explicit.

     In principle, it would be better to speak of stabilisation and

structural aspects or consequences of a given fiscal4 financial or

monetary policy action or rule, rather than of stabilisation and

structural policy. The inferior usage seems to be too well—ingrained,

however, to try to dislodge it.    In a number of cases, one or the other

set of consequences clearly dominates. E.g. liberalisation of domestic

 factor   and goods markets or of a urepressedh domestic financial system

 would seem to have mainly structural consequences, as do policies to

 change the degree of export—orientedness of domestic production or to

 alter the extent of integration of domestic financial and goods markets

 into the global financial and trading systems.5 (But see Buffie

 [19841).

      Reducing public spending, lowering the rate of growth of domestic

credit and devaluing the exchange rate to reduce domestic absorption and

improve the external current account balance would seem to be examples

of policies with mainly stabilization consequences. Changes in the

volume and composition of public spending will, however, also tend to

have important long—run structural consequences. A devaluation,

possibly accompanied by a change in the rate of crawl of the exchange

rate in a crawling peg regime, may also be one element in a structural

adjustment package aimed at increasing the share of exports in domestic

output.

     Like all forms of government intervention in the economic process,

the case for macroeconomic stabilization policy rests on empirical

judgements about the workings of the economic and political systems

and/or on a normative judgement.




5The locus classicus of financial repression is McKinnon [1973]. On
trade liberalisation and export—promoting vs. import—substituting
development strategies see Krueger [1978], Balassa E1992a, b, 1984], and
Bhagwati and Srinivasan [1979]. The important practical issue of the
right order of libera]isation and reform is discussed in Harberger
(1982], Barletta, Blejer and Landau, eds. (1983], Edwards E1984a, b, ci
and Obstfeld [1994).
                                                                    7




        The empirical economic judgement concerns the presence and severity

of market failure and the existence, taking into account only the
                                                          6
technical (or uacadem1cI) constraints on policy design, of

performance—and—welfare—enhancing pa1 icy interventions or interventi on

rules. The empirical political or politico—economic Judgement concerns

the likelihood that these potentially feasible, performance—and

welfare—enhancing policy measures will in fact be imp.lemented given the

actual political and administrative constraints an the design and

conduct of economic policy.

        The ethical or normative judgement that can either substitute for

the positive diagnosis of market failure or reinforce it, concerns the

desirability of government interventions in the income and wealth

distribution process. The ethical judgement that any particular

distribution of wealth and income is undesirable leads to a policy

prescription of redistributive measures only after (and to the extent

that) it has been complemented with the empirical politico—economic

judgement that the proposed cure isn't worse than the disease because Of

negative    side effects (in terms of efficiency and/or stabilization).

        The identification of widespread market failure is not a very

challenging task in many developing countries (as in most industrial

countries). Cf course, many of the distortions that lie behind these

examples of market failure are the direct consequences of past and




61.e.    assuming a unified, benevolent, credible economic policy maker.
                                                                    B




 present government policy. The policy measures to rectify the situation

 often are of a structural or allocative rather than of a macroeconomic

 stabilization kind. For instance, the cure for financial repression

 involves the abolition of artificial ceilings on interest rates ana

 other rates of return. Part of urban unemployment is due to

 artificially high wage rates in the formal urban sector (where the

 government often is a (or the) major employer and unions are stronger

 than in the rural sector), a problem that is sometimes compounded by a

policy of paving higher food subsidies to urban than to rural consumers.

     Many other forms of government—created or government—sponsored

market failure can be thought of. While the ultimate remedy for these

problems lies in structural reform and not in macroeconomic policy

intervention, as long as the structural distortions are part 04   the
actual economic environment, they are apt to have important implications

for design of macroeconomic stabilization poiicy. The potential for

acute financial crowding out problems in a financially repressed econocnv

will be discussed below. While one may wish for financial

liberalization, government budgetary policy design should be sensitive

to the actual crowding out mechanism and not to the nechanism that one

might have hoped for.

     The forms of market failure that are the sine qua non of

stabilization policy are 1) the capital market imperfection" that

(most) individuals and firms cannot borrow on the same terms as their

government and 2) the absence of instantaneous competitive market

clearing in (some) goods and labour markets or, more accurately, the
                                                                   9




existence and persistence of non—Wairasian, quantity—constrained

rationing equilibria or imperfect competition equilibria in some of

these markets.

     Even if one subscribes to the view that such non—Wairasian

equilibria are endemic in the major industrial countries, the very

different structure of developing countries' labour markets and their

often very distinct composition of production make it by no means

self—evident that stabilization approaches designed in the laboratories

of the industrial countries' business cycles are transferable to all or

any of the developing countries. As a first approximation it Is

probably safe to say that the larger the share of the modern industrial

and service sectors in total 6DF, and the larger the TM+ormal sector

relative to the "informal' sector, the more relevant the stabilizatIon

policies derived from the experience of the industrial countries are

likely to be. This means that the more developed 'Southern Cone'

countries will ignore macroeconomic stabilization policy at their peril,

even if mutatis definitely sunt mutandis, with particular attention paid

to important differences in the structure of the labour market, the

capital market and in the organization of production.

     Countries with a small modern industrial sector, a large informal

urban sector and a large share of 6DP derived from subsistence

agriculture are unlikely to provide a welcoming environment for

traditional macroeconomic stabilization policies. Demand management

also is unlikely to play an important role when the production of

agricultural cash crops for a competitive global commodity market
                                                                           'C)




 accounts for a major share of GDF. Supply management, i.e. policies to

 maintain a competitive real exchange rate or reduce real marginal labour
 and capital costs   do    play a crucial role in determining overall economic
 performance, but Keynesian—style quantity—constrained demand for output
 is unlikely to hold back production; an individual country (and
 certainly the individual     producer in   such a country) faces a very
 elastic global demand schedule for its products.
      The identification of the observable empirical correlates of
potentially successful stabilization policy in developing countries
should be a research priority in the years to come. The almost
bewildering variety of      experiences, modes of economic organization and

stages of economic development make it very unlikely that a single
prototype policy model will serve for such a heterogeneous col1ectior o

countri   es.

     Even when this first task is done       and the economic models are

ready to roll', the expected payo from the practical design and

implementation of macroeconomic stabilization policy still is uncertain.

In the second stage of the analysis——the evaluation of the real—world

political, administrative and institutional feasibility of economic

performance—and   welfare—enhancing stabilization policy——political
judgement and an understanding oi the art of        the possible (not at all
the comparative advantage of the economist) are essential. It is to be
hoped that political      market failure is not   so serious as to preclude the
formation of viable, effective coalitions capable either of designing
compensation schemes that turn potential Pareto        improvements into actual
                                                                     11




Pareto improvements, or of resisting veto attempts by losers +rom policy

reforms that are deemed desirable according to some generally accepted

social welfare criterion. it is my belief that, without dismissing the

real dangers of destabilisation policy", there is likely to be a

sufficient reservoir of economic understanding and political

common—sense to make "supply side—friendly" demand management policy and

"aggregate demand—sensitive" supply side policy a practical possibility

in a large number    of developing countries.
     The outline of the rest of the paper is as follows. Section 2

illustrates   the dangers of engaging in financial reform or trade

liberalization without paying attention to the budgetary and monetary

implications of such reforms. After this slight digression, Section 3

reviews the external environment of the developing countries and Section

4 the stabilisation policy instrument arsenal at their disposal.

Section   contains a discussion of stabilisation policy responses to

four external shocks: a deterioration in the terms of trade, a slowdown

in the growth of export demand; an increase in the interest rates at

which developing countries borrow abroad and an increase in the eternal

rate of inflation.



2. Budgetary, Monetary and Inflation Consequences of Two Kinds of
    Structural Reform: A Cautionary Tale

     Just as inappropriate macroecormic stabilisation policies can

interfere with the success+l implementation of structural adjustment

policies, so !tructural adjustment policies can have unexpected and
 unintended macroeconomic consequences which must be taken into account

 lest both sets of policies are reversed or abandoned for entirely the

 wrong reasons. Two important examples are the budgetary, monetary and

 inflationary consequences of domestic or international financial reorn

 and the budgetary consequences of export—oriented liberalization

 measures.

 Domestic financial reform, the budget deficit. seignioraqe and inflation

public spending (6 +i-+ *) over public revenues CT) must be
financed by borrowing domestically           by borrowing abroad (eB*: b

 rate, r*, and the proportional rate of decline of the terms of trade,

     are exogenous. With unrestricted international capital Mobility,

 the domestic real interest rate would be governed by the external real

 interest rate, Even with restricted international capital mobility,

 there are likely to be rather strict bounds on the ability of    the
authorities to influence their debt service burden by varying the

internal real interest rate. 10 More rapid growth of real 6DF, ano
therefore of the   economys   capacity for servicing both internal and
external   public debt, relaxes the debt   service constraint and lowers     the

real amount of revenue to be raised by seigniorage, (the inflation tax)

for any given primary deficit. Except for this last potentially

important channel, the only way in which the government can limit its

need for seigniorage (for   recourse to the inflation tax) is by reducinc
the primary deficit i.e. by some combination of spending    cuts and/or- tax
increases.




 10The internal domestic market for government debt is in many in5tances
of negligible importance. When private domestic bank! are required to
absorb and hold more government paper than they would willingly do at
current interest rates, an effective tax is levied on the banks equal to
the excess holdings times half the difference between the market rate
and the rate paid by the government. This tax can be viewed as another
form of seigniorage. Many developing countries have complicated
arrangements between the government (or the central bank) and the
private banking system.   It is not uncommon for governments to borrow
from the banks (at rates below the shadow price of funds to the banks.
and to lend to them simultaneously through some other arrangement. This
complicates the practice (but not the principle' of the calculation of
seigniorage (or equivalently of the true stock of outside money or
monetary base)
                                                                    15




     Seigniorage as a proportion of 6DP, s can be written as the

product of the proportional rate of growth of base money, M         and the

reciprocal of v, the income velocity of circulation of base money



          S      (X


or


     3)   bc   = sv


     Given s, an increase in the velocity of circulation of base mone

(a reduction in the demand for base money relative to income increases

the proportional rate of growth o the nominal stock of base money and

thus, sooner or later, the rate of inflation. Therefore, any reform4

financial or other, that does not lower the real interest rate paid on

the public debt or raise the growth rate of real output, but increases

the velocity of circulation of government base money will tend to raise

the rate of inflation unless fiscal measures are taken to lower the

primary deficit. Many intrinsically desirable proposals for internal

monetary and financial reform have as one of their consequences an

increase in the velocity of circulation of base money. The lifting of

interest rate ceilings on commercial bank deposits, the encouragement c+

private financial innovation and the removal of artificial barriers to

private financial intermediation all tend to enhance the availability

and the attractiveness of financial claims (both public and private)
                                                                    lo




 that pay market interest rates. Increasing international financial

 openness may lead to direct international currency substitution (e.g.

 dollarization) which depresses the demand for domestic base money (see

Ortiz [1983]). Non—interest—bearing government money experiences a

decline in demand; the inflation tax base shrinks.   If the required

seigniorage revenue is unchanged, the inflation tax rate wiii have to

increase. To avoid higher inflation several steps are possible.     If s

is not changed, the inflation tax base can be expanded, say, by

increased (non—interest—bearing) reserve requirements on domestic

monetary and financial institutions. This is equivalent to imposing a

tax on the private banking system. Alternatively scan be lowered,

which for all practical purposes involves reducing public spending or

raising taxes.

     The issue is important because the velocity of circi.iation of base

money is much lower in many developing countries than in most

industrialized countries, (reflecting the frequently rudimentary and/or

repressed nature of the internal monetary and financial system) and

seigniorage sometimes is an important source of government finance.

Table 2 shows the importance of seigniorage as a source of revenue in a

number of developing countries. For social, political and

administrative reasons, the tax base in many developing countries is

narrow and difficult to expand. The position of mast indu!triaiized

nations is quite different bath as regards the importance of seignioraae

revenue (which tends to be negligible (see Buiter [19B5]) and as regards

the breadth and expansibility of the tax base. Table 3 shows some

illustrative examples of industrialized countries with a much higher

income velocity of circulation of base money, a broader genera] ta base

and a small and often negligible contribution of seigniorage to total

government revenue.

      The implications of financial liberalisation for the seigniorage

base and thus, given the public sector's revenue needs, for inflation

are but one example of   the   often unfamiliar ways in which structural

adjustment policies can have consequences for macroeconomic

stabi I isation.




    Budgetary Consequences of Outward—Looking Trade Liberalization
    Measures


     Trade liberalisation measures such as the reduction or removal of

import tariffs or the relaxation of import licensing requirements and

export promotion measures such as export subsidies may have important

budgetary consequences. It is not true, of courses that lowering tariff

rates or even abolishing tariffs altogether necessarily lowers revenue.

A higher than unitary price elasticity of import demand or a prohibitive

(zero revenue) tariff are obvious cases in point. Many import

restraints furthermore take the form of non—revenue—raising, non—tariff

barriers such as (non—auctioned) quotas. Even so, tariff revenues

represent a significant share of total public sector revenue in a number

of developing countries, as shown in Table 4.

     The budgetary implications of trade liberalisation must be taken

into account lest seigniorage be forced to make up any revenue

     2. The level and variability of the growth of world markets for

developing country exports where developing countries are "large'

relative to the size of the market and face a less than perfectly

elastic world demand schedule. Four countries small enough to take

world prices as parametric, the growth of world demand for their

products will appear as an exogenous rise in their export prices. Again

both current and prospective future developments matter, as do

anticipated variability and true uncertainty. Figure 3 gives the growth

rate since 1957 of real GDP in the industrial world, a crucial indicator

of the growth of global markets for developing country exports.



     3. The cost and availability of external finance. This includes

the "supply conditions", now and in the future, of private and official

external credit and aid.

     The level and variability, now and anticipated in the future, of

U.S. dollar interest rates, both short and long, are key parameters in

the external environment of the developing countries. The spread over

Libor at which countries actually borrow is not a good indicator of the

external financial constraints on borrowers, as it is in part determined

by the behaviour and characteristics of the borrowing country itself.

 Creditworthiness and credit ratings are in part a choice variable, at

 any rate in the long run. Where credit rationing takes place, market

 rates are a poor proxy for the shadow price of investible resources.     At

 constant interest rates, the degree of external financial pressure can

 vary greatly. Figure 4 shows the behaviour since 1957 of short (RUSS)

 and long (RUSL) interest rates on U.S. dollar denominated debt. The

 availability of external resources at below—market cost is represented

 in Table 5 by the real value of private and official aid and credit

extended at concessional rates..

of the world rate of inflation.13 Figure 5 shows the behaviour of the

     5. The level and variability of exchange rates between major

industrialized countries. While this affects developing countries

mainly through the first four channels mentioned above it is worth

emphasizing in its own right. There is a robust empirical regularity

which associates a weakening of the U.S. dollar with a lower real price

of oil and an improventent in the terms of trade of non—oil LDCs. It

has also recently tended to be associated with lower dollar interest

rates and a narrowing of the spread between Libor and the 1—Bill rate

 developing countries have an interest in a weaker U.S. dollar. Figure 6

 contains the behaviour of the US $ effective exchange rate since 1970.

      The significance and the welfare implications of changes in these

 external parameters will of course depend crucially on the domestic

 circumstances of the country in question. E.G. an increase in export

volume (at given terms of trade) only represents an increase in welfare

if there are idle resources whose shadow prices are below their market

prices. i.e. in Keynesian demand—constrained regimes rather than in

classical or supply—constrained regimes.   In what follows full

employment (or a high level of capacity utilization), price stability

and balance of payments equilibrium are taken to be the objectives of

stabilisation policy.

4.   The Macroeconomic Stabilisation Policy Arsenal

      Macroeconomic stabilisation policy aims to influence the level and

composition of effective aggregate demand as well as the level and

composition of effective aggregate suppply in the short to medium term.

It contains both demand management and short—run supply management. The

main instruments are the following:

     a) Monetary policy. This includes changes in the level and/or

rate of change of the stock of domestic credit (under a managed exchange

rate regime) or of the money stock (under a market—determined exchange

rate). A narrow monetary aggregate like M1 (or even the monetary base)

is the relevant one in most developing countries other than the

semi—industrialized group that tends to have a more developed financial

system.    In a repressed financial system with interest rates controlled

at below market—clearing levels and consequent credit rationing,

variations in controlled interest rates and in the degree of stringency

of credit rationing are further important policy instruments. Changes

in the allocation of rationed credit between sectors or between

consumption credit and credit for working capital or fixed capital

formation will also have potentially long—lasting supply side effects.14

      Demand effects of monetary policy. Tight money impacts on

aggregate demand in a familiar manner. Higher nominal and real interest

rates and implicit and explicit required rates of return on other aseets

depress demand, reinforcing any real balance effect. More severe credit

rationing also squeezes demand (especially inventory accumulation and

fixed investment), when financial markets are underdeveloped and/or

repressed and bank credit is the major external source of investible

funds for firms. With a greater or lesser lag, nominal wages and the

general price level adjust downwards (in terms of the level or rate of

change, depending on the nature of the monetary contraction).     In the

long run real activity effects disappear and monetary policy is

reflected only in changes in nominal magnitudes. The duration of the

adjustment process depends on the details of the institutions of labour

and financial policy possess one fewer degrees of freedom than one might
have thought (or hoped). Given the deficit and the amount of internal
and external borrowing, domestic credit expansion is residually
determi ned.
and product markets, but will be shorter when the monetary authorities

are blessed with credibility a to the firmness of their long—run

commitment to monetary control. Painless, instantaneous adjustment has

never been observed and is riot a practical possibility.

     Monetary restraint will tend to improve the official settlements

balance of the international balance of payments under a managed

exchange rate and put upward pressure on the nominal exchange rate path

under a market—determined exchange rate.   In the short run, nominal

exchange rate appreciation (more or less) equals real exchange rate

appreciation and tight money worsens international competitiveness,

either by reducing the relative price of traded to non—traded goods

and/or by raising the relative price of exports to imports. Where thee

is very limited international capital mobility, the behaviour of the

current account surplus mirrors that of the official settlements

balance. When there is a high degree of capital mobility, monetary

policy has, under a managed exchange rate regime, a negligible effect on

real activity and spill5 aver directly and immediately into the overall

balance of payments. Few developing countries are in this position.

     Effective supply side effects of monetary policy.     In an economy

with limited international capital mobility, a deceleration in the rate

of growth of domestic credit (under a managed exchange rate) or in the

rate of growth of the domestic money stock (under a floating exchange

rate) will cause a temporary increase in real interest rates and/or

(especially in a financially repressed system) a temporary increase in

the severity of credit rationing faced by industry. The increase in the
                                                                  24




cost of working capital (or the reduction in its availability) that this

represents acts like an adverse effective supply shock. Notional supply
 (supply in the absence of credit rationing and with the real interest

rate equal to the marginal social cost of borrowing) exceeds effective

supply. (See Blinder (1985]). Together with the demand—depressing

effects of tight money, this suggests the likelihood of a transitional

stagflationary phase in response to a deceleration of credit or money

growth. Longer—run effects of changes in the rate of inflation

associated with changes in the rates of growth of money on the capital

intensity of full employment production (through Tobin effects, etc.)

fail outside the scope of cyclical stabilisation policy and are probably

quite insignificant quantitatively.

     $)   Fiscal policy. This includes changes in the level and

composition of real public spending on currently produced aoods and

services (uexhaustive spending), changes in transfer payments (social

security, pensions) and subsidies or in eligibility and and entit1eent

rules, changes in direct and indirect tax rates etc. Aspects of

commercial policy and of industrial policy with major public sector

revenue consequences also properly belong to fiscal policy.   (Tariffs

and the revenue consequences of the pricing and investment poli:ies of

public corporations that can fall back on the government as the lender

of first resort come to mind).

     Demand effects of fiscal policy.

     Public spending cuts and ta increases lower the level of aggregate

demand, except in the special case of 10) percent or full crowding out.
                                                                  25




In the standard IS/LM model this will occur in the short run if the

income velocity of circulation of money is constant (unless the economy

fixes its exchange rate and faces a perfectly elastic international

supply schedule of capital). Con+idence effects" may lower the risk

premia and thus nominal and real interest rates when credible policies
to reduce fiscal deficits are implemented or announced. There is no

evidence that these effects are sufficiently strong to reverse the

conclusion that the impact effect of tight fiscal policy is a

contractIon of real effective demand.   In the longer run, the

accumulation of debt associated with any continuing deficit will either

put upward pressure on real interest rates, (if it proceeds sufficiently

rapidly to raise the debt—output ratio, the real debt burden), or lead

to credit rationing by external creditors. Ultimately any policy

involving a primary (non—interest) deficit and a real after—tax interest

rate in excess of the growth rate of capacity output becomes

unsustainable and will require correction lest the deficit be monetized

and/or the debt repudiatco. Fiscal stabilization policy must be

reversible, i.e. should not imply any increase in the trend debt—6DF

ratio.

     Public spending cuts also change the compositon of demand. The

distinction between current and capital spending is crucial in this

regard. Tax cuts will tend to crowd out private investment if they take

the form of personal income tax cuts, but will crowd it in if they take

the form of private investment incentives.

     In a financially repressed economy with credit rationing the degree

of crowding out of private borrowing by public borrowing will tend to be
    -                                                                         26



 greater (for a given interest—sensitivity of the demand for money) than

 in an economy with market—clearing interest rates, and even 100 percent

crowding out becomes a theoretical possibility again.

        Fiscal policy measures that reduce the public sector budget deficit

also tend to reduce the current account deficit of the balance of

payments, but less than one—for—one, except in some special cases.

        Supply side effects of isca1 policy.

        Well—designed tax cuts and cuts in benefits or entitlements can

increase the incentives to work, save and invest, with obvious short—run

and long—run effects on capacity output, i.e. on notional supply. The

distributional consequences of such measures are of course central to

any determination of their overall desirability. Cuts in exhaustive

public spending are likely to have adverse long—run notional supply side

consequences if they fail on public sector capital spending, (on

infrastructure investment or investment by public enterprises) or on

mai ntenance.

        Spending classified as current (e.o. education and training) may

have an important human capital formation dimension and spending cuts

that affect such components will have long—run adverse notional suppy

consequences. Cet. Par., lower deficits are associated with lower

interest rates, reduced credit rationing and enhanced incentives for

private investment. The tax increases or spending cuts that bring about

these lower deficits may, however, adversely affect private saving and

investment (and a fortiori total national investment if the public

spending cuts take the form of cuts in public sector capital formation.
                                                                 27




where the foregone public sector capital is complementary with private

capital, as in the case of infrastructure). The desiqn of fiscal policy

is therefore a lot more complicated than the determination of the

magnitude of the public sector financial deficit. Financial crowdina

out, especially if it occurs via credit rationing4 may depress effective

supply below national supply.

     ')   Exchange rate policy.

     Under a managed exchange rate, monetary policy becomes subordinate

to exchange rate policy. This is true even in the very short run, if

the degree of international capital mobility is very high and the money

stock is demand—determined. With limited international capital

mobility, the short—run 'offsetcoefficient' of reserve losses on

domestic credit expansion is less than unity, but in the long run, money

becomes fully endogenous again.

     Demand side effects of devaluations

     In the simple IS-LM model, devaluation expands demand if the

Marshall—Lerner conditions are satisfied, (from an initial position of

balanced trade, the trade balance improves if the sum of the export and

import price elasticities exceeds unity). That this proposition is very

model—specific is clear from the simplest one—commodity monetary model

of the balance of payments in which relative price changes play no role

but absorption is reduced and the trade balance is improved through the

real balance or wealth effect of the increase in the general price level

brought about by the devaluation of the nominal exchange rate. Even

when devaluation does change relative prices in the short run, the
                                                                  22



 effect on the trade balance of such a temporary worsening o the terms

 of trade is ambiguous on theoretical and empirical grounds. A permanent

 worsening in the terms of trade! i.e. a permanent reduction in the real

 income (measured in terms of the purchasing power over the economy's

 consumption bundle) represented by a given volume of domestic

 production, might well lead to an equal reduction in consumption, with

 no effect on saving or on the trade balance. The temporary

 worsening of the terms of trade expected after a devaluation may well

 lead to a smaller reduction in current consumption then in current reai

income, because consumption is, at least in part, governed by permanent

income which has gone down by less than current income. The result

would be a worsening of the trade balance, not an improvement. Credit

markets in developing countries are probably too imperfect to give too

much weight to the permanent income hypothesis, where behaviour in

accordance with this hypothesis would require borrowing against

anticipated future labour income or the realization of illiquid real or

financial assets.   It remains true that the effects of devaluation on

the trade balance and on real demand are by no means obvious unless one

is willing to put a very significant weight on the real balance effect.

(which would seem to be an empirical non—starter), or on the effect of a

devaluation on the real value of credit in a credit—rationed financial

system with incomplete indexing of bank loans to firms.

     There are many other theories arguing the possibility of

(short—run) adverse effects on the current account of a devaluation.

The i—curve, which relies on low short—run demand and supply
                                                                  29




elasticities is probably the best—'nown example. Other arguments about

the possible contractionarY demand effects of a devaluation have been

made by Kurgman and Taylor [1978) and by Dia:—Aleiandro 11981]. (See

also Taylor [1983]).

     If the balance of trade and real demand effects are ambiguous the

price level effects are auite unambiguous.   Devaluation raises the price

level (through a temporary increase in the rate of inflation) in the

long run by the same proportion.    higher rate of "crawling"

depreciation will after a lag lead to an equal increase in the rate o

inflation.

Supp1y—id effects of devaluation

     In the short run, a devaluation will raise the price of traded

relative to non—traded goods. Resources will flow out of the non—traded

goods sector and into the traded goods sector. The magnitude and

duration of this resource transfer (which will have to be reversed wnen

relative prices revert to their pre—devaluation values) will be

dependent on the expected duration of the depreciation of the real

exchange rate.   If there is short—run rigidity of money wages, and if

employment is "real wage constrained", a devaluation and the associated

increase in the general price level will, by temporarily    lowering real


wages, permit a temporary expansion of output supply and employment. 1+
                                                           into factor
there is a rapid pass—through of cost_of—livingchaflqes

payments, whether by de—jure or by dc—facto indexation, and if

demand—constrained employment regimes emerge frequently during cyclical

 downswings the importance of this positive supply—side effect of a
                                                                    30




 devaluation is probably quite minor. The opposite argument1 that

 devaluation, to the extent that it worsens the terms of trade and raises

 the real product wage corresponding to any given real consumption wage1

reduces labour demand and output also seems unimportant empirically.

     6)   Exchange controls and capital controls

     It is fairly arbitrary whether one views capital controls or

foreign exchange controls in general as instruments of stabilization

policy or as important parameters conditioning the consequences of

variations in the other macroeconomic policy instruments (as I would

prefer). A good case can be made for the view that strict limit! or' the

international mobility of financial capital are essential for orderly

macroeconomic development if domestic financial markets are

underdeveloped and domestic factor markets do not fit the idealized

competitive paradigm. Countries that have liberalized international

capital flows before domestic factor and goods market! have frequently

undergone traumatic overvaluations of the exc$'ange rate (brought about

by rapid capital inflows), followed by a loss of confidence and a

financial collapse with serious consequences for the real economy (see

e.g. the Southern Cone experience reviewed in Harberger E1982],

Barletta, Bleer and Landan eds. [1983], Edwards ti984a, b, c} and

Obstfeld [19843). Tight capital controls are of course quite consistent




15E.g. with a fixed (fully indexed) real consumption wage, a worsening
of the terms of trade raises the 11product' supply price of labour and
reduces employment where this is real—wage constrained.
                                                                   31




with a welcoming attitude towards long—term foreign direct investment.

While it is possible, in principle, to use variations in the scope and

degree of stringency of exchange controls as a cyclical stabilization

device, there is neither an academic literature on the subject, nor any

practical experi ence.

     €)   Incomes policy

     Incomes policy can be used as an instrument of nominal wage

restraint (Or wage and price restraint), i.e. as an intervention to

achieve a given desired reduction in the rate of inflation at least cost

in terms of output and employment forgone, or as an instrument for real

wage control.   In the latter case it will have obvious supply—side

effects by permitting an increase in employment if this is real

wage—constrained. By raising profit rates, private investment is likely

to be stimulated (assuming no adverse aggregate demand effects from a

redistribution from labour to capital). Since the public sector is a

major (often the largest) employer in the formal sector in many

developing countries, there will always have to be at least a public

sector incomes policy. Policies affecting the relative wages of

different categories of labour (young vs. adult, skilled vs. unskilled

etc.) will have important supply side consequences but cannot be used

easily for stabilisation purposes. Nominal incomes policy can be used

to add credibility to monetary and fiscal disinflation programmes and to

break through the 'after you" non—cooperative stance of individual

groups of workers in segmented labour markets. Real incomes policy is

unlikely to meet with lasting success unless the underlying balance of
                                                                    32



 forces in the labour market is consonant with its objectives or is

 altered to become so.

 5.   External   Shocks and Domestic Policy Responses

       Before turning to a discussion of specific macroeconomic policy

 responses to particular exogenous shacks, the followin live points

 should be made. First, macroeconomic stabilisation policy is (and

 should be) conducted not only in response to external shocks but also in

 response to internal shocks and disturbances that originate outside the

 government sector. Second, stabilisation policy errors (combinations ol

selecting the wrong instrument, the wrong dosage and the wrong timini

often have been a source of macroeconomic disruption and an obstacle to

efficient and fair structural adjustment. The first task of

macroeconomic policy design is of course to prevent macroeconomic policy

itself from putting unnecessary strain on the economic system. Third,

there is no convincing case (but only a misapplication of the theory of

th best) for correcting' misconceived macroeconomic stabilisation

policy by making changes in structural adjustment policies that would

not otherwise have been implemented. E.g. an excessively lax fiscal

policy stance is likely cet. par. to result in an increased deficit or'

the current account of the balance of payments. 11Correcting" such an

imbalance through protectionist measures (such as import restrictions)

would be unwise and counterproductive for two reasons. One the effect

of an increase in the degree of protection on the current account is

ambiguous. Protection is a two—edged sword, as it tends to reduce

international trade in general, both imports and exports. Such a
reduction in the "openness" of an economy can be accompanied either by a

worsening or by an improvement in the current account.16 Two, to the

cost of correcting a macroeconomic imbalance is added the efficiency

loss associated with a shift in the pattern of production and resource

allocation away from the economy's underlying comparative advantage.1'

     Fourth, as will become apparent in the subsequent discussion of

specific shocks and policy responses, the effectiveness of macroeconmic

adjustment policy and indeed the very nature and magnitude of the proper

policy responses depend crucially on the credbilitv of the policy

announcements of the government. The current behaviour of the exchange

rate (where it is free to reflect market forces), of capital flows, of

interest rates, of wages, prices, savings, investment, employment and

output depends on past policy actions, on current policy actions and on

past and current expectations concerning future policy actions. The

effects of current fiscal and monetary policy may be reinforced or

neutralized by the effect that current policies and current policy

announcements have on domestic and international perceptions about the

likely future course of policy. Credibility is a function of reputatlDn




'6This point is closely related to the well known theorem of the
equivalence of an import tariff and a tax on exports in a static
economic system with full employment and balanced trade (Lerner Ei9á]).


17Assuming the initial configuration corresponded (more closely) to the
one dictated by comparative advantage.

 which in turn reflects past policy actions and the extent to which

 governments can convincingly commit themselves in advance to a sequence

 of future policy moves. Multilateral institutions like the World Bank

and the IMF can play a crucial role in supplying credibility to

countries with poor track records, in exchange for a commitment to

pursue structural or financial adjustment policies.

     Finally, other things being equal, larger policy responses are

required for permanent than for transitory disturbances.   (More

generally, longer—lasting shocks require larger and/or longer—lasting

policy responses). Nominal shocks should not lead to policy responses

that imply lasting real effects. E.g. higher world inflation shcild be

met with a lower rate of depreciation of the home currency, not with a

fiscal response. The policy re5ponse to shocks should begin when they

are first anticipated, not when they finally occur. In the presence of

adjustment costs to changes in employment, in the capital stock, in the

sectoral allocation of resources etc., a policy response conducive to a

gradual adjustment of these endogerious variables will in general be

optimal, even if the shock is permanent.   If adjustment costs are

associated with variations in the values of the policy instruments

themselves (say because of administrative bottlenecks) a gradual

response of the policy instruments themselves will be desirable. The

degree of confidence with which expectations concerning the future

evolution of the external environment are held will determine the

magnitude and speed of the policy response as well as the range 0+    the
policy instrumentarium to be deployed. Irreversible or
                                                                        35




costly—to—reverse policy actions will tend to be postponed if the

passage of time is likely to resolve at least some of the uncertainty.

        5a) Stabilization policy responses to a deterioration in the te.'-ms

            of trade of a small open economy.

        A deterioration in the terms of trade will, holding public

spending, tax—transfer programmes, domestic credit expansion, the (rate

of crawl of the) exchange rate and the pressure of incomes policy

constant, have the following demand and supply effects.

        The real income corresponding to any given level of production of

domestic output is lower. To prevent the emergence of a current account

deficit, real absorption (in terms of the consumption bundle) should

decline by the same amount as real income.      If the terms of trade

deterioration is permanent, real private consumption may well decline in

line with real private permanent disposable income. However, there is

no similar mechanism ensuring that the other two components of

absorption, private investment and public exhaustive spending, will (or

should) follow suit.

        First consider the case where the deterioration in the terms of

trade involves the terms of trade of final consumption goods only. This

means   that   private investment should stay constant in terms of home

output, i.e. decline in terms of the consumption bundle. Real public

consumption and investment also should remain constant in terms of home

goods; that means a cut in volumes if part of this spending is on

imports which now are more expensive. Contractionary fiscal policy           a


balanced budget cut in public sector consumption spending) would seem

the appropriate fiscal response in this case.
                                                                             3á



        An increase in the relative price of an imported intermediate, raw

 material or energy input lowers the value added corresponding to any

 given amount of gross output. Again, private agents following permanent

 income principles would make the required corresponding reduction in

private consumption spending. Public consumption should also be cut to

reflect the objective worsening of the sustainable national standard of

living. The short—run response of private and public investment, actual

and    desired, is    ambiguous, however.

        A   rise in the price      of energy, say, is likely to reduce the

long—run desired stock of capital and other complementary factors.                In a

vintage capital model, the energy price increase may, especially if it

was unanticipated, lead to large—scale scrapping of energy—intensive

older vintages, while sharply raising the return to net investment in

new energy—efficient technology. The result could be a temporary

investment boom, associated with a current account deficit that is quite

sound and above board provided the returns to the investment cover the

cost   of external borrowing.
       An increase in energy prices also lowers the uwarranted real

wage,'8 the real wage, in terms of the price of gross domestic output
(and   thus also the      real consumption wage) corresponding to any given

level of employment, including full employment.




18Strictly the "warranted real marginal cost of labour", including wage
and non—wage costs.
                                                                   37




     Without a lowering of the actual real wage, classical unemployment

would result (if the real wage initially constrained employment). The

warranted real rental rate of capital also declines. Any policy,

including tighter incomes policy, that facilitates this transition to a

lower real wage will help maintain employment.

     The deterioration in the terms of trade can either raise or lower

the domestic general price level at a given exchange rate depending on

whether it takes the form of an increase in dollar import prices or a

cut in dollar export prices. Price level stabilisation calls for an

exchange rate revaluation in the former and a devaluation in the latter

case. There is no clear case for any monetary policy response.

     If the terms of trade worsening is pretty confidently expected to

be long—lasting, the policy response should be as swift and as complete

(in terms of the adjustment to the new long run equilibrium) as is

consistent with a proper allowance for costs of adjustment.

     When the terms of trade change is in the opposite direction the

policy prescriptions are reversed. For net energy importers. the

decline in the real price of energy calls for the following policy

responses (all relative to what would have been done otherwise).

     I) — a fiscal relaxation (specifically a balanced budget increase

          in public consumption spending).

     2) — an increase in the warranted real wage, say through a

          relaxation of real incomes policy, and in the warranted real

          rental rate.

     3) — a devaluation if the relative price decline of energy

          imports is a dollar price decline of imports, a revaluation if

          it   takes the form of an increase in the dollar price of

          exports.
                                                                   36



      4) — no monetary response

     5) — a swift and full response (subject to adjustment costs) under

          1), 2), and 3) if the oil price decline is confidently

          expected to be permanent, a slower and partial response

          otherwi se.

     For net energy exporters, 2), 3), 4) and 5) are the same, but 1)

is reversed.

     5b) Stabilization policy responses to a slowdown in the rate of

growth of export demand for a developing country with some market oower.

     In the absence of any policy response in the developing countries,

a slowdown in the rate of growth of export demand for their output (say

because of industrial country protectionism in the OECD or because of a

recession in the industrial world) constitutes a contractionary shock to

aggregate demand. The equilibrium adjustment to such a shock would be a

transition (maintaining full employment of resources) to less favourable

external terms of trade and a shift in the composition of production

away from exportables and towards import—competing or non—traded goods.

If the slowdown is perceived to be cyclical and therefore temporary,

total absorption would, if external credit is available, decline by less

than real income and the current account would go into deficit.

Provided matching surpluses are run during periods of above normal

growth of export demand when the terms of trade have an exceptionally

high value, such cyclical deficits are nothing to worry about.    If the

weak growth of demand and the associated unfavourable terms of trade are

perceived as permanent, there would be no justification for maintaining

private plus public consumption at its previous level.
                                                                   39




     Without proper fiscal and monetary policy responses1 the actual

transition is likely to be rather more painful than the equilibriurn

transition. Labour and product markets do not clear

instantaneously,factor mobility is limited and excess capacity and

unemployment will follow the deceleration of export demand growth.

Expansionary fiscal policy could provide the 5hort term demand stimulus

required to maintain full employment, but unless it were to take the

form of a "balanced budget" expansion, it would add greatly to the

pressure on the current account. Expansionary monetary policy is called

for, accompanied by a devaluation of the nominal exchange rate and an

incomes policy aimed at translating nominal exchange rate depreciation

into improvements in real competitiveness.

     5c) Stabilization policy responses to an increase in interest

rates in the industrial world

     In the case where the increase in nominal interest rates is also an

increase in real interest rates, even the equilibrium adjustment to the

increased cost of borrowing will involve painful choices for the

developing countries that are net debtors. The only exception to that

rule would occur in the felicitous but unlikely event of an increase in

aid and other concessional resource transfers from the industrial world

to the developing countries, which compensates them fully for the

increase in their debt service costs. As long as the marginal cost of

external debt is increased, there will be a reduction in the optimal

amount of debt for a borrowing country. The transition to this lower

level of external indebtedness requires the debtor countries to run
                                                                     4 C)




 current account surpluses, that is to effect a net transfer of resources

 to the creditor countries. First consider the case where the higher

 interest rates are considered to be a permanent feature of the external

economic environment. At full employment, part of the required

reduction in absorption would come from the private sector (even without

any increase in taxes), if the increase in external real interest rates

is reflected in the cost and/or availability of domestic credit.
                                                                19
Private investment will fall and so will private consumption.

Attempts to insulate the domestic economy from the global increase in

interest rates will merely postpone the inevitable adjustment process

and may well end up making it sore painful than it need have been.          In


the new high interest rate long—run equilibrium, the capital intensity

of production will be lower than it would have been otherwise and the

equilibrium 9warranted" real wage is lower also.

     Public consumption spending too should be cut, unless the marginal

valuation of public consumptionexceeds that of private consumption over

the entire relevant range, which would indicate a serious misallocation

of resources in the initial equilibrium. The increase in the oreian

rates of interest would put downward pressure on the exchange rate

and/or induce a loss of foreign exchange reserves.




19For the economy as a whole, both substitution and income effects (in
the case of a net debtor) favour saving. The private sector, however,
could be a net creditor even if the private and public sectors combined
are a net debtor. The statement in the text ignores this possibility.
                                                                     41




     Again the transition to the new equilibrium with its lower external

debt burden and its lower capital intensity of production is unlikely to

be achieved at full employment, in the absence of a well—designed

stabilization policy package.   If   the exchange rate is not permitted to
weaken, the lower aggregate demand associated with the higher real

interest rates will cause a recession.     (I am assuming that the

effective domestic cost and/or availability of credit goes up in line

with the external cost; if this is not permitted to happen, the

correction of the resulting current account deficit Wjli require other

contractionary, absorption—reducing policy measures.)     If the exchange

rate is devalued (or permitted to depreciate), if nominal exchange rate

changes correspond, at any rate in the short run, to real exchange rate

changes and if "real devaluations have an expansionary effect on

demand, then employment and capacity utilization can be maintained in

the face of an increase in world real interest rates. The devaluation
will lead to an upward shift in the path of the price level, but there

need be no long run increase in the rate of inflation.

     To converge to the sustainable long—run equilibrium with its

reduced external debt, its lower capital—output and capital—labour

ratios and its lower real wage, requires on balance a fiscal contraction

along the adjustment path, as well as a policy for reducing real

marginal labour costs. Unless non—wage labour costs (esployers. social

security contributions, other social premiums paid by employers as a

function of their wage bills, and rules and regulations limiting

managerial discretion in hiring, firing etc.) can be reduced, a cut in
                                                                   42




reel take—home pay is inevitable. Many of the policies that lower

non—wage labour costs (but not all, vide relaxing employment prote:tion

legislation) have adverse consequences for the public sector deficit.

This is especially unfortunate when the overall stance of fiscal policy

should be favouring a reduction of public sector financial deficits.

Incomes policy may well be an essential ingredient of any attempt to

lower real wages.across the board.

     If the increase in world real interest rates is expected to be

temporary rather than permanent, there is of cause no ground for

pursuing any long—run adjustment, and the management of the short—run

problems should also be simplified. Larger current account surpluses

(or smaller deficits) will have to be achieved temporarily in order to

finance the temporary increase in the real debt service burden

associated with the higher interest rates.      tempo-ary tightening of

the fiscal stance is required4 and the contractionary effects of this

combined domestic fiscal tightening and external interest rate increase

imply the need for a balancing devaluation and monetary expansion. This

will lead to a higher price level and therefore a temporary increase in

inflation, but no increase in the long—run rate of inflation. The

expansionary e+ect of the combined devaluation—monetary expansion will

erode over time as the rising domestic price level restores the original

real exchange rate and real stock of money balances.

     5d) Monetary, fiscal, exchange rate and incomes policy responses

to an increase in the world rate of inflation

     For once the appropriate policy response is straightforward. 1+

country should reduce the rate of crawl of its exchange rate by the saie

     Tables 6 and 7 show, not surprisingly, that external shocks dont

come in isolation.      If e.a. it is fiscal policy in the DECD as a whole

that is the source of the disturbances to the developing countries

external environment in a particular period, then we would expect

declining interest rates and declining growth rates of OECD GDP to go

together (both being the short—run consequences of contractionary fiscal

policy).    If OECD monetary policy were the major driving force instead.

we would expect to see declining interest rates associated

(contemporaneously) with rising OECD BDP growth.

     Table 7 shows the worsening o the external environment c the

oil—importing developing countries after 1975 in a summary fashion. The

mean oil price shoots up and its variance increases dramatically. seen

growth of real GDF in the OECD is more than halved while its variance

increases. World nominal interest rates double and the varian:e of

interest rates triples. World inflation more than doubles. The strcn

positive correlation between OECD inflation and nominal interest rites

of .84 in   the   early period fails to .07. The early positive correlation

between OECD growth and the real price of oil (presumably reflecting

demand effects) becomes negative in the later period as negative oil

supply shocks dominate. Beneraily speaking. the correlation patterns

differ dramatically.

     Tables 6 and 7 only show measures of total variability (anticipated

plus unanticipated).       mechanical and imperfect measure of uncertairt

question is in reality used to form expectations of them) can in

principle, given sufficient data, be obtained from the contemporaneous

variance—covariance matrix of the residuals from a vector—autoregressive

representation of the external environment variables. Lack of degrees

of freedom precludes such an exercise at this stage.

      From the point of   view of a debtor country, aiven the variability
in its terms of trade, greater variability of the interest rates it

faces is not necessarily a bad thing.    If e.g. whenever the terms of

trade move against a debtor country, the interest rate on its external

debt were more likely to decline, the overall position of this country

 ught well be superior to that of a country experiencing a variable (or

uncertain) terms of trade and a constant interest rate. Negative

covariances between adverse external shocks can provide something akin

to portfolio diversification and thus reduce the overall riskiness of a

country's external exposure.

Conclusi on

     While much of the knowledge concerning stabilization policy that

has been developed in the context of the industrial world can be

transferred, mutatis mutandis to a wide range of developing countries

(basically those with a non-negligible modern industrial sector),

certain important modifications to the industrial country paradigm

deserve special attention. Rudimentary and/or repressed financial

markets lead to credit rationing. Financial crowding out on the demand

side and effective supply effects from fiscal and financial policy are

likely to complicate macroeconomic management.
                                                                       4

         An i5sue worth emphasizing is the distinction between two kinds of

 devaluations. The fir5t is a devaluation of the exchange rate that

 merely serves to speed up or facilitate a real adjustment which is

 taking place anyway.     It is aimed at a correction which would, in the

 absence of the devaluation, take place through an adjustment of nominal

 prices and wages. The second is a devaluation as a means for correcting

 a persistent and well—entrenched real disequilibrium. The former will

be successful, but the benefits will be modest. The benefits from

achieving the latter might well be major, but the policy will be

unsuccessful unless it is backed up by other measures.

     Without an effective real incomes policy or another set of labour

market policies and/or industrial policies that change the balance of

power between labour and (private or public) capital, a devaluation of

the exchange rate is unlikely to have any lasting notional supply

effects. As predetermined nominal contracts come up for renewal, the

temporary effect on real wages of any incomplete indexing 04 wages will

erode.

     With real wages and the real exchange rate unchanged, any

absorption—reducing effects of a devaluation have to came through the

real balance effect or the ureal credit effect".     In a reasonably

efficient financial system with market—clearing interest rates and other

asset returns, the real balance effect isnt likely to count for much.

In a repressed financial system with credit rationing and incomplete

indexing of loans, the general price level increases associated with a

devaluation will reduce the real flow of credit. This will lower both

credit—constrained forms of spending (inventory accumulation, fixed

capital formation etc.) and credit—constrained forms of production

(production relying heavily on working capital). The possible

stagflationary consequences of devaluations (and of tight money) in a

financially repressed economy cannot be ignored in the design of

macroeconomic policy. Changes in the severity and indeed in the

mechanism of financial crowding out under credit rationing deserve close

attention. Blinder C19B5] has argued that these lessons apply, if

perhaps to a lesser degree, to the industrial countries as well.

     One clear implication f any analysis of policy design in a

variable and uncertain economic environment is that such variability and

uncertainty increase the importance I) of controlled access to

international credit and capital markets by developing country

governments and private agents and 2) of OECD macroeconomic policies

conducive to the least—restricted availability of credit at low real

interest rates. Access to international financial markets potentially

enhances a nation's capacity for smoothing consumption over time by

breaking the closed economy identity of absorption and income. A closed

economy or an open economy restricted to balanced trade can use only

variations in domestic capital formation to influence the time profile

of total national consumption. An open economy with access to

international credit markets can vary both domestic capital formation

and net foreign investment in pursuit of that same objective. This

extension of the nation's Nintertemporal consumption po5sibility set"

would be important even in a world without uncertainty if countries are
                                                                   4G




perturbed by predictable variations in the weather or in other exogenous

variables. It is even more important when uncertainty plays a major

role, because international credit and capital markets can provide de

facto partial insurance against incompletely correlated national

contingencies.

     Restrictions on capital mobility and other forms $ e<charge

control are likely to be necessary in the second, third or nth best

world inhabited by most developing (and developed) countries, in order

to protect the domestic real economy from the severe damage that a

sudden massive influx or outflow of financial capital can cause.

Finally, it is the responsibility of the industrial countries to ensure

that the potential benefits from access by developing countries to

international financial and good! markets are not thrown away or turned

into actual losses through policies that result in persistently high

global real interest rates, unfavourable terms of trade for developing

countries and disappointing growth of their export markets.
