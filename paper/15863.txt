                                             ABSTRACT


A large fraction of Uganda's population continues to earn a living from quasi-subsistence
agriculture. This paper uses a static general equilibrium model to explore the relationships between
high transportation costs, low productivity, and the size of the quasi-subsistence sector. We
parameterize the model to replicate some key features of the Ugandan data, and we then perform a
series of quantitative experiments. Our results suggest that the population in quasi-subsistence
agriculture is highly sensitive both to agricultural productivity levels and to transportation costs. The
model also suggests positive complementarities between improvements in agricultural productivity
and transportation.

1      Introduction
In many developing countries, agriculture is the dominant economic activity,

accounting for large shares of employment and output. This paper considers

the case of Uganda, a country in East Africa in which the economy is heavily

dependent on agriculture.       Over 80 percent of Uganda's households (and

85 percent of the people) live in rural areas, and most of these depend on
                                                    1
agriculture for their primary source of income.

     By any measure, rural and agricultural households are overwhelmingly

and disproportionately poor. The poverty rate in rural areas was estimated

at 34.2% in 2005/06, compared to an urban poverty rate of 13.7%. Other

measures of living standards tend to support this estimate; rural households

spend far larger fractions of their incomes on food and have signicantly

fewer clothes, shoes, and other possessions than do urban households.

     This paper asks a series of questions about the agricultural sector's role in

economic development in Uganda. To begin with, why do so many people live

and work in rural areas, when material living conditions are relatively much

worse than in cities? In particular, why are so many people dependent for

their livelihood on semi-subsistence agriculture? The government estimates

that in some regions of the country, 85-90% of households receive their main

source of income from subsistence agriculture.

     The literature notes several possible reasons why so many individuals are

involved in subsistence agriculture, including such things as various barriers

which impede the growth of the nonagricultural sector or a variety of factors

that lead to low productivity in the agricultural sector. While our analysis

will include an evaluation of these explanations, our primary focus is to assess

the role that lack of transportation infrastructure plays in promoting such a

large subsistence agriculture sector. While the idea that poor transportation

    1 To
       be precise, nationally representative household surveys estimate that 78.8% of
households in Uganda were rural in 2005/06, accounting for 84.6% of the population and
93.2% of those living below the poverty line.



                                          1
infrastructure might play a key role in the development process does feature

prominently in many policy discussions, there is relatively little systematic

work to explore the economic mechanisms through which it operates.           A

key objective of this work is to take a rst step toward articulating these

economic mechanisms.

   To pursue this, our paper uses a static general equilibrium model that

reects key features of the Ugandan economy.       We use a two-sector model

in which there is an agricultural sector and a non-agricultural sector. This

model is similar in spirit to earlier papers by Gollin, Parente, and Rogerson

(2002, 2007) that focus on the structural transformation that accompanies

development  in which economies move labor and other resources out of

agriculture into other sectors and activities. We extend this basic model to

reect one of the realities of the Ugandan economy, namely, the fact that in

much of the country, roads and other transportation infrastructure are very

poor. This means that rural markets in Uganda are characterized by high

transportation and transaction costs. Our model correspondingly includes an

iceberg cost of moving goods from rural areas to urban areas (and vice versa).

We examine the extent to which high transport costs can partly account for

the large fraction of people living in rural areas in Uganda.

   The underlying economics are intuitive. Individuals require food, imply-

ing that sucient food must be produced in rural areas and transported to

urban areas to support the nonagricultural workforce. If transport costs are

very high, food becomes very expensive in urban areas relative to rural areas,

creating an incentive for individuals to locate in rural areas to economize on

transportation costs. In a poor country where food accounts for a large share

of overall expenditure, this force is potentially very large.

   Next, our paper asks how specic interventions would aect the allocation

of labor and inputs across economic activities, and how these interventions

would alter the welfare of people in the Ugandan economy.       To assess the

impact of these interventions, we rst calibrate the model to replicate certain




                                       2
features of the Ugandan data. By altering parameters in the model, we can

conduct some simple and straightforward simulations of various policies and

interventions.

   First, we ask how the economy would benet from improvements in

agricultural productivity.   Would increased agricultural TFP push workers

out of the agricultural sector, or would it draw more workers in?         How

much would TFP increases aect welfare, in an economy where agricultural

goods account for a large fraction of consumption? Second, we ask how the

economy would respond to increases in non-agricultural productivity. How

would these aect the fraction of the population living in urban areas and

working in non-agriculture? How would non-agricultural TFP growth aect

welfare? Third, we consider the impact of a reduction in transportation costs,

such as might result from improvements in roads or other transportation

infrastructure. How would the allocation of workers across sectors be aected

by changes in the transportation cost structure? What would be the eects

on welfare? And what would be the joint eect of reducing transport costs

simultaneous with an increase in agricultural TFP? Finally, we consider

the eect of population growth on a xed land base. Although this is not

explicitly a policy question, we believe it oers useful insights in an economy

that currently features on of the highest population growth rates in the world.

   To summarize the ndings of the paper briey, we nd that agricultural

productivity improvements have a relatively large impact on the economy.

Because the non-agricultural sector is initially small, and because the econ-

omy faces a subsistence constraint that limits the expansion of the non-

agricultural sector, improvements in non-agricultural TFP have relatively

small positive impacts on the economy. Reductions in transportation costs

generate sizeable benets for the economy and trigger substantial reallo-

cations of labor across sectors.   When agricultural TFP improves at the

same time that transportation costs are reduced, the welfare gains exceed




                                      3
those achieved from the two interventions separately, suggesting a kind of

interaction eect.

    The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.       Section 2 presents

some background information on Uganda's development, with a particular

focus on agriculture and on transportation costs and infrastructure.         In

Section 3, we review related literature.     Section 4 presents a two-region

model that will provide the backbone for our analysis. Section 5 discusses

the calibration of this model and shows results.          In Section 6, we oer

an expanded model with three regions, which allows us to focus in more

detail on the quasi-subsistence agricultural sector. Section 7 draws out some

conclusions and implications for policy.




2     Background
Uganda is among the poorest countries in the world, with real per capita

income of just over $1,100 in 2003, according to the Penn World Tables v.

6.2 (Heston et al., 2006).   This level of income places the country rmly

in the bottom quintile of the cross-country income distribution.       As noted

above, Uganda also ranks among the countries most heavily dependent on

agriculture.   In many ways, Uganda is fairly typical of many sub-Saharan

countries with large rural populations. However, in some respects, Uganda

oers a distinct set of challenges and characteristics.



2.1    Agriculture in Uganda

Because it is landlocked, Uganda produces essentially all of its own food, and

most of its agriculture is oriented towards production of food for domestic

consumption. Clearly there is a signicant amount of agricultural production

for export  chiey in coee and a few other crops. Our model economy will

be closed, so we will essentially ignore export agriculture. In the paragraphs

that follow, we will explain why we think this is a reasonable depiction of


                                       4
agriculture in Uganda. We will also explain why we are specically interested

in the quasi-subsistence agriculture sector, which is a large fraction of the

total in Uganda.

   Almost all agricultural production in Uganda takes place on smallholder

plots, with mixed cropping systems predominating.           Two-thirds of agricul-

tural households had between 1 and 4 plots in 2002, and about 40 percent

of the plots were themselves mixed stands, where multiple crops are grown

together (Uganda Bureau of Statistics 2004, pp. 5-6). Most plots are close

to the household (less than one kilometer), but 37 percent are more than

one kilometer away from the homestead (Uganda Bureau of Statistics 2007a,

p. 36). Few purchased inputs are used on smallholder plots, with only 1.0

percent of plots using chemical fertilizer and 6.3 percent reporting the use of

improved seeds (Uganda Bureau of Statistics 2007a, p. 86). Fewer than 1.0

percent are irrigated (Uganda Bureau of Statistics 2007a, p. 86).

   Ten crops account for over 90 percent of the plots under cultivation:

matoke (a kind of cooking banana), beans, cassava, sweet potatoes, coee,

groundnuts, maize, millet, sorghum, and sesame. With the exception of cof-
                                                                                   2
fee, all are food crops that are produced primarily for domestic consumption.

Although there is some disagreement in the data, one estimate from house-

hold survey data (Uganda Bureau of Statistics 2007a, p. 46) suggests that

very large fractions agricultural households in Uganda were growing bananas

(73.1%), maize (85.8%), cassava (74.3%), and beans (80.8%).            Presumably
                                                           3
many households were growing several of these crops.

  2 The  bananas produced in Uganda are largely  though not exclusively  cooking
bananas that dier from the dessert bananas which represent a major global export
commodity. Uganda is a nearly neglibible exporter of bananas, ranking outside the top
thirty countries of the world in net exports.
   3 An earlier survey (Uganda Bureau of Statistics 2004, p. 7) suggested that 40% of
households grew cassava and beans, with 30% growing maize, sweet potato, and banana.
These data were drawn from an agricultural module added to the census. We prefer the
data taken from the Uganda National Household Survey, which appears to have done a
thorough job of documenting plot-level characteristics of agriculture.




                                         5
   Farms also typically include livestock. About 20 percent of farm house-

holds reported owning at least one cow; 30 percent reported keeping goats;

and 46 percent of households reported keeping chickens, mostly on a very

small scale (Uganda Bureau of Statistics 2004).

   Most small farms market some fraction of their output, with the fraction

varying by crop, by region, and by distance from markets.        For example,

households in 2005/06 reported selling 80 percent of the soybeans that they

produced and about half the maize; but only 32 percent of matoke, 23

percent of cassava and 16 percent of beans.     There is signicant variation

across regions in the fraction of agricultural households that are primarily in

subsistence, with government gures showing some regions  primarily those

near Kampala and with good market access to the city  having fewer than 70

percent of households in subsistence agriculture. In the more remote regions

of the country, over 80 percent of households are reported as deriving their

livelihoods from subsistence farming (Uganda Bureau of Statistics 2007b, p.

82).

   There is size heterogeneity among smallholder farms. This is presumably

linked to dierences in the fraction of output marketed. In household survey

data, about 20% of households farm more than 5 acres of land, with about

7% farming more than 10 acres.

   A small but active commercial agricultural sector also operates in Uganda.

One portion of the commercial sector consists of large farms that are typically

privately held. In 2006/07, the Uganda Bureau of Statistics reported nearly

400 ocially registered commercial farms, employing 28,000 workers (Uganda

Bureau of Statistics 2008, p. 142). Most of these businesses were quite small,

with half employing 5-9 workers, but about 60 were large farms employing 50

or more workers, and clearly a number were far larger, given a mean size of

70 workers. Most of the large farms specialized in animal agriculture, but of

the very large farms, most were in crop agriculture, producing horticultural

crops and grain, including tea, sugar, and cotton. One study in 1999 noted




                                      6
that the largest maize farm that could be identied by experts at the time

was 150 acres (60 ha) (Robbins and Ferris, 1999).

   The principal food crops are not traded much on international markets:

matoke, maize, cassava, yams, and other root crops. Of these, only maize is

traded to any signicant degree. The country does produce large amounts of

coee for export markets (along with smaller amounts of sugar and cotton),

but the fraction of land devoted to export commodities is relatively modest,

and some of these crops are produced on a scale comparable to that of basic

food crops.

   The major export crops  coee, tea, cotton, and sugar  together account

for under eight percent of cropped area (FAOSTAT, 2009). Of these, the most

important is coee, which is grown on over 3.5 million plots with an average

plot size of 0.16 hectares.   Even quasi-subsistence farmers often produce a

little coee for sale to the market.    But across the country, the bulk of

agricultural activity is devoted to producing food staples.

   Another way of measuring the fraction of Ugandan agriculture that is

devoted to domestic food production is to look at consumption. Imports of

grain account for about 2.1 percent of Uganda's total food energy.        Since

Uganda is a net exporter of pulses, sh, and some other commodities that

are domestically consumed, in a net sense, only 1.7 percent of total calorie

consumption depends on imported foods.

   Taking all these facts together, we will argue below that it is reasonable to

model Uganda's food economy using a closed economy representation. Even

though the country has a number of important agricultural exports, most of

the resources devoted to agriculture in Uganda are applied to the production

of food crops for domestic consumption, and by the same token, most of

domestic consumption needs are met from domestic production.




                                       7
2.2     Rural income and poverty

About three-quarters of Uganda's population live in rural areas, and most

make their livings from subsistence agriculture (Uganda Bureau of Statistics

2007b, pp.     16-17).    By most estimates, rural households in Uganda are

very poor. In 2005/06, 93.2 percent of Uganda's poor households (using a

headcount measure) were rural, somewhat higher than the 84.6 percent of

households in rural areas.         The poverty rate for rural households, using a

headcount measure, was 34.2 percent, which was almost triple the rate for

urban households (Uganda Bureau of Statistics 2006, p. 60). Median nominal

wages in rural areas are only one-third of the urban level also (Uganda Bureau
                               4
of Statistics 2007b, p. 19).

    Rural households allocated about 50 percent of their total expenditure to

food, drink, and tobacco  although the pricing of these goods is complicated,

since much of consumption is home produced (Uganda Bureau of Statistics

2006, pp. 56-59). About 15 percent of rural households had fewer than two

sets of clothes per household member, and only 43 percent reported that each

member of the household had a pair of shoes in good condition. Most house-

holds outside Kampala owned their own homes and furnishings, including a

radio or other electronic device. About 40 percent of rural households owned

a bicycle, but very few owned any other mode of transportation (Uganda

Bureau of Statistics 2006, pp. 94-95).

    Rural households primarily earn their livings from agriculture  but other

activities are also important. Almost 40 percent of rural households reported

operating informal non-crop enterprises in 2005/06, with most of these enter-

prises concentrated in trade (both wholesale and retail) and manufacturing

(Uganda Bureau of Statistics 2007b, p. 26).

    4 Of course the median wages may reect dierences in skill levels, hours worked, costs
of living, and other factors.




                                            8
2.3    Transaction costs and access to markets

Our paper will focus in part on the high transaction costs faced by rural

households in Uganda.      In particular, we explore the hypothesis that high

rural-to-urban transportation costs implicitly create incentives for poor peo-

ple to live close to their food sources  eectively reducing the real price of

food, which is their largest single expenditure category. This section of the

paper seeks to document and quantify the transportation costs involved in

moving goods from Uganda's rural areas to its cities.

   Like most countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Uganda has very low levels of

physical infrastructure and public services. All forms of physical infrastruc-

ture are underdeveloped, and this is widely cited as one of the country's main

constraints to development. The lack of infrastructure is particularly acute in

rural areas. Existing road networks leave many communities inaccessible by

vehicles, and very few rural residents have access to electricity or piped water.

(For example, less than one percent of rural households were estimated to

have access to grid-supplied electricity in 2000. A large number  perhaps a

majority  of towns and market centers also lacked electrical access.)

   The Government of Uganda has highlighted the need for infrastructure

development in a series of planning documents, including a series of Poverty

Eradication Action Plans and its most recent National Development Plan.

In addition, a consortium of donors, including the World Bank, the African

Development Bank, and several key national aid agencies, issued a Joint

Assistance Strategy for Uganda in 2006. This document identied the most

pressing needs for development investments in Uganda and agreed on a co-

ordinated set of programs, with rural transportation infrastructure featuring

high on the list of priorities.

   Spatial data suggest that more than three-quarters of Uganda's popula-

tion (78 percent) live two or more hours from a market center; 25 percent




                                       9
                                                5
live ve or more hours from a market.               In the most remote regions of the

country, transportation consists primarily of foot trac. People walk long

distances to markets and other services. For example, for the country as a

whole (including urban areas), the average distance to a government health

clinic was about 7 km, and 77 percent of people reported that they walked to

these clinics. In less remote areas, people make eective use of bicycles and

motorcycles. Cars, trucks, and buses traverse the limited network of major

roads.

    Measures of road length support the notion that Uganda's road network is

far behind those of developed countries. In 2003, Uganda reported a network
                                                                                     2
of paved roads consisting of 16,300 km in a land area of 200,000 km                      (CIA
                   6
Factbook 2009).        For a startling benchmark, we note that this was not much

greater than the paved road density found in Britain in AD 350, when the

retreating Roman Empire left a network of 12-15,000 km of paved roads in
                                2
a land area of 242,000 km           (Lay 1992, p. 55). In this specic sense, then,

Uganda lags Britain by almost two thousand years in the development of its

road infrastructure.

    Measures of roads and remoteness oer only an indirect view of trans-

portation and transaction costs. To get a more detailed look, we turn to two

types of data: price dispersion data and direct evidence on transportation

costs and marketing margins.




Price dispersion data


The poor quality of Uganda's road network corresponds directly to an en-

vironment of high transaction costs that contributes to high dispersion of

   5 Roads   are not the only form of infrastructure lacking from rural areas; in 2005/06,
only 9 percent of rural communities had any access to electricity.
   6 It is only fair to note  as any traveler in Africa can attest  that paved roads are not
necessarily better than unpaved roads; particularly when maintenance is poor, pavement
may actually provide a worse surface than dirt or gravel. In this sense, we hesitate to use
paved roads as a measure of transportation quality; nevertheless, we believe that this is a
useful proxy for a more general measure of transportation infrastructure.

prices at a moment in time across geographic space.       Although there are

many possible reasons for the spatial dispersion of prices (including various

forms of market power and collusion), these price wedges must, in some sense,

reect underlying transportation costs, or else the pressure would be great

to arbitrage away the price dierences.


Most of the available data on price dispersion are at the level of wholesale

or retail markets. Table 1 shows price dispersion across wholesale markets

for a number of crops at a single moment in time (the week of March 10-14,

2008). Each column of this table refers to a dierent wholesale market.

Most are in agricultural regions. The one exception is the Kalerwe market,

just north of Kampala, which is one of the major markets serving the

capital city. Several features of the data are immediately striking. First, the

spatial dispersion of prices is high. For matoke, the lowest wholesale price is

in Mbarara, in the southwest of the country, at 180 Ush/kg; the highest

price is at Lira, in the north central part of the country, where the same

commodity sold for 600 Ush/kg. The straight line distance between the two

markets is about 400 km; the estimated road distance is about 500 km. By

contrast, the prices in nearby Kisenyi (about 35 km distance) is much closer

to the Mbarara price, at 230 Ush/kg.




   Table 2 shows the full set of pairwise distances and price dierentials for

matoke between Mbarara and other markets. In general, distance from the

center of cultivation is closely linked to price level. A similar picture comes

from the market for potatoes  a crop for which there is a primary area of

production in southwestern Uganda near Kabale and Kasese and a secondary

area near Tororo in the east. As shown in Table 3, this leads to a generally

rising pattern of prices with distance from Kasese, although Tororo itself has

prices that reect the production in nearby Mbale and Kapchorwa districts.

   The same general patterns hold in the price data for other moments in

time.   Figure 1 shows monthly prices of matoke and sweet potatoes at six

major markets in Uganda from 1997 to 2006. It is apparent from the gure

that prices of matoke move together across markets over time, and the same

is true for sweet potatoes. (It also appears that the prices of the two starch

foods are themselves correlated.)   At any given moment in time, however,

the price spreads across markets for a given commodity are substantial. For

matoke, the major growing areas are in Mbarara, in the southwest, and

Mbale, in the southeast. These two markets typically have the lowest prices,

and the remote northwestern market of Gulu invariably has the highest prices.

The relative ordering of other markets is fairly stable and the price bands

separating dierent markets appear to remain relatively constant over time.

Even leaving aside the prices from Gulu, the width of the price band appears

to be consistently about 50-100 USh/kg, meaning that the prices in Kampala,

Jinja, and Mbale are often 60-70 percent higher than the prices in Mbarara.

For sweet potato, price spreads are similarly large.

   Table 4 provides information on the price bands across markets, based

on monthly price observations across the six major wholesale markets during

the year July 2005 to June 2006. The table shows the lowest of the six prices;

the ratio of the highest price to the lowest price; the average (across twelve

monthly observations) of the absolute gap in prices between the highest and

lowest, and the average of the absolute gap between the second highest and

second lowest prices.   These gaps are large, in general.   Averaging across

crops and across the whole year, nearly 300 USh/kg separated the most

expensive price from the least expensive price; and on average over 100

USh/kg separated the second highest price from the second lowest.

   The examples given here illustrate the point that prices of agricultural

commodities are related to the distances over which the goods need to move

 as well as to road quality and other factors that are not observed precisely.

For the purposes of this paper, we do not need to argue that all of the

price dierences across markets are due to actual transportation costs; we

acknowledge that there are many other factors causing dispersion of prices

across space. For instance, spatial dispersion of prices may reect policy bar-

riers, market power, and other factors. In Uganda's case, however, distance

and road conditions are immediate and clear features of reality.



Transport cost data


As an alternative to looking at geographic dispersion of prices, we can try

to measure transport costs directly.       In principle, shipping costs should

be observed directly without much diculty.         In practice, however, the

costs of shipping agricultural goods are closely associated with the costs of

grading, bagging, storing, and milling, among others. These costs can also

contribute to the price wedges between dierent market locations.       All of

these constitute distribution costs associated with moving food from rural to

urban areas. From our perspective, however, we will focus most closely on

the transportation costs, since these will play an explicit role in our model.

   The best source of data on shipping costs are agricultural marketing

studies, which have been done by a number of agencies  often with a view to

project interventions that aim to reduce marketing wedges between farmers

and consumers. A major 2002 study undertaken as part of the Government of

Uganda's Plan for the Modernization of Agriculture documented transaction

costs in the marketing process for six agricultural commodities: coee, cot-

ton, sh, maize, cassava, and dairy (Plan for Modernization of Agriculture,

2002). We focus on the marketing costs of the three domestically consumed

commodities.

   For maize, the study considers four rural districts, where farmgate prices

of maize ranged from 50 USh/kg (near Kapchorwa) to 65 USh/kg (near

Mbale). As shown in Table 5, transport from farmgate to primary market



                                      17
centers was estimated at 10 USh/kg. Further transport to secondary market

        i.e., district markets) cost an additional 5-10 USh/kg; other handling
centers (

costs  including labor charges for loading and unloading, bagging, storage,

and losses  added up to around 10 USh/kg of additional transport-related

cost. The price of maize at the secondary markets ranged from 90 USh/kg

to 105 USh/kg, implying a 60-85 percent increase relative to farmgate prices.

The study estimates that the total margins earned by traders and middlemen

accounted for close to 10 USh/kg in all cases; essentially all of the remaining

price wedges can be attributed to transportation and transaction costs. From

the secondary markets, maize moved to major wholesale markets in cities like

Mbale, Tororo and Kampala. Wholesale prices in these markets were 115-120

USh/kg, with all of the price wedges between secondary and tertiary markets

attributed to transportation costs (PMA 2002, pp. 119-21). Eventual retail

prices for milled maize our were 210-400 USh/kg, depending on quality.




   Summarizing, the farmgate prices of maize were 40-55 percent of urban

wholesale prices for unmilled maize. By far the largest part of the price gap

was attributed to explicit transport costs. Across the four rural districts, pure

transport costs of moving maize to wholesale markets were approximately

55 USh/kg  meaning that the farmgate price and the transport cost were

approximately the same.

   For cassava, marketing takes place in several forms. Cassava is sold to

market fresh, but it is also marketed as cassava chips (for subsequent milling

into our) and as our.     In all these forms, there are large price wedges

between farmers and markets, with transportation costs accounting for a

large fraction of the total. Table 6 reports data on the prices of cassava chips

at various points in the distribution and marketing chain. Farmgate prices

for cassava chips are 40-50 USh/Kg, compared to wholesale prices of 110-120

USh/Kg, implying that farmers receive 33% to 45% of the wholesale price.

   Similar gures can be found in the market for dried cassava, in which

farmers receive something less than one-third of the wholesale price, and in

which pure transport costs account for slightly more (4500 USh/100 Kg) than

the farmgate price (4000 USh/100Kg). Table 7 shows the other components

of the price wedge between farmgate and wholesale. Although gross margins

are large, net margins appear to be modest.

   For fresh cassava, too, transport costs may easily exceed farmgate prices.

By the time additional labor costs are added for loading, unloading, and bag-

ging, along with market fees and similar charges, the gap between farmgate

prices and wholesale prices may be large.    In some cases, farmers may sell

cassava standing in the eld. The purchaser provides the labor to dig up the

cassava and to market it. In these cases, the revenues received by farmers for

cassava in the eld are estimated to be just over 20% of the wholesale price.




   Taken together, the evidence for maize and cassava suggests that trans-

port costs and marketing margins are very high. Farmgate prices are often

signicantly less than half of wholesale prices, across many crops and regions.

Although these data are only suggestive, a similar conclusion emerges from re-

cent work by Svensson and Yanagizawa (2009) who calculate farmgate prices

for maize from the nationally representative Uganda National Household

Survey 2005. They nd that for the period July 2004-June 2005, the average

farmgate price of maize for households in a subset of maize-growing districts

was 188 USh/kg, compared to a district market price of 291 USh/kg. The

implied ratio of farmgate price to secondary market price is very similar to

the data included in Table 5.



A benchmark for costs: grain shipping in U.S. markets


To put the Ugandan data into perspective, it is useful to make a comparison

to data from the United States. First, consider the data on US corn prices

at major wholesale markets across the U.S., presented in Table 8.        In this

table, we consider several of the same measures used in Table 4, including

the ratio of the maximum price to the minimum.       It is striking that other

than the Gulf Ports, all the other major markets have prices for each year

that fall within a very narrow band. The average ratio of the highest price

to the lowest price, across the seven years of data, was 1.25. By comparison,

for maize in Uganda, the average ratio of the higest price to the lowest price

across six wholesale markets was 1.61, even though the geographic distance

between markets was much smaller in Uganda. The gap between the second

highest price and the second lowest price averaged 10% of the minimum price

in the US, compared with 27% of the minimum price for Uganda.




   Next, consider the unit costs of transporting 100 kg of maize a distance of

100 km from farm to market. For the U.S., as of 2009, a standard calculation



                                      23
used for farm-to-market transportation costs in the U.S. was $0.285/bushel

per 100 miles. This is equivalent to $0.65 per 100 kg/100 km. For Uganda,

by contrast, the cost associated with moving maize from the farmgate to a

secondary market was about 20 USh/kg in 2002. At the prevailing exchange

rate of 1738 USh/$US, and assuming that on average farms were 50 km from

the relevant market center, this corresponds to a unit transport cost of $2.30

per 100 kg/100 km. This is approximately four times the unit cost in the US.

If we assume instead that an average farm was only 25 km from the market

center  which is perhaps a more reasonable estimate  the unit transport

cost rises to $4.60 per 100 kg/100 km, which is about seven times the cost

in the US.

   Similar results emerge from comparisons of shipping costs between whole-

sale markets (as opposed to farm-to-market transport). To ship maize from

Minneapolis to St. Louis, a distance of 560 miles, cost an average of about

$0.305/bushel in 2002-08. This corresponds to a total cost of about $0.125

per 100 kg/ 100 km. To ship maize from Gulu to Jinja, by comparison, is a

distance of 426 km by road. The implied cost per 100 kg/ 100 km is $15.74,

about two orders of magnitude greater than the bulk transport rate in the
      7
US.

   A conclusion from this analysis is that transport costs at all levels are high

in Uganda. Transport costs, along with related storage and handling charges,

appear to account for large fractions of the price wedges between farm and

market, as well as the price wedges between markets. We make no judgment

here as to the extent of market power in this sector. Some analyses suggest

that traders behave non-competitively, especially on long-distance routes,

but the reported net margins in trading do not appear to be unreasonable,

and there is robust (though not free) entry and exit from the markets.

  7 The  comparison is perhaps somewhat unfair; in the US, barge transport helps to
reduce the costs of moving grain along this route. But to some extent, the problem in
Uganda is precisely the lack of alternatives to (low quality) roads .

3     Related literature
This paper has roots in several strands of economic literature. Our theoretical

framework is most closely related to recent work on structural transformation

and economic growth. We also draw on a large body of previous literature

that deals with the issue of transportation and transaction costs.



3.1      Structural transformation and the movement out of

         subsistence agriculture

Modern economic growth is accompanied by a number of changes in the

structural characteristics of production  including changes in the types of

goods produced, the size and organization of establishments, and the role

of home production (Buera and Kaboski 2008).         Changes in the sectoral

composition of output are perhaps the most visible feature of the structural

transformation.   As economies grow, they move out of agriculture into in-

dustry and services. This empirical regularity was documented by Kuznets

(1966) Chenery and Syrquin (1975), and others (e.g., Syrquin 1988).         In

fact, much early writing viewed development as essentially identical with the

movement of people out of quasi-subsistence agriculture and into modern

economic activities (e.g., Rosenstein-Rodan 1943, Rostow 1960, and Lewis

1955).

    What role does agricultural productivity play in this process? Some early

development economist argued that growth depends on an economy's ability

to generate an agricultural surplus  in other words, to reach a level of

labor productivity such that farmers can produce substantial quantities in

excess of their own food needs and can thereby support urban populations.

T.W. Schultz (1953) characterized this challenge as the food problem fac-

ing poor countries.   Schultz's view was later echoed in writings by many

economists who argued that agricultural productivity increases drive the

structural transformation; e.g., Johnston and Mellor (1961), Johnston (1970),



                                      25
Johnston and Kilby (1975) and Timmer (1988), and Johnson (1997). The

same theme gures prominently in the later works of Mellor (1995, 1996)

and the analyses of many other scholars (e.g., Eswaran and Kotwal 1993,

Mundlak 2000).

   In recent years, a number of papers have used two-sector growth models

to examine this process in greater detail. A number of papers have sought to

show how a growth model can generate changes in the sectoral composition

of output (e.g., Echevarria 1995, Echevarria 1997, Kogel and Prskawetz 2001,

Irz and Roe 2005, and Kongsamut, Rebelo and Xie 2001. A related set of

papers sought to model the structural transformation in a one-sector econ-

omy, focusing on the transition from a low-growth or no-growth traditional

economy to a modern Solow economy. Among these papers are King and

Rebelo (1993); Goodfriend and McDermott (1998); Laitner (2002); Hansen

and Prescott (2002); Ngai (2004); and Ngai and Pissarides (2007).

   Although these models can generate structural transformations, they

have some diculty in explaining the coexistence of a rich (modern) sector

and a poor (traditional) agricultural sector. The dualism of developing

economies is puzzling.   Why do labor and capital not move more rapidly

across sectors? As argued by Buera and Kaboski (2008), theories of dualistic

economies may need to assume sector-specic distortions or more general

market failures. For example, Temple (2005) and Vollrath (2009a, 2009b),

among others, have explored multi-sector models in which unemployment

or underemployment is possible. In these papers, there may be xed urban

wages or other rigidities that prevent the urban labor market from clear-

ing. Caselli and Coleman (2001) use a framework in which transaction cost

wedges prevent the labor market from equalizing marginal products across

sectors.   Dekle and Vandenbroucke (2006) similarly focus on distortions in

labor markets. A slightly dierent approach is found in Restuccia, Yang, and

Zhu (2007) and Herrendorf and Teixera (2008), who consider the impact of

distortions in the cost of farm inputs. These papers have the feature that the




                                     26
allocation of resources across sectors is inecient; the social planner would

allocate labor and capital dierently.

   Gollin et al. (2002, 2007) use models in which the allocation is ecient.

They follow Schultz in assuming that many poor countries need to tie down

large amounts of labor and other resources in food production.       Countries

that have low agricultural productivity  which could be due to poor tech-

nology, geography, or institutions  may sustain large dierences in average

productivity across sectors.



3.2    Transportation and transaction costs

Within the recent literature on structural transformation, few papers have

addressed the role of transportation or the costs of moving goods between

rural and urban areas. By contrast, transport cost has been a major topic

in the international trade literature, as well as in the empirical literature

on development economics. In the development policy literature, too, many

donor organizations have directed attention and resources to the issue of rural

transportation infrastructure. Transport costs also gure prominently in the

agricultural economics literature, where there is a long tradition of studying

marketing margins and farm-to-market value chains, in which transportation

costs are prominent.

   In the growth literature, our paper is related to recent work by Herren-

dorf, Schmitz, and Teixeira (2006, 2008).     It is also somewhat related to

Adamopoulos (2006), who uses a model with transportation costs to conduct

a development accounting exercise.

   In the development literature, many papers have looked at the impact

of roads and infrastructure on development in Africa and other regions of

the developing world.   This includes theoretical papers along with a num-

ber of recent policy and empirical papers, such as Platteau (1996), Limão

and Venables (1999), Fan and Hazell (2001), Fan and Chan-Kang (2004),

Torero and Chowdhury (2004), Renkow et al. (2004), Zhang and Fan (2004),



                                      27
Calderón (2009) and Minten and Stifel (2008). Many of these papers rely on

cross-section regressions at the country or district level. There are obviously

dicult identication problems with this approach.

   Most analyses conclude that Africa suers from a substantial decit in

transportation infrastructure, and studies along these lines have been used

to advocate increases in spending on road construction and road mainte-

nance.   A consortium of donors have consequently established the African

Infrastructure Country Diagnostic (AICD) to share knowledge and mobilize

funding for further investments in infrastructure. One AICD document calls

for an additional $31 billion annually on infrastructure spending in Africa;

another paper calls for $20 billion annually in spending on transportation

infrastructure, including both capital improvements and maintenance of ex-

isting stocks.

   Some observers have argued that transportation infrastructure is less of

an issue in Africa than market imperfections and collusion in the transport

sector. Raballand and Macchi (2009) have argued that trucking companies

do not face particularly high costs of vehicle operation (and in fact face

very low labor costs), but that the prices they charge to customers reect

substantial markups that reect cartelization in transport. Related work by

Gachassin et al. (2010) questions the likely impact of road investments on

rural poverty, noting that in a study from Cameroon, rural infrastructure

investments were not linked to increases in consumption expenditure. The

authors argue that road improvements are most likely to have value in areas

where they can support non-agricultural activities rather than in areas of

smallholder farming.



Transportation and agricultural marketing in Uganda


Concerns over high transportation costs and marketing margins date back

many decades in Uganda.     Colonial governments viewed road construction

as one of the priorities for the expansion of markets, and for an extended



                                      28
period, the colonial government required communities to provide forced labor

for road construction and maintenance. Roads remain a concern of today's

Ugandan government.    As noted above, the existing road network is poor,

but expansion is likely to be expensive.   Road construction is expensive.

Carrothers et al. (2008) calculate that a program of road construction and

maintenance that would expand Uganda's network of all-weather roads so

that 75% of the population would be able to access such a road within a

distance of 2 km would require spending of 3.6% of GDP annually for a

period of ten years. Even a more modest goal (50% of the population, with

lower-quality roads) would require 2.2% of GDP annually.

    Our paper relates to an issue raised by Raballand et al.     (2009), who

have argued that improvements in rural roads in Uganda would have little

impact because productivity levels are too low to justify more frequent or

heavier trac. Their paper takes productivity levels as xed; ours considers

the connections between improvements in transportation, changes in input

and output prices, and the resulting changes in yield and production.




4    Model
In this section we lay out a sequence of models that serve to highlight

several forces that inuence the allocation of workers to agriculture.    We

start with a simple version of the model in Gollin   et al.   (2002) and then

extend this model along several dimensions.    We believe that developing

these models sequentially serves to highlight the underlying economic forces

in a more transparent and intuitive fashion. We note here that our analysis

will exclusively focus on models of closed economies.    The essence of this

assumption is that an economy needs to be able to produce sucient food to

feed its population. As described previously in Section 2.1, this assumption

seems reasonable for an economy like Uganda, which is the focus of our




                                    29
analysis. Uganda imports relatively little of the basic food items that serves

to sustain the vast majority of its population.

     Looking ahead, some of the specications that we analyze implicitly create

an incentive for Uganda to import basic foodstus from abroad.                    Under-

standing why this does not occur is an important issue. Consistent with our

general focus on transportation infrastructure, we believe that an important

element of the explanation has to do with the dicult logistics of importing

food into a landlocked country with very poor transportation infrastructure.

Nonetheless, in our models we simply rule out trade and focus on allocations

within a closed economy.



4.1      A Benchmark Model

We begin with a static version of the model in Gollin              et al.   (2002).   The

basic setup is as follows. There is a measure one of identical agents. Each

individual has preferences over two goods, which we label as agriculture (a)
                                       8
and manufacturing (m), given by :



                                  u(a − ā) + v(m + m̄)                               (4.1)



where    u and v are both increasing, strictly concave functions and ā and m̄ are
both strictly positive. The key feature of these preferences is the presence

of the   ā   and   m̄   terms, which serve to make the income elasticity of the

agricultural good less than one and that of the manufactured good greater
              9
than one.         Gollin et al (2002) consider the special case where the function

u   has the property that it is minus innity if        a − ā is negative and equal
to a constant for all nonnegative values of          a − ā. The implication of this
    8 While  we follow the tradition of refering to the nonagricultural good as the
manufacturing good, it should be intepreted as representing both the manufacturing and
the service sectors.
   9 It is sucient that at least one of ā or m̄ be greater than zero for this property to
hold. Having both positive allows for the possibility of a corner solution in which m = 0.



                                            30
specication is that individuals will consume exactly             ā   units of food. While

not essential, this simplies the analytics and increases the transparency

of the key economic forces.          In our quantitative work we will consider a

more general specication in which individuals also value consumption of

the agricultural good beyond         ā.
     The economy is endowed with one unit of land and each individual is

endowed with one unit of time. We assume that land ownership is equally

distributed across the population. The technology for producing the manu-

factured good is given by:

                                           m = A m nm                                  (4.2)


where      nm    is the number of workers that work in the manufacturing sector,

and the technology for producing the agricultural good is given by:



                                       a = Aa Lθ na1−θ                                 (4.3)



where     na     is the number of workers that work in the agricultural sector and         l
is land. We assume that the economy is able to produce sucient amounts

of   a   so as to provide all individuals with at least       ā units   of the agricultural

good. A sucient condition for this is that             Aa > ā.
     We study the competitive equilibrium allocation for this economy, which

can be obtained by solving the Social Planner's problem in which the utility of

a representative household is maximized subject to the feasibility constraints.

This turns out to be somewhat trivial given the extreme form of preferences

that we have assumed. In particular, given that everyone needs to consume

exactly     ā   units of the agricultural good, but receives no benet from con-

suming any additional amount, the optimal allocation is to allocate enough

workers to the agricultural sector so as to produce           ā for each individual in the
economy, and then to allocate all remaining workers to the manufacturing




                                               31
sector. It follows that the optimal value for        na    is given by:


                                            ā 1/(1−θ)
                                   na = [      ]       .                          (4.4)
                                            Aa

The key implication of this model is that in an economy in which food is

a necessity, there is a powerful negative relationship between agricultural

TFP and employment in agriculture. In particular, a one percent decrease

in agricultural TFP   Aa    will lead to an even larger percentage increase in

employment in agriculture, equal to         1/(1 − θ).
   We next extend this simple model in order to illustrate two additional

economic mechanisms that are potentially important determinants of the

allocation of labor to agriculture.



4.2    Intermediate Goods In Agriculture

We modify the previous model by assuming that the output of the man-

ufacturing sector can be used either for consumption or as an input in

the production of the agricultural good.             Let    x   denote the input of the

manufactured good used in the agricultural sector. To simplify the exposition

we again restrict attention to an agricultural production function that is

Cobb-Douglas:

                              a = Aa l(1−θx −θn ) xθx nθan .                      (4.5)


The Social Planner's problem for this economy is not as trivial as in the

previous model, since there is now a decision about the input mix that is

used to produce the required amount of agricultural output. Specically, the

Social Planner now seeks to solve:



                        max v(Am (1 − na ) − x + m̄)
                           na ,x


subject to:

                                    ā = Aa xθx nθan

                                            32
This problem amounts to maximizing the consumption of the non-agricultural

good subject to making sure that food requirements are met.                       Given our

assumption of a Cobb-Douglas production function the solution for                        x   will

necessarily be interior.       Letting    λa   be the Lagrange multiplier on the con-

straint, the rst order conditions for an interior solution are given by:



                  v 0 (Am (1 − na ) − x + m̄)Am = λa θn Aa xθx naθn −1                    (4.6)



                    v 0 (Am (1 − na ) − x + m̄) = λa θx Aa xθx −1 nθan                    (4.7)


Dividing the two equations by each other yields:


                                                 θn x
                                          Am =                                            (4.8)
                                                 θ x na

which implies that the optimal choice of             x   for a given choice of   na   satises:


                                                    θx
                                         x = Am        na                                 (4.9)
                                                    θn

It follows that we can rewrite the Social Planner's problem as:


                                                            θx
                        max v(Am (1 − na ) − Am                na + m̄)
                          na                                θn

subject to:

                                ā = Aa Aθmx (θx /θn )θx naθn +θx

Because   na   is the only choice variable it follows that the constraint eectively

determines the value of        na ,   just as in the previous model, with the solution

given by:
                                               1 1/(θn +θx )
                                   na = B[           ]                                   (4.10)
                                             Aa Aθmx
where   B = [ āθ
               θx
                 n 1/(θn +θx )
                  ]            .      The key result is that in this extended model,

low productivity in either the agricultural or the manufacturing sector can

give rise to increased employment in the agricultural sector. However, it is


                                               33
important to note that the elasticity of       na with respect to Am is smaller than
the elasticity of   na   with respect to   Aa by a factor of θx .
   The above analysis has focused on optimal allocations taking as given the

productivity of the economy in each of the two sectors. It is important to note

that while the above argument stressed low productivity in the manufacturing

sector as a factor leading to high employment in agriculture, the exact same

logic shows that policies that increase the relative price of the intermediate

good used in the agricultural sector would have the same eects.



4.3    Transportation Costs

In this subsection we abstract from intermediate inputs in agricultural pro-

duction, but consider a dierent extension of the basic model described above.

In particular, we consider a model in which production of agriculture and

manufacturing goods takes place in dierent locations and it is costly to

transport these goods between locations.           Specically, the two production

technologies are as in the simple model that we described initially:



                                    a = Aa lθ na1−θ                            (4.11)



                                     m = A m nm                                (4.12)


Workers reside in the location in which they work, and must consume goods

delivered to that location.       For simplicity, we assume that transportation

costs take the form of iceberg costs and are symmetric, i.e., the cost of

transporting   m    from one region to the other is the same as transporting        a
from one region to the other. We denote this cost by           q.   We abstract from

moving costs for individuals and hence do not need to specify the initial

location of workers. We discuss this in more detail below. Letting           am   and

aa denote the consumption of agricultural goods of workers in          region m   and

a respectively, and similarly for ma and mm , feasibility now            requires the




                                            34
following:
                                            am
                          na aa + (1 − na )       = Aa lθ na1−θ                               (4.13)
                                         (1 − q)
                                              ma
                           (1 − na )mm + na         = Am nm                                   (4.14)
                                            (1 − q)
       We again consider the Social Planner's problem for this economy. The

presence of the location decision gives rise to a nonconvexity in this economy,

which means that optimal allocations will not necessarily equate utilities

across individuals in dierent locations. We assume that the transfers across

individuals that are implicitly part of supporting such an allocation as an

equilibrium are taken care of within the family, so that we are viewing the

economy as consisting of many families, each of which has many members.

In equilibrium each family behaves the same way. This assumption serves to

simplify the analysis by allowing us to better focus on the role of transporta-

tion costs for goods, and is not critical for our results. Our main result is

that transportation costs also have the eect of inducing a larger allocation

of workers to the agricultural sector. If we were to assume that all individuals

begin in the agricultural location and it is costly for an individual to move

to the other location, this would simply reinforce this result.

       It remains true that the Social Planner needs to allocate workers so that

each worker obtains        ā   units of the agricultural good.           From the feasibility

condition for the agricultural good it follows that there is a unique value of

na     that is consistent with this outcome. Specically, setting             aa   and   am   equal

to   ā   in this expression yields:


                                         q     ā
                                na ā       =     − Aa n1−θ
                                                        a                                     (4.15)
                                        1−q   1−q

It follows that decreases in            Aa   and increases in    q   both lead to increases in

na .   Considering the case in which           θ = 0 provides some additional insight.           In

this case we obtain:
                                                       ā
                                        na =                                                  (4.16)
                                               āq + (1 − q)Aa

                                                  35
From this expression there are three results of interest. First, as in the initial

model model, a decrease in        Aa   leads to an increase in       na .   Second, whereas

in the case of no transportation costs (i.e.,         q = 0)   this elasticity is equal to

negative one, when       q > 0   the elasticity is less than one in absolute value.

Third, an increase in transportation costs leads to an increase in    na , since
our maintained assumption for an interior solution for na is that Aa > ā. The

elasticity of na with respect to q is given by (Aa − ā)/(āna ). The intuition

for these results is straightforward. Transportation costs imply that it takes

agricultural production in excess of       ā   in order to support an individual who

resides in the manufacturing sector.            It follows that if transportation costs

increase, then holding the labor allocation xed will result in a shortage of

agricultural production, thereby necessitating an increase in labor allocated

to agricultural production.         It follows that holding all else constant, an

economy with greater transportation costs will have a greater fraction of

its employment in the agricultural sector.            The eect of changes in       Aa   are

also muted by the presence of transportation costs. When               θ = 0 and there are
no transportation costs, a one percent increase in             Aa   leads to a one percent

decrease in   na   since the same amount of food can now be produced by one

percent fewer workers. In an economy with transportation costs it remains

true that the same amount of output can be produced by one percent fewer

workers, but when more individuals move from the agricultural sector to the

manufacturing sector, it is necessary to transport more food, and therefore

the decrease in    na   is necessarily less.



4.4    The Interaction of Intermediate Inputs

       and Transportation Costs

To simplify exposition we have thus far considered intermediate inputs and

transportation costs in isolation from each other. However, there is an inter-

action between the two which is important to point out. In our analysis of the

intermediate input case we showed that low productivity in the production of


                                               36
intermediates acted in a similar fashion (though with a smaller magnitude) to

low productivity in agriculture in terms of how it inuences the allocation of

labor. We commented at the end of that section that a policy distortion that

serves to increase the relative price of the intermediate good would have the

same eects. In this section we show that the introduction of transportation

costs into a model with intermediate inputs in agriculture necessarily creates

this same eect. The intuition is simple: if intermediate goods need to be

transported to the agricultural region, then increases in transportation costs

serve to decrease use of intermediates, thereby reducing labor productivity

in that sector. In this section we quickly show this formally, in the simplest

setting possible.   Specically, our starting point will be the intermediate

good model studied in the previous subsection, extended to assume that

there is a cost associated with transporting intermediate goods for use in

agriculture. To facilitate exposition, we abstract from transportation costs

associated with moving the nal goods between locations. Given there is no

cost associated with moving nal goods between locations, the social planner

will allocate the same nal consumption allocation to all individuals.

   The Social Planner now seeks to solve:


                                                x
                      max v(Am (1 − na ) −         + m̄)
                       na ,x                   1−q

subject to:

                                 ā = Aa xθx nθan

The presence of transportation costs for the intermediate input in agriculture

implies that using one more unit of     x   in the agricultural sector implies a

greater than one unit sacrice in terms of nal consumption of the non-

agricultural good. Proceeding just as before and letting    λa   be the Lagrange

multiplier on the constraint, the rst order conditions for an interior solution




                                       37
are given by:


                                         x
                 v 0 (Am (1 − na ) −        + m̄)Am = λa θn Aa xθx nθan −1                (4.17)
                                        1−q
                                  x
           v 0 (Am (1 − na ) −       + m̄) = (1 − q)λa θx Aa xθx −1 nθan                  (4.18)
                                 1−q
Dividing the two equations by each other yields:


                                                1 θn x
                                      Am =                                                (4.19)
                                             (1 − q) θx na

which implies that the optimal choice of              x   for a given choice of   na   satises:


                                                          θx
                                      x = (1 − q)Am          na                           (4.20)
                                                          θn

Relative to our earlier derivations, we see the intuitive result that a higher

value of   q reduces the ratio intermediate input use relative to labor.               Proceed-

ing just as before, it follows that we can rewrite the Social Planner's problem

as:
                                                                  θx
                     max v(Am (1 − na ) − (1 − q)Am                  na + m̄)
                      na                                          θn
subject to:

                           ā = Aa (1 − q)θx Aθmx (θx /θn )θx nθan +θx

Because    na   is the only choice variable it follows that the constraint eectively

determines the value of        na ,   just as in the previous model, with the solution

given by:
                                                1
                            na = B[                           ]1/(θn +θx )                (4.21)
                                        Aa Aθmx (1   − q)θx
where    B = [ āθ
                θx
                  n 1/(θn +θx )
                   ]            . The key result is that in this extended              model, a

lower   value for (1 − q) operates just like a decrease in Am .




                                               38
4.5    Summary

The key message from the above analysis is to note three channels which can

lead to greater allocation of labor to the agricultural sector. The rst channel

is low TFP in agriculture. The second channel is low TFP in the production

of an intermediate good used in the agricultural sector (or equivalently, a

policy that raises the relative price of this input). The third channel is higher

transportation costs. Two results of interest emerge from the above analysis

concerning the size of these eects. First, in a model without transportation

costs, the magnitude of the second channel is likely to be much smaller than

the rst channel, since the second channel is reduced relative to the rst

by a factor equal to the factor share of the intermediate good. Second, the

presence of transportation costs tends to decrease the magnitude of the rst

channel and increase the magnitude of the second channel.




5     Quantitative Analysis
The previous analysis has formally demonstrated three dierent channels

that inuence the allocation of labor to the agricultural sector in a setting

in which some minimal amount of food is required. The goal of this section

is to carry out a quantitative analysis to provide some information regarding

the relative magnitudes of these eects, as well as to measure the welfare

eects associated with these three channels. In this section we consider a two

sector model along the lines of the ones considered in the previous section,

allowing for both intermediate goods as inputs into the agricultural sector,

as well as symmetric transport costs   q   that apply to movement of both nal

and intermediate goods across locations.      For our quantitative analysis we

generalize preferences so that food consumption is not necessarily equal to    ā:

                      α log(a − ā) + (1 − α) log(m + m̄)                  (5.1)




                                       39
We continue to assume a Cobb-Douglas production function for agriculture,

dened over land (l ), intermediates (x) and labor (na ):



                     a = Aa F (l, x, na ) = Aa l1−θx −θn xθx nθn                 (5.2)



Assuming that the land endowment is normalized to one, feasibility is deter-

mined by the two constraints:




                                           am
                   na aa + (1 − na )             = Aa F (1, x, na )              (5.3)
                                         (1 − q)

                                     ma       x
              (1 − na )mm + na            +        = Am (1 − na )                (5.4)
                                   (1 − q) (1 − q)
   We solve a Social Planner's problem for this economy, which as noted

earlier, can be understood as the competitive equilibrium allocation that

would emerge if we interpret our model as consisting of a large number of

households each with a large number of members, where households maximize

the average utility of their members.            As noted earlier, the presence of

the nonconvexity associated with the discrete location choice coupled with

transportation costs implies that not all household members will end up with

the same utility. This implies that households are implicitly making transfers

across family members.

   Many of the results that we derived in the previous section continue to

hold in this model that features a more general utility function. In particular,

given an allocation of labor across the two locations and a choice of        x   that

is feasible given the choice of   na ,   we can derive closed form solutions for the

consumption allocations. In particular, we have:


                                                            q
                     aa = Aa F (1, x, na ) − (1 − na )ā                         (5.5)
                                                           1−q

                       am = (1 − q)Aa F (1, x, na ) + na qā                     (5.6)


                                            40
As noted earlier, when       m̄ > 0,     it is possible that the solution for   ma   will be

zero even when there is positive production of the manufacturing good net

of inputs into the agricultural sector.              This is easily incorporated into the

analysis. Specically, we have:


                                                         x
           ma = max{(1 − q)[Am (1 − na ) −                  ] − (1 − na )m̄q, 0}        (5.7)
                                                        1−q
                                     x           q                x
 mm = max{Am (1 − na ) −                + na m̄     , Am −                  }           (5.8)
                                    1−q         1−q        (1 − na )(1 − q)
It follows that consumption in each location is biased toward consumption

of the good produced in that location.

   For a given value of      na , and using the above allocation rules, increasing x
shifts the overall consumption bundle as well as production from the manufac-

tured good toward the agricultural good. The optimal choice of                x will equate
the marginal rate of substitution between consumption of agriculture and

manufacturing to the marginal rate of transformation between the two, taking

into account transportation costs and the rule for allocating consumption

within the family. A simple calculation shows that if all solutions are interior,

then the choice of    x   should be such that the following holds:


                               (1 − α) (aa − ā)
                                                 = Aa F2                                (5.9)
                                  α (ma + m̄)

where the solutions for      aa    and   ma   are those derived above.

   We now turn to the quantitative analysis. We choose parameters so that

the model captures some features of the Ugandan economy. The technology

parameters   Aa   and     Am   can be set to to one without loss of generality as

this simply amounts to a choice of units. We also normalize the size of the

population to equal one.           For our benchmark results we set           θx = .2    and

θn = .4,   implying a share for land that is also equal to            .4.   The preference

parameter   α   is set to   .20.

     Ifā and m̄ were zero, then expenditure shares would provide information
on   α. The parameters ā and m̄ become less relevant as a country becomes
richer, so looking at expenditure shares for rich countries does provide infor-

mation about         α   if we assume that preferences are the same across countries.

If we were interpreting the agricultural sector output exclusively as food,

then expenditure shares in a rich country such as the US would suggest that

our value of   α     is somewhat on the high side, but we think it is reasonable to

have a broader notion of agricultural output that also includes clothing for

example, thereby motivating the somewhat higher value for                             α.   In terms of

how they inuence labor allocations, the parameters                  ā   and   m̄    have the same

eect, which is to lead to a greater allocation of labor to agriculture holding

all else constant. In view of this we set           m̄ = 0 in our benchmark specication
and rely on     ā   to achieve the desired allocation of labor.                In particular, we

will choose   ā so that roughly 80% of the population works in the agricultural
sector, consistent with the allocation of labor in Uganda. The nal parameter

to be set is the transportation cost parameter               q.   For our benchmark results

we set    q = .5.    In the decentralized equilibrium, this would imply that prices

of agricultural goods in the urban region are twice as high as in the rural

area. This dispersion is consistent with the evidence for Uganda presented

in Section 2. Table 9 displays the equilibrium allocation that results from

our calibrated economy.




     We now consider the eects of changes in several of the model's param-

eters for the equilibrium allocations and welfare. Our measure of welfare is

standard. Specically, let the benchmark equilibrium have                       n∗a   workers in the

agricultural sector and a consumption allocation to be       (a∗a , m∗a , a∗m , m∗m )   and

suppose that the new allocation that emerges from a particular change in

the economy is given by n0a , a0a , m0a , a0m , m0m . We then ask what proportional
                                            ∗    ∗   ∗   ∗
change in the consumption bundle (aa , ma , am , mm ),holding the labor alloca-

tion na xed, would yield the same average utility as generated by the new

allocation.

   In our qualitative analysis we considered three key driving forces for the

allocation of labor to agriculture: TFP in agriculture, TFP in manufacturing

and transportation costs. We begin by exploring the impact of a ten percent

improvement in each of these variables in isolation.        Table 10 presents the

results.




   Several points are worth noting.        First, consistent with our theoretical

analysis, all three changes result in a decline in the fraction of the population

in the agricultural sector. Moreover, the ratio of     θx   to   θx + θn   is one third

and the eect of a ten percent increase in manufacturing TFP on labor

allocated to agriculture is roughly one third the size of the eect from a

ten percent increase in    Aa .   The eect of a ten percent improvement in

transportation has an impact on labor allocated to agriculture that is roughly

80%   as large as the ten percent increase in agricultural TFP. At least in this

parameterization, the eects of improvements in transportation technology

seem to be of roughly similar importance to equivalent improvements in



                                        43
agricultural TFP, and are more important than improvements in the TFP

for producing intermediate goods.         This last result was predicted by our

theoretical analysis, since we saw in the previous section that one of the

eects of a ten percent improvement in transportation is to mimic a ten

percent improvement in the TFP for producing intermediates, but that there

are additional eects as well.

       The welfare eects associated with these changes are very largefor exam-

ple, a ten percent increase in   Aa leads to a welfare increase of more than 30%.
From a mechanical perspective, note that the source of this large increase is

mostly attributable to the fact that although the increase in the consumption

levels is small, it represents a large percentage change in      m.   Specically, for

the case of the increase in   Aa , the value of m   more than doubles for workers in

both locations. To understand why a ten percent improvement in technology

in only one sector can have such a large eect, it is important to note that

the welfare eect is highly nonlinear due to the presence of the          ā   term. For

example, if we considered the welfare increase associated with changing               Aa
by ten percent starting from a value of         Aa = 2     instead of   Aa = 1,       and

holding all other parameters xed, then the welfare increase is only about

half as large. Aside from noting the large welfare increases associated with

small improvements in technology at low levels of development, it is also

worth noting that the welfare eects associated with the increase in             Aa   are

the largest in this economy, but that the welfare gain from a decrease in               q
is also very substantial. Given that the economy devotes         80%    of its labor to

the agricultural sector, it should not be surprising that the welfare eect of

a change in    Am   is substantially lower than that associated with a change in

Aa .
       There are two dierent channels through which changes in            q   inuence

welfare.     One eect is that fewer resources are used in transportation.             A

second eect is that consumption allocations are smoother across locations.

It is of interest to know what the relative importance of these two eects

is. It turns out that the second eect is extremely small: if we compute the

utility gain associated with smoothing consumption across locations, keeping

total consumption constant, then the welfare gain is only     .003.
   It is also instructive to notice how the consumption allocation changes to

better appreciate the dierent mechanisms at work. Table 10 shows that in

each case the consumption allocation increases along all dimensions, with the

increase in consumption being the greatest for the increase in     Aa .   However,

the increase in intermediates used in agriculture is actually smallest for this

case. As noted earlier, the cases of increases in   Am   and decreases in   q   both

serve to decrease the relative price of intermediates, and therefore lead to a

larger increase in intermediate usage relative to the case of an increase in     Aa .
   The last row of Table 10 reports the eects of having two of the changes

occur simultaneously.     The eect on the allocation of labor is roughly the

sum of the two individual eects, but the improvement in welfare is much

larger than the sum of the eects.     This indicates a signicant interaction

eect between the two types of changes.

   We next consider the eects of an increase in population size. It turns

out that in a model with a xed factor and food requirements, an increase in

population pushes not only more people into agriculture but also a greater

fraction of the population into this sector.   This suggests that population

increases (relative to available land) are also potentially an important factor

in understanding the dynamics of labor allocation and productivity. Table

   The rst row of Table 11 reports the results for a ten percent increase in

population. We note that not only does this lead to a lower fraction of people

in the manufacturing sector, but also that the absolute size of the population

in this sector also decreases. There is also a    modest decrease in welfare as-

sociated with a ten percent increase in population. Note that although fewer

workers are working in the manufacturing sector, use of intermediate inputs

in agriculture actually increases as a result of the population increase. The

next row asks what increase in productivity in the agricultural sector would

be required in order to oset the change in the fraction of the population in

agricultural due to the ten percent population increase. The answer turns

out to be an increase of   3.8%.   As this row shows, in this case the rest of the

consumption allocation is also identical to that in the benchmark specication

so that there is no net change in welfare either. But this table illustrates an

important nding, which is that in the presence of a xed amount of land,

population increases require fairly substantial improvements in agricultural

productivity just to maintain a constant share of the workforce devoted to

agriculture.

   The next issue we examine is how improvements in transportation (or

lack thereof ) inuence a develop path. Table 12 reports the results.




   The second row shows that consequences of a doubling of TFP in both of

the productive sectors. As the table shows, this had dramatic eects on the

allocation of labor, the level of consumption and on welfare. In particular,

the share of labor devoted to agriculture is more than cut in half, and the


                                         46
welfare increase is roughly a factor of ten.     As in standard models, large

improvements in TFP lead to large improvements in welfare.             The third

row shows how the development path is altered if we assume that the large

improvements in TFP in the two productive sectors are accompanied by

an equivalent improvement in the transportation technology.           The results

are quite dramatic.     In addition to producing an additional decline in the

agricultural share of the workforce by roughly a third, we see that the welfare

gain is almost doubled.     Comparing the second and third rows, one can

conclude that the consequences for development of neglecting transportation

are very substantial. A simple calculation that serves to quantify this is the

following. Taking the third row of Table 12 as a benchmark, we can ask how

large would the improvements in       the TFP parameters   Aa   and   Am   need to

be in order to achieve the same movement of labor out of agriculture if there

were no associated improvements in transportation. The answer is that they

would have to increase to   2.8   in order to achieve this same outcome.




6    Three Region Analysis
A distinctive feature of agriculture in Uganda is its heterogeneity. As doc-

umented earlier, while a high percentage of individuals do subsistence agri-

culture using very low productivity methods, there is also a small segment

of the agricultural sector that appears to be very modern.       In this section

we develop an extension of our model that can address this heterogeneity.

There are three reasons why this extension is of interest. First, we think this

heterogeneity is additional evidence for the importance of transportation

costs relative to other factors, such as low productivity in producing inter-

mediates. Second, it allows us to address the issue of subsistence agriculture.

Third, while the basic messages from this extension are similar to those in

the previous section, we think that it provides a richer structure for thinking

about policy choices.




                                        47
      The extension that we consider is to assume that there are two rural

regions instead of just one.          Each rural region has a production function

identical to that in the previous model, and each has a fraction of the total

endowment of land. The distinguishing feature of the two regions is the cost

associated with moving goods into and out of the region. We will refer to the

region with lower transportation costs as region 1 and the region with higher

transportation costs as region 2. We will refer to the urban area as region

0. We assume an iceberg cost of           q1   associated with moving goods between

the urban area and the region 1, and an iceberg cost of                q2   associated with

moving goods from region 1 to the region 2. The only way in which goods

can be moved between the urban area and the region 2 is to pass through

region 1. Note that if we set        q2 = 0    then this model reduces to that of the

previous section.

      We do not provide a detailed analysis of the analytics for the three region

case. It is straightforward to show that food is never transported from region

1 to region 2. This allows one to express feasibility in terms of the following

two equations:


                               m1 + x1          m2 + x2
                  n0 m0 + n1           + n2                    = Am n0
                                1 − q1      (1 − q1 )(1 − q2 )

        a0
n0             +n1 a1 +n2 (1−q2 )a2 = Aa l11−θx −θn xθ1x nθ1n +(1−q2 )Aa l21−θx −θn xθ2x nθ2n
     (1 − q1 )
Assuming interior solutions, and similar to the two region case, one can show

that consumption allocations will satisfy:


                                      m1 + m̄         m2 + m̄
                        m0 + m̄ =               =
                                      (1 − q1 )   (1 − q1 )(1 − q2 )

                           a0 − ā
                                    = a1 − ā = (1 − q2 )(a2 − ā)
                          (1 − q1 )

This implies that allocations become increasingly skewed towards agriculture

and away from manufacturing as we move from region 0 to region 1 to region

2.

     We now move to presentation of some illustrative quantitative results. We

choose the same technology parameters as in the previous section:                    θx = .2
and   θn = .4,              α = .2. We allocate land between the two regions
                 and again set

according to l1 = .1 and l2 = .9. Transportation costs are set according to

q1 = .1 and q2 = .6. As in the previous section we set m̄ = 0 and choose
the value of ā so that in the equilibrium we have 80% of the population in

agriculture. In the equilibrium it turns out that n1 = .096 and n2 = .707.

Table 13 shows the consumption allocations.



     Consistent with the above analysis, we see that individuals in region 2

have much lower consumption of manufacturing goods than do individuals

in the other two regions. In terms of consumption allocations, individuals in

region 2 very much capture the notion of subsistence agriculture. It is also of

interest to examine the nature of agricultural production in the two regions.

Table 14 provides some summary statistics.



     The statistics reported are the land per worker (l/n), intermediates per

worker (x/n), average labor productivity (ya /n) and yield (ya /l ). Contrasting

the two regions, we see that production in region 1 is relatively intensive in

intermediate inputs, whereas production in region 2 is relatively intensive in

land. The dierence in relative use of intermediates is very large: region 1

has almost three times as much use of intermediate goods per worker. These

factor intensities have opposing eects in terms of average labor productivity,

but reinforcing eects in terms of yields.    Nonetheless, we see that in the

benchmark equilibrium, not only is yield higher in region 1, but also that

average labor productivity is.    However, perhaps somewhat surprisingly,

despite the much more intensive use of intermediates in region 1, the yield

in region 1 is only about 40% higher than in region 2.

   We now carry out some counterfactual experiments similar to those con-

ducted in the two region model. Results for consumer allocations are pre-

sented in Table 15, and results for agricultural production are in Table 16.

For completeness we include the results of the benchmark equilibrium in each

table. The welfare measure is the same one that we used earlier.




   We begin by discussing the results on allocations. The eects here are very

similar to those from the two region case. Of particular interest is that the

welfare eects of TFP improvements are very similar in this model, while the

eects of improvements in transportation are somewhat larger. Once again

there are very large interaction eects between changes in agricultural TFP

and changes in transportation costs. And as before, population increases have

the eect of not only changing the share of the population in agriculture,

but also reducing the absolute size of the population in the urban region.

Moreover, the increase in the size of the population in subsistence is larger

than the increase in the size of the overall population.              So increases in

population lead to an increase in the size of the subsistence farmer population.

   The    three region model allows us to consider a new experiment relative

to the two region case. In particular, we can contrast the eect of improving

overall transportation with that of expanding the size of region 1. Loosely

speaking, if we think of region 1 as the well connected region and region 2

as the remote region, we can contrast the eects of a general reduction in

transport costs with the eects of increasing the size of the region that is well

connected. This corresponds to the row in which l1 is increased from            .1 to .2.
This corresponds to increasing the share of total land that is well connected

by ten percentage points.         It is striking that this results in a substantially

higher welfare eect than a uniform ten percent reduction in transportation

costs.   It is important to keep in mind that we do not oer any metric in



                                             51
terms of the relative costs of these two types of changes, but we think it

is denitely of interest that these policies have very quantitative eects in

terms of welfare.

   Next we consider the impact on the nature of agricultural production.

Here there are some interesting patterns. Consider the case of a ten percent

increase in agricultural TFP. We know that this leads to fewer people in

agriculture. But whereas the land per worker ratio does increase in region

2, somewhat surprisingly, this ratio actually decreases in region 1. This is

because the ow of workers out of agriculture leads to greater production

of manufacturing goods and hence greater use of intermediates in agricul-

ture.    This greater use of intermediates increases labor productivity and

hence allows the economy to use even more workers in region 1, helping

them to economize on transportation costs.        A similar pattern is found

for improvements in manufacturing TFP and reductions in transportation

costs.   The fact that these improvements lead to fewer workers per unit

of land in region 2 but more workers per unit of land in region 1 lead to

opposing eects on labor productivity, but amplify the dierences in yields.

In some case output per worker even becomes greater in region 2 than in

region 1.   The fact that we do not have capital as a factor of production

may help explain this seemingly anomalous prediction. It may also be that

the Cobb-Douglas production function also plays a role.        For example, it

could be that subsistence farming involves a constraint on how much land

one individual can use productively. More generally, richer specications of

agricultural technology and technology choice are interesting extensions to

explore.

   An interesting nding is that crop yields (output per unit of land) in

region 2 vary little across the experiments shown in Table 16. In particular,

these yields vary far less than the yields of the more intensively farmed region

1. Where some of the experiments lead to yield increases of 35 percent or

more in region 1, relative to the benchmark, the largest increase in region 2




                                      52
is 8 percent. A reason for this seems to be that rising agricultural TFP tends

to lead to a movement of workers out of region 2 into the more productive

region 1, with the reduction in labor osetting the productivity benets of

increased TFP. A possible implication is that it may be somewhat dicult

for policy makers to increase yields in the quasi-subsistence sector  even

though it may be possible to increase welfare.




7        Conclusion
A key feature of the Ugandan economy is the large fraction of individuals

engaged in farming at the same time that productivity of the agricultural

sector is low relative to the nonagricultural sector.     Earlier work has em-

phasized that this pattern obtains when low productivity in the agricultural

sector is coupled with minimum food requirements and food is not easily

imported.      Our goal in this paper has been to explore the possibility that

high transportation costs associated with low infrastructure spending might

also reinforce this pattern of labor allocation.

       We rst present evidence showing that regional price dispersion associated

with transportation costs is very high in Uganda and then incorporate this

feature into an otherwise standard two sector model. We calibrate this model

to resemble key features of the Ugandan economy and then perform several

exercises aimed at uncovering the potential signicance of transportation

costs in accounting for the pattern of labor allocation in Uganda. We nd

that high transportation costs represent an important force in shaping the

allocation of labor. Moreover, we nd that improvements in transportation

have an important interaction with improvements in agricultural productiv-

ity.

       The underlying economics are intuitive: high transportation costs create

an incentive for individuals to locate so as to minimize transportation costs

for those goods that are most important to them. Since agricultural goods are




                                         53
relatively more important in poor economies, this leads to a greater fraction

of the population in agriculture. Moreover, we argue that the predominance

of subsistence agriculture can also be explained by this, since people who

locate in remote areas in order to close to their source of food will necessarily

engage in little trade for other goods precisely because of the high transport

costs.

   While our model has been simple and stylized, we believe it captures

some important economic forces. Nonetheless, we want to emphasize three

important directions for future research. The rst is to gather more system-

atic data on the nature of transport costs. The second is to develop richer

versions of our model that can provide better estimates of the quantitative

eects of transportation infrastructure. Third, it is important to incorporate

the costs associated with transportation infrastructure in order to provide

better guidance regarding optimal policy.
