                                         ABSTRACT

While a growing literature shows that women, relative to men, prefer greater investment in
children, it is unclear whether empowering women produces better economic outcomes.
Exploiting plausibly exogenous variation in U.S. suffrage laws, we show that exposure to
suffrage during childhood led to large increases in educational attainment for children from
disadvantaged backgrounds, especially blacks and Southern whites. We also find that suffrage led
to higher earnings alongside education gains, although not for Southern blacks. Using newly-
digitized data, we show that education increases are primarily explained by suffrage-induced
growth in education spending, although early-life health improvements may have also
contributed.

    Gender differences in social preferences have been documented across many settings. For
instance, there is evidence that women favor higher levels of investment in children, are more
pro-social, and are more egalitarian.1 Thus, it has been argued that female empowerment
could lead to greater investment in human capital and increase economic development (Duflo,
2012). However, there is little empirical evidence that increase in women’s influence leads
to different policies or better economic outcomes. In this paper, we provide new evidence of
the impact of enfranchising women in the U.S. on the human capital of the next generation.
    The passage of women’s suffrage laws in the U.S. has been hailed as a “turning point
in our Nation’s history” (Obama, 2010): newly-empowered women exercised their vote in
large numbers (Lott and Kenny, 1999) and post-suffrage legislators voted for more progressive
policies and more funds for public health, social services, and (at least in the South) education
(Lott and Kenny, 1999; Miller, 2008; Carruthers and Wanamaker, 2014). There is also some
evidence that changes in health spending led to a decline in child mortality (Miller, 2008).
    Building on these earlier findings, we estimate the long-run impact of exposure to suffrage
during childhood on education and labor market outcomes. To examine mechanisms, we
use newly-digitized historical records to estimate the short-run impact of suffrage on local
education expenditures, school enrollment, and infant mortality.
    Theoretically, it is ambiguous whether women’s suffrage would lead to long term gains in
education, and for whom. While studies show that public spending on health, social services,
and, to some extent, education increased on average, these effects may not lead to education
gains if spending was increased for populations with few gains from spending. For instance,
some evidence suggests that the returns to education spending are largest for those with
few resources (Jackson, Johnson and Persico, 2016; Lafortune, Rothstein and Schanzenbach,
2018; Carruthers and Wanamaker, 2013). Thus, suffrage may have had little impact on
education if newly-empowered women advocated that funding only go to populations with
greater political or economic influence (e.g., more-educated whites).
    Our analysis exploits variation in the timing of suffrage laws, as in John R. Lott and
Lawrence W. Kenny (1999) and Miller (2008), and differential exposure to the laws across
cohorts, in a difference-in-difference design. Thus, for each state, we compare the outcomes of
individuals who were older than fifteen when suffrage was passed (comparison) to individuals
who were at most age fifteen when suffrage was passed (treated). The staggered adoption
of suffrage laws allows us to include detailed birth-cohort-by-region fixed effects to control
for other potential changes across cohorts. This design thus relies on the assumption that
differential exposure to suffrage – among individuals in the same region and birth cohort –

and Gneezy (2009); Alesina and Giuliano (2011); Ashok, Kuziemko and Washington (2015).

only affects outcomes through suffrage-induced changes in human capital inputs.
    We provide several pieces of evidence in favor of the identifying assumption. First,
we use event studies to show that suffrage is not correlated with trends in our outcomes of
interest. Second, we show that the timing of suffrage is not correlated with pre-suffrage state
demographics (trends or levels), education policies, or the passage of other progressive laws.
Thus, any remaining confounders would need to be correlated with the timing of suffrage
and outside the extensive set of state covariates and progressive laws in our controls.
    We bring together multiple historical data sources to examine the impacts of suffrage.
We use the 1940, 1950 and 1960 decennial censuses to estimate the effects of suffrage on indi-
viduals’ education and labor market outcomes. Additionally, we digitized city-level records
from 1909 to 1927 to examine countrywide impacts on school enrollment, school expendi-
tures, and state and local revenue for schooling. Finally, we digitized counts of deaths for
each state, age, race, and gender from 1900 to 1932 to estimate impacts on mortality.
    Our primary finding is that exposure to women’s suffrage during childhood led to mean-
ingful gains in educational attainment, particularly for children from economically disad-
vantaged backgrounds. Full exposure to suffrage between the ages of 0 and 15 increased
educational attainment by 0.9 years for black children (who averaged 5.2 years of education
pre-suffrage) and by one year for white children from the South (who averaged 8.0 years
of education pre-suffrage.) In contrast, full exposure to suffrage led to between 0.3 and 0.5
years of additional education for whites in the Northeast and in the West (who averaged 9.0
years of education pre-suffrage.) Consistent with this, we show that suffrage had significantly
larger effects on the education of youth from states that had low average levels of education
pre-suffrage.
    We also find that suffrage increased earnings along with education, although not for
Southern blacks. This is consistent with prior evidence that low school quality together with
labor market discrimination reduced the returns to schooling for this group (see, e.g., Card
and Krueger, 1992).
    To explain the large and heterogeneous effects on education, we show that suffrage had
disparate impacts on school spending across the country. On average, suffrage led to a 13.9%
increase in schooling expenditures within five years. However, expenditures post-suffrage
increased more in percent terms in cities in the South and in states with lower average pre-
suffrage education. For example, spending on education increased by nearly twice as much
in the South (23 percent) as in the non-South (13 percent.) Drawing on previous estimates
of the impact of education spending (Jackson, Johnson and Persico, 2016), we calculate that
growth in education spending could explain 110%, 95%, and 73% of the education impacts
for Southern whites, Southern blacks, and blacks nationwide. Altogether, this suggests that


                                              3
education spending is very likely to be the primary mechanism for our education effects.
     We find less evidence that improvements in early-life health – proxied by reductions in
infant mortality – can explain post-suffrage gains in education. In particular, contrary to our
impacts on education, mortality improvements post-suffrage are small for blacks outside the
South and are significant for whites in the non-South. Thus, while improvements in health
may have contributed to increases in schooling, this does not appear to be a main channel
for education gains.
     We bolster the plausibility of these results by providing additional evidence on political
mechanisms and on the mechanics of spending in the South. First, we show that suffrage
increased voting for progressive bills in the Senate both by increasing “yay” votes by leg-
islators elected post-suffrage and by reducing “nay” votes by incumbent legislators. Thus,
suffrage appears to have swayed the votes of existing legislators in addition to changing the
composition of legislators (Morgan-Collins, 2019). Second, we show that in the South, 10
percent growth in local education spending translated to 10 percent growth in spending in
white schools and 5.2 to 6.3 percent growth in spending black schools. This indicates that
even in the presence of racism in the South, the growth in education spending post-suffrage
is likely to have been at least modestly passed on to black schools.
     This paper touches on several literatures. First, we add to the work on the broad effects
of women’s political representation on public spending and children’s outcomes. The closest
studies in this area show that electing women to public office in India leads to greater
investment in female-preferred public goods and increases primary educational attainment
(Chattopadhyay and Duflo, 2004; Clots-Figueras, 2012), but that electing women to local
office in the U.S. has little impact on spending (Ferreira and Gyourko, 2014). Our findings
suggest that women’s voting en masse can have wide-reaching effects on children’s outcomes
akin to the best-case effects of increasing women’s representation.
     Second, we add to the set of studies on the impact of suffrage on policy outcomes and
children’s well-being (see Lott and Kenny, 1999; Miller, 2008; Carruthers and Wanamaker,
2014, summarized above, and Aidt and Dallal, 2008). We make three additions to this
literature. Our first addition is that we show that childhood exposure to suffrage led to
large and lasting improvements in human capital. We document that impacts on education
were widespread, geographically and racially, larger in less advantaged areas, and extended
beyond the children of those with the greatest gains in political power post-suffrage.
     Our second addition is that we provide the first national accounting of the impacts of
suffrage on local education spending. This builds on Carruthers and Wanamaker (2014), who
broke ground by showing that suffrage increased local schooling expenditures in 3 Southern
states. We show that geographic variation in the impact of suffrage on spending is important


                                              4
for explaining heterogeneous effects on education.
    As a third, more minor addition, we also provide evidence that suffrage changed the
voting behavior of incumbent politicians towards abstention. This is a likely mechanism for
the rise in the passage of progressive bills post-suffrage shown in earlier work (Miller, 2008),
together with the election of new, less-conservative legislators (Morgan-Collins, 2019). It
also provides empirical evidence that women’s lobbying changed legislators’ voting behavior,
which is frequently mentioned in historical accounts.
    Finally, we contribute to the literature on the impact of public spending on educational
attainment (e.g., Jackson, Johnson and Persico, 2016; Hyman, 2017). The fact that we find
similar gains in education for blacks and whites in the South, despite the fact that whites
likely experienced almost twice the increase in education expenditures, provides additional
evidence of potential diminishing returns to education spending (Carruthers and Wanamaker,
2013).
    The remainder of the paper continues as follows. In Section 1 we provide institutional
background on the passage of suffrage laws and present evidence of the short-run impacts
of suffrage on voting and the passage of progressive bills. We discuss the expected effects
of suffrage on education in Section 2. Section 3 describes our data sources, followed by an
overview of our empirical strategy in Section 4. We present our main results on the long-
run effects of suffrage in Section 5, followed by evidence on mechanisms in Section 6, and
robustness checks in Section 7. We conclude in Section 8.


1       Background on Women’s Suffrage
    At the turn of the 20th century, women had few, if any, political rights (Baker, 1984;
Keyssar, 2000).2 Thus, the passage of suffrage laws in the early part of the century provided
the first opportunity for many women to enter into the political sphere, and influence political
outcomes and local policy.
    De jure, suffrage laws applied to all women. But de facto, black women’s participation
was severely limited by the presence of literacy tests, poll taxes, and fear of retribution in
the South (Cascio and Washington, 2013; Naidu, 2012). Hence, access to voting following
suffrage was largely limited to white women. In spite of this, suffrage led to a significant
shift in the electorate and in policymakers’ priorities, as we discuss below.
    2
     The most common form of political voice for women was the right to vote for school boards, although
anecdotally school elections had low female participation (Youmans, 1921). School board voting rights were
extended during the mid- to late- 19th century in 21 states (Keyssar, 2000). Since these laws preceded the
passage of state and presidential suffrage by over 30 years, our results should be interpreted as the effect of
full voting rights above any existing school voting rights.


                                                      5
    Figure 1 illustrates the timing of the passage of the first suffrage law in each state using
data from Lott and Kenny (1999) and Miller (2008).3 In our analysis, we exploit the variation
in suffrage laws passed after 1900, beginning with Washington in 1910.4 Between 1910 and
1919, an additional 24 states passed suffrage laws. In 1920, the US ratified the Nineteenth
Amendment, which guaranteed that sex could not be used as a basis of exclusion from voting.
Three-fourths of the 48 states voted in support of ratification, and the remaining 12 states,
labeled as “Mandated” in Figure 1, adopted it by mandate in 1920.
    Historical accounts suggest that suffrage led to increased attention and support for poli-
cies targeting children’s welfare. For example, one year after the passage of suffrage in North
Carolina, “politicians passed unusually liberal appropriations’ for the states educational and
child-caring institutions (Schuyler (2006), p.171).” This appears to have been due to the
election of new, progressive legislators (Morgan-Collins, 2019) and to women’s lobbying of
existing legislators. In particular, women’s lobbies created the perception of a close political
alignment among its members, which appears to have made politicians more willing to sup-
port progressive legislation (Lemons, 1973; Moehling and Thomasson, 2012).5 We provide
empirical evidence supporting this narrative – that suffrage had an impact of suffrage on
legislators’ voting patterns – below, in Section 1.1.
    Because suffrage increased voting primarily for white women, one might expect gains
primarily for white children. However, there are reasons to suspect that there could be
some gains for black children as well. While black women in the South could not directly
lobby legislators, there is qualitative evidence that black women’s organizations had some
(infrequent) success in convincing white women’s organizations to request funds for black
youth. For instance, this form of cooperation led to the founding of the Fairworld School
for Negro girls in South Carolina, and of a training school for “delinquent African American
boys” in North Carolina (Schuyler, 2006, p.156-158). Similar examples also led to funding
for homes for delinquent black children (Schuyler, 2006, p. 171). In that sense, suffrage may
have reduced the costs of gaining access to policymakers not only for white women, but also
   3
     Following the prior literature, our focus is the timing of the earliest state or presidential suffrage law
passed in the state, since subsequent laws may have been passed strategically in anticipation of the Nine-
teenth Amendment. Presidential-only suffrage laws were passed in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Minnesota,
Missouri, North Dakota, Ohio, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Vermont and Wisconsin. Arkansas and Texas, in-
stead, passed primary-only laws (Miller, 2008). See Teele (2018) and Keyssar (2000) for greater detail on
the passage of suffrage laws.
   4
     This helps balance exposure to suffrage across states in our sample, as we discuss in Section 3.
   5
     As an example of the successful organization of women, in the Virginia gubernatorial election in 1921,
former anti-suffragist George Tucker was handily defeated due to opposition from the League of Women
Voters. The League instead endorsed the opposing candidate, Elbert Trinkle, for his support of progressive
legislation, including improved roads to allow rural children to attend school. Further, Westmoreland Davis,
the previous Virginia governor who had endorsed Tucker, lost his bid for the Senate (Walker, Dunn and
Dunn, 2003).


                                                      6
for black women (at least for issues related to child welfare.)
    A second channel for gains for black children is that a portion of suffrage-induced ed-
ucation spending may have simply been “passed-through” to black schools through fixed
allocation mechanisms (or norms.) We quantify the likely magnitude of such pass-through
in Section 6.


1.1     Voting, Progressive Legislation, and Public Spending Post-
        Suffrage
    The passage of suffrage laws has been linked to an immediate and significant change
in voter participation in gubernatorial elections nationwide, and other elections in specific
states (Lott and Kenny, 1999; Corder and Wolbrecht, 2016); and in the passage of progressive
legislation in Congress, particularly in the Senate (Lott and Kenny, 1999; Miller, 2008).
Because these mechanisms are relevant for impacts on public spending and education, we
briefly re-examine these outcomes to verify the immediacy of the effects on voter turnout
and the plausibility of rapid effects in the Senate.
    First, we examine the relationship between the passage of suffrage laws and voting in
presidential elections, which typically have higher turnout than other races (Cascio and
Washington, 2013). We illustrate changes in voting around suffrage by regressing the log of
the number of votes relative to the population over 21 on event-time indicators for the years
around the passage of suffrage (using the timing of suffrage laws in Figure 1), together with
state and election-year fixed effects. Appendix Figure A.1 shows that voter participation
increased by 45 log points, or 56 percent, in the year after suffrage. Consistent with prior
work, this suggests that suffrage significantly expanded the voting population, although
women voted at roughly half the rate of men.
    Second, we consider whether suffrage had impacts on the progressive voting of existing
legislators, which could have hastened the post-suffrage change in policies. In particular, we
measure the impact of suffrage on progressive voting by all Senators (as in Miller, 2008),
which includes changes in the composition of elected Senators, and as well as by Senators
present before and after suffrage (“incumbents.”)6
    Panel A of Appendix Table A.1 shows that, conditional on state and year fixed effects,
suffrage leads to a significant rise in the propensity to vote in favor of a progressive bill,
consistent with Miller (2008). Panel B shows that, conditional on individual and year fixed
   6
    In particular, we first regress the share of progressive bills for which a Senator votes in a particular way
(yay, nay, or abstains) on an indicator for the years after suffrage along with year and state fixed effects. We
include individual fixed effects when we examine incumbents. For details on the coding of progressive bills
and voting data, see Appendix B.


                                                       7
effects, incumbents are more likely to abstain from votes on progressive bills post-suffrage.
This comes from a decline in voting against progressive bills.7 Thus, suffrage appears to
have both increased voting for progressive bills by newly-elected senators, which drives the
overall effect, and reduced voting against progressive bills by incumbents. The presence of
both of these channels helps to explain the rapid change in legislation following suffrage.
     Multiple studies show that suffrage led to an increase in public spending, particularly
on health (by up to 36%) and social programs (by up to 24%) (Lott and Kenny, 1999;
Miller, 2008). However, there is inconsistent evidence of impacts on education spending.
While Lott and Kenny (1999) and Miller (2008) find no effect of suffrage on state-level
education spending across the country, Carruthers and Wanamaker (2014) find positive
effects of suffrage on county-level education spending for three Southern states, with larger
impacts for white schools relative to black schools.
     While these earlier studies of education spending provide important insights into the
impacts of suffrage, each of them has critical limitations. First, Lott and Kenny (1999) and
Miller (2008) focus on state spending, which accounted for less than 20% of local education
expenditures during this period (Benson and O’Halloran, 1987). Thus, their null estimates
may not capture the full effects of suffrage. Second, the estimates in Carruthers and Wana-
maker (2014) may be specific to the South (or a subset of the South.) Third, the estimates
in Carruthers and Wanamaker (2014) rely on variation in the white female share across
counties, which could be measured with error and may not necessarily correspond to a larger
“dose” of suffrage.8 This could lead to attenuation or reduced precision in the estimates. To
fill these gaps, in Section 6, we revisit the effects of suffrage on education expenditures using
new historical data on city-level spending that has national coverage.


2       Expected Effects of Suffrage
   We hypothesize that increases in public spending on health and education are two main
channels by which suffrage would have impacted education. In this section, we briefly discuss
the predicted education effects of these channels, other potential mechanisms, and testable
hypotheses.
   The predicted effect of greater health spending on education is ambiguous. On the one
hand, reductions in the prevalence of disease are likely to reduce the duration or severity of
    7
      Event studies in Appendix Figure A.2 illustrate that these changes incumbent voting took place immedi-
ately after suffrage. They also show that the results are robust to including region-by-year and state trends,
although the inclusion of trends sometimes introduces pre-trends where there are none.
    8
      For instance, counties with a smaller share of white women may experience a bigger impact of suffrage
if the discrepancy between men and women’s preferences for spending is larger in those counties.


                                                      8
sickness spells. This would lead to increases in school attendance post-suffrage. On the other
hand, reductions in mortality (as shown in Miller, 2008) would lead to a greater presence of
weak survivors. This would tend to reduce estimated impacts on completed education. We
can not observe reductions in sickness to examine the first channel; however, in Section 6 we
use bounding methods to estimate the role of survivors in our education effects.
    The predicted effect of education spending on education is generally positive. However,
there is evidence that education gains may be larger for groups with lower pre-suffrage
spending. As one example, studies of the philanthropic “Rosenwald Initiative” – which was
closely timed with suffrage – show that black children benefited more from increases in school
spending than white children (Aaronson and Mazumder, 2011; Carruthers and Wanamaker,
2013). Similarly, school spending increases have been shown to have strong impacts on
education outcomes in districts with low levels of spending (Jackson, Johnson and Persico,
2016; Hyman, 2017; Lafortune, Rothstein and Schanzenbach, 2018). To test for this form of
heterogeneity in our setting, we estimate differential impacts of suffrage by race as well as
by pre-suffrage average education in the state.9
    Finally, changes in women’s bargaining power in households or in girls’ aspirations could
also lead to improvements in education. We expect changes in bargaining power to primarily
benefit white children, since black women were largely disenfranchised. Suffrage could also
make girls more motivated to remain in school (e.g., from a desire to become an educated
voter, changes in gender norms, or greater investment from parents.) Thus, we test for larger
education gains for women post-suffrage.


3       Data
   One of the strengths of our analysis is the large number of data sources we access to
provide the most comprehensive description of the effects of suffrage on human capital. For
brevity, we provide an overview of the data sources here and include detailed descriptions in
Appendix B.

Long-Run Outcomes We analyze the effect of women’s suffrage laws on children’s ed-
ucational and labor market outcomes using two samples constructed from the 1920–1930
and 1940–1960 U.S. decennial censuses, respectively. The data for each census year are
a 1% representative sample of the U.S. population and are publicly available through the
    9
    Although we discuss the impacts of health and education spending separately, there could be interactions
between these effect; positive, if healthy students are more attentive, or negative if health improvements lead
to classroom overcrowding.

Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) (Ruggles et al., 2020). Relevant for our
research design, the samples contain information on individuals’ year and state of birth, as
well as years of completed education and earnings for each individual (for the 1940–1960
censuses) and literacy (for the 1920–1930 censuses).10
    Our main analysis sample for educational attainment and labor market outcomes includes
individuals who are (i) at least 20 years old at the time of the census and (ii) were born
between 1880 and 1930 in states that adopted suffrage between 1910 and 1920.11 This ensures
that for each state that passed suffrage between 1910 and 1920, we observe individuals born
between 30 years before suffrage and up to 10 years after suffrage.12 For our analysis of
impacts on literacy, we expand the sample to include individuals ages 15 and above (Aaronson
and Mazumder, 2011).

State-Level Controls For controls, we merge on state-by-cohort measures of the demo-
graphic and economic composition of the state and measures of exposure to other education
policies. These include the percentage female; population; percentage white; percentage
black; percentage illiterate; employment in manufacturing; total wages paid in manufac-
turing; total value of farm property; percentage urban population; and percentage foreign
born. We also control for the state-by-cohort compulsory attendance requirement, the child
labor educational requirement (following Stephens and Yang, 2014), and exposure to the
Rosenwald Initiative during childhood (following Aaronson and Mazumder, 2011).

Mortality Counts To perform detailed analyses of the impact of suffrage on mortality,
we digitized annual counts of deaths by state, age, race, and gender from 1900 to 1932 from
the Mortality Statistics. The data include all deaths from participating states, which grew
from 10 states in 1900 to 48 states by 1932.

Education Spending and School Enrollment To examine education spending and
enrollment patterns, we digitized city-level enrollment, education expenditures, and revenue
sources from the Report of the Commissioner of Education and Biennial Survey of Education
for cities with populations of 10,000 and over. Each report contains data for a single academic
  10
     We drop observations where years of education or income were imputed by the census. The 1950 Census
only collected years of education for one individual per household, so we have fewer observations for that
year.
  11
     Hence, we exclude individuals born in the early-adopter states Colorado, Idaho, Utah and Wyoming.
We also exclude those born in Alaska, the District of Columbia and Hawaii, which were not U.S. states by
1920, and for which we do not have either a date of suffrage or state-level controls.
  12
     Our results remain the same if we keep states that passed suffrage prior to 1910 or keep individuals over
age 25 – see Section 7.



                                                     10
year (e.g., 1909 to 1910), which we will hereafter refer to by the calendar year of the start of
the term (e.g., 1909). We digitized the annual reports from 1909 to 1911 and 1913 to 1915
and the biennial reports from 1917 and 1927 (12 academic years in total).
   For our main analyses, we keep cities for which we have information on enrollment,
spending, and revenues, and which have available information for at least 7 of the 12 years.
This helps achieve balance across years and across outcomes.13 We drop cities that we
identify as outliers, defined as having enrollment and spending above the 99th percentile.
Our final dataset contains city-year observations with enrollment, spending, and revenue
from 1909 through 1927 for 42 states and 523 cities. This is the most comprehensive data
on education spending used to analyze the impacts of suffrage to date.14


4      Empirical Strategy
   We estimate the effect of suffrage using a difference-in-differences framework that com-
pares the outcomes of cohorts who in the year that suffrage was passed in their state of birth
were beyond schooling-age (“comparison”), at schooling age or not yet in school (“partially
exposed”), and not yet born (“fully exposed”). We define exposure using state of birth
because it is less likely to be an outcome of suffrage than state of residence and provides a
reasonable proxy for childhood location.
   We first estimate the effects of voting laws for each age of exposure to suffrage in an
event-study model. This allows us to visually inspect whether cohorts exposed at older ages,
who we argue should be less affected by suffrage, have small treatment effects, and to show
the pattern of treatment effects among children exposed at younger ages.
   We estimate:
                 30
                 X
 Yicsrt = α0 +           βa (AgeTreatcs = a) + γ1 0Xicst + γ2 0Zcs + θc + δs + χs × c + τct + φrc + icsrt , (1)
                 a=−10


where i, c, s, r, and t represent individual, cohort, state of birth, region of birth, and survey
year, respectively, and AgeTreatcs is the age of individual i in the year that women’s suffrage
was passed in s. δs and θc flexibly control for differential political, education, and education
climates across states and cohorts, respectively. A state-level trend, χs × c, controls for
linear changes in education at the state level across different years of birth, and cohort
  13
     We have also run the results requiring cities to appear in 8, 9, or 10 years or including cities that appear
in fewer years. The results remain the same.
  14
     Other sources of education spending begin many decades after suffrage, such as the Census of Govern-
ments (which begins in 1972) or the Historical Database on Individual Government Finances (which begins
in 1967) (Jackson, Johnson and Persico, 2016).


                                                       11
by survey year fixed effects, τct , further control for the aging of cohorts over time. We
also include a vector of individual controls, Xicst , including race, age, and gender, and a
vector of state-cohort controls, Zcs , which includes state demographics, employment, wages,
and education policies in the year of birth, c. Region by cohort fixed effects,f φrc control
for unobservable differences across regions over time that may be related to the clustered
passage of suffrage laws.15 The variation used for identification of the coefficients of interest,
βa , is thus generated by differential exposure to suffrage within cohorts and across states
(within regions), as well as within states and across cohorts.
     To increase power, we group together treated ages greater than or equal to 30 and treated
ages less than or equal to -10. We also group together pairs of consecutive ages of treat-
ment, such that individuals treated at ages -10 and -9 are both assigned AgeTreatcs = −9,
individuals treated at ages -8 and -7 are both assigned AgeTreatcs = −7, and so forth.16
All coefficients are measured relative to the omitted category, which is treatment at ages
16 or 17. We perform regressions separately by race to take account of the marked gaps in
educational attainment and in human capital investments across black and white children
during this period.
     We summarize the average effect of additional exposure to suffrage using a generalized
difference-in-differences approach, as follows:17

       Yicsrt = α0 + β1 SuffExp015cs + γ1 0Xicst + γ2 0Zcs + θc + δs + χs × c + τct + φrc + icsrt         (2)

where Suf f Exp015cs is a continuous measure of exposure to the suffrage laws, defined as
the share of time between birth and age 15 that women are able to vote in an individual’s
state of birth.18 We define the relevant age of exposure ending at the typical school-leaving
age, 15 years, which we calculate as the sum of the median age of school entry (7) and
average completed schooling (8) (Collins and Margo, 2006). However, since there is a wide
  15
      Importantly, this helps control for important differences in education outcomes across regions (see Ap-
pendix Figure A.3.) When we exclude these fixed effects, the average effect for whites increases by four-fold,
and the estimate becomes statistically significant – see Appendix Table A.2. Interestingly, the standard
errors change very little when we include these fixed effects, though, which suggests that we are not losing
excessive identifying variation.
   16
      Grouping in this manner also allows us to estimate state trends and region by birth cohort fixed effects
without dropping additional event-time dummies.
   17
      Although we refer to this as the average effect, β1 may not precisely correspond to the average treatment
effect in the population due to uneven weighting across states (Goodman-Bacon, 2018; de Chaisemartin and
D’Haultfoeuille, 2019; Borusyak and Jaravel, 2016). However, reassuringly, our results are similar across the
difference-in-difference and our event studies, which are less susceptible to weighting issues (Goodman-Bacon,
2018).
   18
      Formally,                                     15
                                                   X    1(c + a > YearSuffrages )
                                  SuffExp015cs =                                                            (3)
                                                   a=0
                                                                   16
where YearSuffrages is the year in which suffrage was passed in the state.

distribution of school entry and leaving ages, this is only a rough approximation, and we
will use our event study specification as a data-driven way to validate the relevance of this
margin.


4.1     Identifying Assumptions and Testable Implications
    The identifying assumptions for this model are that (i) suffrage laws are not correlated
with an unobserved trend in education outcomes across states, and that (ii) there are no
confounding events with suffrage. We address assumption (i) in part by including linear
state-specific trends to minimize the influence of unobserved trends. Nonetheless, there
may remain some (potentially small) correlations with unobserved time-varying factors that
remain threats to our identification.
    We provide evidence of the plausibility of assumption (i) by testing whether suffrage
was preceded by a systematic change in any of a number of state policies, demographics,
or economic activity. To diagnose the importance of any pre-existing trend, we estimate a
modified event-study model, in which we replace the pre-suffrage indicators with a linear
trend, as follows:
                                          10
                                          X
   Yst = α0 + α1 YearRelSuffragest +             βy (YearRelSuffragest = y) + γ0Zst + δs + φrt + st       (4)
                                         y=−10

Yst is a state- (or city-) characteristic in state (or city) s and YearRelSuffragest is a linear
trend in years since suffrage in state s, and 20
                                                P
                                                   y=1 (YearRelSuffragest = y) are indicators for
each year after suffrage. The coefficient of interest is α1 . Because we include indicators
for each year after suffrage, α1 is mechanically only identified only from the data prior to
suffrage, and therefore gives the slope of Yst over time prior to suffrage. We include state
(or city) fixed effects, region by year fixed effects, and the same state time-varying controls
as in Equation 2.19
    To reduce noise in the estimation of the pre-trend (α1 ), we estimate this using the sample
of states (or cities) for which we have at least three years of data prior to suffrage. Thus, we
analyze outcomes for 31 states for the majority of the state-level regressions, and for 2,129
cities across 41 states for the city-level regressions.
    Table 1 shows our estimates of α1 . Of the 19 outcomes we analyze, just four are significant
at the 5 percent level: manufacturing wages per earner (α1 = 0.02), doctors capita (α1 =
0.04), white mortality under age 5 (α1 = −0.056), and log school enrollment (α1 = −0.01),
  19
    We exclude any controls that are directly related to the outcome in order to increase our ability to detect
a trend. To improve balance, we set Y earRelSuf f rage = 10 for all years at least 10 years after suffrage,
and Y earRelSuf f rage = −10 for all years at least 10 years before suffrage. For the city-level outcomes, we
also group together -10 and -9, -8 and -7, etc., since we only observe cities biennially.


                                                      13
and. Moreover, the direction of bias from these is not obvious. For instance, the effect of
a reduction in white mortality or more doctors per capita on education could be negative
due to the presence of weak survivors, or positive due to health improvements. Similarly,
higher manufacturing wages could reduce school attendance through the substitution effect,
or increase attendance through improvements in family income. Last, the slight negative
trend in school enrollment is most likely to bias us against finding an effect.
    The remaining 15 coefficients are not significant, typically small in magnitude, and are
not systematic in the predicted effects on human capital. Included in these 15 outcomes
is a predicted education index for whites and blacks, which we create by regressing the
mean education for state-cohort cells pre-suffrage on state covariates (shown in the table)
in the year of birth, and then obtaining fitted values for all state-cohort observations.20
Regressions are run separately for whites and blacks. The trend in this index is highly
insignificant (p = 0.41 for whites; p = 0.20 for blacks). This is consistent with previous
investigations that have shown few correlates of suffrage (Dahlin, Cornwall and King, 2005;
Braun and Kvasnicka, 2013; Miller, 2008). Reinforcing this, in the next section we also find
no trend in observed education across cohorts.
    To complement this analysis, we also directly examine the correlations between the year
of suffrage or whether a state passed suffrage in 1920 (“late’’) with pre-suffrage levels, pre-
suffrage changes, and contemporaneous changes in state covariates. We do this for the set
of states that passed suffrage after 1917 (as above) and the full set of states, and present
the results in Appendix Tables A.3 and A.4, respectively. In 10 out of 11 specifications, we
cannot reject the hypothesis that the covariates do not significantly predict the timing of
suffrage.
    One might also be worried that suffrage was bundled with other progressive era laws
that could have improved education. Appendix Table A.5 finds no correlation between the
year that suffrage was passed and the year of several other laws, including prohibition and
women’s minimum wage. Moreover, the direction of the coefficients indicate that, if anything,
suffrage was typically passed after these laws, which means that any effect of these other
laws would have been expected to show up in the pre-trends analysis. Similarly, the timing
of suffrage could be associated with other infusions of spending, like during the New Deal,
or contemporaneous changes in compulsory schooling laws. Again, we do not find evidence
for this (see Appendix Tables A.6, A.7 and A.8).
  20
    For state-year cells where we do not observe mortality, we use a prediction that omits mortality as a
covariate.




                                                   14
5     Results
    We present the results for the event study specification separately by race in Figure 2,
where we plot the estimated coefficients as well as their 95% confidence intervals by age of
treatment.
    For blacks, shown in Panel A, we find large, positive, and statistically significant effects
for children that were exposed to suffrage prior to age 15. Further, younger exposure is
generally associated with larger increases in education. Exposure to suffrage at ages 12–
15 leads to roughly a quarter of a year of additional education, while exposure to suffrage
between the ages of 0–5 leads to around three-quarters of a year of education. However, we
do not find any differential impact of exposure within the ages of 0 to 5, suggesting that
the effects are not driven by early-life exposure to suffrage.21 Importantly, we find no effect
of suffrage on the education of those that were exposed to suffrage after age 15. This is
consistent with our hypothesis that the education of individuals who had already left school
would be unaffected by the passage of suffrage.
    In contrast, for whites shown in Panel B, the effects hover at zero and are flat at all ages
of treatment. This is potentially consistent with prior evidence that resources may be less
important for relatively more advantaged populations (Carruthers and Wanamaker, 2013,
e.g.). In Section 5.1, we test whether there are varying impacts within whites and blacks to
probe whether less-advantaged white populations benefited more from suffrage.
    Across both samples, the pattern of the coefficients provides strong evidence in favor of
our empirical strategy. The absence of an impact of suffrage among individuals exposed to
suffrage after age 15 suggests that our effects are not capturing differential trends in educa-
tional attainment across cohorts.22 Additionally, the increasing and then flat the coefficients
between the ages of 0 to 15 resembles the age-pattern of effects resulting from exposure to
other important childhood interventions, such as increases in school spending and exposure
to high-quality neighborhoods (Jackson, Johnson and Persico, 2016; Chetty and Hendren,
2018), which bolsters our confidence in these results.
    We present the difference-in-differences estimates for all, whites, and blacks in columns
(1)–(3) of Table 2. On average, full exposure to suffrage between the ages of 0 to 15 leads
   21
      In Table A.9 we test the marginal effect of exposure to suffrage between ages 11-15, 6-10, and 0-5 using a
spline in exposure to suffrage. We find that the impact of an additional year of suffrage exposure is roughly
0.1 between the ages 6-15, and that, conditional on exposure at later ages, the effects of exposure between
ages 0-5 has little additional impact on education outcomes.
   22
      We formally test for an effect of suffrage beyond age fifteen in Appendix Table A.10 by including the
effect of exposure between age 16 and 22 and between 23 and 30 as additional covariates in the regression.
We find an insignificant effect of suffrage exposure after age 15, while the coefficient on exposure between
age 0 and 15 is similar to our base specification.



                                                      15
to a statistically insignificant 0.09 increase in years of schooling. Consistent with our event
studies, for whites, full exposure to suffrage led to a statistically insignificant 0.06 year
increase in education. For blacks, full exposure to suffrage led to 0.88 years of additional
education (p<0.01). This effect is statistically-significantly larger than the effect on whites
(p<0.045), and represents a 13% gain relative to the average years of completed education
for blacks.
    In the remaining four columns of Table 2 we analyze whether suffrage differentially im-
proves outcomes for girls, a pattern shown in previous studies of female empowerment (Qian,
2008; Duflo, 2003; Beaman et al., 2012). This could occur if, for example, parents perceived
daughters to be more valuable after suffrage, and therefore perceived the returns to investing
in the human capital of daughters to be higher. Additionally, there may be changes in gen-
der attitudes and modeling effects for younger girls inspired by women’s expanded political
rights.
    Contrary to these predictions, we do not find larger impacts on the education of women.
We find a statistically insignificant impact of suffrage for white women, and while the point
estimate is larger than the impact for white men, we could not rule out that they are the
same. For blacks, we actually find a larger effect of suffrage exposure on men than on
women (1.26 years compared with 0.55 years). This is potentially a reflection of the fact
that men had lower human capital investments at baseline – reflected in lower average levels
of education – which could result in a higher returns to investment.


5.1       Sources of Treatment Effect Heterogeneity
    The fact that we find larger impacts of suffrage for blacks is consistent either with (i)
suffrage leading to particularly large changes in black communities, counter to historical
narratives; or (ii) suffrage having a larger impact for communities with fewer resources. To
distinguish between these explanations, we now examine whether suffrage had heterogeneous
impacts by pre-suffrage education levels and within racial groups.23
    Descriptively, Figure 3 plots the impact of suffrage for groups defined by region, race,
and gender against the average level of education for each group prior to suffrage, which
we measure using individuals who were at least age 16 at suffrage. It shows a clear neg-
ative relationship between the impact of suffrage and pre-suffrage education levels: groups
that averaged 4 to 8 years of education pre-suffrage gained roughly one year of additional
education post-suffrage, while groups that averaged 9 or more years education pre-suffrage
experienced little or no gain.
 23
      We find similar patterns using other measures of socioeconomic status (see Appendix Figure A.4.)



                                                     16
    Figure 3 also shows that the impacts of suffrage are present among low-educated whites,
in addition to blacks. In particular, white children in the South, who averaged 8 years
of education prior to suffrage, gained an additional 0.96 years in education (se: 0.47) fol-
lowing suffrage, and whites in the Northeast and West, who averaged 9.3 and 9.1 years of
education prior to suffrage, gained an additional 0.54 (se: 0.21) and 0.27 (se: 0.17) years,
respectively.24,25
    Next, we formally estimate this relationship by adding to our baseline specification an
interaction between suffrage exposure and the pre-suffrage average education in the state.
We calculate pre-suffrage education separately for all, whites, and blacks.
    Table 3 reports the the main effect of suffrage, i.e., the impact of suffrage for a group
with zero pre-suffrage education, and the interaction with pre-suffrage interaction. For the
whole sample, the coefficient on the main effect is 2.53 and the coefficient on the interaction
is -0.28 (p < 0.01). This implies that the effect of full exposure to suffrage goes down by 0.28
years with every additional year of pre-suffrage education for a group.26 Columns (2)-(3) of
Table 3 shows a similar pattern within whites and blacks: the interaction with pre-suffrage
education is -0.31 for whites (p < 0.01) and -0.17 for blacks (p > 0.10). These results are
consistent with our hypothesis that the impact of suffrage was near-universal at low levels
of education for both whites and blacks, but does not appear in the average effect for whites
because of the higher level of education in that sample.


5.2     Impacts on the Distribution of Education
    To gain a richer understanding of the effects on attainment, we employ distributional
methods to identify the margin of educational attainment most impacted by suffrage. Specif-
ically, estimate the effect of exposure to suffrage on one minus the cumulative distribution
function of educational attainment (1-CDF) (Duflo, 2001). This gives the impact of suffrage
on the probability of having a level of education greater than a particular threshold. In
practice, we estimate a series of regressions where the outcome is an indicator for whether
the completed education of individual i is greater than p, where p takes on the discrete values
  24
      See Appendix Table A.11 for the coefficients estimated for each region and race. We are able to reject
that the effects for whites across regions are the same (p = 0.07). For blacks, we can not reject that the
effects are the same in all regions outside the West, which we exclude from the test due to concerns about
small sample size and overfitting.
   25
      Appendix Figure A.5 shows this in an event study by allowing for differential effects for white and black
children from the South and non-South. The age pattern of effects for whites from the South is very similar
to that of blacks, with larger gains for those exposed at younger ages, and leveling off for those exposed by
age 5. But white children in the South exposed between the ages of 15 and 30 also experience some small
increases in education.
   26
      As a basic check on the fit of this model, we plug in the pre-suffrage mean education levels of whites
and blacks, and obtain estimates close to our baseline difference-in-difference effects.


                                                      17
from 0 to 17 (Almond, Hoynes and Schanzenbach, 2011; Duflo, 2001).
    We plot the coefficients from this series of regressions in Panel A (for blacks) and Panel
B (for whites) of Figure 4, together with distribution of educational outcomes pre-suffrage.
For blacks, we find that the impact of suffrage on education attainment is concentrated
between 4 and 9 years of education. For whites, we find small effects between 7 and 9 years
of education. Relative to the baseline distributions, the impacts for both blacks and whites
are clustered around the median for each group, which is 5 years for blacks and 8 years for
whites. Thus, it appears that one of the main benefits of suffrage may have been to help
raise the schooling of children who otherwise would have been at the bottom-to-middle of
the education distribution.


5.3     Literacy and Labor Market Outcomes
    The previous discussions focused on the impact of suffrage on the quantity of education
attained. In this section, we examine whether the extended time in school led to the acqui-
sition of literacy, and whether the impacts on education translated into gains in the labor
market.

Literacy We analyze effects on literacy as a proxy for whether suffrage led to increases in
measurable skills. Note, though, that since literacy was near-universal by the 1900 cohort,
especially among whites, this measure will only pick up improvements in very basic abilities
(Collins and Margo, 2006).27 Even with this little variation, Appendix Figure A.6 indicates
that there were some positive impacts on literacy, with up to a 5 percentage point increase
for black children exposed at the youngest ages.28 While these results are measured with
error, this provides suggestive evidence that suffrage led to improvements in literacy together
with extended schooling.

Labor Market Outcomes Next, we analyze whether suffrage impacted labor market
outcomes, including the likelihood that an individual is employed (which we define as having
non-zero wage earnings), real wage earnings (in 1960 dollars and including 0’s), and the
log of real wage earnings.29,30 Here we limit our sample to men and women between the
  27
     Among the 1900 cohort, whites and blacks had literacy rates above 98% and 82%, respectively (Collins
and Margo, 2006).
  28
     However, we note that there is a pre-trend in this outcome, which suggests that suffrage may have had
spillover impacts to older groups, or may have been preceded by policies that improved the quality, but not
quantity of schooling for older cohorts.
  29
     For reference, $1 in 1960 is the equivalent of $8.75 in 2020, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
  30
     We test the sensitivity of these results to dropping data from the 1940 census, which, unlike the other
censuses, does not report the earnings of self-employed workers (Collins and Wanamaker, 2014), and find


                                                      18
ages of 30 and 65. Motivated by the heterogeneity in our education analysis, we allow the
effect of exposure to suffrage on labor outcomes to vary for individuals in the South and by
pre-suffrage education.
    Panel A of Table 4 shows that full exposure to suffrage for Southern whites led to a
large and significant effect on log earnings (22 percent), and a positive effect on earnings
($170, p > 0.10), with no impact on employment.31 We also find a significant effect on
earnings for blacks outside the South ($464), along with large increases in employment (12.7
p.p.) However, for Southern blacks, we find an insignificant impact on employment and
a marginally significant decline in earnings. The absence of labor market gains for this
group is perhaps not entirely surprising – it is consistent with prior evidence of labor market
discrimination or and the low quality of education for this group (Card and Krueger, 1992;
Karbownik and Wray, 2019; Bhalotra and Venkataramani, 2015).32 The point estimates are
noisy, though, and we can not rule out some small earnings gains.
    In Panel B, we find that impacts on earnings levels are larger for whites from states with
low average education pre-suffrage (p < 0.10). We also find that impacts on employment are
suggestively larger for blacks from states with higher education, consistent with our larger
effects for blacks from outside the South. These results reinforce our conclusions above: that
suffrage-induced education gains led to improvements in labor market outcomes for many
groups, but – importantly – not for Southern blacks.


6     Mechanisms
    We interpret our education results as the reduced form effect of increased women’s bar-
gaining power and public spending, which could affect human capital through improvements
in health and educational quality. In this section we explore which of these mechanisms,
if any, could account for the larger impact of suffrage on the education of less-advantaged
groups.

Mechanism 1: Bargaining First, political empowerment may increase the bargaining
power of women in the household by reducing a woman’s reliance on her husband. Our
similar results.
   31
      We find no impact of suffrage exposure on labor market outcomes for whites outside the South, consistent
with the absence of education gains for that group. For the event study figures for log income for whites,
see Appendix Figure A.7.
   32
      In Appendix Figure A.8 we show distributional effects on earnings by race and by South/non-South,
using the same methodology as the distributional effects on education in Figure 4. It confirms the lack of
effects for Southern blacks at any level of earnings, and indicates that impacts on earnings for Southern
whites and blacks outside the South were concentrated around the median to 75th percentile of earnings.


                                                     19
evidence is weakest for this channel since we do not observe much of intra-household behavior,
including spending. Nevertheless, while this channel may have contributed to the effects
on white children, it is less plausible for disenfranchised black communities. Thus, while
bargaining may be a contributing factor to our estimates, it is unlikely to be the only channel.

Mechanism 2: Health Improvements Second, to examine heterogeneous improvements
in health, we regress the log of the number of infant mortalities in a state on an indicator
for the years after suffrage together with our controls for state demographics and policies,
state and year fixed effects, and state linear time trends. We do this separately for whites
and blacks, and then test for interactions with South or pre-suffrage levels of education
(determined by state and race, as previously.)
    Appendix Table A.12 shows that suffrage led to declines in mortality, particularly for
whites. Mortality improvements are larger in the South and for groups with lower pre-
suffrage education. However, unlike our impacts on education, the mortality effects are
small for blacks outside the South and significant for whites in the non-South (p < 0.05).
In that sense, our impacts on education to not appear to be explained by improvements in
mortality.33
    In Appendix Table A.13, we perform a bounding exercise following Lee (2009) to examine
the potential role of selection from infant mortality in our education estimates. In particular,
we trim the top (bottom) of education outcomes to obtain the lower (upper) bound of the
impact of suffrage. We obtain a lower bound that is similar to our main results, and an
upper bound that is at least four times as large as our main estimates for both whites and
blacks. This suggests that our baseline estimates, if anything, may be an underestimate of
the true effects of suffrage accounting for selection.

Mechanism 3: Education Spending Third, we use our data on city-level spending,
revenues and enrollment to examine dynamic impacts on education spending, revenue, and
enrollment post-suffrage. We estimate:

                            7
                            X
               Yca = α0 +          βt (YearRelSuffrageca = t) + γ0Zsa + δc + φa + ca              (5)
                            t=−5


where c and a index city and academic year, respectively. YearRelSuffrageca = t is thus an
indicator for t academic years since suffrage. We pair together consecutive academic years
to increase power, and omit the pair of years consisting of the year that was suffrage was
  33
    However, there may be other unobserved improvements in health (e.g., reductions in the severity and
duration of sickness spells) that could have contributed to increases in schooling attendance.


                                                  20
passed and the preceding year. Zsa , δc and φat indicate state demographic controls, city and
academic year fixed effects, respectively.
     Table 5 examines average impacts on log expenditures (column 1), log total, local, and
state revenue (columns 2–4), and school enrollment (column 5). Schooling expenditures
post-suffrage increased by 3.4% within one year (p > 0.10), by 10.8% (p < 0.05) within three
years, and by 13.9% (p < 0.05) within five years. Further, these effects persist for at least
seven years post-suffrage.34,35 Suffrage also led to an 11 to 15 percent increase in revenue
within the first seven years post-suffrage. This increase in revenue was driven primarily by
increases in local revenue (city + county), with insignificant (and often negative) impacts on
state revenue. Finally, we find positive but insignificant average effects on enrollment.
     To examine heterogeneous effects of suffrage, we allow the estimated effect of suffrage
on spending and enrollment to differ across three measures of “status” or “advantage.” In
particular, we allow the effect of suffrage to vary by (i) the average level of education in the
state prior to suffrage (the same measure used in our earlier analysis); (ii) non-South; and
(iii) black share of the city population in 1910.36
     The left panels of Figure 5 present the implied effects of suffrage on log expenditures for
cities in the 75th and 25th percentiles of pre-suffrage level of education (panel A) and share
black (panel B), and for the South and non-South (panel C). We also show the difference
between the 75th and 25th percentiles (panels A and B) or between the South and non-South
(panel C).37 We find that both more- and less-advantaged cities experienced increases in
log expenditures after suffrage. However, suggestively, areas with lower education, higher
share black, and in the South appear to have experienced larger increases in spending. For
example, our results imply that educational expenditures increased by 21 log points in the
South within five years (23 percent), or roughly twice the 13 percent increase outside the
South.38 The differences across areas are not typically statistically significantly different,
but we may have less power due to the limited number of cities in our sample (and in each
of these subgroups.)
     The right panels of Figure 5 show that post-suffrage school enrollment follows a similar
path as expenditures, with larger gains in cities with lower education, higher share black,
  34
     We find comparable effects on expenditures per pupil.
  35
     We note that funding increases of this magnitude were relatively common during this period, which had
rapid growth in school funding. School revenues grew by at least 10% in over 50% of the consecutive years
in our sample, indicating that funding levels were relatively malleable. See Appendix Table A.14.
  36
     We thank Claudia Goldin for generously providing us with the data on black population used in Goldin
and Katz (2010). We match these data to 233 cities in our sample.
  37
     See Appendix Table A.15 for the individual coefficients.
  38
     These estimated impacts on spending in the South are consistent with Carruthers and Wanamaker
(2014), despite our different identification strategies, states in the analysis, and data sources.



                                                   21
and in the South. We are able to reject that the difference in enrollment gains is zero for each
of the measures of disadvantage. This aligns well with the pattern of gains in educational
attainment we find in the Census.
    In sum, we find a close link between increases in education spending, education enroll-
ment, and completed education. We interpret this as evidence that changes in education
spending post-suffrage were in all likelihood the primary channel for educational gains. We
reinforce this intuition below by verifying that our effects could quantitatively be explained
by the post-suffrage increases in education spending.

Pass-through to White and Black Schools Our results show that suffrage increased
school spending at the city-level. To connect these effects to increases in education in the
South, which was highly segregated, we next consider how much of this growth in city-level
spending would have been “passed-through” to white and black schools (i.e., the elasticity
of spending at black or white schools to city-level spending).
    Since there are no existing estimates of pass-through (to our knowledge), we estimate
this using county-level data from South Carolina and Georgia on education expenditures for
white schools, black schools, and in total (Carruthers and Wanamaker, 2019, see Appendix
B for details.) We regress log spending (or per-pupil spending) for white or black schools
on log county spending (or per-pupil spending), together with county and year fixed effects.
To focus on pass-through after suffrage, we estimate a separate coefficient on log county
(per-pupil) expenditures after 1920.39
    The results shown in Appendix Tables A.16 and A.17 show that 10% growth in county
(per-pupil) funding leads to 10% (10%) growth in county (per-pupil) spending for white
schools, and 6.3% (5.1%) growth in county (per-pupil) spending for black schools.40 Using
the smaller estimates of pass-through, this implies that suffrage led to a 11.2 and 23 percent
rise in spending in black and white schools in the South, respectively. Relative to the rest
of the country, this places the percent rise in education spending for blacks in the South at
the average percent growth outside of the South, and the percent rise in spending for white
schools in the South substantially above the mean of the percent growth outside the South.
This matches up with the patterns of education growth (which was higher for whites in the
South relative to the non-South, and similar for blacks in the South and non-South.)
  39
      In general, we find that pass-through to black schools increases after 1920, in contrast to Carruthers
and Wanamaker (2014).
   40
      The impacts on white and black schools do not average to one because in the data total spending is
frequently larger than the sum of spending on white and black schools. We interpret this as reflecting
administrative costs, although it may also be an error in transcription.




                                                    22
Magnitude and Timing of Effects The up to one year increase in educational attain-
ment from suffrage that we document is large, but aligns with other sizable education inter-
ventions. This effect is similar in magnitude to the impact of the Rosenwald school-building
initiative (Aaronson and Mazumder, 2011) and court-ordered desegregation (Johnson, 2015).
It is also not statistically distinguishable from the estimated impact of a 20% increase in
per-pupil spending throughout schooling for children from poor families in Jackson, Johnson
and Persico (2016) (0.92 years) and is within the bounds implied by the estimates in Hyman
(2017) (0.043–1.04 years).41,42
    Moreover, our impacts across groups fit with the previously-estimated effects of educa-
tion spending. In particular, when we scale the average effect from Jackson, Johnson and
Persico (2016) by our changes in education spending, we find that education spending could
explain 110%, 95%, and 73% of our effects for Southern whites, Southern blacks, and blacks
nationwide, respectively.43 This suggests that education spending is very likely to be the
primary mechanism for our education effects.
    The immediacy of the effects of suffrage on education funding and educational attainment
is also not particular to suffrage. For instance, Cascio, Gordon and Reber (2013) and Gordon
(2004) find that cities are able to adjust local education funding in 1 to 3 years in response
to federal education grants. Further, Jackson, Johnson and Persico (2016) find that cohorts
that benefited from any increase in spending show at least some evidence of improvements in
education. This suggests that the education responses to spending following suffrage appear
to be generalizable beyond this setting.


7      Robustness
   In this section, we conduct a variety of robustness exercises to address potential concerns
and alternative explanations for our estimates.
  41
      See Table 3 of Jackson, Johnson and Persico (2016), which shows a 0.46 year increase in schooling for a
10% increase in spending. We obtain a comparable estimate from Hyman (2017), by applying the conversion
from post-secondary enrollment to completed schooling described in that paper to the 4.3 p.p increase in
post-secondary enrollment in low-income districts (Table 6.) We thus calculate that a 10% increase in
spending leads to at most a 0.52 year increase in completed schooling (0.043×3×4) and at least a 0.043
increase in completed schooling (0.043 ×1×1).
   42
      As another comparison, our effects are somewhat larger than the estimated impacts of compulsory
schooling laws, which increased schooling between 0.04 and 0.4 years for white men (Stephens and Yang,
2014), but it is somewhat difficult to compare this regulation-style policy with the infusion of resources from
suffrage.
   43
      We calculate these by scaling the 0.92 effect from Jackson, Johnson and Persico (2016) by the change in
spending for the group five years post suffrage as a fraction of 20%, and dividing that by our estimated effect
                                            23%
for the group. For Southern whites this is 20%   × 0.92
                                                   0.96 = 1.1; for Southern blacks this is
                                                                                           23%×0.63
                                                                                             20%    × 0.92
                                                                                                       0.7 = 0.95,
                                                                        13.9%   0.92
taking account 63% pass-through; and for blacks on average this is 20% × 0.88 = 0.73.


                                                       23
Mandatory States First, we check whether suffrage had an impact on education in states
that were mandated to accept suffrage by the Nineteenth Amendment (i.e, who did not vote
to ratify the Amendment.) This allows us to rule out the possibility that our effects are driven
by endogenous adoption of suffrage laws. Panel A of Appendix Table A.18 shows that in
fact suffrage had a larger effect on education in mandated states relative to voluntary states.
Nevertheless, Panel B shows that our effects are also robust to dropping the mandatory
states. Thus, the impact of suffrage does not appear to depend on how suffrage was adopted.

Randomization Test with Placebo Suffrage Laws Second, we perform a randomiza-
tion test that allows us to determine whether our effects could have arisen by chance (Athey
and Imbens, 2017). In particular, we randomly draw a placebo suffrage year between 1910
and 1920 for each state, and then assign placebo individual suffrage exposure based on that
placebo year. We then use Equation 2 to estimate the effect of placebo suffrage exposure
on educational attainment, separately for blacks and whites. We repeat this 1000 times.
Consistent with our main results, this test produces a p-value below 0.01 for the impacts
of suffrage on blacks’ education and a p-value of 0.31 for the impacts of suffrage on whites’
education (see Appendix Figure A.9.)

Migration by Parents or Children Third, we consider the potential role of migration
by parents (pre-birth) or by children (post-birth) in our results. The fact that we found
little change in state demographics following suffrage in Section 4.1 provides evidence against
selective migration by parents. To examine the role of child migration, we stratify our results
by individuals that remain in the same state of birth (“non-movers”) or not (“non-movers”).
We find that our effects are concentrated among non-movers (see Appendix Table A.19.)
Thus, it does not appear that education gains following suffrage were a result of migration.

World War II and the G.I. bill Fourth, we check whether exposure to suffrage might
be correlated with the likelihood of serving in World War II and, hence, with eligibility for
the G.I. bill. Controlling for region fixed effects, we find no correlation between the year
of suffrage and the proportion of the state serving in World War II (which we obtain from
Acemoglu, Autor and Lyle, 2004).44
  44
    Early cohorts in our sample born from 1880 to 1900 were also eligible to serve in WWI. Since these
cohorts are concentrated among our “control group”, we can look for evidence of bias from the War in the
form of pre-trend for the children too old to experience the benefits of suffrage. Our event studies show no
evidence of this, however, indicating that any effect of the War is absorbed by our control variables.




                                                    24
Additional checks Finally, we run a variety of additional specifications to verify the ro-
bustness of the results. These include trying alternative sample restrictions, e.g,: examining
results by census year (Appendix Table A.20); keeping states that passed suffrage prior to
1900 (Appendix Table A.21); only keeping individuals over 25 (Appendix Table A.22); or
restricting the sample to a smaller range of treatment ages (Appendix Figure A.10). They
also include testing alternative measures of treatment and controls, e.g.,: running a model
with a binary measure of exposure to suffrage (Appendix Table A.23); substituting our base-
line state controls (measured at birth) with average state conditions between ages 0–15 or
an interaction between state conditions in 1900 with a linear trend (Appendix Table A.24,
Panels A–C); dropping compulsory law controls, allowing the effect of compulsory laws to
vary by age, adding controls for progressive laws, controlling for trends interacted with the
pre-suffrage education level of the state, and dropping states that had Rosenwald school
(Appendix Table A.24, Panels D–H). Our conclusions do not change across any of these
specifications.


8    Conclusion
    This paper presents new evidence on the effects of women’s political empowerment on chil-
dren’s human capital. We find that exposure to suffrage during childhood led to substantial
gains in educational attainment, particularly for children from economically disadvantaged
backgrounds. Full exposure to suffrage between the ages of 0 and 15 increased educational
attainment by slightly less than one year for black children and white children from the
South, who had the lowest levels of education pre-suffrage. We also provide new evidence
that suffrage led to disparate increases in education spending across the country. These
increases in spending appear to explain our heterogeneous impacts on education.
    On the whole, this article provides compelling evidence for the role of female voter prefer-
ences in influencing policy, both towards greater investments in children and less advantaged
groups. As political power increasingly equates to economic holdings, a future promising
avenue for research is to understand whether women’s economic power can lead to similar
gains. This question is of great relevance today given the push for gender equality in the
workplace. We leave it for future research to provide evidence in this area.

    Notes: This table presents results from 19 regressions where the outcome is shown in the first column, and the key
    coefficient of interest is on a trend in the number of years since suffrage. The regressions also include indicators for
    each year after suffrage, region-year fixed effects, state (or city) fixed effects, and state-year controls. Importantly,
    because we include indicators for each year after suffrage, the coefficient on the trend (shown in column 1) is identified
    only from pre-suffrage years, and therefore the p-value in column 3 can be interpreted as a test for whether there
    is a significant pre-trend for each outcome. “Pred Yrs Ed” is an education index generated by regressing the mean
    education for state-cohort cells pre-suffrage on state covariates (shown in the table) in the year of birth, and then
    obtaining fitted values for all state-cohort observations (separately for whites and blacks). For state-year cells where
    we do not observe mortality, we use a prediction that omits mortality as a covariate. The sample for each regression
    includes all states (or cities) for which we have at least three years of data prior to the passage of suffrage. Estimates
    are weighted using state (or city) population weights and standard errors are clustered at the state level. Sources:
    State characteristics from 1915 to 1930 are taken from Lleras-Muney (2002); infant mortality records from 1900 to
    1930 are digitized from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; and records on city-level education spending
    are digitized from the 1909 to 1911 and 1913 to 1915 Report of the Commissioner of Education and the 1917 to
    1927 Biennial Survey of Education for cities with populations of 10,000 and over.

Notes: This table presents results from regressions of completed years of education on suffrage exposure
between ages 0–15 (the share of time between birth and age 15 that an individual was exposed to a
suffrage law in his state of birth.) We are able to reject that the coefficients for the white and black
coefficients are the same (p < 0.045). All regressions include controls for demographics and state-level
characteristics, birth state and birth year fixed effects, birth state linear time trends, as well as region-
by-birth year and census year-by-birth year fixed effects. Estimates are weighted using Census sample
weights, and standard errors are clustered on the state of birth. The sample consists of individuals born
between 1880 and 1930, and that are at least 20 years old at the time of observation. We exclude states
that passed suffrage prior to 1900. Source: 1940-1960 decennial censuses. * p<0.10, ** p<0.05, ***

Notes: This table presents results from regressions of an indicator for having positive wage earnings (columns 1 and 4),
real wage earnings (including 0’s), $1960 (columns 2 and 5), and log real earnings on either (i) suffrage exposure between
ages 0–15 interacted with an indicator for non-South and an indicator for South (Panel A) or (ii) suffrage exposure
between ages 0–15 and the interaction between suffrage exposure and pre-suffrage average education in each state (Panel
B). Pre-suffrage average education is calculated using individuals who were are least age 16 in the year that suffrage was
passed. For reference, $1 in 1960 is the equivalent of $8.75 in 2020. All regressions include controls for demographics and
state-level characteristics, birth state and birth year fixed effects, birth state linear time trends, as well as region-by-birth
year and census year-by-birth year fixed effects. Estimates are weighted using Census sample weights, and standard
errors are clustered on the state of birth. The sample consists of individuals born between 1880 and 1930, and that are
at between 30 and 60 years old at the time of observation. We exclude states that passed suffrage prior to 1900. Source:

         Notes: This table presents results from regressions where the outcome is either log city schooling ex-
         penditures (column 1), log total revenue (total, from the state, or from local sources (city + county);
         columns 2–4), or log enrollment, and the key variables of interest are are indicators for the number
         of academic years since suffrage. All regressions include controls for state-level characteristics, and
         city and academic year fixed effects. Estimates are weighted using city population in 1910, and
         standard errors are clustered on state. The sample consists of all cities with available expenditure,
         revenue and enrollment data, which we observe for at least 7 years, and which are not outliers.

Notes: Suffrage laws are obtained from Lott and Kenny (1999) and Miller (2008), and the year in each state indicates the
first suffrage law passed in the state. “Mandatory states” implemented suffrage as a result of the Nineteenth Amendment, in
1920. See text for further detail.

Notes: This figure plots the estimated coefficients (and 95% confidence intervals) ob-
tained from event study specifications where the outcome is educational attainment,
estimated separately for whites and blacks. All specifications include controls for de-
mographics and state-level characteristics, birth state and birth year fixed effects, birth
state linear time trends, as well as region-by-birth year and census year-by-birth year
fixed effects. Age at treatment 16 to 17 is the omitted category so estimates are relative
to that point. Estimates are weighted using Census sample weights, and standard errors
are clustered on the state of birth. The sample consists of individuals born between
1880 and 1930, and that are at least 20 years old at the time of observation. We exclude
states that passed suffrage prior to 1900. Source: 1940-1960 decennial censuses.

  Notes: This figure shows coefficients (on the y-axis) from regressions of educational attainment on exposure
  to suffrage between ages 0–15, estimated separately for groups defined according to region of birth, race
  and gender. The x-axis shows the average pre-suffrage educational attainment (average attainment among
  individuals that were age 16 or older by the passage of suffrage in the state.) Marker size for each group is
  proportional to the number of observations in each group. Regions are abbreviated as follows: “S” for South,
  “W” for West, “MW” for Midwest, and “NE” for Northeast, and race is abbreviated as: “Bl” for black and
  “Wh” for white. We do not show blacks in the West due to their small sample size, but an equivalent
  figure that includes all groups is available on request. All regressions include controls for demographics
  and state-level characteristics, birth state and birth year fixed effects, birth state linear time trends, as well
  as region-by-birth year and census year-by-birth year fixed effects. Estimates are weighted using Census
  sample weights, and standard errors are clustered on the state of birth. The sample consists of individuals
  born between 1880 and 1930, and that are at least 20 years old at the time of observation. We exclude
  states that passed suffrage prior to 1900. Source: 1940-1960 decennial censuses.

         Notes: These figures plot the estimated coefficients (and 95% confidence intervals) from
         a series of regressions of indicators for whether an individual obtained x or greater
         years of education (1-CDF), where x is represented on the x-axis, on suffrage exposure
         between ages 0–15. Regressions are estimated separately for white and blacks, and they
         include controls for demographics and state-level characteristics, birth state and birth
         year fixed effects, birth state linear time trends, as well as region-by-birth year and census
         year-by-birth year fixed effects. Estimates are weighted using Census sample weights,
         and standard errors are clustered on the state of birth. For reference, we also show a
         histogram of the completed education of individuals who were exposed to suffrage after
         age 15, who serve as the comparison group in these regressions. The sample consists of
         individuals born between 1880 and 1930, and that are at least 20 years old at the time
         of observation. We exclude states that passed suffrage prior to 1900. Source: 1940-1960

Notes: These figures are obtained from event study specifications that analyze the effect of suffrage on log expenditures and log
enrollment, and that include an interaction between academic years since suffrage and one of our three measures of advantage.
The figures shows the implied effects of suffrage for the 75th and 25th percentile of each of our continuous measures of status
- education and share black - and for the South and non-South, as well as their difference. All regressions include controls
for state-level characteristics, and city and academic year fixed effects. Estimates are weighted using city population in 1910,
and standard errors are clustered on state. The sample consists 41of all cities with available expenditure, revenue and enrollment
data, which we observe for at least 7 years, and which are not outliers. Source: 1909 to 1911 and 1913 to 1915 Report of the
Commissioner of Education, and 1917 to 1927 Biennial Survey of Education for cities with populations of 10,000 and over. *

    Notes: This table contains results obtained when the dependent variable is (i) the share of progressive bills that
    a senator voted for (columns 1-2); (ii) the share of progressive bills that a senator abstained from (columns 3-
    4); and (iii) the share of progressive bills that the senator voted against (columns 5-6). We show results with
    levels in odd columns and logs in the even columns. Post-suffrage is an indicator for the years after suffrage was
    passed. Regressions include year fixed effects and state fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered at the state level.
    Panel A includes all senators voting between 1900 and 1930 (385 unique members), while Panel B only includes
    senators present for at least 1 year prior to suffrage, and 1 year after suffrage (108 unique members.) Sources:

Notes: This table contains results obtained when the dependent variable is years of education
and the main independent variable is suffrage exposure, which is defined as the share of time
between birth and age 15 that an individual was exposed to a suffrage law in his state of birth. All
regressions include controls for demographics and state-level characteristics, birth state and birth
year fixed effects, birth state linear time trends, as well as region-by-birth year and census year-
by-birth year fixed effects. Estimates are weighted using Census sample weights, and standard
errors are clustered on the state of birth. The sample consists of individuals born between 1880
and 1930, and that are at least 20 years old at the time of observation. We exclude states that
passed suffrage prior to 1900. Source: 1940-1960 decennial censuses. * p<0.10, ** p<0.05, ***

             Notes: Columns 1-6 of this table test whether the year of suffrage (columns 1, 3, and 5) or or “late”
             suffrage (columns 2, 4, and 6), a dummy for suffrage year ≥ 1920, is associated with levels of state-
             level covariates prior to suffrage, net of region fixed effects. Columns 1-2 use annual covariates from
             Lleras-Muney (2002) from 1915-17, and restrict to states that passed suffrage after 1917, and columns
             3-4 and 5-6, respectively use state-level covariates for 1900 and 1910 from ICPSR 2896, restricting
             to states that passed suffrage after 1910. Column 7 tests whether state-level demographic variables
             changed in the three years after suffrage, relative to the three years before suffrage, using the states
             from columns 1-2. We include regionxyear and state fixed effects for that specification. Standard
             errors are clustered on state in column (7). The F-test p-value comes from a test that the coefficients
             shown are jointly equal to zero, and the partial R2 reports the R2 of the variables shown in the
             table. * p<0.10, ** p<0.05, *** p<0.01.

Notes: This table tests whether the year of suffrage (columns 1 and 3) or “late” suffrage (columns 2 and 4),
a dummy for suffrage year ≥ 1920, is associated with changes in state-level covariates prior to suffrage, net
of region fixed effects. Columns 1-2 use annual data from Lleras-Muney (2002) from 1915-17, limiting the
sample to states that passed suffrage after 1917, and columns 3-4 use state-level covariates for 1900 and 1910
from ICPSR 2896, limiting the sample to states that passed suffrage after 1910. Hence, the independent
variables are either changes in state-level covariates between 1915-17 (columns 1 and 2) or changes in state-
level covariates between 1900-10. There were no changes in compulsory schooling laws between 1915-17 for
this sample, so instead we use changes from 1907-17 in columns (1)-(2). The F-test p-value comes from a
test that the coefficients shown are jointly equal to zero, and the partial R2 reports the R2 of the variables
shown in the table. * p<0.10, ** p<0.05, *** p<0.01.

                            independent variable is the generosity of New Deal relief spending in
                            the state, the total (1967 $) spent between 1929 and 1940 normal-
                            ized by the 1930 population (Fishback, Haines and Kantor, 2007).
                            All regressions include region fixed effects. Total relief is the sum of
                            direct and work relief, and is sourced from data made available from
                            Fishback, Haines and Kantor (2007). The sample excludes states
                            that passed suffrage prior to 1900. Suffrage laws are from Lott and
                            Kenny (1999) and Miller (2008). * p<0.10, ** p<0.05, *** p<0.01.

  Notes: This table contains results obtained when the dependent variable
  is years of education and the main independent variables are a spline in
  the number of years an individual is treated between the ages of 0 and 15.
  Therefore the coefficient for “Treated between X-Y” is the additional im-
  pact of one year of treatment during that age range; the text described an
  example for calculating the total effect of exposure to suffrage. All regres-
  sions include controls for demographics and state-level characteristics, birth
  state and birth year fixed effects, birth state linear time trends, as well as
  region-by-birth year and census year-by-birth year fixed effects. All regres-
  sions include sample weights, and standard errors are clustered at the state
  level. The sample consists of individuals born between 1880 and 1930, and
  that are at least 20 years old at the time of observation. We exclude states

    Notes: This table contains results obtained when the dependent
    variable is years of education and the main independent variable
    is suffrage exposure, which is defined as the share of time between
    birth and age 15 that an individual was exposed to a suffrage law
    in his state of birth. All regressions include controls for demo-
    graphics and state-level characteristics, birth state and birth year
    fixed effects, birth state linear time trends, as well as census year-
    by-birth year fixed effects. Estimates are weighted using Census
    sample weights, and standard errors are clustered on the state of
    birth. The sample consists of individuals born between 1880 and
    1930, and that are at least 20 years old at the time of observation.
    We exclude states that passed suffrage prior to 1900. The bottom
    rows of the table test the hypothesis that the effects are equal
    for all four regions (NE, MW, S, W) or for all regions except the
    West, since there we have some concerns about overfitting for
    blacks in the West. For reference, the number of observations
    for whites (blacks) in the NE, MW, S, and W, respectively, is:
    397,080 (7,381); 509,551 (7,946); 421,211 (140,982); 66,013 (537).
    The average years of education for whites (blacks) pre-suffrage in
    the NE, MW, S, and W, respectively, is: 9.3 (7.9); 9.1 (7.8); 8.0

 Notes: The dependent variable is log infant mortality. Post suffrage is a dummy
 variable that takes the value of one if the state passed suffrage by the current year.
 We include interactions between post suffrage and either South (column 2) or pre-
 suffrage education levels (column 3). Pre-suffrage education is calculated for each
 state (and race for Panels B and C) as the average education in that sample among
 individuals age 16 and above in the year that suffrage was passed. All regressions
 include controls for state-level characteristics, state and year fixed effects, and state
 linear time trends. Estimates are weighted using population weights, and standard
 errors are clustered on the state. We exclude states that passed suffrage prior to
 1900. Source: 1900 to 1932 mortality records by state, age, race, and gender from

        change in mortality by South/non-South and race that we esti-
        mate in Appendix Table A.12. In columns (2) and (4) we drop

        on the state of birth. The sample consists of individuals born
        between 1880 and 1930, and that are at least 20 years old at
        the time of observation. We exclude states that passed suffrage
        prior to 1900. Source: 1940-1960 decennial censuses. p<0.10,

Notes: This table contains results obtained when the dependent variables are log expenditures and
log enrollment, and the independent variables of interest are academic years since suffrage interacted
with one of our three measures of advantage: state-level pre-suffrage education levels (columns 1
and 4); city-level black share of the population (columns 2 and 5); and whether the city is located
in the South (columns 3 and 6.) All regressions include controls for state-level characteristics, and
city and academic year fixed effects. Estimates are weighted using city population in 1910, and
standard errors are clustered on state. The sample consists of all cities with available expenditure,
revenue and enrollment data, which we observe for at least 7 years, and which are not outliers.

          posure, which is defined as the share of time between birth and age 15
          that an individual was exposed to a suffrage law in his state of birth. In
          Panel A, suffrage exposure is interacted with indicators for “mandatory”
          and voluntary states, where “mandatory states” are the state that did
          not pass suffrage prior to the Nineteenth Amendment nor voluntarily
          ratified it. In Panel B, the sample is restricted to states that passed
          suffrage voluntarily as defined above. All regressions include controls for

          fixed effects, birth state linear time trends, as well as region-by-birth year
          and census year-by-birth year fixed effects. Estimates are weighted using

            Notes: This table contains results obtained when the dependent variable is years of
            education and the main independent variable is suffrage exposure, which is defined
            as the share of time between birth and age 15 that an individual was exposed to a
            suffrage law in his state of birth. Each panel and column presents estimates from
            separate regressions. Each panel title refers to a separate robustness exercise, see
            text for details. Panel E reports results where we include a control for the relevant
            compulsory schooling law at each age, from age 1 to 18. All regressions include
            controls for demographics, birth state and birth year fixed effects, birth state linear
            time trends, as well as region-by-birth year and census year-by-birth year fixed
            effects. Estimates are weighted using Census sample weights, and standard errors
            are clustered on the state of birth. The sample consists of individuals born between
            1880 and 1930, and that are at least 20 years old at the time of observation. We
            exclude states that passed suffrage prior to 1900. Source: 1940-1960 decennial

Notes: This figure plots the estimated coefficients obtained from an event study spec-
ification that analyzes the effect of suffrage on state-level presidential turnout, defined
as the natural logarithm of total number of votes at the presidential elections divided
by the voting eligible age, 21+. We control for state and year fixed effects, weight the
estimates using population weights, and cluster the standard errors at the state level.
The two years prior to the passage of suffrage are the omitted category, so estimates are
relative to that point. The sample excludes states that passed suffrage prior to 1900.

These figures are obtained from event study specifications that analyze the effect of suffrage on (i) the share of progressive bills that
a senator voted for; (ii) the share of progressive bills that a senator abstained from; and (iii) the share of progressive bills that the
senator voted against. The “Within” panels includes individual fixed effects, while the “Total” panels do not. “Base” specification in
black diamonds includes year fixed effects and state fixed effects. Wee add state trends and region-by-year fixed effects as a robustness
check, shown with the grey open diamonds. Event study coefficients are relative to t=-1. We group together the years t≥5 and t≤-5,
shown at the end-points. Standard errors are clustered at the state level. Sources: Coding of progressive and anti-progressive bills

                    estimated coefficients along with the three different average pre-suffrage measure of disadvantage for each demographic
                    group, with the circle/triangle size representing the number of observations in each group. Regions are abbreviated as
                    follows: “S” for South, “W” for West, “MW” for Midwest, and “NE” for Northeast, and race is abbreviated as: “Bl”
                    for black and “Wh” for white. We do not show blacks in the West due to their small sample size, but an equivalent
                    figure that includes all groups is available on request. All regressions include controls for demographics and state-level
                    characteristics, birth state and birth year fixed effects, birth state linear time trends, as well as region-by-birth year and
                    census year-by-birth year fixed effects. Estimates are weighted using Census sample weights, and standard errors are
                    clustered on the state of birth. The sample consists of individuals born between 1880 and 1930, and that are at least 20
                    years old at the time of observation. We exclude states that passed suffrage prior to 1900. Source: 1940-1960 decennial

        Notes: This figure plots the estimated coefficients (and 95% confidence intervals) ob-
        tained from event study specifications that analyze the effect of suffrage at each age of
        first exposure on educational attainment and includes an interaction between the age
        at treatment dummies and whether the state of birth is in the South or Non-South,
        estimated separately for whites and blacks. All specifications include controls for de-
        mographics and state-level characteristics, birth state and birth year fixed effects, birth
        state linear time trends, as well as region-by-birth year and census year-by-birth year
        fixed effects. Age at treatment 16 to 17 is the omitted category so estimates are relative
        to that point. Estimates are weighted using Census sample weights, and standard errors
        are clustered on the state of birth. The sample consists of individuals born between
        1880 and 1930, and that are at least 20 years old at the time of observation. We exclude
        states that passed suffrage prior to 1900. Source: 1940-1960 decennial censuses.

   Notes: This figure plots the estimated coefficients (and 95% confidence intervals) ob-
   tained from event study specifications that analyze the effect of suffrage at each age of
   first exposure on literacy attainment, separately for whites and blacks. All specifications
   include controls for demographics and state-level characteristics, birth state and birth
   year fixed effects, birth state linear time trends, as well as region-by-birth year and cen-
   sus year-by-birth year fixed effects. Age at treatment 16 to 17 is the omitted category
   so estimates are relative to that point. Estimates are weighted using Census sample
   weights, and standard errors are clustered on the state of birth. The sample consists of
   individuals born between 1880 and 1915, and that are at least 15 years old at the time
   of observation. We exclude states that passed suffrage prior to 1900. Source: 1920-1930

Notes: This figure plots the estimated coefficients (and 95% confidence intervals) obtained from event study specifications
that analyze the effect of suffrage at each age of first exposure on log income, and includes an interaction between the age at
treatment dummies and whether the state of birth is in the South or Non-South, estimated separately for whites and blacks.
All specifications include controls for demographics and state-level characteristics, birth state and birth year fixed effects, birth
state linear time trends, as well as region-by-birth year and census year-by-birth year fixed effects. Age at treatment 16 to
17 is the omitted category so estimates are relative to that point. Estimates are weighted using Census sample weights, and
standard errors are clustered on the state of birth. The sample consists of individuals born between 1880 and 1930, and that
are at between 30 and 65 years old at the time of observation. We exclude states that passed suffrage prior to 1900. Source:

Notes: These figures plot the estimated coefficients (and 95% confidence intervals) from a series of regressions of indicators for
whether an individual had earnings ($1960 at least as great as x, where x is represented on the x-axis, on suffrage exposure
between ages 0–15. Regressions are estimated separately for white and blacks and by south/non-south, and they include controls
for demographics and state-level characteristics, birth state and birth year fixed effects, birth state linear time trends, as well
as region-by-birth year and census year-by-birth year fixed effects. Estimates are weighted using Census sample weights, and
standard errors are clustered on the state of birth. For reference, we also include a histogram of the earnings of individuals
who were exposed to suffrage after age 15, who serve as the comparison group in these regressions. The sample consists of
individuals born between 1880 and 1930, and that are between the ages of 30–60 at the time of observation. We exclude states
that passed suffrage prior to 1900. Source: 1940-1960 decennial censuses.

Notes: These figures plot the distribution of the estimated difference-in-differences coefficients on suffrage exposure obtained
from 1000 repetitions where we randomly assign a year of suffrage between 1910 and 1920 to each state. The red line indicates
the estimated effect when we use the real suffrage laws. The empirical p-value for blacks is < 0.01 and for whites is 0.31. All
specifications include controls for demographics and state-level characteristics, birth state and birth year fixed effects, birth
state linear time trends, as well as region-by-birth year and census year-by-birth year fixed effects. Estimates are weighted
using Census sample weights. The sample consists of individuals born between 1880 and 1930, and that are at least 20 years
old at the time of observation. We exclude states that passed suffrage prior to 1900. Source: 1940-1960 decennial censuses.

           tained from event study specifications that analyze the effect of suffrage at each age of
           first exposure on educational attainment, estimated for blacks only separately for co-
           horts exposed to suffrage between -5 and 25 and between -8 and 25. All specifications
           include controls for demographics and state-level characteristics, birth state and birth
           year fixed effects, birth state linear time trends, as well as region-by-birth year and cen-
           sus year-by-birth year fixed effects. Age at treatment 16 to 17 is the omitted category
           so estimates are relative to that point. Estimates are weighted using Census sample
           weights, and standard errors are clustered on the state of birth. The sample consists of
           individuals born between 1880 and 1930, and that are at least 20 years old at the time
           of observation. We exclude states that passed suffrage prior to 1900. Source: 1940-1960

B      Appendix B: Data Appendix
Voter Turnout We obtain the number of votes cast in each presidential election for our
analysis of voter turnout in Section 1.1 from the ICPSR data series #8611: “Electoral Data
for Counties in the United States: Presidential and Congressional Races, 1840–1972” (Clubb,
Flanigan and Zingale, 2006).45 We estimate the population over age 21 using decennial census
data (Ruggles et al., 2020), with linear interpolation for the intercensal years.

State Controls We source these measures from the data set used in Lleras-Muney (2002)
(and made available on Adriana Lleras-Muney’s website)46 and ICPSR data series #2896
“Historical, Demographic, Economic, and Social Data: The United States, 1790–2002”
(Haines and Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research, 2010). The
ICPSR series harmonizes information from Census of Manufacturing and Census of Agri-
culture .47 The data from Lleras-Muney (2002) span the years 1915-1939 and have been
utilized in many previous studies of this time period, including Goldin and Katz (2010).
We use ICPSR #2896 to create an equivalent set of controls spanning from 1880-1914. We
linearly interpolate between decennial census observations to create annual measures.48 Fi-
nally, we use the 1870–1930 decennial censuses to generate estimates of literacy at birth for
each state and cohort (Ruggles et al., 2020).

Compulsory Schooling We use data on compulsory schooling requirements from 1910 to
1913 used in Goldin and Katz (2003), and from 1914 to 1944 used in Acemoglu and Angrist
(2000).49 We then determine the relevant schooling and labor laws for each cohort following
the assignment rules in Stephens and Yang (2014). In particular, the measure of compulsory
attendance, CA is defined for each cohort c born in state s as follows:
CAcs = min{DropoutAgecs − EnrollmentAgecs , Years of SchoolNeeded to Dropoutcs }, where
each of the components of CA are determined by the prevailing laws in state s in the
year that c turns 14. Child labor, CLcs is defined as: CLcs = max{WorkPermitAgecs −
EnrollmentAgecs , EducationforWorkPermitcs }. Since we only have these laws beginning in

     These data are compiled from a number of sources. We accessed these data from Lleras-Muney’s former
website in April 2014, which has now been migrated to https://adriana-llerasmuney.squarespace.com/
data.

     Following Lleras-Muney (2002), we adjust all monetary values for inflation using the Consumer Price
Index, 1982-1984 as the base period.
  49
     For the data used in Acemoglu and Angrist (2000), we use the Stata dataset “schooling laws aa” in the
data archive of Stephens and Yang (2014). For the data used in Goldin and Katz (2003), we use the data
posted on Claudia Goldin’s website. See: https://scholar.harvard.edu/goldin/pages/data.

1910, we assume that cohorts that turned 14 before 1910 (born between 1880-1896) were
exposed to the 1910 laws.

Rosenwald Initiative We aggregate the county-level Rosenwald student exposure mea-
sure from the data archive of Aaronson and Mazumder (2011) to the state-level to generate
an individual measure of Rosenwald exposure during childhood.

Progressive Laws and New Deal Spending We hand-coded the years of progressive
laws that appear in Appendix Table A.5 based on tables in Skocpol (1992), Kantor and
Fishback (1996), and Depew, Edwards and Owens (2013). We obtain information on New
Deal Spending used in Table A.6 from the data used in Fishback, Haines and Kantor (2007),
and made available on Price Fishback’s website: http://www.u.arizona.edu/~fishback/
Published_Research_Datasets.html.

Mortality Statistics The Mortality Statistics were originally published by the U.S. Bu-
reau of the Census, but we obtained pdf files of historical statistics from 1900–1932 from
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Original pdfs can be downloaded from
http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/vsus/vsus_1890_1938.htm. We used optical char-
acter recognition (OCR) to convert the pdfs to Excel files and a research assistant manually
checked the values.

City-level Education Data During our period of interest, city-level education statistics
were published either in the Report of the Commissioner of Education (RCE) (annually,
academic years 1909/10 until 1915/16) or in the Biennial Survey of Education (BSE) (bi-
ennially, from 1917/18 on). We downloaded pdfs for all of the years we digitized, 1906 to
1911 and 1913 to 1928, from HathiTrust Digital Library (https://www.hathitrust.org/),
except 1923/24, which we scanned ourselves for better image quality. We selected three
tables to digitize in each year: the school census, which has enrollment and attendance; the
“receipts of school systems”, which contains sources of revenue; and the expenses and outlays
table, which has total current expenditures. We digitized this information for all cities with
populations over 10,000 using an external digitization service.
    To obtain our final city panel data, we first harmonized the naming conventions across
years by manually looking for cases where the name changed very slightly across years (e.g.,
“Windham (P. O. Willimantic)” became “Windham (P. O., Willimantic)”). Second, we
manually identified cities that merged or split, and generated consistent names for these
cities. Third, since the reporting categories for local revenue (city and county) varied across


                                              73
years, we aggregated these to create a comparable measure over time. We define revenue
from local sources as total revenue minus revenue from the state.

Congressional Voting We draw on Congressional roll call data from Voteview (Lewis
et al., 2019) and the coding of progressive bills used in Miller (2008) (and made available on
Grant Miller’s website) for our analysis of voting in the Senate in Section 1.1.50 The data
include all votes by legislators in the Senate and the House of Representatives from 1900 to
1930, and indicators for whether the bill voted on was “progressive” or “anti-progressive.”
Following Miller (2008), we consider voting “no” on an anti-progressive bill or “yes” on a
progressive bill to be a “progressive” vote. To be as inclusive as possible, we include votes
on bills marked questionably progressive or questionably anti-progressive in this category.

County-level Education Expenditures To estimate “pass-through” of growth in county
spending to black and white schools, we use a panel of county-level education expenditures
for Georgia and South Carolina from 1910 to 1940 obtained from ICPSR (Carruthers and
Wanamaker, 2019). These data were previously used in Carruthers and Wanamaker (2014).51
Expenditure data are available for South Carolina for every academic year, and for Georgia
for every academic year between 1910–1922 and for every other academic year between
1922–1940. The data include information on expenditures for white schools, black schools,
and total expenditures52 We compute expenditures per pupil by dividing expenditures by
enrollment.

we accessed on August 1, 2019.

      The data also include race-specific school spending for Louisiana and Arkansas, but for a shorter period
(from 1922–1940 for Louisiana, and every other year from 1928–1940 for Arkansas.)
   52
      Total expenditures are frequently larger than the sum of expenditures for white and black schools, which
could represent administrative costs.
