        This paper examines the surprising performance of the Argentine stock market in the midst of the

country’s most recent financial crisis and the role played by ADRs in Argentine capital flight. Although

Argentine investors were subject to capital controls, they were able to purchase stocks with associated ADRs

for pesos in Argentina, convert them into ADRs, re-sell them in New York for dollars and deposit the dollar

proceeds in U.S. bank accounts. In the paper we show that: (1) ADR discounts went as high as 60% (indicating

that Argentine investors were willing to pay significant amounts in order to legally move their funds abroad),

(2) the market anticipated (correctly) a 40% devaluation, (3) local market factors in Argentina became more

important in pricing peso denominated stocks with associated ADRs, while the same stocks in New York were

mainly priced based on global factors, (4) capital outflow using the ADR market was substantial (our estimate

is between $835 million and $3.4 billion) .

1. Introduction

        This paper examines the surprising performance of the Argentine stock market in the

midst of the country’s most recent financial crisis and the role played by ADRs1 in Argentine

capital flight. Although the exact timing and causes of Argentina’s economic fall from grace are

contentious, there is little disagreement that by the last quarter of 2001 Argentina was on the

brink of a full-scale collapse.2 Between July and November 2001, Argentines withdrew over $15

billion from banks -- on November 30, 2001 alone, banks saw withdrawals of $1.3 billion. On

December 3rd, in a desperate effort to prevent further massive capital outflows, financial market

controls were established (these are known as the “Corralito”), which among other restrictions,

imposed a ceiling of $1,000 a month on bank withdrawals.3 In January the Argentine peso was

  American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) are shares of non-U.S. (in this case Argentine) corporations sold in the U.S
(and denominated in dollars). Although Depositary Receipts (DRs) can be issued in a number of markets, all of the
cross-listed firms from Argentina issued DRs in the United States; consequently, we will refer to Argentine cross-
listed shares as ADRs.
2
  Mussa (2002) makes the case that the persistent inability of the Argentine government to run responsible fiscal
policy was the primary cause of the economic collapse. Others point to the deleterious effects of an over-valued
currency on exports (see, for example, Feldstein (2002)) and the sudden stop in foreign capital inflows (Calvo,
Izquierdo, and Talvi (2002)).
3
  A literal translation of “Corralito” is little corral. It is also the word for “playpen.”


                                                        1
officially devalued, all bank deposits and debts were “pesofied”, and U.S. dollar accounts were

no longer permitted.

         In contrast to the experiences of other emerging markets, the crisis appears to have been

“good news” for the Argentine stock market.4 Figure 1 shows the stock market indices

(denominated in dollars) in Argentina, Malaysia, Mexico and Thailand during their respective

financial crises.5 The stock markets in Malaysia, Mexico and Thailand stagnated in the weeks

preceding their currency devaluations, and then sharply declined after devaluation. While the

market in Argentina was also in a slump two months before the devaluation, the Corralito

triggered a 50 percent expansion of the market. One interpretation of the stock market run up in

Argentina is that for some reason investors viewed the likely devaluation of the peso as

beneficial for firms, whereas in other countries such crises are generally harmful.6 The

contention of this paper, however, is that the idiosyncratic reaction of the Argentine stock market

was largely due to the specific restrictions in the Corralito that allowed investors to use their

frozen bank deposits to purchase Argentine stocks, and, in so doing, provided a legal mechanism

for transferring funds abroad via ADRs.7 Based on data on ADR discounts and trading volume

we find that Argentine investors were willing to pay a substantial price to move their deposits out

of Argentina through ADR conversions. At their peak, some ADRs were trading at a discount of



4
   It is interesting to note that the Argentine stock market began its upturn when the Corralito was first imposed on
December 3rd, and then rose even higher after President De La Rua and Finance Minister Domingo Cavallo resigned
(December 19 and 20th) when expectations of an impending devaluation intensified. It was not until after the
announcement of the devaluation (on January 7th) that the stock market, measured in US dollars, began its decline.

  The vertical line on the figure marks the corresponding devaluation date for each country. The flat intervals in the
plot indicate periods when the Argentine market was closed. All returns are measured in U.S. dollars.
6
  See, for example, Forbes (2002).
7
  It is clear that the Argentine government understood the role ADRs might play in allowing citizens to transfer
funds abroad. However, because ADRs were associated with most of the largest publicly traded Argentine
companies it would have been difficult for the government to disallow ADR transactions (and risk sending the
Argentine stock market into a tail spin). Also, the fact that ADR conversions did not have a direct impact on Central
Bank reserves, a topic we will return to, meant that the government was less concerned about this channel of capital
outflow.

in excess of 40 cents on the dollar. A rough estimate is that such transactions resulted in a capital

outflow of roughly $835 million to $3.4 billion between December 1, 2001 and May 31, 2002.

                                               [Figure 1 here]

        There is an extensive literature on ADRs and their role in the global integration of

financial markets (see, for example, the survey by Karolyi (1998)). The holder of an ADR has

the right to redeem the receipt for the underlying shares at any point, so that in the absence of

capital market restrictions, and adjusting for the exchange rate, the ADR and the underlying

share are perfect substitutes.8 Cross-listing in the United States allows firms in foreign markets to

enjoy the advantages of greater liquidity, transparency and access to the U.S. capital market.9

From the perspective of U.S. investors, ADRs are a convenient way of obtaining global

diversification.10 In general, the literature suggests that ADRs are efficiently priced – after

correcting for differences in exchange rates and transactions costs, the law of one price does

appear to hold for cross-listed stocks (Kato et al. (1991) and Park and Tavakkol (1994)).

        Viewed against this backdrop, Argentina appears to be a unique case in which a country

with a significant number of cross-listed stocks and relatively well-integrated financial markets

subsequently attempted to close its financial borders. The unusual set of circumstances in

Argentina give ADRs a new, and previously unstudied, role as a mechanism for capital flight.11

The Argentine case suggests that, once having established ADRs and other kinds of contractual

   Conversely, the holder of the underlying shares has the option of converting the shares into ADRs. Each ADR
denotes a specific number of the underlying shares (which remain on deposit at the depositary’s custodian bank in
the issuer's home market).

  See, for example, Alexander, Eun and Jankiramanan (1987), Foerster and Karolyi (1999), Miller (1999), Ahearne,
Griever, and Warnock (2001), and Doidge, Karolyi and Stulz (2002).

   See, for example, Officer and Hoffmeister (1987), Whahab and Khanduala (1993) and Jiang (1998). Domovitz,

influences of ADR programs on the development and integration of markets.

   Melvin (2002) also documents the unusual behavior of the Argentine stock market and the role of ADRs during
the Corralito period.

arrangements across markets, it may be difficult if not impossible to reverse the process of

capital market integration with (even draconian) capital controls.

       The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides details about the specific

restrictions of the Corralito and defines the arbitrage premium/discount between local and U.S.

ADR prices. Section 3 examines the behavior of non-ADR and ADR returns pre- and post-

Corralito and calculates arbitrage bounds for ADRs based on the transactions costs that U.S. and

Argentine investors faced during the December 2001 to July 2002 period. We then use the ADR

premium to estimate the market’s expectation of the devaluation. Section 4 examines the market

factors that influenced ADR portfolio returns in New York and Argentina before and after the

imposition of the Corralito. Finally, in section 5 we discuss the decline of ADRs as a

mechanism for capital outflow in March 2002 and the rise of Argentine certificates of deposit

(CEDEARs) as an alternative channel for arbitrage and capital flow.

2. ADRs, The Corralito and the Argentine Stock Market

       In principle the performance of the Argentine stock market in the pre-devaluation period

is puzzling. Just one month before a widely anticipated devaluation of the peso and in the midst

of a staggering financial crisis with massive capital outflows and bank runs, the stock market was

booming. To place the recent performance of the stock market in some perspective, Figure 2

shows Argentina’s stock market index, the Merval, in pesos and U.S. dollars, from January 1990

to April 2002. Argentina’s currency board was established in March 1991, triggering a stock

market boom that lasted until June 1992. The market was negatively affected by the Mexican

crisis in late 1994, and again by the Asian crisis in 1997, but stayed well above its pre-March

1991 level. Beginning in early 2000, however, the market began a steady decline, sliding down

to levels not seen in a decade.

2.1 The Corralito

          By mid-2001, years of stagnating economic growth, lagging exports, weak banks and

mounting fiscal deficits had taken their toll. In October negotiations over a bailout package with

the IMF failed and Argentina was on the brink of financial collapse. To stave off a run on banks

and a speculative attack on the peso, on December 1, 2001 Finance Minister Cavallo announced

a series of restrictions on bank withdrawals and dollar transfers abroad. Under the Corralito,

depositors were limited to withdrawals of 250 pesos per week but could access their accounts to

transfer funds within the banking system.12 Wire transfers required Central Bank approval,

foreign currency futures transactions were prohibited, and in effect, all investors, foreign and

domestic, were prohibited from transferring funds abroad. The restrictions were announced as

temporary measures that would remain in place until the danger of the speculative attack had

passed.

          The Corralito, did not, however, restrict investors from trading Argentine securities

including those that were cross-listed on another market. Indeed, to do so would have seriously

destabilized the local market as it would have prevented investors from trading in some of the

largest and most liquid stocks on the market. The ADR “loophole” worked as follows:

Argentine residents were allowed to use bank deposits in excess of the $1,000 monthly ceiling to

purchase Argentine stocks. If a stock happened to be cross-listed in another country those shares

could be legally converted from Argentine shares into ADRs. The ADRs could then be sold in

the United States and the dollar proceeds deposited in a U.S. account. Under normal

circumstances the dollar proceeds would appear in the Argentine Balance of Payments as a




                                                   5
capital inflow, as U.S. residents have acquired claims on Argentine firms. Under the Corralito,

however, the capital inflows did not occur, and the dollars and/or shares remained outside of

Argentina. In effect, the ADR “loophole” allowed Argentines to transfer monies abroad, but the

transactions did not result directly in a fall in Argentina’s international reserves (or a fall in

Argentine bank deposits). ADR conversions, however, did reduce the number of (underlying)

shares available on La Bolsa.

2.2 Costless and instantaneous arbitrage premia

        To help fix ideas, it is useful to define the trade-offs facing U.S. and Argentine investors.

We first assume that arbitrage between the two markets is instantaneous and costless. While this

is clearly unrealistic, it will establish a useful benchmark for examining transactions costs.

        We will use the following definitions:

         Pt L   = price of local shares, in pesos

         Pt ADR = price of ADR in the United States, in dollars

         St     = spot exchange rate, U.S. dollars per peso

         ξ      = number of underlying shares per unit of depositary receipt

        Consider the return to an Argentine investor who purchases local shares and then

converts them to an ADR. We take the view that given the extent of dollarization of the

Argentine economy, investors were concerned about preserving the dollar value of their assets,

and therefore we compute dollar returns. The instantaneous arbitrage premium on holding the

ADR is then:




12
   Some of the original withdrawal limits were eventually modified, though the main restrictions on capital outflow
still remain in place. See Appendix 1 for a detailed timeline of the changes in financial market regulations in
Argentina beginning in October 2001.

2.3 Arbitrage with transactions costs

Argentine investor

       Consider again an Argentine investor in period t who has purchased cross-listed

stocks. The investor can sell the stocks in Buenos Aires or transform the stocks into

ADRs and sell them in the United States. Transforming the stock into an ADR, setting

up a U.S. account and selling the stock takes time, and involves transaction costs and

different risks.13 Define n0 as the minimum time required to sell the ADR in New York,

and consider the following two strategies:

                  1) Sell the stock in Buenos Aires at ptL+ n

                  2) Sell the ADR in New York at ptADR
                                                   +n



where n≥n0. If the expected return of strategy 2 is larger than the expected return of strategy 1,

then every risk neutral local investor (assuming all the other investing opportunities are

arbitraged) would transform their stocks into ADRs and follow strategy 2. On the other hand,

under normal conditions risk-neutral local investors would simply hold their local shares when


13
  Information from brokers suggests that the time to conversion and the implicit exchange rate used in the
conversion process varied considerably across type of investor and across time. For this reason we use
contemporaneous prices and exchange rates as a benchmark in computing arbitrage returns.


                                                     7
the expected return of strategy 1 is bigger than expected return of strategy 2. The expected return

(at period t) in U.S. dollars of following strategy 2 is:14

                                + n (1- τ 3 )(1- τ 5 )] - τ 4 -[ξ pt (1 + τ 1 + τ 2 ) St ]
                         Et [ ptADR                                 L
        (2)        EtR2=
                                           [ξ ptL (1 + τ 1 + τ 2 ) St ]

where ξ Pt L (1 + τ 1 + τ 2 ) is the pesos the investor needs to buy ξ local shares to obtain one ADR,


           + n (1- τ 3 )(1- τ 5 )] is the dollar amount that the Argentine investor expects to obtain after
and Et [ ptADR

selling the ADR in the U.S. at time t+n after taxes and expenses. Argentine investors typically

face a broker’s fee, τ1, and a transactions fee, τ2. A second broker’s fee, τ3, is incurred when the

asset is sold in the United States. We also include a fixed fee in dollars, τ4, that the investor must

pay to transform the regular shares into an ADR. Finally, the cost of opening a bank account in

the United States is τ5. Note that the investor does not have to physically obtain dollars to carry

out this operation (the return is simply expressed in dollar units) so the investor does not pay a

fee for obtaining foreign exchange. Note also that all of the transactions in (2) were permitted

under the Corralito.

          If the Argentine investor were to instead use the dollar amount [ξ ptL (1 + τ 1 + τ 2 ) St ] to

buy local shares and sell them in Buenos Aires in period t+n for the expected (net of taxes) price,

her expected return at time t will be:

                           Etξ ptL+ n (1- τ 1 - τ 2 ) St + n − ξ ptL (1 + τ 1 + τ 2 ) St
        (3)       EtR1=
                                            ξ ptL (1 + τ 1 + τ 2 ) St

Where ξ ptL (1 + τ 1 + τ 2 ) St is the amount, expressed in dollars, the investor needs in order to buy

enough shares of the local stock to reach the equivalent of one ADR, and Etξ ptL+ n (1- τ 1 - τ 2 ) St + n



14
  Here we are assuming the conversion fee is paid in dollars in the U.S. once the operation is complete, and the
amount is withdrawn from the investor’s banking account.

is the amount of money she receives for selling the shares after n periods. The returns are

calculated net of the broker’s fee and the local transactions fee.

          For the investor to be willing to convert shares to ADRs, it must be the case that EtR1 ≤

EtR2 or

                           + n (1- τ 3 )(1- τ 5 )] - τ 4 − Et [ξ pt + n (1- τ 1 - τ 2 ) St + n ] ≥ 0

          (4)

U.S. investor

          We next derive the trade-off facing a U.S. investor. The trade-off is different for the two

investors because of the asymmetries in fees, taxes and institutional regulations in the two

markets. The U.S. investor purchases the ADR in the U.S. and can either

                  I) Sell the ADR in New York at ptADR
                                                   + n or



                  II) Sell the stock in Buenos Aires at ptL+ n .

The first strategy gives the expected return to holding the ADR for n periods:

                                 Et ptADR
                                      + n - pt
                                              ADR

                                       ptADR

converting the ADR to local shares, and repatriating the earnings is given by:

                               Etξ ptL+ n (1- τ 1 - τ 2 )(1 − τ 6 ) St + n −      ptADR
          (6)           EtRII=                                                            .
                                                        ptADR

          When selling the shares in Argentina, we assume that the U.S. investor incurs charges in

using a local broker and must pay the stock market transactions fee. Since we assume that he

would like to return the profits from the sale back to the U.S., he incurs an additional tax ( τ 6 ) for



15
   It is not strictly true that U.S. investors face zero transactions costs. However, our empirical analysis focuses on
the arbitrage conducted by Argentine investors during the Corralito, so we abstract from the relatively small U.S.
transaction costs for simplicity.


                                                                 9
transferring the funds. Note that under the Corralito repatriating the dollars directly is illegal.

Presumably there are other means of circumventing the controls, but by ignoring these

restrictions we are in effect understating the transactions costs faced by U.S. investors.

        A risk-neutral investor will cancel an ADR when Et RI ≥ Et RII or:

       (7)          Etξ ptL+ n (1- τ 1 - τ 2 )(1 − τ 7 ) St + n −   ptADR ≥ 0

This suggests that if local prices (expressed in dollars) exceed the ADR price investors should

buy ADRs, convert them back to local shares and sell them in Argentina.

Arbitrage bounds

         The trade-offs faced by Argentine and U.S. investors yield arbitrage bounds for

capital inflow into and outflow from the Argentine market. Equation (4) can be re-

written to show the bound facing an Argentine investor who is contemplating

converting his local stocks into an ADR:

                     (1 − τ 1 − τ 2 )                  τ4                                  + n − E t ξp t + n S t + n
                                                                                      Et ptADR              L
       (8)                             +                                        − 1 ≥
                   (1 − τ 3 )(1 − τ 5 ) (1 − τ 3 )(1 − τ 5 ) Et ξptL+ n S t + n             Et ξptL+ n S t + n

Capital outflows to the U.S. will not occur if the transaction costs on the left-hand-side of (8)

(which are a function of the local price and the exchange rate) exceed the returns to the

conversion.

        Equation (9) shows the corresponding arbitrage bound for capital inflows into

Argentina. If the transactions costs faced by a U.S. investor are less than the returns of selling

ADRs for local shares then we should observe capital inflows into Argentina.

                                                       Etξ ptL+ n St + n − Et ptADR
       (9)          (1 − τ 1 − τ 2 )(1 − τ 6 ) − 1 ≥                            +n

                                                            Etξ ptL+ n St + n




                                                             10
If the ADR premia/discount lies between the bounds in (8) and (9) neither investor would engage

in arbitrage between the markets. Premia outside of the bounds should, in principle, be arbitraged

away. In the section below we use estimated transactions costs during the Corralito to calculate

the arbitrage bounds.

3. ADR premia during the Corralito

         Table 1 provides a list of ADRs listed in Argentina as of December 1, 2001. The top

part of the table lists the shares that are publicly traded in the United States and Argentina. These

12 companies will be the sample for most of our analysis. The remaining 11 shares are traded

over the counter (Rule 144a and OTC stocks) and as such are not required to meet U.S.

accounting standards.16 In December 2001, the 12 ADRs in Table 1 accounted for 85% percent

of the Merval.

                                           [Table 1 here]

       During the Corralito, ADRs played three roles for Argentine investors. ADRs provided

(1) liquidity value (they allowed asset transformation of bank deposits – which could potentially

be expropriated by the government or lost in a full-scale bank run -- into stocks); (2) capital

control circumvention value (they allowed investors to legally deposit dollars abroad); and (3)

hedge value (against the likely devaluation of the dollar value of the peso). The first effect, asset

transformation, should increase the value of all Argentine stocks during the Corralito, and the

premium associated with asset transformation should remain until all depositors in Argentina

have re-optimized their savings portfolios or the deposit restrictions are removed. The second

effect, capital outflow, should appear as an additional premium in ADR prices over non-ADR

prices in Argentina, and again should last until all Argentine investors are indifferent between




                                                 11
holding their assets at home or abroad. This could be achieved either when all of the available

funds have left the country, or the cost of moving funds becomes prohibitively high. The third

effect, the exchange rate hedge, will be an additional premium associated with ADRs until the

devaluation takes place.

          The difference in the ADR premium post- and pre-devaluation yields the market

forecast of the magnitude of the devaluation. In effect, prior to the devaluation the stock market

served as a shadow exchange market and we exploit this to back out expectations of the

devaluation. After the devaluation there still exists exchange rate risk, but it is now priced in the

foreign exchange market rather than in the stock market.

          Figure 3 shows price indices for equal-weighted portfolios of ADRs17 and all other

Argentine stocks over the July 1, 2001 to May 31, 2002 period. As predicted, both portfolios

reverse their downward trend in the pre-Corralito period, increasing immediately following the

imposition of capital controls. The ADR portfolio experiences a bigger increase than the non-

ADR portfolio, reflecting the second two effects discussed above. The additional premium on

ADR stocks over non-ADR stocks remains until May 2002. We also observe a dramatic change

in the trading volume in ADRs in Argentina. Figure 4 shows the steady decline in the aggregate

trading volume on La Bolsa over the last two and a half years. However, as shown in Figure 5,

the fraction of ADRs in the total volume traded jumps dramatically at the time of the Corralito

from roughly 40 percent of the total volume to over 80 percent. Perez Companc alone accounted

for nearly 50 percent of the total volume of trading in the month of December 2001.



16
   We dropped Nortel from our ADR portfolio even though it is not an OTC stock because it is a preferred stock
with very few transactions over this period.
17
   We use the equal-weighted portfolio to get a better sense of the movement in all share prices and to reduce
idiosyncratic noise. Using the value-weighted portfolio reflects mainly movements in YPF, with a market
capitalization that represents 44% of the ADR portfolio, and Perez Companc, with a market capitalization that
represents another 16% of the ADR portfolio.

           Table 2 examines the changes in prices of the ADR portfolio and individual ADRs

following the imposition of the Corralito, Cavallo’s resignation on December 19, 2001 and the

announcement of the discontinuation of the currency board on January 4, 2002.18 (All prices are

measured in U.S. dollars). In the week following the imposition of the Corralito, the ADR

portfolio jumped 7.6 percent. There is considerable heterogeneity in the price responses of

different ADRs ranging from increases of 23 percent for Siderca and 15.6 percent for Perez

Companc to a decline of 1.6 percent for IRSA. Cavallo’s resignation, which increased the

likelihood of a devaluation, increased the value of ADRs even further. The ADR portfolio

increased an additional 7.5 percent and Metrogas, TECO and Perez Companc increased over 30

percent in value. All dollar share prices fell after the devaluation, reflecting the change in the

exchange rate.

Changes in ADR premia

           Changes in Argentine prices during the Corralito tell only part of the story. We now

turn to the arbitrage premia/discount on Argentine shares relative to the price of ADRs in the

U.S. Figures 6 and 7 show local and U.S. prices in dollars and the ADR discounts for two (Perez

Companc and Siderca) of the 12 companies in our sample of ADRs over the July 1, 2001 to May

31, 2002 period.19 The figures also show the arbitrage bounds based on our estimates of

   The devaluation was announced on January 7th and took place on January 11th (to a new exchange rate of 1.4).
The free float started on February 11th. See appendix 2 for more information regarding exchange rate developments
over this period. Note also that the stock market was closed on several days over this period which may have
impacted the behavior of returns. We simply use observable prices on day when the market was open in our
calculations.

   Similar figures for the rest of the ADRs are available upon request.

transactions costs (see Table 3).20 The bottom half of Table 2 summarizes the average discounts

during pre-Corralito, Corralito pre-devaluation and post-devaluation periods for each company

and the averages across the twelve companies.21

                                             [Figures 6 and 7 here]

                                                  [Table 3 here]

           The information in Table 2 and the plots indicate that the average pre-Corralito

premium for all companies except Metrogas was close to zero, suggesting that arbitrage between

Argentina and the U.S. kept prices in close alignment. During the Corralito, the average ADR

discount (the local price less the ADR price) jumped to 20 percent. The plots suggest that the

ADR discounts were relatively small at the beginning of the Corralito and peaked just prior to

the devaluation. One interpretation of this evidence is that the shadow value of the exchange rate

hedge via ADRs increased as the devaluation became more likely in early January 2002. At their

peak, the discount reached close to 40 cents on the dollar for Banco Frances, Banco Galicia,

Perez Companc and Siderca.22



20
   The transactions costs we use in the calculations (based on conversations with brokers and investment bankers in
Argentina) are: τ1=.3025 τ2=.1025 τ3=.3025 τ4=.2 τ5=1.0. In table 3 we provide transaction cost ranges that reflect
amounts that were charged to both small and large Argentine investors. Our sources indicate that the standard length
of time required for an ADR conversion was nine days. Large investors, such as institutional investors and bankers
faced substantially lower costs than smaller investors, and could also complete the ADR conversion in a shorter
period of time. We ignore the time delay in our calculations of premia/discounts. The difference between the lower
bound and upper bound in our estimations is around 500 basis points. Rabinovitch, Silva and Susmel (2000), using
data for 6 Argentinean stocks with ADRs for the period 1993-2000 estimate arbitrage bands of around 270 basis
points, suggesting both that transactions costs increased during the Corralito and that the transactions fees we use in
our calculations provide maximum arbitrage bands.
21
   Here the adjustment to the law of one price is apparently accomplished in the Argentinean price rather than the
U.S. ADR price. Huang and Stoll (2001), find a similar adjustment in the 1992 UK crisis (where the local price
jumped to adjust to the expected devaluation), but for 1994 Mexico, they find that the adjustment was in the
Mexican ADR price, rather than in the local price.
22
   According to brokers and the financial press, the most demanded ADRs have been (in order of importance): Perez
Companc (PC), Grupo Financiero Galicia, Siderca and Telecom. In December 2001, the number of shares of PC
traded in NYSE increased 170%. The likely reason investors preferred these specific stocks is that they were the
ones with the highest liquidity in the U.S. market. Our preliminary research on the cross sectional differences in the
stocks’ premia (based on panel data) confirm that liquidity seems to be the most important factor in explaining the
differences in premia across firms.


                                                         14
Expected Devaluation

             We use three methods to estimate the market’s expectation of the magnitude of the

devaluation on January 11, 2002.23 The first measure is to look at the price impact of Cavallo’s

resignation on December 19, 2001. It could be argued that up to that point the Corralito was still

viewed as a temporary measure to bolster the peg. The news of the resignation was clearly a

signal that the peg would be abandoned. Column B in Table 2 shows the weekly change in the

local price of ADRs before and after the resignation. On average, prices jumped 16.7 percent,

suggesting a roughly 17 percent increase in the value of the exchange rate hedge.24

             The second measure of the anticipated devaluation is to examine the difference

between the ADR discount in the pre- and post-devaluation periods. Under the assumption that

the shadow value of ADRs as a means of converting bank deposits and for capital outflow over

the period remained constant, the difference between the pre- and post-devaluation periods

isolates the value of the exchange rate hedge. The difference between the average discount in the

two periods is shown in Table 2 column G. The difference ranges considerably across ADRs,

averaging out to roughly 8%. This is likely to be an understatement of the hedge term, however,

because the ADR discount started small and increased dramatically in the pre-devaluation

sample. It is more likely that prices on the eve of the devaluation came closest to reflecting the

market’s expectation of the change in the exchange rate. Using the discounts just before and just

after the devaluation as our measure, column H shows an average devaluation of 40.4 percent

(with a range of between 19 and 76 percent). This is larger than the other two estimates and it is


23
   Becjker, Gelos and Richards (2002) estimate devaluation expectations from the relative performance of a cross
section of Mexican publicly traded firms around the 1994 peso crash. Using an estimate of the exchange rate
exposure of the different firms, they construct a measure of the shadow exchange rate prior to devaluation. In future
research we will further explore the information from our cross-section of ADRs for alternative measures of
expected devaluation.
24
   One could also argue that the resignation was a further sign of political instability, which would also increase the
demand for ADRs as vehicles for capital outflow.


                                                         15
exactly the magnitude of the official devaluation for foreign trade operations, although it is less

than the free market rate devaluation of 70 percent that applied to all other transactions.

               In addition to calculating the expected magnitude of the devaluation, we can use ADR

transactions data to estimate the magnitude of capital outflow. The most accurate measure of the

volume of outflow would be to use the number of ADR conversions that occurred after the

imposition of the Corralito. Unfortunately, these figures are not publicly available. An

alternative measure is to take the post-Corralito cumulated volume of sales of Argentine ADRs

in New York, under the assumption that all ADR sales reflect cashing out by Argentine

investors. This figure comes to $835 million.25 This is likely to be an underestimate of the

volume of outflow, since many investors may simply hold the stock rather than sell at depressed

prices. Another measure is the cumulated volume of purchases of local stocks with associated

ADRs in Buenos Aires over this period. Under the assumption that all these purchases are

intended for ADR conversion, the value of capital outflow comes to $3.4 billion dollars. This is

likely an overestimate, since Argentines may have had other reasons for purchasing these stocks

besides ADR convertibility.

4. Market Factors and the Pricing of ADRs

               Until this point, we have analyzed the time series of ADR and local prices in

isolation. We now turn to the pricing of ADR stocks in the context of overall market movements

in Argentina and New York.

               In theory, in a fully liberalized and integrated financial environment, we would expect

ADRs to be priced based on global market factors. Investors with access to global assets should

expect returns to be based on covariances of individual stocks and the global market portfolio.


25
     This is the cumulated sum between December 1, 2001 and May 31, 2002.


                                                       16
That said, in practice, Karolyi and Stulz (2002) find that home bias tends to increase local

influences on asset prices. They find that local market portfolios often better explain the cross-

sectional variation in expected returns for local stocks, though they also find that equity flows

and cross-country correlations increase global influences on asset prices. 26 The pricing of

Argentine ADRs provides an interesting natural experiment in the context of this literature. Prior

to the imposition of the Corralito, Argentina’s financial markets were considered fully

liberalized. The Corralito, although allowing ADR transactions to continue, was intended to

control capital outflows and therefore presumably led to a less globally integrated Argentine

capital market. In terms of the market model, we should therefore expect that local market

factors in Argentina became more important in pricing stocks with associated ADRs during the

period in which capital controls were in force.

             We test whether the imposition of the Corralito led to changes in the pricing of

Argentine stocks with associated ADRs using a standard market model; where Rit is the return

                                                                           G
on asset i at time t, R ft is the return on the risk-free rate at time t, Rmt is the return on the global

market portfolio at time t, and RmtL is the return on the local market portfolio at time t:

         (10)         Rit − R ft = β1 ( Rmt
                                         G
                                            − R ft ) + β 2 ( RmtL − R ft ) + ε it .

Evidence of market segmentation would be indicated by a significant coefficient on the local

market index, β2. Table 4 presents daily time series results27 from regressions of returns from the

26
   Also see Errunza and Losq (1985), Eun and Janakiramanan (1986) and Alexander et al (1987) who examine the
pricing of ADR portfolios in the context of the market model and generally find evidence that global market factors
dominate local factors in explaining ADR returns.
27
   Daily returns correspond to close-to-close prices including dividends and excluding weekends and holidays. A
potential problem with daily market model regressions is the occurrence of non-overlapping trading hours across
markets due to different time zones, trading schedules and country-specific holidays. In our study, the extent of non-
synchronous trading across national stock markets is compounded by the fact that the Argentine stock market was
closed for several days during the height of the crisis. We include dummy variables in the regressions to control for
the possibility of abnormal returns after these market closures and in future drafts of the paper we will include the
Scholes and Williams (1977) non-synchronous trading correction.


                                                              17
portfolio of Argentine stocks that have associated ADRs on the Morgan Stanley Capital

International (MSCI) world index and an orthogonalized local Argentine equal-weighted

portfolio index (excluding the stocks with associated ADRs).28 Regression results are presented

both for the period prior to the imposition of the Corralito (specifically October 1997 through

November 2001)29 and for the post-Corralito period (over rolling subperiods to take into account

potential parameter instability).30

                                                   [Table 4 here]

          The results in table 4 suggest that both Argentine market factors and global market

factors were important in pricing Argentine stocks with associated ADRs even before the

imposition of the Corralito. In the period when the Corralito was in place, both indices continue

to be statistically significant, though the beta on the Argentine market index is typically larger in

magnitude. The beta on the Argentine market index rises almost twofold (to 1.5) in the two

months immediately following the imposition of the Corralito, indicating that stocks with

associated ADRs magnified Argentine market movements in this period. These results confirm

our initial hypothesis that local market factors in Argentina became more important in pricing




28
  The correlation between the MSCI and the non-ADR Argentine portfolio is quite high (.53 for the period October
1997 – July 2002). We therefore orthogonalize the non-ADR Argentine portfolio by regressing it on the MSCI and
                                                       L
use the residuals from this first stage regression for Rmt in the estimation of equation 10.
29
   In the pre-Corralito subperiod regressions seven dummy variables are also included as independent variables in
the market model as controls for days on which we might expect abnormal returns due to non-market factors. The
first dummy variable indicates dates when the Argentine market was closed due to holidays, the second indicates
days when the Argentine market was closed for other reasons (days on which the New York market was closed are
omitted). And, the other five dummy variables were included to indicate the day on which a new ADR was included
in the ADR portfolio (Banco Galicia entered on 7/4/2000, APSA on 11/15/2000, PC on 1/26/2000, Nortel on
6/19/1997 and Siderca on 5/21/2001) as we might expect the return on the overall ADR portfolio to rise on these
days in reaction to its new composition. These estimates are not reported in the tables but are available upon request.
30
   In the post-Corralito subperiods we also include the change in the peso/dollar exchange rate as a third factor in
the market model to control for the large devaluation that took place on January 11, 2002. The coefficient on the
exchange rate term is generally statistically significant and ranges in magnitude from .1 to .5 depending on the
subperiod. This coefficient can also be interpreted as an estimate of the peso exposure of the ADR portfolio.

stocks with associated ADRs (and presumably all Argentine stocks) during the period in which

capital controls were in force.

        The model in section 2 and the data description in section 3 of this paper suggest that the

pricing of ADR stocks in Argentina and New York may have diverged during the Corralito

period. And, in particular, we might expect that while local factors influenced prices in

Argentina (as reported in table 4), they may not have been as important for prices of the same

stocks sold in New York (given that investors in New York were not subject to the restrictions of

the Corralito). Table 5 presents time series results from regressions of Argentine ADR portfolio

returns in New York (NYSE and Nasdaq) on the MSCI world index and an orthogonalized local

Argentine equal-weighted portfolio (excluding the ADRs).

                                           [Table 5 here]

       The results for the pricing of ADR stocks in the post-Corralito subperiod reported in

table 5 differ markedly from those in table 4. Recall that the dependent variable for the

regressions reported in table 4 is the return in Argentina of a portfolio of stocks with associated

ADRs, while in table 5 we examine the pricing of these same stocks after they are converted to

ADRs and traded in New York. In both sets of tests the results in the pre-Corralito period are

similar. The results suggest that although the Argentine market was relatively more integrated

before the imposition of the Corralito – it is still the case that local (Argentine) market factors as

well as global factors were important in explaining ADR portfolio returns in both Argentina and

New York. In the period immediately following the imposition of the Corralito (and when

volume in the ADR market was at its peak) neither the global market index nor the Argentine

market index explain ADR portfolio returns in New York (whereas in Argentina local market

factors become more important in explaining the pricing of stocks with associated ADRs over




                                                 19
this period). In the subsequent two-month rolling subsamples the global market index beta

regains statistical significance and rises in magnitude for the ADR portfolio returns in New

York. The coefficient on the local market index also regains statistical significance, though the

size of the local market beta falls dramatically from .88 in the pre-Corralito subperiod to .08 in

the subperiod including January through March 2002. 31 These results suggest that after the

imposition of the Corralito Argentine market factors no longer had as much influence on the

pricing of Argentine ADRs in New York. Or, put another way, ADRs in New York became less

like other Argentine stocks (including those with associated ADRs) with the advent of capital

controls.

5. The Emergence of the CEDEAR market

            In late February 2002 volume in the ADR market, which had reached its peak in

December 2001 just after the imposition of the Corralito, leveled off.32 Although the Corralito

continued to be in effect, several regulatory changes, starting in February 2002, may have

diminished investor’s incentives to use the stock market as a means to gain access to frozen

assets.33 At the same time as interest in ADRs was stalling, volume in the CEDEAR

(certificados de depositos Argentinos) market began to rise dramatically, so much so that by May

2002 volume in CEDEARs exceeded volume in all other listed stocks on La Bolsa.




31
   The regression goodness of fit also falls dramatically from .55 in the pre-Corralito period to .17 for the period
January through March 2002.
32
   This is particularly true in New York where ADR volume declines steadily from its peak in December 2001.
Volume in February 2002 was 18 percent lower than the previous December, and by May 2002, volume was a mere
23% of what it had been in December 2001.
33
   In February investors were allowed to withdraw (once and for all) 7,000 U.S. dollars from any of their bank
accounts. In March investors were given the option to convert deposits into bonds (in pesos or dollars) and they
were allowed to use their deposits to purchase properties, and more recently, cars.

              CEDEARs are shares of non-Argentine firms (mostly U.S. firms) that are cross-

listed on the Argentine exchange and sold for pesos.34 They were first introduced on the

Argentine stock exchange in 1997, though volume in the market was negligible until late

February 2002.35 Before the imposition of the Corralito it is not clear why an investor would

have preferred holding a CEDEAR (in pesos) to holding the foreign stocks directly (and in

dollars), especially given that they had to pay high conversion fees for the CEDEARs. However,

after the imposition of the Corralito investors were no longer able to use dollars to purchase non-

Argentine stocks. Indeed, one of the few ways investors were able to gain access to their frozen

bank deposits was to purchase shares on La Bolsa. For this reason we might have expected

Argentine demand for CEDEARs to have increased during the Corralito and especially after the

devaluation, both because underlying CEDEAR assets are denominated in dollars (although

CEDEARs are priced in pesos), and because holding shares of non-Argentine firms would serve

as a better means of hedging against the looming economic crisis. Volume in the CEDEAR

market, however, did not immediately pick up in large part because there was little incentive for

anyone to convert U.S. stocks into peso denominated CEDEARs before the devaluation.36

           Starting in late February 2002, however, liquidity in CEDEAR stocks gradually

increased. Discussions with brokers in Argentina suggest that the increase in CEDEAR

liquidity came from three sources. First, mutual funds, pension funds and other institutional

investors are required to hold assets rated above BBB, and at this time all Argentine stocks and

bonds were below the minimum ranking, forcing these funds to purchase non-Argentine


34
    Most CEDEARs are issued by Deustche Bank, which acts as the depositary bank, and is the only authorized
institution that can transform CEDEARs back into shares sold on U.S. exchanges. The most traded CEDEARs in
this period included Cisco Systems, Honeywell, International Paper, JP Morgan Chase and Wal-Mart stores.
35
    In December 2001 the volume of CEDEARs was approximately 0.2% of the total volume traded (stocks plus
CEDEARs) on La Bolsa, whereas in June 2002 CEDEARs made up 70% of total volume traded.
36
   Traders had little incentive to convert U.S. stocks into CEDEARs prior to the devaluation both because of peso
value uncertainty and because the Corralito restricted repatriation of any peso returns.


                                                       21
securities. Since the Corralito disallowed direct purchases of foreign assets CEDEARs were

among the few assets that they could acquire. Second, Argentines who held dollars abroad

(possibly as a result of an earlier sale of ADRs) started to purchase U.S. stocks with CEDEAR

conversions, and re-sell the CEDEARs in Argentina for pesos, as a means to bring monies back

into Argentina (and at the same time gaining the CEDEAR premium). 37 Third, using operations

called “via cable” investors were able to buy foreign bank checks that allowed them to purchase

the underlying U.S. shares, convert these into CEDEARs, and then sell the CEDEARs (at a

premium) in Argentina for pesos.38

            Once liquidity in the CEDEAR market was established, investors had an alternative

means of escaping the Corralito, by purchasing CEDEARs in Argentina for pesos, converting

them back to the underlying dollar denominated stocks, and selling them in New York for dollars

(that then are deposited in dollar accounts).39 The transaction costs of CEDEAR conversion are

similar to those in the ADR market, and the increased demand for CEDEARs in Argentina led to

similar price spreads on CEDEARs in Argentina relative to the underlying prices of the stocks in

New York. Before the Corralito, the mean CEDEAR premium was approximately zero, but in

March 2002 the premium increased to 5 percent.40

            There is clear indication that the Argentine government understood that CEDEARs

were serving a similar purpose as ADRs in allowing investors to transfer funds (legally) outside


37
   One reason to do this was that after “the pesofication” investors could repay dollar debts with pesos.
38
   Another way that CEDEARs may have been created is through a practice termed “pre-releasing” where the
Depositary Bank lends out the underlying securities that make up the CEDEAR to brokers in the market. The
brokers then sell the CEDEARs to investors who pay in pesos and then request that the broker convert the
CEDEARs back into the underlying U.S. shares (and sell them in New York for dollars).
39
   Investors also purchased (in pesos) dollar denominated Argentine government bonds (specifically Global 2008s)
and re-sold them in New York (for dollars) for similar reasons.
40
   Since liquidity for most of the CEDEARs in Buenos Aires is low and the transactions occur at irregular and
infrequent intervals, we calculate the premium for each of the CEDEARs on the days when there is a closing price in
both markets. The index is then the average of the daily premia. This is obviously a rough measure of the CEDEAR
premia, and we leave a complete analysis of this market to future analysis.

of Argentina. On March 25, 2002 a report in the official BCRA press communication suggests

that the government considered adopting new measures to avoid capital outflows using ADR and

CEDEAR transactions. However, no restrictions were imposed at that time. In September 2002,

regulations were changed that increased the cost of conversions.41 Despite the increased costs,

ADR and CEDEAR market conversions continue to take place.

6. Conclusions

           Argentina in late 2001 and early 2002 provides an unusual opportunity to analyze the

reactions of investors to capital controls. The Corralito, originally put in place to stave off a

devaluation of the peso, effectively served to provide incentives for Argentines to invest in the

Argentine stock market, helping to fuel a boom in La Bolsa even as the Argentine economy was

headed toward collapse. The Corralito also provided a new role for ADRs as a (legal)

mechanism for capital flight. Investors were able to purchase Argentine stocks with associated

ADRs for pesos in Argentina, convert them into ADRs, re-sell them in New York for dollars and

deposit the dollar proceeds in U.S. bank accounts.

           In the paper we show that ADR discounts went as high as 60% in the pre-devaluation

period, indicating that Argentine investors were willing to pay significant amounts in order to

move their funds abroad and to hedge the dollar value of their assets. In effect, the stock market

served as a shadow exchange market, which allows us to back out the market’s implicit forecast




41
   The central bank passed a very restrictive regulation (circular #3723) that mandated that every stock be traded in
its original currency. Since access to dollars and the use of dollars was greatly restricted already, this effectively
killed the CEDEAR market. After intense opposition from the financial community, the central bank rescinded
#3723 and instead passed a resolution (circular #3727) that forbids “contra cable” operations. These operations
allowed brokers to sell stocks purchased in Buenos Aires instantaneously in New York (or any foreign market) using
the Mercado de Valores as a clearinghouse. Under #3727 it is still possible for investors in Argentina to convert
CEDEARs and sell them in New York, but this new restriction significantly increases the transactions costs to do so.
CEDEAR trading volume has fallen more than 35% since “contra cable” operations were disallowed.

of the size of the devaluation. On the eve of the devaluation, we estimate that the market

(correctly) anticipated a 40% devaluation.

         We also test whether the imposition of the Corralito led to changes in the underlying

pricing structure of ADR stocks in Argentina and New York. The Corralito, although allowing

ADR transactions to continue, was intended to control capital outflows and therefore should have

led to a less globally integrated Argentine capital market. We find strong evidence of an

increase in Argentine market segmentation after the imposition of the Corralito. We find that

local market factors in Argentina became more important in pricing peso denominated stocks

with associated ADRs, though we find that the same ADRs in New York are mainly priced based

on global factors.

         Argentine investors continue to use financial markets, and increasingly the CEDEAR

market, to gain access to their frozen bank deposits and to place their assets abroad in dollar

accounts. We estimate that capital outflow using the ADR market over the December 2001 to

May 2002 amounted to $835 million to $3.4 billion. If we include capital outflows via

CEDEARs and other cross-listed securities, it is likely that the amount of capital that has

(legally) left Argentina since the imposition of the Corralito is many times higher.

                    Argentina’s Financial Market Event Time Line

                    Minister Cavallo starts negotiations with the IMF and the U.S.
 October 28, 2001   Treasury to purchase collateral for new bonds to be issued in an
                    exchange for the nearly $100 billion of local and external debt.
                    Mr. Cavallo defines the debt exchange operation as voluntary.
                    The old debt would exchange for bonds paying seven percent
 October 29, 2001   per year and be guaranteed by tax revenues. The IMF and U.S.
                    Treasury ask for compliance with a zero deficit and an
                    agreement with the provinces on tax revenue sharing before
                    any kind of financial support is given.
                    The IMF announces it will not make any new disbursements
November 19, 2001   (around 1.3 billion dollars) without being satisfied that the
                    country has secured the goals previously designated.
                    End of a debt swap with local banks and pension funds for
November 30, 2001   more that 55 billion (over a total public debt of 160 billions).
                    The government announces cash withdrawal limits (Corralito)
                    and limits dollar transfers abroad as a last-ditch effort to fend
                    off a devaluation and prevent a major banking crisis.
                    Withdrawals are limited to 250 pesos (dollars) per week per
December 2, 2001    account. Depositors, however, may still access their funds for
                    larger purchases through checks or debit cards and transfer
                    their money among banks. No limits are placed on domestic
                    payments through the use of checks, credits, debit cards and
                    electronic MEP (Metodo Electronico de Pagos) payments.
                    Initially the government stated that the Corralito would last 3
                    months.
                    The measures announced on Dec 2nd come into full effect
                    through Decree 1570-01 on Dec 3rd. They can be summarized
                    as follows:
                    a) Wire transfers are not allowed without prior Central Bank
                    approval.
                    b) Cash withdrawals from the Banking System will be limited
                    to US$ 1000 per month.
                    c) Financial Argentine institutions may not participate in
                    foreign currency futures transactions.
                    d) Financial Argentine institutions are prohibited from issuing
December 3, 2001    new bank loans denominated in Argentine Pesos. All new loans
                    must be issued in U.S. dollars and existing peso loans must be
                    converted to U.S. dollar loans at a one to one rate.
                    e) Foreign investors trading in the Argentine Securities Market
                    are subject to the repatriation restriction. Funds related to
                    securities transactions must remain in the country until
                    government approval is obtained or the measure is officially
                    revoked.

                    The Merval Index (Buenos Aires Stock Exchange) increases
December 4, 2001    6%. According to the local press, there was incipient trading in
                    ADRs.
                    Following Decree 1570, the Central Bank established an
                    information procedure for the processing of automatic and non-
                    automatic authorizations of repatriation. According to this rule,
December 7, 2001    coupon payments on National Government Bonds have
                    automatic transfer authorization and all other types of payments
                    and repatriations of U.S. dollars are subject to Central Bank
                    approval.
December 19, 2001   Mr. Cavallo and all other ministers resign.
                    President Dela Rua resigns and Mr. Ramon Puerta becomes
December 20, 2001   interim president. Country Risk reaches 4618 points. Global
                    (sovereign) bond yields reach their historical maximum of 49%
                    annual return in dollars.
                    The official Foreign Exchange Rate market is closed until the
December 21, 2001   10th of January, 2002.
                    Mr. Rodriguez Saa, governor of one of the provinces, becomes
December 23, 2001   the new interim president for 60 days, until elections are called
                    in March, 2002. He declares the suspension of external debt
                    payments for at least 60 days, totaling $166bn in federal and
                    provincial debt.
                    The government announces that a new fiat currency (i.e.,
December 24, 2001   without foreign-currency backing) would be created (the
                    argentino).
                    Interim president Mr. Rodriguez Saa resigns and the legislative
December 30, 2001   assembly elects Mr. Eduardo Duhalde as new president.
                    In the midst of political instability and closed foreign exchange
December 31, 2001   markets, the peso trades on the black market at 1.35 pesos per
                    dollar.
 January 2, 2002    Mr. Duhalde assumes power.
                    The new Minister of Finance, Mr. Lenicov, announces the
 January 7, 2002    devaluation of the peso and a new dual foreign exchange rate
                    regime, to be implemented on the 9th of January, 2002.




                                           37
                   After several delays, the exchange rate market re-opens and the
                   new dual exchange rate system is put in place, under the
                   “Public Emergency and Exchange Regulations” approved by
                   Congress. The main articles and measures are the following:
                   a) 1 Argentinean peso= 1 U.S. dollar parity (Convertibility
                   Plan) is abolished. For emergency reasons, the Executive
January 11, 2002   Power- President- has been authorized to determine both the
                   new official rate of exchange between the Argentinean peso
                   and foreign currency and exchange rate regulations.
                   b) All debts (capital and interests) agreed in ARG currency
                   with financial entities - converted into U.S. dollars according to
                   the Decree 1570/2001- will be reconverted into the original
                   currency agreed (pesos).
                   c) The official, fixed conversion rate - 1 U.S Dollar=1.4 pesos
                   will be relevant for foreign trade operations. The free or
                   floating rate will be used for all other transactions and freely
                   determined by the market.
                   The peso was quoted at 1.8 per dollar at money-changers in
                   Buenos Aires. The peso's decline was limited by the
                   government's decision to reduce the amount of money in
                   circulation through a freeze on deposits, withdrawal restrictions
                   and a central bank order blocking banks from selling the U.S.
                   currency via electronic transactions.

                   The government announces the easing of bank withdrawal
                   restrictions:
                   a) Up to 7,000 pesos can be withdrawn from term deposits in
January 21, 2002   pesos (transferring that money to a checking account)
                   b) Up to 5,000 dollars can be withdrawn from term deposits in
                   dollars (transferring that money to a checking account at the
                   official exchange rate, 1.40).
                   c) Up to 5,000 dollars in a saving account can be pesofied at
                   the official exchange rate.
                   Mr. Lenicov announces an asymmetric pesofication and the end
                   of the dual exchange rate regime. The fundamental economic
                   measures were the following:
                   a) pesofication of all dollar deposits at 1.4 pesos per dollar.
February 3, 2002   b) corporate and consumer debts are also pesofied, but at the
                   exchange rate prevailing during the Convertibility period. Both
                   deposits and credit will be indexed to inflation.
                   c) the end of the dual exchange rate regime and a unified
                   floating exchange rate determined by market forces.
                   d) the right to withdraw wage and pension income from the
                   corralito without any amount restrictions (before workers could
                   only extract up to 1.500 pesos).




                                          38
                       The official foreign exchange market is closed again until the
  February 4, 2002     11th of February.
                       While the foreign exchange market is closed and before
                       devaluation uncertainty is resolved, the stock market index
                       increases. The pesification of all debts announced in Argentina
                       drives up share prices of firms heavily indebted in pesos and
                       banks.
                       The mix of announced policy measures not yet implemented,
                       (including the pesification of all debts and the prospects of a
  February 8, 2002     large devaluation once the market re-opened) and the non-
                       operation of the exchange rate market, induce some investors to
                       reverse the capital-outflow process, converting ADRs back into
                       underlying shares and selling them in the Argentinean market.
                       The implicit dollar rate obtained through this operation was
                       2.56 pesos (above the 2.35 pesos in the black market) and
                       allowed the repayment of pesofied corporate debt.
                       The BCRA establishes a new unified free foreign exchange
                       market, which replaces the two markets - official and free -
 February 11, 2002     implemented in January. The exchange rate market re-opens
                       and the floating dollar exchange rate reaches 2.1 pesos, well
                       below the devaluation expectations built-into asset prices.
                       The stock market drops an accumulated 18% in the two
 February 12, 2002     business days following the launching of the new exchange rate
                       regime.
                       The Central Bank announces new measures related to foreign
                       exchange transactions and ADR/CEDEAR conversions.
                       According to the press release, these were aimed at improving
                       the functioning of the foreign currency market and regulating
                       the buying and selling of foreign currency by order and for the
                       account of the Central Bank.
                       The press communication also mentions that there will be
   March 26, 2002      coordination between the Comision Nacional de Valores
                       (CNV) - the equivalent to the SEC in the U.S. - and the Bolsa
                       de Comercio de Buenos Aires (BCBA) - the Buenos Aires
                       Stock Exchange - in order to adopt new measures to regulate
                       capital outflows via ADR and CEDEAR transactions.
                       However, neither the CNV nor the BCBA have yet issued any
                       official communication regulating these transactions.

The Argentine foreign exchange rate market was closed (feriado cambiario) from the 21st of
December until the 10th of January (inclusive). During this period the shadow (or parallel)
market exchange rate quoted at around 1.5-1.6 pesos per dollar, well above the official parity of
1 peso per dollar prevailing before markets were closed.

On January 4th the Minister of Finance announced the discontinuation of the currency board and
on January 7th, the Minister of Finance announced the devaluation of the peso and a new
exchange rate regime. The new exchange rate regime was a dual one, featuring an official, fixed
non-convertible rate of 1.4 pesos per dollar (relevant for exporters and financial institutions) and
a free or floating dollar, for all other operations and determined by supply and demand. This new
dual regime came into full effect on Friday the 11th of January when the markets were re-opened.

On January the 11th there were two different values for the free exchange rate: dollars purchased
with cash at 1.7-1.8 “free pesos” per dollar, and a higher exchange rate for dollars purchased
with checks from funds in the Corralito (1.9-2 “trapped pesos” per dollar).

Exchange rate market operations were again suspended from the 4th of February to the 8thth of
February, inclusive. On Sunday, February 3rd, the new Minister of Finance announced the end of
the dual exchange rate regime and a unified floating exchange rate was put in place on Monday,
February 11th. On the 11th, the floating exchange rate opened at 2.10 pesos per dollar.
