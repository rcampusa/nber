Valuation of the Risk of SARS in Taiwan

                                          ABSTRACT

Two surveys conducted in Taiwan during the spring 2003 SARS epidemic reveal a high degree of
concern about the threat posed by SARS to Taiwan and to residents, although respondents believe
they are knowledgeable about the risk of SARS and that it is susceptible to individual control. WTP
to reduce the risk of infection and death from SARS is elicited using contingent valuation methods.
Estimated WTP is high, implying values per statistical life of US$3 to 12 million. While consistent
with estimates for high-income countries, these values are substantially larger than previous
estimates for Taiwan and may be attributable to the high degree of concern about SARS at the time
the data were collected.

1. Introduction

       Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an infection that was first reported in

Spring 2003. It is believed to have originated in mainland China and significant outbreaks

occurred in several parts of Southeast Asia and in Toronto, Canada. By summer, the outbreaks

were largely contained through quarantines and other measures. By 11 July, nearly 8,500

probable cases had been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO), of which 813 proved

fatal. The largest outbreaks were in mainland China (5,327 probable cases, 348 deaths), Hong

Kong (1,755 cases, 298 deaths), Taiwan (671 cases, 84 deaths), Canada (250 cases, 38 deaths),

and Singapore (206 cases, 32 deaths) (WHO, 2003a).

       SARS is an atypical pneumonia apparently caused by a newly identified strain of

coronavirus. Most cases have developed in previously healthy adults with only a few suspected

cases in children. The incubation period is typically 2 to 7 days. Symptoms generally begin with

a high fever, sometimes accompanied by chills, headache, and diffuse muscular pain. After 3 to 7

days, SARS progresses to a lower respiratory phase including a dry cough. Mechanical

ventilation is required in 10 to 20 percent of cases. Although steroids and a variety of antiviral

and antibiotic agents have been administered, there is no recognized and effective treatment. The

fatality rate among probable and suspected cases is approximately 3 percent (WHO, 2003b).

       In Taiwan, most of the early cases were imported from China and Hong Kong, or were

family members, friends or medical workers in close contact with these patients. On 22 April, an

outbreak occurred at the Taipei Municipal Hoping Hospital after which the situation deteriorated

rapidly. Two days later, the Taipei City government established a SARS Emergency Response

Task Force and closed the hospital. The task force ordered all of the 930 staff members and 240

patients to stay in the hospital to prevent the further spread of the SARS virus. At its peak,

Taiwan reported 60 SARS cases in a single day. The situation was brought under control in late
                                                                                                   2


of May and the WHO announced it would remove Taiwan from the list of areas with local

transmission of SARS on 5 July.1 The epidemic was heavily concentrated in Taipei city and

Taipei county, with 518 of a total of 665 probable cases located in the northern part of Taiwan

(Taiwan Department of Health, 2003).

       During this period, we conducted two surveys to assess Taiwan residents’ perceptions and

economic valuation of the risk of contracting SARS. In Section 2, we describe the surveys and

data collected. Section 3 summarizes risk perceptions and willingness to pay for a vaccine to

prevent SARS. Section 4 concludes.

2. Data Collection and Sample Statistics

       This study incorporates data from two surveys. Both surveys elicited information on

respondents’ perceptions of the SARS risk, precautions taken to reduce the risk, and willingness

to pay for a hypothetical SARS vaccine. Socio-demographic characteristics were also collected.

       The larger survey (the “Taiwan sample”) was conducted between 6 and 12 May using

random-digit-dial computer-assisted telephone interviewing. The sample was restricted to

individuals aged 20 to 65 years residing in Taiwan. The survey was conducted during the peak of

the epidemic and only included questions about SARS. In total, 1,028 interviews were completed.

The response rate among individuals contacted was 77 percent (1,028 completed interviews out

of 1,334 individuals contacted).

       The smaller survey (the “Taipei sample”) was conducted between 19 April and 25 May

2003. The survey period almost exactly corresponds to the period during which new cases were

frequent. The survey was a more general health and food-safety survey of women in Taipei city

  The number of new probable cases ranged from zero to three per day before mid April, from
10 to 25 per day between mid April and mid May, then fall rapidly to zero by mid June (Taiwan

and county that also included questions about SARS. Initial interviews were conducted in-person,

at the respondent’s home, but as the SARS outbreak worsened this mode proved infeasible and

so on 28 April a mixed-mode mail/telephone approach was substituted. In this mode,

questionnaires were mailed to respondents who completed a follow-up telephone interview one

to two weeks later. In total, 488 interviews were completed. Response rates among contacted

individuals for the two survey modes were similar, 86 percent (= 198/230) for the in-person

interviews and 82 percent (= 290/350) for the mail/telephone mode.

       Summary statistics and definitions of the variables are reported in Table 1. In the Taiwan

sample, the respondents’ mean age is 40 years, with two-thirds of respondents between 30 and 50

years old. Three-quarters of the respondents are married and 56 percent are male. About 20

percent have a university education (average schooling is 12.4 years) and 16 percent reside in

Taipei city and county. The average number of household members is four. The average monthly

income level is NT$39,082 (about US$13,400 per year).2 Almost three-quarters of the

respondents express some kind of religious belief. Only six percent of the respondents indicated

that they would visit China or Hong Kong in the following year. On a standard five point scale,

mean health status is 4 (very good). Nearly half of the respondents indicated that they had worn

masks when they went outside their homes in the previous week.

       In the Taipei sample, all of the respondents are women, by design. Compared with the

Taiwan sample, they are older (mean age of 50 years), more likely to be married (90 percent),

have a year and a half less schooling (10.7 years) and have substantially greater household

income (NT$62,166 per month, about US$21,300 per year). The Taipei respondents rate their

health as somewhat lower on average, with a mean of 3.3. A larger fraction (two-thirds) report

wearing a mask to protect against SARS. In contrast, only five percent of respondents had taken

a flu vaccine shot in the previous six months.

       Several decades of psychometric research have shown that public conceptions of risk are

complex and influenced by qualitative features of hazards. Studies summarized by Slovic (1987)

identify three clusters of attributes that describe how people perceive various technological

hazards and risky activities. These factors may also influence WTP to reduce risk (McDaniels et

al., 1992; Savage, 1993). One cluster of attributes concerns the extent to which a given risk is a

source of “dread.” In general, dreaded risks are perceived as uncontrollable, fatal, and having

catastrophic potential. A second cluster involves attributes that are perceived as “unknown,”

including risks that are new, unobservable, unfamiliar and have delayed consequences. A third

cluster of attributes concerns an individual’s level of exposure to the risk, and encompasses both

personal and societal levels of exposure.

       To characterize respondents’ risk perceptions, we included three questions related to these

attribute clusters. Each of these questions uses a five point scale. The variable Fatal describes the

respondent’s belief about the risk of fatality if one contracts SARS. Knowledge describes the

respondents’ perceived knowledge about the mechanisms by which SARS is transmitted between

people, and Control describes the extent to which the risk of infection can be modified by the

individual.

       Additional risk-perception questions were designed to characterize respondents’ beliefs

about the threat presented by the SARS epidemic to Taiwan and to themselves. Severity

summarizes how serious the respondent believes the effect of the epidemic will be on Taiwan

and Economy describes how important an effect the respondent believes the epidemic will have

on the Taiwanese economy. Perceived risk to the respondent is summarized by three variables:
                                                                                                   5


Concern (the respondent’s overall degree of concern about SARS), Danger (the effect of SARS

on the respondent’s own life), and Income Risk (the effect of SARS on the respondent’s income

this year). Danger and Income Risk are structured as 10 point scales.

       An additional measure of individual concern about SARS is the economic value of

reducing the risk of contracting the illness. Willingness to pay (WTP) to reduce the risk of

developing SARS was elicited using conventional contingent valuation (CV) methods.

Respondents were asked if they would be willing to purchase a vaccine (if it existed) that would

eliminate the chance of becoming infected with SARS. To test for sensitivity of elicited WTP to

the scope or magnitude of the benefit (Hammitt and Graham, 1999), the baseline risk of SARS,

the conditional mortality risk, and the duration of protection were randomly varied among

respondents. The risk of infection with SARS was described as either 3 per 100,000 or 5 per

100,000 per month in Taiwan, the mortality risk conditional on developing SARS as either 10

percent or 5 percent,3 and the period over which the vaccine would protect the individual as

either 12 months or 6 months (in the Taiwan sample) or as either 6 months or 3 months (in the

Taipei sample).

       WTP was elicited using double-bounded binary-choice questions (Hanemann et al., 1991).

Binary-choice questions are easier for respondents than open-ended alternatives, and less likely

to induce a bargaining response. Respondents were first asked if they would or would not

purchase the vaccine if it cost a specified amount. Respondents who indicated they would

purchase the vaccine were asked if they would still purchase it if the price were a new amount,



3
  The stated risk of infection is consistent with the actual experience. Nearly all of the
approximately 670 probable cases in Taiwan occurred within a month. Dividing by the
population of about 22 million yields a probability of about 3 per 100,000. The average fatality
rate in Taiwan was somewhat larger than stated, 84 deaths of 670 cases or about 13 percent.
                                                                                                        6


higher than the initial price, and respondents who indicated they would not purchase the vaccine

were asked if they would purchase it at a lower stated price.

3. Results

3.1 Perceived Risk

         Frequency distributions for the three risk-characteristic variables are reported in Table 2,

and the means and standard deviations for these variables are in Table 1. SARS risk is widely

perceived as fatal, with 76 percent of the Taiwan sample and 86 percent of the Taipei sample

rating it 4 or 5 on a five point scale. Respondents believe they are well informed, however. About

80 percent of respondents in both samples rate their knowledge about transmission mechanisms

as 4 or 5. Finally, SARS is perceived as moderately controllable. The fractions judging its

controllability as 4 or 5 are 46 percent in the Taiwan sample and 58 percent in the Taipei sample.

This pattern of results suggests that SARS is not likely to be among the most feared risks, since

risks that are perceived to be unknown and uncontrollable tend to elicit greater fear (Slovic,

1987).

         Questions about the threat of SARS to Taiwan and to the respondents also reveal a high

degree of concern. The average rating of the Severity of the effect of SARS on Taiwan is 4.1 in

the Taiwan sample and 3.8 in the Taipei sample, and the average rating for its effect on the

Economy is 4.5 in the Taiwan sample (this question was not asked in the Taipei sample).

Respondents’ perceptions of the threat to their own lives appear to reflect slightly less concern,

potentially reflecting optimism bias (Weinstein, 1989) or denial. The average rating of Concern

is 3.6 (Taipei sample). In the Taiwan sample, the average value of Danger (reflecting the effect

of the SARS epidemic on the individual’s life) is 6.3 (on a 10 point scale), slightly greater than

the average value of Income risk (reflecting concern about the effect of SARS on the individual’s
                                                                                                    7


income this year), 5.1 on a 10 point scale.

3.2 Willingness to Pay to Reduce Risk

       The fractions of respondents who indicated they would purchase a vaccine declined

significantly with the stated price. In the Taiwan sample, the initial bids and fractions of

respondents indicating they would purchase the vaccine in the initial question are NT$500, 89

percent, NT$1,500, 84 percent; and NT$4,000, 67 percent, respectively. In the Taipei sample, the

corresponding values are NT$500, 83 percent, NT$1,000, 66 percent; and NT$5,000, 44 percent,

respectively.

       WTP is estimated using linear regression equations, in which the logarithm of WTP is

assumed to be normally distributed with a mean that is a linear function of risk and individual

characteristics. Because WTP is elicited using the double-bounded binary-choice format,

individual WTP is censored by the prices stated in the initial and follow-up questions, and by

zero (for people who indicate they would not purchase the vaccine in both initial and follow-up

questions). Following conventional practice, the regression models are estimated using

maximum-likelihood methods (Alberini, 1995).

       Three regression models are estimated for each sample. The simplest models include only

the dummy variables characterizing the magnitude of risk reduction (columns (1) and (4) in

Table 3). The second set adds individual characteristics (columns (2) and (5)) and the third set

adds risk perception variables (columns (3) and (6)).

       WTP to reduce risk is estimated to increase with the magnitude of the risk reduction. The

coefficients on Risk, Mortality, and Duration are all positive. Aggregating across models, five of

the six coefficients on Risk and Duration are significantly different from zero at the 1 percent

level, and one of the coefficients on Mortality is significant at the 10 percent level in the Taiwan

sample (columns (1) – (3)). Estimated values of the coefficients are similar in the Taipei sample
                                                                                                      8


but significance levels are lower, perhaps because of the much smaller sample size. Consistent

with most of the literature on CV estimates of WTP to reduce health risk (Hammitt and Graham,

1999), the estimated coefficients are substantially smaller than the level implied by the prediction

of standard economic theory that WTP for small reductions in mortality or other health risks

should be nearly proportional to the reduction in probability of harm. This departure from

proportionality suggests that respondents may not have adequately considered the specific

numerical risk values specified in the questions.

       In the Taipei sample, respondents who were interviewed by telephone report significantly

greater WTP for a SARS vaccine than those interviewed in person. Because telephone interviews

were substituted for in-person interviews part way during the survey, the effects of survey mode

and date of interview are confounded in our data, and so we cannot determine whether this

coefficient reflects increasing concern about SARS during the survey period or a survey-mode

effect. The Taiwan sample data reveal no significant effect of interview date, but these data were

collected during a one week period and so provide little information on possible temporal effects.

       The estimated coefficients of the socio-demographic characteristics appear reasonable

and consistent across model specifications. The effect of household income is positive and highly

significant. The estimated income elasticity is 0.3 to 0.5 in both samples, consistent with

previous studies in Taiwan (Liu et al., 2000) and elsewhere (e.g., Viscusi and Aldy, 2003). More

highly educated respondents express significantly higher WTP in the Taiwan sample, but

education has no effect in the Taipei sample. In contrast, WTP decreases with household size in

the Taipei sample, but not in the Taiwan sample. Age, ethnicity, marital status, and health status

are not significantly related to WTP in either sample, nor are gender, having religious beliefs, or

living in the Taipei area in the Taiwan sample. The evidence on behavioral factors is mixed.

Although the coefficients suggest that respondents who wear a mask for protection from SARS
                                                                                                    9


have higher WTP, none are statistically significant. In contrast, Taipei-sample respondents who

obtained a flu shot reveal significantly greater WTP for a SARS vaccine, possibly reflecting a

selection effect involving respondents who are predisposed to getting vaccinated.

       The performance of the risk-perception variables is mixed. Of the three variables based

on psychometric attributes—Fatal, Knowledge, and Control—only Fatal has a statistically

significant coefficient, and only in the Taipei sample. The coefficient on Severity, reflecting

concern about the effect of SARS on Taiwan, is insignificant but the coefficient on Economy,

reflecting concern about the effects on Taiwan’s economy, is positive and significant in the

Taiwan sample. The variables directed at personal risk are much more important in explaining

variation in WTP. Danger and Income Risk are positive and significant in the Taiwan sample, and

Concern is positive and significant in the Taipei sample.

       Predicted WTP for the SARS vaccine, calculated at the sample mean of the independent

variables, is reported in Table 3. These predictions are adjusted for the indicated levels of the

Risk, Mortality, and Duration variables and used to calculated the associated value per statistical

life (VSL) reported in Table 4 (column headings correspond to the regression models in Table 3).

VSL is the marginal rate of substitution between income and mortality risk, calculated here by

dividing WTP for the vaccine by the corresponding reduction in mortality risk (equal to the

product of the baseline risk of SARS, the conditional mortality risk, and the duration for which

the vaccine is effective4). Because the estimated coefficients of Risk, Mortality, and Duration are

smaller than the values consistent with proportionality between risk reduction and WTP,

estimated VSL depends on the levels of these variables. Specifically, since estimated WTP varies




4
  Discounting to adjust for latency of benefit was neglected since it would have minimal effect
given that the vaccine is effective for one year or less.
                                                                                                    10


less than proportionately to risk reduction, estimated VSL tends to be larger for the smaller risk

reductions than for the larger risk reductions.

       The estimates of VSL reported in Table 4 are somewhat larger than estimates previously

reported for Taiwan. Based on estimates of the wage premium workers receive to compensate for

occupational fatality risk, Liu et al. (1997) estimated VSL in 1982 to 1986 as approximately

US$360,000 to 680,000 using actuarial risk estimates (1990 dollars, excluding anomalously low

1984 values). Liu and Hammitt (1999) estimated VSL in 1995 as US$620,000 (controlling for

injury risk) and US$1.2 million (not controlling for injury risk), using worker’s subjective risk

estimates (1995 dollars). In a CV study of WTP to reduce health risks associated with pesticide

residues on foods, Fu et al. (1999) estimated values per statistical cancer of US$580,000 to 1.3

million (1995 dollars). The values in Table 4 are similar to estimates for the United States and

other high-income countries, for which Viscusi and Aldy (2003) suggest the most reasonable

estimates for the average blue-collar worker range from about $4 million to $9 million, with a

median value of $7 million (2000 dollars). The rather high estimates may be attributable to the

high degree of salience and concern about SARS during the survey period, or to the possibility

that respondents believed the risk they faced to be larger than the probabilities stated in the

survey (3 or 5 per 100,000 per month).

4. Conclusions

       Two surveys conducted in Taiwan during the peak of the SARS epidemic reveal a high

degree of concern about SARS and high willingness to pay for a vaccine to prevent the risk of

infection. The general consistency of results between the two surveys—which encompass

different populations (adult residents of Taiwan vs. female adult residents of Taipei city and

county) and survey modes (telephone vs. in-person and mail/telephone)—provides some

evidence that the results are reliable.
                                                                                                     11


       The risk-perception results suggest that, while SARS was of great concern, respondents

also believed they were knowledgeable about the risk and that it was to some degree susceptible

to individual control. Willingness to pay for a vaccine to protect oneself from SARS was quite

high compared with WTP to reduce other fatal risks. Among individuals, estimated WTP is

related to household income and perceived threat of SARS to the respondent, but not strongly

related to the perceived effect of the epidemic on Taiwan. Interpreting the estimated WTP as a

value per statistical life yields values consistent with estimates of VSL in the United States and

other high-income countries, substantially larger than previous estimates for Taiwan. In

significant part, these high values may reflect the novelty, salience, and high degree of concern

about SARS during the period in which these data were collected.
