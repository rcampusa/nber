Cyclical patterns in earnings can arise when contracts between firms and their workers are
incomplete, and when workers cannot borrow or lend so as to smooth their consumption.
Earnings cycles generate occasional large changes in earnings, consistent with some recent
empirical findings. At the calibrated parameter values, financial constraints promote investment

           Cyclical patterns in earnings can arise when contracts between firms and their
        workers are incomplete, and when workers cannot borrow or lend so as to smooth
        their consumption. Earnings cycles generate occasional large changes in earn-
        ings, consistent with some recent empirical findings. At the calibrated parameter
        values, financial constraints promote investment in reputation – an intangible
        capital form – in contrast to their documented inhibiting effect on investment in
        tangible capital.

           Keywords: Reputation, Career Concerns, Earnings Dynamics, Endogenous
        Fluctuations.



1       Introduction
Recent analyses of large panel data sets reveal that earnings fluctuate in ways that
cannot be captured by the linear models commonly used in the literature on earnings
dynamics. In particular, earnings data show occasional changes far larger than pre-
dicted by a log-normal distribution – see Guvenen, Karahan, Ozkan and Song (2015)
and Arellano, Blundell and Bonhomme (2017), henceforth GKOS and ABB respective-
ly.

    These unusual events are routinely attributed to external shocks such as layoffs
triggering falls off the job ladder. Since large income fluctuations reduce the wel-
fare of risk-averse agents, it seems natural to conjecture that they are not initiated
by them. We show that career-concerned agents may in fact choose to go through
periods of low and high effort. We call these oscillations reputation cycles.
    We change the career concerns model of Holmström (1999) by assuming that the
agent is risk-averse and cannot borrow or lend. Since reputational investment pays
off only in the future, a worker’s incentive to maintain or improve her reputation de-
pends on her discount factor. If she is risk averse, her discount factor depends neg-
atively on her consumption growth. When the worker cannot smooth her consump-
tion by other means,1 this force can then give rise to cycles in her effort, and thus
in her earnings. The mechanism works as follows: When effort is low, the worker’s
consumption is low relative to her future consumption which means that her dis-
count factor is also low. This reduces her incentive to create a good reputation and
low effort is self fulfilling. Conversely, in a period of high effort, current consump-
tion is higher than future consumption, which means that the discount factor is also
large and so high effort is self fulfilling too. In other words, the discount factor and
reputational concerns are high because consumption growth is low.
    The model delivers several insights. First, evidence has shown that tangible in-
vestment is inhibited by liquidity constraints – Fazzari, Hubbard and Petersen (1988).
We find the opposite at least as far as reputational investment – an intangible – is
concerned. Under the set of calibrated parameters, cyclical paths may entail higher
average reputation capital than does the rest point solution of the model, although
cyclical paths exist only if the agent cannot borrow or lend.
    Second, in terms of pure theory, we show the existence of a new class of equilibri-
a. Repeated games are known to have equilibria that shift from period to period with
no change in the payoff functions in the stage game – e.g., Green and Porter (1984),
Mailath and Samuelson (2016, Sec. 4.3.1). In dynamic games with type uncertainty
of which ours is an example, Markovian equilibria also can entail fluctuating effort –
e.g., Board and Meyer-ter-Vehn (2013) and Cisternas (2018). With a risk averse agent,
however, we show that the Holmström model acquires a Markovian, cyclical equi-
librium: At each belief about the agent’s quality, there are three Markov-equilibrium
actions. Moreover, cyclical equilibria can arise even though the agent has a publicly

known retirement date.
    Third, we explore the model’s quantitative properties using micro-data on earn-
ings dynamics to calibrate its parameters. The variance coefficients can be recovered
from Lange’s (2007) estimates about the speed of employer learning. In the model,
income growth decomposes into small, fully persistent changes and larger, mean-
reverting changes roughly as U.S. panel data on earnings show: GKOS and ABB de-
tect significant deviations from lognormality in earnings data, with a small but no-
ticeable share of individuals experiencing very large changes. They also find that the
degree of persistence appears to be non-linear in the size of the shocks as large shocks
exhibit much stronger mean reversion than small shocks. Hubmer (2018) shows that
a life-cycle version of the standard job ladder model can capture the large negative
skewness and high excess kurtosis of earnings data. Our analysis indicates that en-
dogenous fluctuations in effort can also help to explain these large deviations from
the log-normal framework, while addressing the systematic correlation between the
persistence and the size of income shocks.
    Finally, the model generates a negative relation between exogenous income noise
and the volatility of earnings: Income can become more volatile when reputational
concerns rise in response to a reduction in the noise accompanying the relation be-
tween effort and output. Agency theory suggests that a reduction in noise raises the
incentives to provide effort, and we show that this can also help explain the rise in
the volatility of earnings. For cycles in effort to exist, incentives to provide effort can-
not be too weak. Noise with which the agent’s output is observed deters effort and
it also obstructs the formation of cycles. This bears on the question of why income
inequality has risen – Song, Price, Guvenen, Bloom, von Wachter (2018), henceforth
SPGBW. Paradoxically, we find that an increase in inequality could have in part been
caused by a decline in exogenous volatility. In particular, a decline in the noisiness of
technology will strengthen reputational concerns and may raise equilibrium income
volatility. Hence what SPGBW measure as a rise in the volatility of observed income
may in fact be the result of a decline in exogenous output noise.
    The plan of the paper is as follows. Section 2 lays out the model. Section 3 deal-
s with reputation cycles when disutility is linear in effort, where the mechanism is
more transparent, while Section 4 deals with convex disutility functions. We explain
in Section 5 how the model can be parametrized, and explore its quantitative impli-
cations. Then we review major hypotheses for endogenous cycles in Section 6.1 so
as to highlight the novelty of reputation cycles. Several extensions are discussed in

                                             3
Section 6.2, while Section 7 concludes. All the proofs are relegated to the Appendix.


2       Model
In Holmström (1999) a risk-neutral agent faces a spot market with risk-neutral buyer-
s. The unique equilibrium then entails a monotonic time path of effort. We will show
that if one assumes that the agent is risk averse, multiple equilibria arise and in some
of them effort follows a 2-period cycle. We assume the following:
    A1. Non-contractible effort and output;
    A2. Risk averse agent facing short-term risk-neutral buyers;
    A3. Agent cannot borrow or lend.
We maintain these assumptions throughout.

       Production.—Each period an agent produces output yt by exerting hidden effort
at :
                                          y t =  t + at + " t :                      (1)

Here "t  N (0;  2" ) is an i.i.d. shock. The variable  is the agent’s efficiency;  is
unknown, even to the agent, and the common prior is N (0 ;  2 ).

   Earnings.—Contracts in which the period-t payment is contingent on yt are not
feasible. Instead, buyers pay the agent up front and the payment reflects the market
belief at the beginning of the period. Thus the agent exerts effort only so as to raise
her future income. Output has a persistent effect on prices because it affects the
market’s belief about the agent’s efficiency which fluctuates over time as follows
                                                                    
                            t = t   1   +  t ; with   N 0;  2 :                (2)


    Information.—Each period the agent chooses an a from a compact and convex
set A  R+ while everyone observes y. The agent can also observe  + " but not its
components. The market’s participants observe y only, but since they will deduce
a from equilibrium, they too will be able to infer  + ". However, the market and
the agent observe different signals whenever the agent deviates and take a different
action than the one anticipated by the market. We account for such divergence by
using E  [] and E [] to denote the market’s and the agent’s expectation, respectively.


                                                    4
   Timing.—Within a period, events unfold as follows:

   1. There are many identical and risk neutral potential buyers, and they get ze-
      ro rents. Hence the up-front payment the agent gets is E  [yt j y t ] ; where y t 
      fys gts=01 is her public history.

   2. The agent chooses at , privately.

   3. Output yt is realized, and it becomes part of the publicly observed history y t+1 .


   Preferences.—The agent is risk averse and infinitely lived. Her preferences as of
date 0 read                        1

                                          t=0

with    2 (0; 1) denoting the discount factor.

   Equilibrium.—We will examine equilibria in pure strategies in which the agent’s
behavior along the path of play is a function of time only. An equilibrium must satisfy
the following three requirements. First, payments are set competitively by the market.
Second, the agent chooses her effort so as to maximize expected payoffs. Third, the
market conjecture at is verified.

depends on time only and:
1. Expected profits are zero in every period as ct = E  [yt j y t ] :

   Market beliefs.—In order to interpret the output signal, the market’s participants
need to conjecture the agent’s behavior. For a given conjecture fas gts=01 , a sufficient
statistic for the information revealed about t is the sequence xt = fxs gts=01 , where

                               xt  yt         at = t + at        at + "t :              (4)

   We will focus on stationary learning (Holmström, 1999, Sec. 2.2). Hence we as-

As (4) shows, by deviating from at , the agent can raise xt , manipulate mt+1 and drive
a wedge between her own belief and that of the market. We now analyze the agent’s
incentives to do that.


2.1 Investment in reputation
The zero-profit condition for market’s participants is satisfied when ct = E  [yt j y t ] =
mt + at , with mt obeying the law of motion (7). We focus on equilibria in which at is
deterministic. The agent’s FOC must hold at a :
                                     "   1
                                                                            #
                                         X
                                                s
                 at = arg max E                    U (ms + as ; as ) ; for all t = 0; 1; :::                   (8)

                                         s=0


This requirement ensures that: (i) given the law of motion of beliefs derived in the
previous subsection, equilibrium strategies satisfying (8) maximize the agent’s utility;
(ii) given the equilibrium actions, beliefs are updated via Bayes rule which is well

     Observe that @                        2 =@  < 0 as fluctuations in output and efficiency lower
stationary precision.

                ^ since all output levels occur with positive probability at a . Solutions
defined for all a
to problem (8) are therefore optimal.
    We now establish a sufficient condition for the existence of deterministic equi-
libria. Whenever the agent deviates, she drives a persistent wedge between her belief
and that of the market. Thus a deviation that is not attractive on the equilibrium path
might nonetheless be profitable off path, and so the necessary condition is not gen-
erally sufficient. We now show that this concern does not apply when U () is in the
CARA class.

Proposition 1 Assume that the per-period utility function is CARA:

                 U(c; a) = U (c          g(a)) =       exp(      (c         g(a))); with          > 0:    (9)

A deterministic profile fat g1
                              t=0 is an equilibrium profile if and only if

                                                       1

                                                                         Et [U1 (cs ; as )] :          (10)
                                                    s=t+1


     The proof is in the Appendix and it proceeds in two steps. First, we establish that
optimal strategies are deterministic on and off the equilibrium path whenever the
market’s conjecture at is deterministic. This result holds because shocks to the agen-
t’s reputation are permanent. Then income shocks, which reflect the history y t , will
in turn be permanent because buyers are risk neutral and because their beliefs have
the martingale property. But permanent income shocks matter for the decisions of
the agent only if her preferences display a wealth effect, which can be turned off us-
ing the CARA specification. We can therefore focus, without loss of generality, on
sequences of deterministic actions. This restriction enables us to prove the concavity
of the agent’s objective in the space of action sequences, thus directly establishing
the sufficiency of the first order condition.3
     The left-hand side of (10) is the marginal disutility, while the right-hand side is the
discounted benefit because a marginal increase in effort raises the posterior mean
at date s by @ms =@at = (1 ) s t 1 , for all s > t.4 Since c is increasing in m and
m is a martingale, expected consumption depends on the agent’s current reputation.
   3
     A recent paper by Cisternas (2016) provides bounds guaranteeing sufficiency in more general set-
tings in which optimal actions may depend on the posterior m.
   4
     Eq. (10) is the counterpart of Holmström’s (1999), eq. (22), with the essential addition of the terms
U2 (ct ; at ) and Et [U1 (cs ; as )] :


                                                           7
Hence the optimality condition (10) varies with mt and in general so would at ; con-
trary to our assumption that at depends on t only. To ensure that Et [U1 (cs ; as )=U2 (ct ; at )]
is not affected by mt , we neutralize the wealth effect by assuming that the agent’s utili-
ty function is CARA. This restriction ensures that the agent’s discount factor no longer
depends on mt because it is the forecastable component of ms for all s > t.

       The effective discount factor r is higher than because consumption is stochastic
and the agent is prudent (U 000 () > 0). A mean-preserving spread in consumption rais-
es expected marginal utility in future periods, and so makes the agent more patient.
This precautionary motive is stronger when the coefficient of risk-aversion is large
because governs the curvature of the marginal utility function. The discount factor
r is also increasing in  2 because beliefs, and thus consumption, are more volatile
when types are less persistent. By contrast, r does not depend on the output variance
 2" . This surprising result arises because  2" has two countervailing effects. To describe
them, it is useful to recall that mt+1 = mt + (1 ) xt , and that consumption is linear
in m as ct = mt + at . Hence  2" has a positive effect on consumption volatility since
it raises the variance of the market signal x. However,  2" also raises the gain parame-
ter  as the market puts less weight on recent observations when production is more
noisy. This additional inertia in the updating rule exactly compensates the direct im-
pact on the variance of the signal, thus leaving consumption volatility unchanged.5
In the remainder of the paper, we guarantee that expected returns are bounded by
focusing on cases where r < 1.

3       Cycles with Linear Costs

3.1     Rest point
Suppose that g(a) = a with  2 (0; 1) to ensure that effort raises output net of disu-
tility. We rule out infinite output by imposing an upper-bound a   on the feasible set
A = [0; a  ]. With linear costs, optimality can only be restored through changes in
the discount factor because both marginal costs and marginal returns are constant.
To see why, assume that both at and at+1 belong to the interior of A and substitute
         
g 0 at+1 on the right-hand side of (11) to obtain6

                                 U 0 (at+1 (1 ))          

                                                   =                                 :              (13)
                                  U (at (1 ))       r(1 + (                 1))

Taking expectations about at+1 as given, at adjusts until the equality above is satisfied.
The equilibrium path is fully determined by the ratio of marginal costs to discounted
marginal returns on the right-hand side of (13). Since this ratio is constant, all paths
converge to a when it is lower than one or, conversely, converge to zero when it is
higher than one. The dynamics become explicit if one uses (9) to rewrite (13) as
                                                                                        
                                                1                         
                         at+1   =   at                 log                                 :      (14)
                                           (1       )             r(1 + (     1))

The law of motion is obtained projecting at on a line parallel to the 45 degree line
with an intercept equal to the constant on the right-hand side of (14). As shown in
Appendix A.2, Fig. 13, in the knife-edge case where the intercept is zero, i.e., when
 = (1 )=(r 1 ), the dynamic map and 45 degree line coincide so that any action
in A is a potential rest point. Besides this particular case, the action path converges
    when the intercept is positive or to zero when it is negative. Hence at can be
to a
constant solely at one of the boundary of the action set.
    If marginal costs are low, so that  < (1 )=(r 1 ), agents are tempted to
raise their effort above that of the rest point a
                                                ^. Hence a ^ is sustainable only if such
deviations are not feasible, that is if a .7 This solution is also efficient because the
                                        ^=a
    6
     Eq. (13) is a particular case of the recursive incentive constraint (18) where g(a) = a: The poste-
rior m does not affect the ratio on the LHS of (13) because utility is CARA.
   7
     Formally, the incentive constraint (11) does not have to hold as an equality at the bounds of the
feasibility set. When a ^=a  and  < (1 )=(r 1 ), the RHS exceeds the LHS of (11) and the agent is
constrained by the requirement that a  a    .

cost parameter  < 1 while marginal productivity is one. Conversely, when marginal
costs are high, so that  > (1 )=(r 1 ), reputational concerns are too weak and
a
^ = 0 is the only rest point.


3.2      Cycles
Deterministic output.—To build our intuition, we first assume that output is deter-
                               2 =  2 since all the uncertainty is due to the fact that
ministic, i.e.,  " = 0. Then 
the agent’s type  changes from period to period. If  were to remain constant, each
type would be revealed once and for all after the first output realization. This simpli-
fied environment enables us to isolate the impact of the discount factor. As shown
in Proposition 3, the model exhibits stationary cycles of period two when agents are
sufficiently patient. Moreover, two-period cycles can Pareto dominate the rest point
when the latter is inefficient because effort costs are too high.

Proposition 3 Assume that (i) costs are linear in effort (g(a) = a with  2 (0; 1));
(ii) a 2 [0; a
             ]; and (iii) output is deterministic ( " = 0) : Then the rest point a
                                                                                   ^ = 0 is
Pareto dominated by 2-period cycles in which effort oscillates between 0 and a      when-
ever r 2 ( exp (    (1 ) a ) ; ).

    Cycles arise because the discount factor fluctuates procyclically. High at = a          en-
tails above-normal consumption, leading to a low marginal utility U 0 (ct g (at )). The
opposite is true next period as at+1 = 0 delivers low consumption and relatively high
marginal utility U 0 (ct+1 g (at+1 )). Thus Et [U 0 (cs g (as )) =U 0 (ct g (at ))] is large to-
day, and this justifies the higher investment in reputation building. A similar but
opposite mechanism operates in the next period, making low effort optimal. The os-
cillations of the discount factor capture the willingness of the agent to smooth con-
sumption. Since the benefits of her action only accrue in the following period, she
finds it optimal to transfer resources from good to bad times by overinvesting.
    To better understand the forces at work, it is insightful to study the incentive con-
straint at the upper-bound a  : Full effort is incentive compatible if and only if8

                                          U 0 (0)

Reputational returns are on the right-hand side of (15), and they are increasing in
effort a
        because it raises the ratio of marginal utilities between bad and good times.
Quite intuitively, smaller oscillations become sustainable when the power of incen-
tives is strengthened. Take for example an increase in the discount factor . It raises r
as patient agents tend to be more concerned by their reputation. Hence the required
wedge between marginal utilities is decreasing in which allows the model to gen-
erate cycles for lower values of a. A similar mechanism is triggered by changes in the
degree of risk aversion because the effective rate of time preference r is increasing in
  . This effect is reinforced by the positive impact that has on the curvature of the
marginal utility function. When agents are more prudent, similar oscillations in con-
sumption generate greater swings in the discount factor, which lowers the value of a   
that restores incentive compatibility.
    To sum-up, the agent must be sufficiently prudent and not too impatient for cy-
cles to emerge. Note that Proposition 3 also requires that agents are not too patient
since it imposes an upper-bound on the effective discount factor (r < ). Although
cycles can emerge even when this requirement is violated, they will not be welfare
improving because, as explained before, the rest point is efficient when costs are so
low that r > .9

   Stochastic output.—We now consider the full model where output is stochastic.
Letting  " differ from 0 implies that today’s action affects beliefs on-the-equilibrium
path not only in the next period, but also in all future periods. The rate of decay of
past observations is controlled by the parameter , whose value is equal to 0 when
output is observable. Proposition 4 takes into account the impact of  by extending
Proposition 3 to environments where output is noisy.

Proposition 4 Assume that (i) costs are linear (g(a) = a with  2 (0; 1)); and (ii)

    As with deterministic output, welfare improving cycles can arise solely if the agent
is sufficiently patient and prudent. We can also show that they require output to not
be too noisy. Thus, although  " is, by the usual account, a measure of idiosyncratic
uncertainty, higher  " does not necessarily translate into more income volatility for

      Remember that  = 0 when  " = 0:

the agent. An increase in  " lowers the power of incentives because recent observa-
tions are less informative when realized output is a noisier measure of actual quality.
This implies in turn that cycles are not sustainable if  " is too high.

Proposition 5 There exists a unique output variance  " such that cycles of period two
are never sustainable when  " >  " . Moreover, (i) when  > r, cycles are sustainable if
and only if a     log(=r)
                      (1 )
                             and  " 2 [0;  " ]; (ii) when   r, there exists an output variance
 " 2 [0;  " ) such that cycles are sustainable for all  " 2 [ " ;  " ].

    According to Proposition 5, a reduction in the noisiness of the technology can
raise income volatility. This paradoxical behavior occurs if: (i)  " is initially higher
than the upper-bound  " , so that at is constant for all t; and (ii) the drop in  " is
large enough to ensure that the new value is smaller than  " , so that effort now cycles
between 0 and a . Then the cross-sectional and conditional variance of income will
be negatively correlated with  " . As mentioned in the introduction, this relates to the
evidence on rising inequality in SPGBW.
    The variance of income increments from period to period is given by10

The variance of at is obviously equal to 0 at the rest point. It jumps to a
crosses the  " threshold from above and effort starts to cycle. Such a drop in output
uncertainty will therefore increase the conditional volatility of income. To character-
ize its impact on the cross-sectional variance, we must first ensure that a stationary
distribution of types exists. The simplest way to do so is to assume that agents ran-
domly exit the market with probability  per period. Since each agent’s productivity
is a geometrically distributed random variable and an additional period of life adds
 2 to the variance of m, the time-invariant distribution of types  (m) is a mixture of
normal distributions with the following cross-sectional variance

other volatility parameter   is less intriguing because it strengthens the power of
incentives. It is therefore positively correlated with income variance since a switch
to the cycling regime will be triggered by an increase in   , as opposed to a decrease
in  " . Note that   also directly increases the volatility of income by augmenting the
variance of income increments from period to period (see eq. (16)). As a result  
raises the discount factor r, which further supports the emergence of cycles.


4    Cycles with Convex Costs
We now generalize our setup and show that cycles continue to emerge when disutility
is strictly convex in effort. If U (c; a) = U (c g (a)) and if g 0 (0) = 0, the incentive
constraint (10) always admits an interior solution for a , and we can substitute in the
                       
expression of g 0 at+1 on the right-hand side of (10) to obtain a recursive condition
                                  "                               #

The recursive incentive constraint highlights that increasing at has two benefits:
   (i) It raises t + 1 earnings by (1 ), and
   (ii) it enables the agent to reduce her effort in period t + 1 by  in order to undo
the deviation, thereby restoring the reputation associated to the equilibrium path in

Efficient effort would require instead that a = g 0 1 (1). Thus, when r is smaller than
one, a^ < g 0 1 (1) and effort at the rest point is suboptimal because costs are paid up-
front, whereas reputational benefits accrue slowly over time. This delay explains why
the gap between efficient and actual effort is larger when the agent is more impatient.

   Stability of the rest point.—Under risk neutrality, the rest point is always unstable.
Any other action than a   ^ generates diverging trajectories,11 hence the unique deter-
ministic equilibrium requires that at = a  ^ for all t. By contrast, the rest point can
be locally stable when the agent is risk averse. Then, for any initial action a0 in the
neighborhood of a   ^, there exists a deterministic path that converges back to a ^. The
condition under which equilibrium multiplicity arises is laid-out in Proposition 6.

Proposition 6 Assume that g(a) is strictly convex with g 0 (0) = 0. Then the rest point a
                                                                                        ^

    Equation (20) depends on the action a     ^ at the rest point, and so only implicitly de-
scribes the parameter values under which multiple equilibria arise. We can nonethe-
less easily establish a couple of observations. First, when the coefficient of absolute
risk aversion goes to zero, condition (20) is violated and the rest point is unstable.12
Second, if a^ is efficient, the rest point is unstable. To see why, note that the impact of

    This is not obvious from (20) because affects a     ^ through its impact
                                                                           on r. However, since r con-
                                                                      1
verges to when goes to zero, lim !0 a      ^ ( ) = g 0 1 (1 ) =          . Hence the LHS of (20) con-
verges to a positive value, whereas the RHS goes to zero, and so (20) never holds in the limit.

 , as measured by the term on the right hand side of (20), is proportional to 1 g 0 (^     a).
                                          0
Thus risk aversion is irrelevant when g (^  a) = 1, that is when the action is efficient. In-
tuitively, the curvature of the utility function matters only to the extent that changes
in a affect utility. Benefits and costs are set equal at the first best and a marginal in-
crease in effort leaves utility unchanged. However, we have seen that a      ^ is inefficient
whenever the agent discounts the future. Then raising a lowers her marginal utility,
thus making it attractive to provide more effort today in order to raise tomorrow’s
consumption. This is why an increase in effort is followed by a drop and a return to
the rest point if the curvature of the utility function is high enough.

    Cycles.—When the rest point is locally stable, there is a continuum of determinis-
tic equilibria whose paths start in the vicinity of the stationary solution and gradually
converge to it. Hence they only temporarily differ from the solution already studied
in the career concerns literature. But the model can also generate more complex be-
haviors with persistent oscillations. We now focus on the simplest equilibria in such
class, namely deterministic cycles of period two.

Proposition 7 When the costs function is quadratic, i.e., g(a) = a2 =2, deterministic
2-period cycles are sustainable whenever the rest point is locally stable.

    The reason why cycles are sustainable is the same as in the model with linear cost-
s: Procyclical fluctuations in the discount factor make it optimal to work hard when
consumption is high and to reduce effort when consumption is low. This mechanism
is closely related to the one that renders the rest point locally stable, and Proposition
7 shows that the two phenomena are indeed concomitant when disutility is quadratic
in effort.
    Inspecting the phase portrait generated by the incentive constraint (18) helps one
understand how cycles arise. We highlight the impact of risk aversion by also report-
ing the model’s dynamics when agents are risk neutral. Then, as shown in the left-
hand panel of Fig. 2, the mapping between at and at+1 is linear with a slope greater
than one. Hence the rest point a ^ is the only effort level that does not generate diverg-
ing action paths.
    We introduce risk aversion in the right-hand panel of Fig. 2. The dynamic map
solves the recursive equation (19) with a quadratic cost function g(a) = a2 =2, and is
therefore equivalent to

    Let us first explain why small values of at can never be incentive compatible. Let-
ting at go to zero, we see that the expression on the left hand side of (21) also con-
verges to zero. By contrast, the expression on the right hand side of (21) has a pos-
itive minimum. By continuity, there always exists an a > 0 such that (21) does not
hold whenever at 2 [0; a]. In economic terms, there is no expectation about at+1 that
sustains an effort level smaller than a. Intuitively, the dynamic map in Fig. 2 is empty
close to the origin because today’s marginal loss converges to 0 whereas tomorrow’s
marginal returns are bounded from below by 1 .
    Besides this empty interval, we see that, instead of the one-to-one mapping pre-
vailing under risk neutrality, the dynamic map under risk aversion is a correspon-
dence which associates a pair of incentive compatible at+1 to any at . The incen-
tive constraint is satisfied by two different at+1 because tomorrow’s effort shifts the
discount factor and the marginal costs in opposite directions. Increasing at+1 rais-
es tomorrow’s consumption, which lowers the discount factor and counteracts the
increase in marginal costs g 0 (at+1 ). When the elasticity of the discount factor with re-
spect to at+1 is higher than that of the marginal costs, it is possible to perturb a pair
of sustainable actions and restore incentive compatibility by adjusting at+1 until its

effect on the discount factor offsets the change in marginal costs.
    Effort settles down at the rest point a
                                          ^ when the expectation-formation mechanism
always selects the lower branch of the phase portrait. By contrast, 2-period cycles
are regime switching equilibria whose actions oscillate between the upper and lower
branch.

   Stability region.—Equation (20) enables us to identify the region with multiple
equilibria. The rest point is locally stable and 2-period cycles arise whenever the pa-
rameters fall inside the surface depicted in Fig. 3. We use two different angles to
depict the stability region because its shape is strongly asymmetric.
   Looking first at the discount factor , we see that it has an ambiguous impact as
cycles emerge only for intermediary values of . When goes to 0, so does the rest
point a^ because the agent is not anymore concerned by her reputation. Hence the
marginal disutility of effort g 0 (^
                                   a) also converges to 0, and the stability condition (20) is
always violated. Reputational returns are so low that an increase in today’s effort can
be incentive compatible solely if the marginal disutility of effort in the next period
increases more than proportionally. Thus the slope of the relationship between at
and at+1 is greater than 1 when evaluated at a    ^, which ensures that the rest point is

                                             17
locally unstable. Conversely, as goes to 1, a       ^ converges to the efficient level of effort
which, as explained above, is always locally unstable.
    Comparing the impact of the coefficient of risk aversion in the right and left-
hand panels of Fig. 3, we notice that has a stronger effect on the stability region
when is low. This is because does not only increase risk aversion but also renders
the agent more prudent. As explained before, the precautionary motive increases the
level of effort at the rest point. When a  ^ is already close to its efficient level because is
high, as in the right-hand panel of Fig. 3, then the precautionary channel counteracts
the risk aversion channel. By contrast, when is low, as in the left-hand panel of Fig.
3, the risk aversion channel dwarfs the precautionary channel, so that raising makes
it much more likely for cycles to be sustainable.
    The last variable included in Fig. 3 is the gain parameter  which controls the
inertia of beliefs. Remember that varying  is equivalent to adjusting the output vari-
ance  2" , with  2" going from 0 to infinity as  goes from 0 to 1.13 As already discussed
in Section 3, decreasing  makes it more likely that cycles arise by strengthening the
power of incentives. However, it also increases the value of the rest point, which may
counteract the direct impact of  when the rest point is close to its efficient level. As
was the case for , this countervailing force explains why the stability region is much
less sensitive to changes in  in the right-hand panel of Fig. 3, where and thus a         ^ are
both close to one.

    Output volatility and income variance.—Studying the model with linear costs, we
proved that a reduction in the noisiness of the technology may raise income variance.
A similar conclusion can be numerically established in the model with convex costs.
For instance, taking the parameters in Table 1 and varying the value of  " , we indeed
find that income variance and output volatility can be negatively correlated when
effort fluctuates endogenously.
    The upper panel of Fig. 4 reports effort in the high and low states of 2-period
cycles along with its value at the rest point. Cycles are sustainable when incentives
are strong enough. Hence they arise when , and consequently  " , are below a cer-
tain threshold.14 The cross-sectional variance of income increases as  " crosses this
  13
     By contrast, the variance of types  2 affects two parameters at once. Raising  2 leads to a decrease
in  as well as an increase in r, which is equivalent to raising in Fig. 3. In general, these two adjust-
ments tend to reinforce each other, thus making it more likely that cycles are sustainable.
  14
     Note that Fig. 3 shows that it is not always possible to generate cycles by lowering , especially
when is close to one so that the rest point is not too far from its efficient level.

tom panel is the analog of Fig. 1; this experiment confirms that an increase in in-
come variance can be caused by a reduction in the volatility of the underlying shocks.
Moreover, we see that the calibrated value of  " in Table 1 falls well within the region
where cycles are sustainable. This again relates to the evidence on rising inequality
in SPGBW.


5    Earnings Persistence

5.1 Deterministic cycles
Parametrization.—We have established that reputation cycles emerge when the risk-
aversion and the patience of the agent belong to some intermediate range. To see
whether these two requirements are likely to be met in practice, we use micro data to
pin down the parameters.
   We now assume that agents are workers who maximize their expected utility, and
that a is a worker’s hidden labor. We focus on quadratic disutility so that g(a) = a2 =2:
The model then has five parameters f ; ; ;  " ;   g. For the yearly discount factor,
we set = 0:95. The exit rate  determines the average length of a worker’s career. As-
suming that reputation is occupation specific, we target Kambourov and Manovskii’s
(2008) finding that occupational mobility at the one-digit level averaged 13% per year

    The two variance parameters f " ;   g are chosen to match the speed of employer
learning and the labor wedge. We use  to denote the labor wedge and define it as the
gap between the marginal product of labor (MPN) and the marginal rate of substitu-
tion (MRS), so that   1 MRS/MPN. The labor wedge measures the extent to which
agents underinvest in their reputation. In the absence of distortions,  = 0 because
both MRS and MPN are equal to the wage. At the rest point of our model, however,
labor supply is inefficiently low and the MRS is lower than the wage. Hence the labor
wedge is positive and equal to15

is at the rest point so that a = a^. We set ^ = 0:4 to match the average labor wedge in
the US over the last fifty years, as estimated by Shimer (2009).
     For our second moment, we target the frequency at which the market updates its
beliefs, i.e., the speed with which information about the agent’s performance leaks
out to the general public. Its value has been estimated by Lange (2007) in his empiri-
cal analysis about the speed of employer learning. Using AFQT scores to infer ability,
Lange’s estimates of the learning speed center around  = :75.16
     Together with Eqs. (7), (22), these estimates for  and  enable us to to pin down
 " and   conditional on . The upper panel of Fig. 5 shows that reputation cycles are
consistent with our calibration strategy whenever

to offset the increase in the curvature of the utility function. The lower panel of Fig. 5

      Lange (2007) uses K1 to denote the speed of learning parameter and defines it on page 11, eq.
(11). Comparing its expression with that of  in (7), one sees that K1 = 1 . Even though learning
in Lange’s model is non-stationary, since types remain constant over time in his model, the similarity
between K1 and  holds because K1 captures the speed of learning during the first year of a worker’s
career.

vestment in reputation. Although is a CARA-utility parameter, we can convert (23)
into a statement about CRRA utility as follows: By adjusting average ability 0 , we can
normalize average consumption and output to unity at the rest point.17 Then also

setting  " = :2255 and   = :0651, ensures that we exactly match our labor wedge and
speed of learning targets. Our choice of parameters is summarized in Table 1.

    Earnings persistence.—We now explain why reputation cycles generate earnings
profiles with large shocks that are less persistent than small shocks, as documented
in GKOS and ABB. To relate mean reversion to the size of the shocks, we follow GKOS
in reporting today’s earnings changes against the expected value of future earnings
changes k years from now, for different values of k. The resulting impulse response
functions are depicted in Fig. 6. They measure the fraction of each shock that has
mean-reverted. The points that are on the horizontal line indicate perfect persistence
of today’s shocks, whereas those that are on the 45 degrees line indicate full mean

      More precisely, setting 0 = 0:4 ensures that consumption at the rest point is on average equal to
           c] = 0 + a
1 since E [^           ^ = 0 + 1 ^, and ^ has been set equal to 0:4 to match the evidence in Shimer
(2009).

reversion.18
    We first report in the left-hand panel of Fig. 6 the impulse responses when effort
is at the rest point. Then earnings shocks, whatever their sizes, are fully persistent be-
cause beliefs, and thus wages, follow a martingale process. We introduce reputation
cycles in the right-hand panel of Fig. 6. Large shocks are now driven by changes in
effort, with cycles considerably widening the range of income fluctuations. Focusing
on horizons that are even (k = 1; 3; 5), large shocks are completely transitory because
they follow the agents’ efforts whose values oscillate from one period to the next.


5.2 Three fit-improving extensions
The following three extensions improve the model’s fit to the impulse-response evi-
dence in GKOS.

   1. Observed characteristics: Given that some output characteristics may be ob-
      servable, we add a state pt such that the output of a worker with t years of occu-

   The impulse response functions are estimated using a simulated panel dataset made of 100 waves,
each one of them containing 5.000 workers. We delete the first 50 waves to limit the impact of the initial
conditions, thus basing our estimates on 500.000 observations.

Notes: Using the parameters in Table 1, we generate a balanced panel dataset of 50 waves, with 5.000
workers per wave. For each period, we assign workers into 10 groups based on their current log-
earnings growth. Then, for workers in each group, we compute the average of log k-year earnings
growth, i.e., E [log (ct+k =ct ) jlog (ct =ct 1 )] for k = 1; 2; 3; 4; 5.

      Since pt is persistent, it drops out of the incentive constraints for the same rea-
      son that mt does.

   2. Some workers can borrow and lend: Cycling equilibria arise only if agents can-
      not borrow and lend. According to Kaplan, Violante and Weidner (2014) only
      one third of agents are so constrained. Hence we assume that two thirds of
      workers can smooth their income and implement the rest point solution since
      that is the only Markovian equilibrium that exists in that case. This adds no new
      parameters.

   3. Stochastic cycles: Our model exhibits a significant departure from GKOS data

                                                                23
       as the degree of mean reversion dramatically changes when the forward horizon
       k goes from even to odd. Whenever k is odd, shocks are fully persistent because
       effort reverts to its original value. This suggests that, in order to reproduce the
       data, one needs to consider cycles whose lengths are not deterministic.
       Thus we allow agents to switch stochastically, instead of deterministically, be-
       tween periods of low and high effort. Signals that raise at are “good news” be-
       cause they bring the worker closer to first best, signals that lower at are bad
       news.19 We continue to focus on action paths with two levels only, but assume
       that, at each level, effort remains constant with probability , and changes state
       with the complementary probability. This lowers the discount factor but other-
       wise leaves incentives as before; details are in Appendix A.4. One coordination
       device may be task assignment as in Bar-Isaac and Hörner (2014) – assignment
       to a demanding task indicating an expectation that effort will be high, and vice
       versa.


5.3 Extended calibration
We keep the baseline parameters reported in Table 1, and select the values of the two
new parameters f ;   g to minimize the distance between a set of moments predicted
by the model and their empirical counterparts. We target the estimates in GKOS for
the dispersion of log-earnings growth and the persistence of earning shocks.20 As
reported in Table 1, we obtain the best fit when = :7 and   = :11:

   Distribution of earnings growth.—The density of earnings changes predicted by
the model, and the one observed in GKOS data, are reported in Fig. 7. We also in-
clude a normal density with the same standard deviation as in the data. Fig. 7 shows
that the simulated and empirical densities display high kurtosis since they have much
  19
      This relates to the good-news and bad-news literature. By contrast to our signals, Board and
Meyer-ter-Vehn (2013), e.g., have endogenous signals to which effort can respond.
   20
      More precisely, we split the empirical moments into two vectors: m         ^ 1 which contains the esti-
mated standard deviation of log-earnings growth, and m          ^ 2 which contains the average persistence
for the first and last five percentiles of earnings shocks. Average persistence is computed over four
and five years so as to match its value when the horizon is odd or even. Using mi () to denote the
simulated moments generated by the vector of parameters   f ;   g, we compute the quadrat-

squares of the data targets on the diagonal – i.e., Wii = 1=m       ^ 2i – and zero for all other entries. This
procedure ensures that our objective puts the same weight on the dispersion of log-earnings growth
as on the persistence of earning shocks.

sharper peaks than the normal distribution. We match the shape of the empirical
peak almost perfectly. In our model, the extra kurtosis is generated by reputation cy-
cles because the two other sources of income shocks, namely changes in reputation
and observable productivity, are independently drawn from normal distributions.
The impact of reputation cycles is noticeable on the shoulders of the simulated dis-
tribution, that is in the regions around the positive and negative standard deviations,
where the model generates more mass than in the data.

    Persistence of earnings changes.—The impulse responses of the extended model
are reported in Fig. 8. They are now consistent with GKOS. The persistence of earn-
ings changes is clearly nonlinear. Small shocks are very persistent because they result
from changes in reputation or observable productivity, which are permanent by as-
sumption. By contrast, large shocks are driven by reputation cycles that tend to revert
over time. But their degree of mean reversion is not anymore fully determined by the
forward horizon. Adding a stochastic switching rate ( = :7) smooths the impulse re-
sponses, as only 70% of saving-constrained agents adjust their effort from one period
to the next.
    Although the introduction of stochastic cycles ensures that the impulse responses

are broadly similar to those reported in GKOS, the potential size of shocks is small-
er in our simulations than in the data.21 Hence reputation cycles cannot account
for all unusual events, especially large negative drops in earnings. To some extent,
this was expected since our model does not take into consideration the risk of non-
employment. It is, however, possible to increase the size of shocks by raising the coef-
ficient of risk aversion . Setting for instance equal to 5 instead of 4, and recalibrat-
ing the model, yields Fig. 9. The distribution of log-earnings changes remains close
to its empirical counterpart. Raising widens the amplitude of cycles which creates
the following trade-off: On the one hand, the model now matches more closely the
fatness of the tails; on the other hand, it slightly underestimates the size of the spike
at 0. As for the impulse responses reported in the lower panel of Fig. 9, they have a
similar shape than in the benchmark calibration. The only noticeable difference is
that wider cycles translate into a larger range of earnings shocks.

    Impulse responses by income groups.—GKOS also analyze how the impulse re-
sponses vary across income groups. They sort individuals based on their average
earnings over the last years, and then compute the impulse responses within each
group. Comparing the impulse responses across groups, they find that positive shock-
s are more persistent than negative shocks for low-earnings individuals. Since the
opposite holds true for high-earnings individuals, putting together the impulse re-
sponses of different income groups yields what GKOS call a "butterfly pattern": As
one moves up the distribution of recent earnings, the positive and negative branches
of the impulse responses rotate in opposite directions.
    Fig. 10 reports the results of a similar experiment on our simulated dataset. As in
GKOS data, low-earnings individuals face larger shocks. Another similarity is that the
negative shocks faced by high-earnings individuals are much larger than the positive
shocks. But the simulations do not generate a butterfly pattern. We do not observe
a significant correlation between recent earnings and the persistence of positive and
negative shocks. Note, however, that the butterfly pattern might not be a universal
feature of earnings data since ABB find that a different pattern holds true in PSID da-
ta. Using a semi-parametric approach, ABB show that persistence is at its strongest
when high earnings households are hit by a good shock, or when low earnings house-
holds are hit by a bad shock.

     Today’s earnings changes, log(ct )   log(ct   1 ),   go from -.55 to .5 in our simulation instead of -1.2 to
1 in GKOS data.

6     Discussion

6.1 Related models
The rest point of our model has the following two features:
   (i) effort is below its output-maximizing level so that higher effort today raises
current earnings and utility,
    (ii) higher effort today does not raise future output.
Properties (i) and (ii) combine to generate the movements in the effective discoun-
t factor that are needed to generate cyclical effort paths. Models of human capital
investment do not include both of these features.

    Ben-Porath type of human capital investment.—Reputation, as we have modeled
it, differs from traditional models of the Ben-Porath (1967) type in which a worker
sacrifices current income in return for higher future earnings. In contrast to (i) and
(ii) such human capital investment lowers current earnings via a compensating dif-
ferential contrary to property (i), and it raises future earnings contrary to property
(ii).

   Learning by doing investment.—Although it does not have property (ii) ; LBD is
the closest-related line of research because it potentially shares with our model prop-
erty (i), namely the feature that higher learning today raises an agent’s income today.
That does not mean, however, that it also raises today’s utility. Here is a version of
LBD that compares closely to our model. Let k denote the stock of human capital
and a the investment in human capital. Assume that

                            ct = kt + at and,                                                    (25)
                           kt = (1      )kt     1   + at 1 ; with  2 (0; 1):                   (26)

Property (i) does not hold because agents set at beyond the point where today’s util-
ity U (ct g(at )) is maximized.22 Hence increasing at reduces current utility instead of
 22
    Current output is maximized when a = g 1 (1). Thus the observation that effort exceeds its output-
maximizing level directly follows from the first-order condition
                                             1              0
                                                     s tU       (cs   g(as )) @ks

raising it. Property (ii) does not hold either because, according to (26), higher effort
raises k 0 , and so increases tomorrow’s output. Thus the discount factor is decreasing
in at at the rest point, and LBD exerts a stabilizing force which prevents the emer-
gence of cycles.
    When combined with technological choice, however, the LBD model can generate
cycles resembling the asymmetric cycles displayed in Fig. 12 below. Examples are
Parente (1994) and Jovanovic and Nyarko (1996).


6.2 Other Extensions

1. Non-stationary learning and the age-volatility relation.—We now describe four ex-
tensions that would extend further the model’s explanatory power. As a first check,
we let the precision of the starting prior  ;02 differ from its long-run level      2 . We
typically expect the precision of beliefs to increase over time, as is always the case
when types are constant since then   2 , and thus     2 , are both infinite. The return-
s to effort are decreasing in posterior precision because it lowers the weight that the
market puts on recent observations. Hence the equilibrium sequence of actions tend-
s to decrease over time as in Holmström’s model with risk-neutral agents. Adding
risk-aversion allows us to construct another equilibrium sequence which oscillates
around the regularly decreasing path, as shown in Fig. 11. This alternative solution
eventually coincides with the two-period cycles described in the previous section be-
cause the precision converges to its stationary level        2 . Moreover, the decreasing
amplitude of the oscillations is consistent with empirical evidence about the nega-
tive relationship between income volatility and worker age.
    Even along the regularly decreasing “Holmström” path shown by the solid curve
in Fig. 11, income volatility is decreasing with the worker age. Cycling at paths thus
reinforce this decline by subtracting mass from the tails of the growth rates’ distribu-
tions as the worker ages.

    2. Asymmetric cycles and income-growth persistence.—Although we have focused
on cycles of period 2, the model can generate more complex patterns. For example,
it is possible to use the model with linear costs to generate cycles with more than
two states. As an illustration, Fig. 12 describes incentive-compatible cycles of peri-
od 3 where investment grows for two successive periods and then drops back to its
initial level. This is the simplest instance of asymmetric cycles featuring protracted

                                              30

booms and sudden busts. A tendency for a time series to show large negative growth
rates followed by several smaller positive growth rates is known as “steep asymme-
try.” Moreover, the long-run frequency distribution of at places equal weight on the
points 0; 0:71, and 1, and thus has longer left tail. A tendency for a detrended time
series to have negative skew is known as “deep”.23
    The longer period of growth is sustainable because investment costs  are low, i.e.,
 < (1 )=(r 1 ).24 As explained in Section 3, when this inequality holds, the rest
point is efficient because the agent always finds it profitable to raise her investment.
But now she is discouraged from doing so in the two low states by the fact that the
marginal utility of consumption will decrease in the following period. We show in
Appendix A.3 that this feature gives rise to asymmetric cycles similar to the one de-
                                 is high enough, and (ii)  2 (; (1 )=(r 1 )) for
picted in Fig. 12 whenever: (i) a
some  > 0. The logic of the proof can be extended to cycles with more than 3 states.

    3. Finite horizon does not eliminate cycles.—In contrasting our model to Holm-
ström’s benchmark, we have stressed that equilibrium uniqueness is not anymore
guaranteed. But one may argue that this distinction is not fundamental because it
stems from our focus on Markov equilibria. Although this requirement is implicitly
assumed in much, if not all, of the career concerns literature, there can be other so-
lutions if one allows for strategies that are not Markov. However, whenever the agent
  23
   See Fig. 4 in Jovanovic (2006) for a graphical distinction between the two types of asymmetry.
  24
   By contrast, asymmetric cycles with protracted slumps and sudden booms can be constructed
when the steady-state is inefficient, so that  > (1 )=(r 1 ).

has a finite horizon, backward induction bites and the equilibrium under risk neu-
trality is unique and deterministic. By contrast, multiple equilibria and reputation
cycles continue to arise in finite-horizon models with risk averse agents.25

    4. General equilibrium extension.—The mechanisms described in this paper fits
easily into a general equilibrium setting. Following the approach described in Jo-
vanovic and Prat (2016), one recovers the same incentive structure if firms operate
the technology described in (1) and if risk-averse households fully diversify their pur-
chases of goods over firms. The only fundamental difference is that cycles are now
in aggregate consumption. Hence the requirement that agents cannot smooth them
becomes equivalent to the assumption that the economy is closed with no access to
outside finance. Then the results on stability and cycles presented in Section 4 con-
tinue to hold in a macro setting. If anything, they hold more generally because the
representative family runs many firms and is insured against firm-level shocks. The
lack of idiosyncratic risk implies that deterministic equilibria are sustainable even
when there is a wealth effect, thus making it possible to consider utility function-
s outside of the CARA family. In Jovanovic and Prat (2016) we show that a calibrated
version of the macro model produces realistic fluctuations in terms of peak-to-trough
  25
    This is particularly simple to check
                                        when disutility

deterministic equilibrium if the horizon T and the upper bound a  of the action set are large enough.

7    Conclusion
We have shown that financial constraints can promote investment in reputation:
Cyclical paths entail higher earnings because average effort is higher. This contrasts
sharply with the findings reported in a host of papers that financial constraints in-
hibit tangible investment. It is likely, therefore, that when facing such constraints,
firms may substitute away from investing in physical capital and towards reputation
capital. The conditions under which this occurs are stated in Propositions 3 and 6,
and the calibrated parameter values satisfy them comfortably.
    We have also shown that cyclical effort paths generate unusual shocks to earnings
and can help explain the evidence on their dynamics. By generating a large switch in
effort, tail events in earnings growth emerge. The mechanism may not be the exact
reputational mechanism that our model generates, but we have shown that the main
alternative, learning by doing, is unlikely to be helpful in this regard. Instead one
may hope to improve the model’s fit further by embedding the reputation-concerns
mechanism into a standard model of income dynamics. As documented in GKOS,
such a richer model would include a mixture of autoregressive processes with differ-
ent degrees of persistence, along with transitory shocks and abrupt transitions cap-
turing the risk of non-employment.
    The model also offers a new perspective on changes in the volatility of income,
namely that a rise in income volatility could be the result of a rise in reputational
concerns that, in turn could be called by a reduction in the noise accompanying the
relation between effort and output. Agency theory suggests that a reduction in noise
raises the incentives to provide effort, and we have shown that this can also help
explain the rise in the volatility of earnings.

A.1 Proof of Proposition 1
We prove that, given the unique consumption function that satisfies the no-profit re-
quirement, the optimality of a conjectured deterministic profile can be established
by a first-order condition. In Holmström (1999) sufficiency of the necessary condi-
tion immediately followed from the linear impact of actions on payoffs. With concave
payoffs, we have to characterize the agent’s problem both on and off the equilibrium
path. Hence we consider arbitrary strategies and let  t  at at denote the devia-
tion from conjectured effort at each date. We wish to relate the agent’s and market’s
posteriors about , which we denote ma and m, respectively. Bayes rule implies that

It follows from (28) that mat = mt t : We can use this relationship to specify the
agent’s expectations about the law of motion of beliefs. First notice that yt mat =
t mat + at + "t . Since t mat is normally distributed with mean 0 and variance             2 ,
the innovation process from the agent’s standpoint is a normally distributed variable,

Given a deterministic profile fat g1

Proof. The lemma follows from the fact that the value function is of the form

The second equality follows reinserting our guess (32) and using the fact that at is de-
terministic and thus independent of m, while the third equality follows directly from
the Bellman equation (30) defining V . Since the functional equation is a contraction
mapping, the value function is unique and its policy function  (; t) identical across
all market’s beliefs m. Hence, the agent chooses a sequence of deterministic actions
that only depend on the cumulative stock of past deviations  and potentially on t.
In other words, optimal policies are deterministic on and off the equilibrium path.

    We are now in a position to prove Proposition 1. According to Lemma 1, there
is no loss of generality in focusing on sequences of deterministic actions. Let a 
fa0 ; a1 ; :::g denote a sequence of actions from date 0 onwards. Given that effort in
each period belongs to the feasibility set A  R+ , sequences are element of the infi-
nite Cartesian product A1 = f(at )1  t=0 jat 2 A for all t = 0; 1; :::g. The market belief can
be computed using the Bayesian map

where mt (a) is a shorthand version of mt (a; xa jm0 ) introduced in (33).26 Sufficiency of
the necessary condition will follow if we can prove that U(a) is a concave functional.
We establish an even stronger requirement as concavity holds in all periods. To see
why, let pt (a)  ct (a) g(at ) denote returns in period t, i.e., consumption net of the
disutility of effort. We have

       pt ( a1 + (1       )a2 ) = mt ( a1 + (1   )a2 ) + at g( a1t + (1     )a2t )
                                                                                                                  

                               = pt (a1 ) + (1          )pt (a2 );

for any 2 (0; 1) and all pair of sequences a1 ; a2 2 A1 . The first equality uses the
fact that the market conjecture at is deterministic. The second inequality holds true
because the disutility g is convex in a, while the Bayesian map for mt is linear in a,
so that mt ( a1 + (1      )a2 ) = mt (a1 ) + (1   )mt (a2 ). Per-period utility is given by
Ut (a) = (U  pt )(a), and since the composition of concave continuous functions is
itself concave, the strict concavity of U along with the convexity of A imply that

                         Ut ( a1 + (1       )a2 ) > Ut (a1 ) + (1                      )Ut (a2 );

    Since the innovation process xa and the prior m0 cannot be influenced by the agent, they can be
treated as exogenous when studying her optimal control problem.

Note that the inequality holds true because the only source of randomness is the in-
novation process xa defined from the agent’s standpoint so that its realizations are
by definition independent of a: We can therefore conclude that U is a strictly concave
functional in the space of action sequences. Thus any local maximum of U is also
a global maximum. A necessary condition for U to have a maximum at a is that its
Gateaux derivative dU(a ; h) = 0 for all h 2 A1 . The existence of the Gateaux deriva-
tive being guaranteed by the convexity of A1 , this requirement yields the necessary
FOC (11) which, by strict concavity of the objective, is also sufficient.

     cannot be satisfied. Intuitively, the costs  are so low that it is never optimal to
     set a = 0.

     whenever a      log(f (; r; ))=[ (1 )]. As for the second inequality, it follows
     from 1=S(   a)  1 that S(   a)  1  f (; r; ).

     S(a), is satisfied whenever a       log(f (; r; ))=[ (1 )]. The first inequality im-

    Propositions 3 and 4 focus on case 3. Since f (; r; ) is strictly decreasing in r,

S(a) > f (; r; ) for all r 2 r; 1 +      : Given that S( a) is increasing in and a  and
@f (; r; )=@r < 0, r must decrease when or a        increase in order to restore the equali-
ty f (; r; ) = S(
                   a). Note that when  " = 0, as in Proposition 3,  is also equal to 0 and
f (; r; 0) = =r. Then the condition f (; r; 0)  S(    a) is necessarily satisfied whenever
r 2 ( exp (     (1 ) a ) ; ), as stated in Proposition 3.

    Finally, we need to show that a^ = 0 is the unique rest point when  > (1 )=(r 1
). Set as = a ^ for all s  t in (11). The resulting incentive constraint reads  =
r (1  + ), a requirement that cannot be satisfied since we are focusing on cases
where  > (1 )=(r 1 ). Hence a      ^ > 0 cannot be incentive compatible as the agent
would like to deviate by investing less than a   ^, as shown in Fig. 13. However, such
                                     
deviations are not feasible when at = 0 for all t, and so a  ^ = 0 is indeed the only rest
point.


Proof. Proposition 5: We first prove that cycles can emerge solely if  " does not ex-
ceed a certain threshold. The first step consists in rewriting the necessary condition

                                                                                                  a) 1
                                    (r) S(
                                             a) +                   (r)        =                       +1 :
                                                                                  1 r          1 + r

The expression on the right-hand side is decreasing in  and converges to 0 as  goes
to 1. Hence there exists a  2 (0; 1) such that the necessary condition (37) is not
satisfied whenever  > : Given that  is strictly increasing in  " , and that it goes

whenever  " is greater than a certain value, which we denote by  " .
(i) Let’s now first consider cases where   r. If  = (r )=[r(1 )], the definition
of f in (39) implies that f (; r; ) = 1. Given that S(    a) is greater than 1, condition (39)
is necessarily satisfied and so  > (r )=[r(1 )]. Moreover, it follows from the
continuity of f and the proof of Proposition 4 that there exists a   (r )=[r(1 )]
                                                                                       
such that the necessary condition is sufficient and satisfied for all  2 ;  . Given

condition will be satisfied for all  2 0;  . Moreover, we have shown in Step 3 of
the proof of Proposition 4 that the necessary condition is also sufficient whenever
the rest point is inefficient, a property that is verified because  > r. Finally, using
once again the relationship between  " and , we conclude that two-period cycles
are sustainable if and only if  " 2 [0;  " ].

Proof. Proposition 6: We want to characterize deterministic dynamics near the rest
point a^. Let ' (at ) = at+1 denote the implicit map so that l (a) = h (' (a)), where
l (a)  g 0 (a) U 0 (a g (a)) and h (a)  rU 0 (a g (a)) [1  + g 0 (a)]. Differentiating
the incentive constraint (18) at the rest point, we find that

   The rest point a ^ is locally stable if j'0 (^

ways higher than the denominator, the stability condition can be satisfied solely if the
denominator is negative. Let us focus first on cases where the numerator is positive
while the denominator is negative. Then it is easy to verify that '0 (^     a) 2 ( 1; 0] when-

a condition that is always fulfilled when requirement (20) in Proposition 6 is satisfied.


   Proposition 7 can be proved in a similar way to Proposition 4. Thus we first use a
direct approach by changing variable and defining a new fixed point problem.

Lemma 2 Let
                                                          r (1 )
                                              a (s)              (r + s) ;
                                                          1 (r)2
2-period cycles are sustainable when the fixed point problem

                                                 U 0 (c(a(1=s))                     g(a(1=s)))
                                       s = (s)                                                                             (42)
                                                    U 0 (c(a(s))                    g(a(s)))

admits a solution s 6= 1.

Proof. Lemma 2: We focus on 2-period cycles and denote this period action by a, next
period by a0 ; the period after by a, and so on. In other words, we have the discount
factors from today til tomorrow and from tomorrow til the day after, respectively,

                                       s  U 0 (c(a0 )        g(a0 ))=U 0 (c(a)                 g(a));                      (43)
                                      s0  1=s (a; a0 ) :                                                                   (44)

Therefore, if we start at t = 0, so that a is the action at t = 0; 2; 4; 6::: and a0 the action
for t = 1; 3; 5; 7; :::; then the incentive constraint (10) is satisfied when (a; a0 ) solve the
following two equations

                                                                   44
These simplify to

                                                       1
                                             a=           r (r + s) ;                                  (45)
                                                  1 (r)2

                                             a0 =         r (r + s0 ) :                                (46)
                                                  1 (r)2

Thus there are 4 equations (43), (44), (45), and (46), and 4 unknowns, (a; a0 ; s; s0 ) : One
solution is (^
             a; a              ^ = (1 )=(r 1 ), which is a version of Holmström’s
                ^; 1; 1) where a
(1999) Proposition 1. Now let’s treat s as a parameter to begin with. Investment as a
function of s is given by

                               r(1 )                   0       r(1 )         1
                                                                                 
                     a (s) =           (r + s) ; and a   (s) =         r + s     :
                               1 (r)2                          1 (r)2

Thus our problem is equivalent to looking for a fixed point in s of the function                          (s)
defined in (42).

Proof. Proposition 7: Since U (c) = exp( c), it follows from the definition in (42)
                                         2
of () that (1) = 1: Let s  2 1r(1(r)

                                           r; since c (               s) 2 (0; 1), we have
                                                        s) = 0 and c (1=
   s) < 1. By continuity of the mapping (), there will be a fixed point s 2 (1; s) if
  (
 0
   (1) > 1: Differentiating (), we obtain
                                                                                                          

     (s) =       1     a(s) +                                 exp      a(s)                 a(1=s)                   ;

and so
                                     0                               r (1 )

                                                                                1
This expression can be simplified as a(1) = a
                                            ^ = (1                      )=(r       ) so that

                                           r (1 )       a
                                                         ^      a(1)
                                                  2 =        =        :                                 (47)

Reinserting this equality into the previous equation we get

                                     0
                                         (1) > 1 , 2 [1      a(1)] a(1) > 1 + r;

which implies in turn that
                                      1
                                    a(1)

                                                                2 ( 1; 1) :

                                                (1    a(1))

This allows us to conclude that the rest point is stable since equation (40) with quadrat-

A.3 Asymmetric cycles.
Proposition 8 derives conditions under which cycles of period 3 can be constructed
using the partial equilibrium model with linear costs described in Subsection 3. It
focuses on asymmetric cycles with protracted booms and sudden busts. The logic
of the proof can be applied to study reverse cases and to show that cycles with pro-
tracted slumps and sudden booms can be sustained when  > (1 )=(r 1 ).
Furthermore, it is cumbersome but relatively straightforward to extend the proof so
as to construct cycles with more than 3 states.

Proposition 8 Consider the partial equilibrium model with CARA utility and linear
costs, i.e., g(a) = a. Assume that  satisfies the compatible conditions
                                                                 

Proof. Proposition 8: We propose a constructive proof. We study each action in turn
and prove their incentive compatibility

  1. at = a
           : Since we are focusing on cases where  < r(1                                      )=(1    r), we have
                                        1
                        1              X                     1             X

                                                                 

     The last inequality follows from the definition of S() in (36) because a    at+i
                         a at+i )  1, with strict inequality for some i. Since the last
     for all i, and so S(
     expression in (49) measures the discounted returns from effort at date t, the
     feasibility constraint binds and at = a
                                             is indeed incentive compatible.

  2. at = 0: At the lower-bound of the feasibility set, costs must exceed returns so

     The last equality follows from the fact that the incentive constraint must hold
     with equality in the next period because at+1 = a  ~ 2 (0; a

     The first inequality follows from step 1 above, while the second one holds true
     because  < r(1 )=(1 r). It shows that S (~      a a ) has to be inferior to one,
     thus requiring that a be strictly larger than a
                                                    ~. Keeping a

     tiating (51) with respect to a, we find that returns are strictly decreasing in a.

     there exists a unique value, which we denote a                    ~=a

     This inequality is equivalent to  > r2 (1 )= [1 + r (r)2 ], which yields a
     lower-bound that is inferior to the term on the right-hand side of (48) as well
     as to r(1 )=(1 r). Hence the two conditions in (48) are compatible since
     they define a non-empty interval. As with period-2 cycles, low levels of effort
     can never be incentive compatible when costs are too small.

    We still have to prove that our cycles are sustainable when a    > a min . Differenti-
ating (51) with respect to both a  and a~, one finds that @~
                                                            a=@a 2 (0; 1). The derivative
being positive, a ~>a         >a
                      ~min if a min , and the condition (50) for incentive compatibility
    
of at = 0 is satisfied. Furthermore, the derivative being smaller than one ensures that
a
~ remains within the interior of the feasible set as a increases.

                                                                                      (55)
                                      U (c(a (s))     g(a (s)))
admits a solution s 6= 1, stochastic cycles where effort switches with probability     2
(0; 1) from a (s) to a
                      (s), or from a
                                     (s) to a (s), are sustainable

Proof. Proposition 9: Let s = U 0 (c(    a) g( a))=U 0 (c(a) g(a)) denote the discount
factor when effort switches from a to a   . Then the recursive incentive constraint (18)
is satisfied when the effort pair (a; a
                                      ) solves the following system of equations

                   a = r [(1       ) (1     + a) + s (1             + 
                                                                          a)] ;
                                                           1
                                                                              
                   a
                    = r (1        ) (1     + 
                                                a) + s          (1      + a) :

Combining the two equations above yields (53) and (54). As expected, when             = 1,
we recover the expressions (45) and (46) in Lemma 2.
