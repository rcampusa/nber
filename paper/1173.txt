Exchange Rate Dynamics with Sluggish Prices under Alternative Price—
                          Adjustment Rules




                                ABSTRACT

    This paper studies exchange rate behavior in models with moving long-

run equilibria incorporating alternative price—adjustment mechanisms.

The paper demonstrates that price—adjustment rules proposed by Mussa and

by Barro and Grossman yield models that are empirically indistinguishable

from each other. For speeds of goods—market adjustment that are "too

fast," the Barro—Grossman rule appears to induce instability; but we

argue   that when the rule   is interpreted properly, models incorporating

it are dynamically stable regardless of the speed at which disequilibrium

is eliminated. The Barro—Grossman pricing scheme is shown to be a

natural generalization, to a setting of moving long—run equilibria, of

less versatile schemes proposed in earlier literature on exchange rate

dynamics.

                           1. INTRODUCTION

       Recent research on the asset—market approach to exchange rates has

incorporated short—run Keynesian price rigidities into models assuming

rational expectations. These sticky-price models generally exhibit classical

properties in the long run, but allow for temporary goods—market disequilibrium

in response to real and monetary shocks that are less than perfectly anticipated.

A critical element in these models is the techanism determining how domestic

goods prices adjust over time in response both to current disequilibrium

and to expectations of future events.

       In his seminal paper on exchange—rate determination with sticky

domestic prices, Dornbusch [19761 assumed that the nominal price of domestic

output is a predetermined variable that moves in response to current goods—

market disequilibrium only. Mussa [1977, 1982.] has criticized the simple

Dornbusch adjustment rule as being inadequate in situations where future

disturbances are anticipated or where the long—run equilibrium of the economy

moves over time. Frankel [1979], Liviatan [1980), and Buiter and Miller

[1981, 19821 introduce trend inflation into the Dornbusch model by linking

price adjustment to the underlying (constant) money growth rate in addition

to direct goods—market pressure. An alternative price—adjustment scheme

allowing for very general moving long—run equilibria is derived by Mussa [19811.

       The paper compares the price—adjustment rule of Mussa [19811 to a

rule advanced by Barro and Grossman [19761 in a closed—economy context. The

interest of the Barro—Grossnian rule is twofold. First, like Mussa's rule,

that of Barro and Grossman is appropriate in models with anticipated future

 disturbances or nonstationary long—run equilibria. Second, the Barro—Grossinan

 rule contains the rules of Dornbusch, Frankel, Liviatan, and Buiter and

 Miller as special cases, and thus has an intuitive interpretation.

          The paper's central result is that the Mussa and Barro—Grossman

 rules, though apparently quite dissimilar, yield structurally equivalent ex-

 change rate models.' Thus, despite the key role of disequilibrium price

 dynamics, the choice between the two adjustment mechanisms is not necessarily

a critical one.                   I




                   2. THE LIMITING    FLEXIBLE—PRICE MODEL


         The dynamics of a sticky—price exchange rate model with rational
 expectations can be decomposed Into two components. The first   component

 Is   caused by the system's adjustment to current disequilibrium. The second
 component is caused by movement of the equilibrium that would obtain if all
 prices were fully flex.tble.-' Perfectly predictable trend movements in


2/ The models explored below assume that agents have perfect foresight, but

the structural equivalence result would carry over to an explicitly stochastic

environment such as the one assumed by Mussa [1982). In a stochastic setting,

structural equivalence is the same as econometric observational equivalence.

The "perfect foresight" assumption allows for the initial arrival of previously

unanticipated Information concerning the future paths of relevant exogenous var-

iables. After the initial moment, however, agents' expectations are fulfilled.

 3/ Even if prices are flexible and exogenous variables are stationary,
dynamics may arise from the adjust*ents of nonmonatary asset stocks to
long—run desired levels, as in Kouri (1976]. The class of models studied

in this paper abstracts from the dynamics of asset accumulation. For an

analysis of asset accumulation in a sticky—price model, see Henderson (1980].

the money supply or in the equilibrium terms of trade, for example, cause

no disequilibrium in a well—specified model, but do induce movements of the

system. In this section, we focus on the second source of dynamics by

solving a standard exchange rate model under the temporary assumption that

domestic prices are fully flexible, or, alternatively, that all movements

in the exogenous variables affecting the economy are perfectly anticipated.

The equilibrium path of this flexible—price model provides a limiting

benchmark for the sticky—price models analyzed later. This benchmark is

a natural generalization of the fixed tIloag_nU equilibrium appearing in

sticky—price models whose exogenous variables are static except for one-

time unexpected jumps.

      The exchange—rate model used here is of the extended small—country

variety, and is based on work of Dornbusch [1976] and Mussa [1977, l982].-"

It is described by the following equations:


(1)       — ctp — (1 —   c)e   = — Xr + iy                       (money demand)


(2)    r =   r*   ÷ è                                            (uncovered interest parity)


       d =    e     — p + u) —   a[r   — cq —   (1 — a)éJ + yy   (aggregate demand)


(4)    m' = m                                                    (money—market equilibrium)


(5)    yd =   y                                                  (goods—market equilibrium)


Ree, p is the logaitlmi of the money price of domestically—produced goods;

e is the logarithm of the exchange rate (defined as the domestic—currency

price of foreign currency); and r is the domestic nominal interest rate.

Dots over variables indicate rates of change.-' The remaining variables

5/ Unless otherwise stated, these rates of change are right—hand derivatives.

are exogenous: in is the         logarithm   of the nominal money 8upply;    is the

share of home goods in the domestic consumer price index; y is the logarithm

of the flow of perishable home output; r* is the nominal interest rate on

foreign—currency bonds; and u is a shock to foreign demand for domestic

output.     CL   is   assumed to be fixed, and y and r* are assumed to be fixed and

equal to zero. The exegenous foreign—currency price of imports is likewise

assumed to be constant, with its natural loqarithm normalized to zero.

          The model assumes rational expectations; this amounts to perfect

foresight in the absence of unanticipated shocks. Thus, there is no

distinction between actual and anticipated rates of change of e and p.

Equation (1) is the money—demand schedule, which relates the demand for

price—index deflated nominal balances to the home interest rate and income.

Equation (2) reflects the assumption that home—currency and foreign—

currency bonds are perfect substitutes. Equation (3) is the aggregate—

demand schedule, which posits that damand for domestic output depends on

the terms of trade, taates (as represented by u), the real rate of interest,

and income. Finally equations (4) and (5) require continuous clearing

of both the money and goods markets. Condition (5), which entails full

flexibility of domestic prices, will be relaxed in subsequent sections.

          The flex—price equilibrium values of the exchange rate and domestic

output price are denoted by          and .     Following   Sargent and Wallace [1973],

we close the model with the assumption that the economy must always lie on

its unique conditionally stable saddlepath1 As the appendix shows, the


6/ In sodel5 with a well—defined stationary long—run equilibrium, the

saddlepath is the unique path converging to long—run equilibrium and thus

is the unique path implying nonexplosive behavior for the economy. Saddlepoint

stability results from the self—fulfilling nature of rational expectations.

depend on the future expected paths of money and the autonomous component

of aggregate demand. Note that monetary factors affect                         and    by equal

amounts, whereas demand shifts affect these variables differentially in

general. Thus, while real shocks must be accommodated by shifts in the

flex—price real exchange rate                         —            depends exclusively on

factors that shift aggregate demand yd,and not on money. In the flex—price

model set out here, there is a complete dichotomy between real and monetary

phenomena. This classical dichotomy would disappear, for example, if real

balances m —              — (1 —         were an additional argument in the aggregate

effects.

Whether there is a stationary long—run equilibrium or a moving long—run
equilibrium, the saddlepath can be defined as the unique path of the

economy along which prices do not depend in part on pure speculative

"bubbles" unrelated to actual market conditions. The appendix discusses

the mathematical implementation of this definition in the present context.

Laplace transform technique is a convenient one for rational—expectations

models, although other solution techniques are available.

       3.    STICKY DOMESTIC PRICES AND ALTERNATIVE PRICE—ADJUSTMENT RULES

            When   the   price of domestic output is sticky, the goods—market clearing

condition (5) need not hold. Following Dornbusch [1976], we assume that the

domestic output price is a predetermined or nonjumping variable that adjusts

gradually to eliminate goods-market disequilibrium. Dornbusch, who assumes that

the exogenous variables are constant except for one—time unanticipated jumps,

postulates the following price—adjustment scheme:

                    d
 (8)        p=Tr(y —y).

While specification (8) is entirely appropriate given the environment

Dornbusch assumes, it may become inappropriate once anticipated shocks or

trend movements in exogenous variables are introduced.'

            Gray and Turnovsky [19791 and Wilson [1979] use the Dornbusch model

with adjustment rule (8) to analyze a one—time anticipated increase in

the money supply. The solution these authors derive is qualitatively

sensible when the disturbance is expected to occur in the near future, but

problems arise when (8) is used to study money shocks that are anticipated

long before they occur. To see this, consider the economy's behavior as

the date of the future money increase recedes infinitely far into the

future. As the adjustment period preceding the intended policy act grows

longer, the disequilibrium caused by the announcement of that act should

disappear. In the limit of a perfectly anticipated money—stock increase ——

one that is anticipated "infinitely far" in advance —— the domestic output

price and the exchange rate should rise gradually and in proportion toward

the long—run equilibrium levels associated with the post—disturbance stock

!/ Mussa [1982] has emphasized these problems.
                                 —7—




of money.' However, this equilibrium scenario is impossible with adjustment—

rule (8), because the price level cannot rise in the absence of excess

demand. Even perfectly anticipated money shocks must cause goods—market

disequilibrium.•

        Similar difficulties surround the Frankel [19791, Liviatan [1980],

and Buiter—Miller [1981, 1982) extensions of Dornbusch's price—adjustment




 9 Prices naturally exhibit this behavior in the flex—price model of the

previous section. When the money shock is expected to occur in finite

time and prices are flexible, the domestic output price and exchange rate,

after an initial equiproportionate jump when the announcement is made, rise

smoothly and in proportion so that the economy is at its long—run equilibrium

when the money supply increases. This type of adjustment to imperfectly

anticipated shocks is impossible in the sticky—price setting, but it is

still true that, after the initial announcement, price evolve smoothly.

In particular, the exchange rate cannot jump when the expected money

increase takes place, for an anticipated discrete jump would entail an

unexploited opportunity to earn an infinite instantaneous rate of return

on foreign bonds.


10/ To be precise, the problems with the Gray—Turnovsky and Wilson analyses

are not caused exclusively by the price—adjustment scheme these authors adopt.

An additional source of nonneutrality is their assumption that aggregate

demand is a function of the nominal, rather than the real, domestic interest

rate. It is easy to see that in a well—specified model, the nominal

interest rate would rise over time during the adjustment to a perfectly

anticipated money increase while the real interest rate would remain constant.
                                          —8—




rule   to   environments of secular inflation." These authors modify (8)

by adding to the excess demand term the current rate of nominal money

 growth. The resulting adjustment rule is


 (9      p=r(y —y)+m.

 Specification (9) is consistent with an assumption that all changes in the

monetary growth rate are unanticipated. But the rule implies unreasonable

asymptotic behavior when anticipated changes are analyzed. Consider, for

 example, a perfectly anticipated increase in the monetary growth rate. With

higher trend nney growth, long—run in — p is lower. Thus, a perfectly

anticipated money—growth increase should cause m — p to decline over time

but should not occasion disequilibrium. Becanse p is predetermined, however,

 rule (9) implies that in — p can fall over time only if the announcement of

 the future increase in th    creates   an excess demand for output that does

 not vanish as the date of the increase becomes infinitely distant.

         While the price—adjustment rules described. so far are unsatisfactory

 in many situations, a generalization which contains these rules as special

 cases is adequate for the analysis of any type of disturbance. Assume

 now that       is a function not only of current disequilibrinm, but also of

 the rate at which the price of domestic output would increase if that price were




jJj    Like   Dornbusch [1976], section V, Buiter and Miller analyze a nx,del

 in which output is demand—determined and therefore endogenous. In that

 model, the disequilibrium term entering their price adjustment rule

 depends on the difference between actual output and full—employment

 potential output. Our analysis applies with only minor modifications to

 variable—output models; see footnote 15 below.

fully flexible. The resulting price adjustment scheme is


 (10)
        •
            = (d -   )   +


where       is the flex—price equilibrium output price discussed in the previous

section. This type of pricing rule is suggested by Barro and Grossman [1976]

in a closed—economy setting, although they do not assume rational expectations

regarding           It is easy to see that the Barro—Grossman rule reduces to

Dornbusch's rule (8) when the exogenous variables are fixed except for

unanticipated jumps, for in that case,       =   0.   Similarly, the rule reduces

to (9) when the only expected change in the exogenous variables is the

growth of money at a constant rate. However, the rule does not rednce to

Dornbusch's rule (8) in the case of the one—time expected money increase

analyzed by Gray and Turnovsky [1979] and by Wilson 11979]. If it is

announced at time t = 0 that the money stock will increase by an amount

m at time t = T, then        = (1/X)Am exp[(t —   T)/X]   >   0 or O t < T.

        That the Barro—Grossman rule is immune to the criticisms levelled

at rules (8) and (9) is clear. Perfectly anticipated shocks —— whether

real or nominal —— do not cause disequilibrium when price adjustment is

given by (10).      Since the equilibrium flexible—price        does not jump

discontinuously at any point in response to a change announced "infinitely

far" In advance, p will fully trace its movements under (10).

        Mussa [1977, l982J suggests an alternative rule, and demonstrates

that it, too, renders disequilibrium price adjustment unnecessary when

shacks are perfectly anticipated. The Mussa rule is given by


(11)

where p is defined as the domestic output price that would clear the goods

market given the actual (possibly disequilibrium) values of the endogenous

variables e, p, r, &, and   .   More formally, p is defined by the condition

                                               —   (1   a)é].

The difference between p and     deserves emphasis.      is the output ptice

that would prevail in a hypothetical Walrasian general equilibrium with

fully flexible prices. p is the output price that would clear tha goods

market given current levels of the sticky—price system's endogenous variables.

       Alternative microeconomic rationales f or the Mussa price—adjustment

rule are presented in McCallum [1980], Mussa (19811, and Flood [1982b].

Mussa's derivation, for example, assumes monopolistic firms for whom price

changes are costly. Flood's inventory—adjustment story assumes that firms
                                                                13/
set their prices a period in advance of market transactions.—

       The Barro—Grossman rule (10) and the Mussa rule (11) appear quite

unrelated, and It is natural to ask how these different price—adjustment

schemes affect the dynamic behavior of the economy. We address this question

in the next section by comparing explicit solutions of models incorporating

the two rules.


13/ Flood's justification of the Mussa rule is based on work of Green

and Laf font [1981]. Rotemberg [19811 points out some limitations of

Mussa's [1981] rationale.

   Grossman and Mussa pricing rules:

       is satisfied,      the Barro—Grossman price adjustment scheme (10) and the Mussa

   models.

 for    when e is so chosen, —0q = r2 [cf. (15)]. The two models are therefore

     structurally equivalent.

              It is important to note that the theorem holds only along the

 saddlepath. The models are not            structurally equivalent elsewhere.

              When condition (13) is violated (as it necessarily is for r sufficiently

large), the model with the Barro—Grossman adjustment rule has two characteristic roots

with positive real part. Sadalepath stability requires that a negative root

be associated with each predetermined variable in the model; and because p

is predetermined, a rational—expectations equilibrium will not exist in

general when (13) fails and the model is •unstable.-' In contrast, the

Mussa rule necessarily yields saddlepath stability for any nonnegative

values of the system's parameters; and as the speed—of-adjustment parameter

0 + -fco, the Mussa model converges smoothly to the flex-price model. It

seems worri&ome, at first glance, that under the Barro—Grossman rule, the

economy becomes unstable and does not converge to the flex—price model as

ii   ÷ +cx.    We will argue shortly that when the price adjustment Implied by

the Barro—Grosstnan mechanism is interpreted properly, (13) always holds

and this apparent convergence problem disappears.


14, The instability is due to the fact that when (13) does not hold, a

positive shock to aggregate demand (an increase in u) leads, ceteris

paribus, to falling prices.

              The following result makes apparent the essential reason for the

 two models' structural equivalence:


 COROLLARY. Along the saddlepath of the Mussa model, the output price p

 obeys a differential equation having the same form as the Barro—Grossnian

 equation (10). More precisely, along the saddlepath of the Mussa model,

                               d —

may     use    (3) to write excess demand in the Mussa model as

model,

Equations         (20) and (21) together imply that

Combining (22) and (23) yields

       The foregoing corollary shows why the Mussa model is necessarily

saddlepath stable. Although prices in   that   model do adjust according

to a Barro—Grossman—type rule, the model can never be unstable because,

by (19), the stability criterion


(25) l—&a>O

is always satisfied [cf. equation (13)]. By assuming the Mussa rule, we

effectively limit the parameter ó to values between 0 (0        0) and l/c&a (0 m -f0).

Even though the Nussa rule places an upper bound on the excess—demand coefficient

6 appearing in (18), there is no upper bound on the speed at which goods—

market disequilibrium is eliminated. As was pointed out above, the Mussa

model converges to the equilibrium flex—price model as 0 --     -f and S       1/acT.


       A consequence of these findings is that the speed of goods—market

adjustment under the Barro—Grossman rule (10) becomes infinite as ii -- 1/acT.

Accordingly, that rule yields a saddlepoint—stable model for              speed of

goods—market adjustment. Contrary to appearances, the stability condition

(13) does not limit one to adjustment speeds which are not too great.—
                                                                               l5

15/ The isomorphism results presented here are readily extended to

variable—output versions of the exchange rate model, like that of Büiter

and Miller [1981, 1982 1 and those compared by Flood [1982a 1. The stability

condition when the Barro—Grossman mechanism is used is slightly more complicated

in the variable-output case if money demand depends on actual output.

The stability criterion, in that case, is X(1 —   y)   + cxaP— ArracT >   0.
Otherwise, the isomorphism between variable—output models incorporating

the Barro—Grossman rule and those incorporating the Mussa rule can be

proved as in the text.

                            5. CONCLUSION

        This paper has studied the consequences of adopting alternative

 sticky—price adjustment rules in exchange rate models characterized by

moving long—run equilibria. A price—adjustment scheme suggested by Barro

and Grossman 119761 in a different context was shown to be a natural general-

 ization of less versatile price—adjustment schemes advanced by Dornbusch [1976],

 by Frankel [19791, by Liviatan [1980], and by Buiter and Miller [198l,j 1982].

It was also demonstrated that use of the Barro—Grossman rule results in an

exchange rate model that is structurally equivalent to one based on the

apparently quite different price—adjustment rule proposed by Mussa [1977,

1982]. The choice between the Barro—Grossman and Mussa rules is therefore

not critical for many theoretical and empirical applications.—
                                                          16 /
                                                               Unlike the

simpler price—adjustment rules used in earlier studies, either yields

sensible results for     expected path of the exogenous variables driving

the system.




16/ As Lucas [1976] argues, changes of policy regime could alter the

parameters appearing in the two rules. In some cases it mar be easier

to model this possibility using the Mussa rule, which at present has a

somewhat better—developed microeconomic rationale.

       This       appendix calculates explicit solution paths for the flexible—price

exchange rate model and the two sticky—price models discussed in the text.

These rational—expectations models are solved by the method of Laplace

transforms, which is equivalent to the operator solution procedure described

by Sargent [l979J..i The Laplace transform of a function                                    is defined by


(Al)   L(f t ) =        I0 exp(—9t)f dt,
and is a function of 2.21 The key theorem invoked belo!1 is that a

continuous function is uniquely determined on (0, co) by its Laplace transform

(see Sokolnikoff and Redheffer 11966]). It is easy to verify that: (1)

L(•) is linear; (ii) L(ft) =                         —             (iii) L(f)L(g) = L(
                                            £L(ft)       f0;
These three properties will be used repeatedly in what follows.


1. The Flex—Price Model

       The flex—price model may be written in the form


(A2)         =    [(1 — a)/A1e + (c/A)p              —

(A3) may be written in matrix notation as

1/ The advantages of the Laplace transform method are that                                 it   is completely

algorithmic and that it produces solutions which are expressed in terms of the

state variables' initial positions.

2/ The transform is defined only for 2. such that the integral in (Al) converges.

Equation (A8) expresses the path of the exchange rate as a function of its

own initial value (e0) and the initial value of the price of domestic output

assumption, which requires that the coefficients of the explosive "bubble"

terms, exp(t/X) and exp(u)t), be zero (see Sargent and Wallace [1973]). The

requirement that the economy be on its saddlepath implies [by (A8)] that

                          :                     exp(-As)u5ds,


where a tilde denotes a saddlepath equilibrium value for the flex—price

model. Combining (A8), (A9), and CAb), we obtain the rational—expectations

 equilibrium value of the exchange rate


(All)    a    =/
             t At exp[(t-s)/Xlm                 S
                                                    ds +
                                                             —Jtf{exp[(t—s)/Al          —   exp[w(t-s]}u Sds.


 A derivation similar to the foregoing shows that the flex—price equilibrium

 domestic output price can be written as
                                               -A4-




                                               l—A()t7 exp[(t—s)/X]uS
              =                ds          +                          ds

              +      .
                         —

                             a) — Xo]    f exp[u.(t—s))uds.

        According to (All) and (A12), the flex—price exchange rate and

domestic output price depend both on future expected monetary disturbances

(represented by n) and future expected real disturbances (represented by

u). However the flex—price real exchange rate ,                   defined   as   —

is   given by


(Al3)         =   - I exp[(t — s)]u9ds.
The real exchange rate thus depends exclusively on current and anticipated

future real shocks; it is not influenced by monetary factors. Expression

(A13) reflects the real—monetary dichotomy that characterizes the flex—price

exchange—rate model.


2. Sticky Prices and the Barro—Grossman Adjustment Rule

        To introduce sticky prices and the Barro—Grossman adjustment scheme,

assume that the domestic ouput price is a predetermined variable and replace

the goods—market equilibrium condition (A3) with the equation


(A14)         =
                  'ir[4(e
                             —
                                 Pt
                                      + u) —          — )]   +


where         again represents the flex—price equilibrium output price derived

in the previous section. Equilibrium e and Pt in the present model

satisfy (A2) and (A14), while                   and    satisfy (A2) and (A3). It follows

that under the Barro—Grossman price dynamics, the exchange rate and output
                                                          -A5--




price obey the equations


(A15) é = [(1         —   ct)/X}e' +


(A16)
            =   TT[(e'     —   p')      —                 —




where e E
             e    —        and
                                   p.
                                                 —
                                                                  Equations (A15) and (A16),

wFen combined, yield

              — ct(l —
    • = [X,i x(l
A17 t.           —                               e
                                                      ,       (Air   + ct2Tra)
                                                              X(l — rrcta)       Pt.


Together (A15)     and     (All)     dascribe              an autonomous differential equation system

in e and p.
         The characteristic roots of that system, Ti1 and ri2, are given by


                      -[Xu+1rca-(l-ct)]{[X$+1Tca-(1-a)]2÷
                                     -                      $
         1' 2                  2X(1 —       rrctcY)
                                                        (1 —
                                                                             4X2(1      ,)2
                                                                                                       rrca)

Provided that the condition 1 — irco > 0 is met,                                   > 0 and Ti2 < 0, as required

for saddlepath stability when one of the two endogenous variables is predetermined.

By imposing the requirement that the economy be on the stable saddlepath,

we obtain the rational—expectations solution


(A18)    e = [(1
                —(p0 —
                   —      )    —
                                   Xr2]
                                             exp(n2t) +



(A19) 1'        (p0 —     )     exp(r2t) +


According to (A18) and (A19), e and Pt converge to their flex—price
values      and       at a rate given by Iri2I. At any point, the deviation

of actual e or Pt from Its flex—price value is proportional to the initial

discrepancy between the predetermined initial output price p0 and its

flex—price level p0 given by (AlO). If there is no disequilibrium initially,
                                                          -A6-



 a divergence between p0 and p0 can arise only as the result of previously

 unanticipated information arriving at time t = 0.

 3. Sticky Prices and the Mussa Adjustment Rule

        The Mussa model results from replacing (A14) by the price—adjustment

 rule


(A20)           =
                    O(e_         Pt + u) -                    -       +


where p is defined by the condition

(A21) (et —                 + u) — ocY(é            —   ) = 0.
 If we differentiate (A21) and substitute the result into (A20), we obtain


(A22)        =
                    O[4(e
                                —
                                    Pt
                                         ÷
                                             Ut)
                                                   —          —        ÷    +     —
                                                                                      (l/)( j)
                                                                                             —



 (recall    that W /uct). Using the definition of the real exchange rate,
        e   —
                p,      we may rewrite (A22) as a single, second—order differential
equation        in

(A23) q —           (iY(l   —             —            = w04u     +
                                Occy)c

Even though the level of                           depends on the initial sticky nominal price of

domestic goods, the adjustnnt law for                                 involves real factors only.

        The model consisting of (A2) and (A22) will be solved in three steps.

 First, (A23) will be solved to obtain the rational—expectations path of

 the real exchange rate                            Second, equation (A2), rewritten as


                =    (l/X)e         —              —
(A24)                                   (ct/A)q        m/X,

will be used in conjunction with the solution for                                to obtain the path

 of e and the initial values e0 and q0. Third, the identity Pt e —

will    be used to derive the path of the domestic output price.
                                                      -A7-



        The Laplace transform, applied to (A23), yields the equation

                       4    + (2. — + 04)q + tOq + 2,)L(u            )
                 —
                                     (2. + 9) (2. —


 Equation   (A25) is based on the normalization u0 =                     0.   After partial—

 fraction expansion, (A25) becomes


                 = —(______                ____      40+eqq0                     ____
        L(q)           +             e        + oq +  w + e         +wL(u)][j      —   1.
 The Laplace transform theorem now implies that

                                                                                   t
(A26)       = —(______ exp(—Ot) + 40+Oq0 )                         expt)      + w I
                  +            o    ÷                                                  exp[w(t—s)]u5ds

                           —
            = —(
                               oYq                       40+Oq0 + 7
                           +       )   exp(—04t) + [(      +   ) w exp(-s)udsJ exp(wt)

            —    f exp[ci(t
                   t
                                       —   s)]uSds

        The saddlepath assumption requires that the coefficient of exp(wt)

 in (A26) be zeros Thus,                     and q0 must satisfy the relation



(A27)       —Wq0 =         —((ii   + 04)[q0 + t       I exp(-.ws)uds].
Combining (A13), (A26), and (A27), we find that

            =          —
(A28)           (q0        ) exp(—Ot)           + 4t


The effect of Mussats price—adjustment mechanism is to drive the real
exchange    rate toward its                flex—price level at a rate given      by 0.
        To solve for                   we write (A24) in terms of deviations from flex—price

equilibrium values,
                                                  -A8-




(A29) ê = (l/X)e — (c/A)q

 where   e e —                 as before and q            —    . Differentiation   of (A28)

 gives


(A30) 4 = — Oq

 The characteristic roots of the autonomous system described by (A29) and

 (A30) are clearly 1/A and —O .                   Imposition   of the saddlepath assumption

 leads to the exchange rate solution

                      —
                  (q0
(A3l)    e =      (1 + X04)      exp(— 04t) +


         The initial values e0 and q0 may be recovered from (A31), given

                                               = 0 gives
 p0. Substituting e0 — p0 for q0 and setting t

                   —(p0 —
              =                           +
(A32)    e0       [(1 — c) + X04]

                   —(p0
                          —
                                 (1 + XOc)
              =                               +
(A33)    q0         [(1   —      + xoq]



Thus, (A28) may       be      written as

                      —            + AO)
(A34)
              =
                    [(1   —   )+   AO]
                                              exp(—04t) +


while    (A31) takes the form

                           —
(A35)    e = [(1     —    a +             exp(—Oqt) +
                                      -A9-



        The path of the domestic output price Pt is readily derived from

 (A34) and (A35). It is given by



(A36) Pt = (p0
                 —
                     ) exp(—et)   +


 In   the wake of an unanticipated disturbance, the sticky price of domestic

 goods converges to its flex—price value at a rate given by 04.
