                 NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE REVISITED




                              ABSTRACT

     This paper explains why one in seven Americans has no health
insurance, and compares the casualty and the social insurance
models of health insurance. The paper discusses the relationship

among national health insurance (NHI), the cost of care, and the

health of the population, and it considers the prospects for NHI

in the United States in the short and the long run. Four

explanations for the absence of NHI in the United States --

distrust   of government, heterogeneity of the population, a robust
voluntary sector, and lack of noblesse oblige --   are   evaluated in

the light of recent political, social, and economic trends.

                     NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE REVISITED

                                Victor R. Fuchs



      Proposals for national health insurance (NHI) are once again making the

headlines, as they have periodically in the United States since World War 1.1

The advocates of NHI have, as always, diverse goals: to increase access for

millions of Americana who do not have health insurance; to stem the rapid

escalation in the coat of care; to improve the health of the population and

reduce socioeconomic differentials in life expectancy. Vigorous opposition to

NHI is also not a new phenomenon. Insurance companies, physicians, and others

directly involved in the health field see it as a threat to their roles and

interests; in addition, many Americans with no direct involvement oppose

expanaion of government on general principles. The huge hudget deficit

contributes to the difficulty of enacting a major new domestic program, in

health or any other area.

      How and when will the current debate over health policy be resolved?

Fifteen years ago I discussed the popularity of NHI around the world and

offered four reasons why the United States was the last major holdout.2 They

were: diatrust of government; heterogeneity of the population; a robust

voluntary sector; and less sense of noblesse oblige. In this paper I consider

whether these explanations are as relevant today as in the past. First,

however, I diacuss aeveral issues that help to put the NHI controversy in

clearer perspective. Why are so many Americana uninsured? How do conflicting

views of health insurance shape attitudes toward NHI? What ia the connection

between NHI and the coat of care? Would NHI do much to reduce socioeconomic

differentials in health?
The Uninsured

      With some exceptions such as Medicare, health insutance in the United

States is a private, voluntary matter. The demand for insurance, like the

demand for any good or service, depends on the consumer's ability and

willineness to pay for it. Some of the uninsured cannot afford health

insurance; othets are unwilling to acquire it. In all, they can be grouped

into six categories.

      1. The poor. The largest group of uninsured consists of individuals

and families whose low income makes it unfessible for them to acquire

insurance, either on their own or as a condition of employment. About one in

five have no connection with the work force, but nearly 80% are either

employed or are the dependents of employed persons.3 The HIAA estimates that

31% of these workers earned less than $10,000 in 1989; snother estimate puts

the figure at 63%. Tn any case, it is clear that the great majority of

uninsured workers cannot afford to give up a substantial fraction of their

wages in order to obtain health insurance.

      Most uninsured workers are employed in small firms, but the frequently

heard explanation, "Small employers can't afford health insurance," is as

misleading as the phrase "employer-provided health insurance." Employers

don't bear the cost of health insurance; workers do, in the form of lower

wages or foregone other benefits. A more sccurste description of the problem

would be "many workers in small firms can't afford health insurance."    Note

that lawyers, accountants, computer consultants, and other highly paid

professionals organized in small firms usually have health insursnce, although

they often face extrs costs as discussed below.
                                                                                 3

      2. The sick and disabled. Many men and women who are not poor are

still unable to afford health insurance because they have special health

problems and therefore face very high premiums or are excluded from some

coverage entirely.

      3. The "difficult". Some individuals are neither poor nor sick, but

have difficulty obtaining insurance at average premiums. They may be self-

employed, work in small firms, or are out of the labor force entirely. In

order to reach and service such individuals, insurance companies incur

abnormally high sales and administrative coats. They also encounter the

problem of adverse aelection: if an insurance company offers a policy to

individuals or small groups at an average premium, those who expect to use a

great deal of medical care are likely to buy, and those who do not will

refrain from buying.

      4. The low users. Some people don't expect to use much medical care.

They may be in particularly good health; they may dislike going to physicians;

or, like Christian Scientists, they may not believe in the efficacy of medical

care. For them, health insurance is a "bad buy" unless they can acquire it at

a below-average premium.

      5. The eamblers. Most people buy health insurance fn part because they

are risk averse. They would rather pay a fixed, known premium (even including

a charge above the actuarial level) than run the risk of a huge expense in

event of serious illness. But not everyone is risk averse about health

expenditures, or risk averse to the same degree. The gambler says "I'd rather

save the premium and take my chances."

      6. The free-riders. The final category consists of individuals who

remain uninsured because they believe that in the event of serious illness
                                                                                4

they will get care anyway, with somebody else picking up the bill. They save

the cost of insurance and "free ride" on the coattails of those who do pay

into the health care system. There may be elements of "free riding" in the

behavior of the low users and the gamblers as well; it is often difficult to

distinguish among these three categories of individuals who are able to pay

for insurance but are unwilling to do so.

      Review of the six categories reveals thar achievement of Nh is, from an

analytical perspective, rather simple; all it requires is subsidization of

those who are unable to afford insurance and compulsion for those who are

unwilling to acquire it. No country in the world achieves universal coverage

without subsidization and compulsion. The best short explanation of why the

United States does not have universal coverage is that the majority of

Americans have resisted subsidizing those who are unable to afford insurance

and have been reluctant to force coverage on those who do not obtain it

voluntarily. 6




Two Nodels of health Insurance

      Part of the current debate over NNI is rooted in two conflicting visions

of how the cost of health care should be shared. We can designate one as the

casualty model and the other as the social insurance model. Casualty

insurance, which usually refers to automobile collision, residential fire, and

similar risks, is premised on the idea that premiums should (to the extent

feasible) be set according to expected loss. Other things equal, policy

holders who have better driving records or put smoke detectors in their homes

pay lower premiums, while poorer risks pay higher premiums. Social insurance,
                                                                                 S

which is the basis for NEt, provides for extensive cross-subsidization across

different risk groups; it ignores expected loss in allocating costs.

      As applied to health insurance, advocates of the casualty approach argue

that it is more efficient and more equitable than social insurance. They

assert that utilization of care depends, to some extent, on personal behavior

and choice. If premiums vary with expected utilization, individuals have an

incentive to choose healthier behaviors and to be more cost conscious in their

utilization of care for any given health condition.7 A clear example of the

former is charging cigarette smokers a higher premium than nonsmokers. This

may decrease the number of smokers, end even if it doesn't, the casualty model

advocates argue that it is fair for smokers to bear the extra cost of their

unhealthy habit.

      Even when there is no possibility of altering behavior, and even if the

utilization of care is unrelated to insurance coverage, there is still an

efficiency advantage for the casualty model in any system of voluntary health

insurance. The alternative, a uniform premium for all individuals, including

those with major health problems, will discourage purchase of insurance by

those without such problems because the premium for them is unreasonably high.

      Arguments for the social insurance model rely heavily on appeals to

justice, that is, to a sense of collective responsibility. In earlier times

these feelings of mutual responsibility were often evident within families and

within religious communities. In modern times many countries have extended it

to encompass the entire nation. The philosophical foundation can be discerned

in John Rawls's discussion of making choices behind a veil of ignorance.8

Suppose before you were born you didn't know if you were going to be rich or

poor, sick-or healthy; you might (assuming some risk aversion) prefer to be
born into a society that would provide health care for, say, parsons born with

a genetic disease on the same basis as those born without such a problem.

Advocates of the social insurance model also point to efficiency arguments.

Because everyone must participate, there can be savings in sales and

administrative costs that offset other efficiencies achieved through the

casualty approach.

      Whether the casualty or the social insurance model is more conducive to

an efficient health care system is primarily an empirical question (interwoven

with value judgments) that cannot he answered a orion. Which approach is

more just is primarily a value question (individual versus collective

responsibility), but empirical information concerning the reasons for

variation in utilization of care is relevant. In my experience, the same

audiences   that overwhelmingly approve charging smokers a higher premium
because they use more care, strongly oppose a premium surcharge for
individuals   whose high use is attributable to genetic factors. Should

cigarette smoking turn out to have a significant genetic component, opinions

concerning the smoker surcharge would presumably change. One consequence of

the genetics revolution may be to shift public sentiment toward the social

insurance model.



NEIl and the Cost of Care

      Opponents of NEIl frequently assert that universal coverage would result

in a substantial increase in the total cost of care. Both theoretical and

empirical research support the view that the lower the price of care to the

patient, the more care he or she will want to receive. The logic of this

argument suggests that those countries with universal coverage should be
                                                                                         7

    spending more on medicel care than does the United States. In fact, the

    reverse is true. On a per capita basis, and adjusting for differences in real

    income, the United States spends much more on medical care than any other

    country. For instance, the average American spends about 4OX more than the

    average Canadian, even though the difference in real income per capita is less

    than 10%. And Canada spends more per capita than does any European country.

          How can this be? The following discussion shows that countries with

    universal coverage find other methods to contain health care spending, methods

    that appear to be more effective thmn relying on financial constraints on

    patients.

          The most obvious source of saving under NHI is in health insurance

    sdministrstion. In the United States approximately six percent of nstionsl

    health expenditures is accounted for by "program administration snd net cost

    of private health insurance." To this must be added seversl additional

    percentage points for costs incurred hy providers for billing and other

    administrative activities directly attributable to the American system of

    financing care. By contrast, the Csnsdisn system of provincial health

    insurance imposes minimal administrative and billing costs on providers and

    psyors; the insurance plans themselves are inexpensive to run because everyone

    must join and premiums sre collected through the tax system.

          But savings in administrative costs are only part of the answer. Nearly

    all countries with NIH rely heavily on what I call "upstream resource

    allocation" (URA). The key to URA    is   control over capital investment in

6   facilities   end equipment, specialty mix of physicistis, and the development and

    diffusion of high.tech, high-cost technologies. Such control usually results

    in less excess capacity, both in physical end human capital. -    In   Canada, for
                                                                                   8

instance,   telatively scarce high-tech equipment, such as MRS's   ot   CT scanners,

is used intensively, while the proliferation of such equipment in the United

States results in considerable idle time. There are more physicians per

capita in Canada than in the United States, but there are many fewer who

specialize in complex surgical and diagnostic procedures. As a result, the

average Canadian specialist has a full workload, while his or her American

counterpart does not.9

      The price that Canadians and Europeans pay for such controls is delay or

inconvenience in obtaining access to high-tech services, and in some cases not

receiving such services at all. Whether such delays or denials have a

significant effect on the health of the population is not known with

certainty; the limited evidence currently available suggests that they do not.

      Another way that foreign countries with NHI contain costs is by using

their centralized buying power to squeeze down the prices of resources,

especially for drugs and physicians' services. Drug prices in the United

States usually contain significant monopoly rents as evidenced by the

willingness of the drug manuiacturers to sell the identical products overseas

at much lower prices.

      Canadian and European physicians do not enjoy as high net incomes as do

American physicians, even after adjustment for international differences in

the general level of wages. But this does not mean that American physicians

are more satisfied with their lot or that American medical schools find it

easier to attract high quality, well motivated applicants. Compared to

physicians in most countries with NHI, American physicians suffer more

bureaucratic supervision from public and private insurance plans and more

interference with the day-to-day practice of medicine.
      It is important not to overestimate the amount of money that can be

saved by squeezing physicians. In the United States physicimns' net incomes

account for approximately lOX of dl health care spending. Suppose these

incomes could be reduced by 20% (the approximate differential between the

United States and Canada after adjusting for specialty mix, the exchange rate,

and the generml level of wages).1Â° The saving would be 2% of health care

spending, and even this is not a saving of real resources but only a money

transfer from physicians to patients and taxpayers.

      Cost containment under 1*11 often relies on single source funding set

prospectively. An example is the global budget given to each Canadian

hospital et the beginning of each year. Samuel Johnson said, "When a man

knows he is to be hanged in a fortnight, it concentrates his mind

wonderfully."" Much the same seems to be true of health care. When

physicians and hospital administrators know that there is a certain pool of

resources at their disposal and that no more will be forthcoming, they seem to

figure out ways to do the job with what they have. To be sure, this

inevitably involves limitation of some services, but most health profesaionals

prefer having some control over the allocation of the scarce resources that

are available to them.



MIII and Health

      Does NHI improve the health of the population by increaaing acceaa to

care? Or does it worsen health by constraining the introduction of new

technology and destroying incentives for physicians and hospitals? There is

no conclusive answer to this queation; in my judgment MIII has little effect on

health one way or the other.12
                                                                                10

      With regard to the other stated health goal- -   the   reduction of

differentials in health outcomes within a country- -the evidence is more

compelling. Universal coverage for medical care does not eliminate or even

substantially reduce differentials across socioeconomic groups. In England,

for instance, infant mortality in the lowest socioeconomic class is double the

rate of the highest class, just as it was prior to the introduction of NHI.'3

The relatively homogeneous populations of Scandinavia not only enjoy universal

coverage for health care, but also have many other egalitsrian social

programs. Nevertheless, life expectancy varies considerably across

occupations; the age-standardized mortality ratio for male hotel, restsursnt,

and food service workers is double that of teachers and technical workers.14

In Sweden a study of age-standardized death rates among employed men ages 45-

64 found substantial differentials across occupations in 1966-70 and slightly

greater differentials in l97680.15 The author adds "There is no ayatematic

evidence that the health care system is inequitable in the sense that those in

greater need get leas care, or that there are barriers towards the lower

socioeconomic groups" (p. 13)11

      Is the failure of NHI to eliminate or reduce mortality differentials a

decisive argument against ita adoption? Nor necessarily. Bruce Viadeck

argues that curing disease and improving functional outcomes are not the only

benefits of medical care. He writes "We expect the health system to take care

of sick people whether or not they are going to get better, aa much for our

benefit aa theirs. 16 The caring and validation services provided by health

professionals have value even when they do not change health outcomes.17
                                                                                 11

Prospects for Will   in   the United States                            -



      What changes hsve occurred since 1976 that might modify the relevance of

the four reasons I advanced to explain the absence of Will in the United

States?

      1) Distrust of aovernment. It seems likely that the typical American's

distrust of government is stronger now thsn it was in the mid-l970s. Jimmy

Carter was elected as an "outsider," and he did little to enhance the image of

the Presidency or of government in general during his four years in office.

Ronald Reagan maintained an anti-government posture throughout his two terms.

Ceorge Bush may be more pragmatic and less- ideological, but he still commands

wide support with the message "government is the problem, not the solution."

      Can our political institutions deal with a complex problem such as

health care efficiently and honestly? The recent experience with the savings

and loan industry provides ample cause for concern. This debacle did not,

like a major earthquake, come upon us suddenly. It was a well-diagnosed,

localized cancer that government allowed to metastasize to its present level.

What is particularly disturbing is that the blame cannot be laid at the door

of one political party- -both Democrats and Republicans helped the cancer to

spread. Moreover, it was not the fault of just one branch of government; both

Congress and the Executive Branch are fully implicated. Finally, it was not

just the Federal government that was derelict; state regulstory agencies and

state legislatures also failed to meet their responsibilities to the public.

      Our government is built on checks and balances: by political parties,

by branches of government, and by levels of government. If these checks and

balances failed so badly with savings and loans, many observers wonder how
                                                                               12

well they would do with health care, which is so much lsrger, so much more

complex, and so much more vulnerable to mismanagement and dishonesty.

      2) Heteroreneity of the population. In 1976 I argued that the

heterogeneity of the U.S. population helped explain a reluctance to embrace

NUT. Unlike the Swedes, Germans, Japanese, and many other "peoples," moat

Ameticans do not ahare centuries of common language, culture, and tradition;

thus there is less sense of national identification and empathy. In 1991 this

explanation probably has even more force. The celebration of "multicultural-

ism" in the United States in the past fifteen years appears to have led to a

heightened sense of separateness among the country's many ethni, religious,

and racial groups. Glorification of the "pluribua" at the expense of the

"unuis" does not enhance the prospects for NUT.

     Heterogeneity of values also fuels the resistance to NUT. No nation

should expect or desire uniformity of opinion, but the name-calling and

physical violence that often accompany debates in the United States over

values undermines the ability of the nation to undertake collective efforts

for collective well-being. Americans might consider the words of the British

historian, R. H. Tawney, "The condition of effective action in a complex

civilization is cooperation. And the condition of cooperation is agreement,

both as to the ends to which efforts should be applied and the criteria by

which its success is to be judged. 18

      3) A robust voluntary sector. America has always been distinguished

from most other nations by its highly developed private, nonprofit

institutions devoted to health, education, and social services. These

institutions, often founded and supported by religious groups, perform many of

the functions that government undertakes in other countriea. During the past
                                                                                13

fifteen years, however, the ability of nonprofit hospitals and the Blue Cross-

Blue Shield organizations to provide a form of social insurance through free

care, cost shifting, and community rating of inaursnce premiums, has been

seriously compromised. The "competition revolution"19 has imposed the

casualty approach to health insurance aa a condition for survival. The growth

of PPOs, Ii!40a, and tough bargaining by all third-party payora has sharply

diminished the capacity of nonprofit institutions to act aa rediatributive

agents. The declining importance of philanthropy relative to private and

public health insurance also decreases the ability of the nonprofit

institutions to act as quasi-governmental agencies. In heslth care the

"thousand points of light" are fainter now than in the past.    I conclude that

the "voluntary sector" explanation for the absence of NHT in the United States

has less force in the l990s than it had in an earlier ers.

      4 Less "noblesse oblige". The two central ideological forces of

American society hsve been a commitment to individusl freedom and a

commitment, at least in the abstract, to equality. There has always been a

tension between these forces, with the emphasis on individual opportunity and

achievement prevailing most of the time, but the egalitarian emphasis much in

evidence in the l930s and 1960s. Even the egalitarian ideology, however, has

focused more on equality of social status, equality under the law, and

equality of opportunity, than on equality of outcomes. Becsuse so many

Americsns of humble origins could and did mchimve weslth and position, the

sense of "noblesse oblige" that motivates many of the well-born in othet

countries to vote for social programs to aid the less fortunate has never been

as evident in the United States.
                                                                                14

      How have the developments of the past fifteen years affected this

explanation? I find it difficult to judge, but suspect that it may be

slightly more relevant today. During the l9BOs the rhetotic of most of the

Aaerican right wing was "laissez-faire," not "Tory conservetive," Moreover,

the left wing's infatuation with the vocabulary of "rights" (divorced from

obligations) often diminishes rather than enhances e feeling of mutual

responsibility.

      In summary, the distrust of government and the population heterogeneity

explanations are probably more relevant today than in 1976, and the lack pf

nohlesse oblige may be more relevant. Only one explanation- - the robustness of

the voluntary sector- - is definitely weaker now. It is ironic that the

"competition revolution," which erodes the ability of not-for-profit health

care institutions to provide a modicum of social insurance, may prove to be a

significant factor leading the country toward Nh.

     Will the United States adopt NIH? In my view the prospects in the short

run are poor. The forces actively opposed to NHI are strong, well organized,

and have a clear sense of what they don't want. The forces actively in favor

are relatively weak, disorganized, end frequently at odds regarding the

reasons for wanting MIII or the best way to obtain it. The great majority of

Americans are not actively involved in the debate one way or the other, but

tend to be opposed for the reasons I have indicated. Some public opinion

polls seem to indicate a readiness for MIII, but they are not credible

indicators of political behavior. For example, one recent survey of business

executives reports that they believe the high cost of health cere to be

Ametica's most serious problem. At the same time business executives
                                                                                15

overwhelmingly approve of President Bush, who has not made reduction of health

care costs a high priority for his administration.

      In the long run, MIII is far from dead; the need to curb cost while

extending coverage will continue to push the country in that direction. The

process will accelerate as nonprofit health care institutions lose their

ability to provide some social insurance as an alternative to MIII. Moreover,

the current trend of basing insurance premiums on expected utilization will

strike more people as unjust because most disease will be found to have a

significant genetic component. Also, as employer hiring decisions and

employee job choices become increasingly constrained by health insurance

considarations, there will be more appreciation of the efficiency advantages

of making health insurance independent of the labor market.

      The timing of adoption of MIII will depend largely on factors external to

health care. Major changes in health policy, like major policy changes in any

area, are political acts, undertaken for political purposes. That was true

when Biamarck introduced MIII to the new German state over a hundred years ago.

It was true when England adopted MIII after World War II, and it will be true

in the United States as well. MIII will probably come to the United States in

the wake of a major change in the political climate, the kind of change that

often accompanies a war, a depression, or large-scale civil unrest. Short of

that, we should expect modest attempts to increase coverage and contain costs,

accompanied by an immodest amount of "aound and fury."

        1. NHI can take many forms. The emphasis in this paper is on any

national system that provides universal coverage.

        6. The United States has some compulsion and some subsidization among

the employees of large companies. In the typical case, all workers

participate, and the firm rarely adjusts the individual worker's wages or

premiums to take full account of differences in expected utilization.


        7. The RAND Health Insurance Experiment clearly showed that utilization

is greater when patients do not bear some of its cost. See W. G. Manning et

Randomized Experiment," The American Economic Review (June i987): 251-277.

         12. The effect of NHI on health dependa on the product of two

elasticities: 1) the responsiveness of the quantity of medical care to Nh,

and 2) the responsiveness of health to changes in the quantity of medical

care. In developed countries tha product of these terms is apparently very

small.
