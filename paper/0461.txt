                       in the United States


                             ABSTRACT



     This paper assesses the theoretical and empirical basis for American

labor union leaders' contention that imports have been a big source of

job loss in the United States. It is shown, first, that identification of

job losses "due to imports" is exceptionally difficult because economic growth

affects adversely the industries believed affected by imports. Then, an

accounting framework is employed to assess possible empirical orders of mag-

nitude. The results are fairly conclusive in indicating that factors other

than import competition have been primary in leading to structural shifts

in employment.

      The American labor movement reversed its support of free trade in
the 1960s, claiming and believing that "American jobs are lost" as a
consequence    of import competition. Its switch to a protectionist stance

has   been   a significant force in American political discussions regarding

trade policy. There can     be   little doubt that American adoption of such

protectionist measures as trigger pricing for steel and the mu].t:ifiber

agreement was, in substantial measure, a consequence of labor pressures

and the view of many other Americans that American labor was essentially

correct in its beliefs. Advocates of free trade felt compelled to

support "adjustment" assistance to "importimpacted workers" as part of

their case.

       It is the purpose of this paper to review   the   theory and empirical -

evidence underlying the view that job losses have,, in some sense, re—
suited from import competition. The basic message is that, at least

for the United States, it is exceptionally difficult to make an argument

that job losses, however defined, have been "caused", in any substantial

part, by import competition. A first section briefly sets forth con-

ventional theory as to the possible relationship between imports and

employment. A second section sets forth some empirical evidence about

the changing composition of employment in U.S. manufacturing industry

and the proximate decomposition of those changes into those generated

by demand patterns, by productivity growth, and by imports or the net

trade balance. A final section provides some indication as to the re-

lative importance, within several allegedly trade—impacted industries,

of gross and net employment changes in determining layoffs, and examines

briefly the question of who gains, and who loses, in industries receiving

protection.



                  I, HOW CAN IMPORTS AFFECT ELOYMENT?



       Different economic theories have varying models of the underlying

determinants of employment and wage determination. None of t:hem assigns

to    imports (contrasted with the trade balance) a cent:ral role in the
determination of employment,
       At one extreme lies neoclassical theory, in which wages are fully
flexible, so that the number of persons employed is a function of demand
for,    and supply of, labor.   Any shift in the demand   curve   for labor is
associated with a change in employment only insofar as the labor supply

curve is not perfectly inelastic. When the demand curve for labor shifts

upward,    employment increases   or decreases as the labor supply curve is
forward sloping or backward bending. In the neoclassical model, import
competition    could affect employment and/or the real wage via      the Stolper—
Samuelson effect, with free trade resulting in a downward or upward shift
 in   demand for labor, depending upon the relative factor intensity of
 imports and   exports. If, as    Leontief, Baldwin, Branson and Nonoyios
                                     —3—


and others have found American exports are relatively labor—intensive

contrasted with American imports, theory would suggest that free trade

would result in a higher real wage than would protection, and employment

would be greater or less with free trade depending upon the sign of the

slope of the labor supply curve.

     At the opposite end of the spectrum is the simple IS—LN Keynesian

model,   in which the real wage is   exogenously determined (via the price

level or other means),    aithe   level of aggregate demand determines the
level    of employment. In the model, fiscal and monetary policy determine

the level of employment, and changes in imports are significant only

insofar as they are not accompanied by changes in exports.

     What all these models have in common is that they treat the level of

employment as a macroeconomic phenomenon which, in the aggregate, it

surely is. In addition, one cannot associate increases in imports with

job losses unless one extends the analysis to take into account both

the general equilibrium repercussions of the net increase in exports that

would    accompany any change in imports and also the underlying nature of
the labor market (and in particular whether changes in     the   demand for
labor    are likely to be reflected in changes in the nominal or real wage

rate). It is thus apparent that one cannot legitimately view imports,

or changes in import levels, as a significant determinant of aggregate

employment.

        What may make sense, however, is to examine "impact effects" on dif-

ferent industries of the changing pattern of trade. For, while aggregate

employment levels are surely a function more of macroeconomic variables

than of trade flows, it can be contended that import competition causes

some individuals and firms to relocate either geographically or sectorally
                                 —4-.



and that such relocation may cause hardships. If one is to make economic

sense out of demands for protection on grounds of the "employment" effect

of imports, it must surely be these "impact" effects, and the short—term

dislocations that individual industries may suffers that are the source
              1
of concern.

     Even here, however, there are significant, and important, difficulties.

For, as is well known, there are many causes of changes in employment

composition Changes in tastes and other random factors can result: in

an altered distribution of output and employment. Competitive successes

and failures lead tochanging patterns within, as well as between, industries..

Perhaps even more important, the process of economic growt:h generates

systematic changes in patterns of employment and output:.. This is both

because: 1) income elasticities differ from unity, and employment must

therefore shIft from low—income—elasticity goods to high income—elasticity

goods if the. process of economic growth is to continue, and 2) factor

accumulation, and especially accumulation

of physical and human capital, alters the relative scarcity of different

factors of production. As that happens, the real wage accruing to unskilled

labor risea,whire the real return to capital and skills falls relative

to the return to unskilled labor. The change in relative factor prices)

in turn, alters the relative costs of production in. different lines, thus

altering relative prices of final goods (unless, by chance, technological

changes proceeds faster in relatively unskilled labor—intensive industries),

and inducing consumers to substitute capital—and skill—intensive goods



     'Even if this argument proved to be valid and empirically significant,
It would not constitute a convincing case for protection: The permanent
consumption losses associated with failing to adjust would have to be eva-
luated against the short—term "gains" that stemmd from avoiding dilocation
costs. On the size of those costs in the U.S., see Bale.
                                       —5—



for   unskilled—labor intensive goods in their consumption basket.'

      That change must occur in the process of economic growth is widely

accepted. Indeed, it would not be possible for rapid—growth industries

to expand unless resources were released from contracting industries,

and   resistances   to those changes would, by definition, retard the growth

process. For present purposes, however, a major difficulty arises: for

advanced countries such as the United States, the same labor—intensive

industries that are likely to contract relatively because of rising real

wages are the ones where import competition is most likely to be felt..

This follows naturally from the factor proportions explanation of trade':
just as industries intensive in the use of unskilled labOr are likely

to be slowly growing because of their cost disadvantage with rising real

wages, those same industries are likely to be at a competitive disadvantage

vis—a—vis competition from imports, since the comparative advantage of

the   U.S. (and other   advanced   countries) is   likely to   lie in capit:al and
skill—intensive goods.
      Thus,   the fact that the number of jobs in a certain labor—intensive

industry   may   be declining is not per se evidence     that imports are the

"cause'. To the extent that the foreign supply curve remains constant

through the process, there is some presumption that the decline           in employ--
ment is primarily a consequence of rising real wage rates and the process
of reallocation of labor towards higher value—adding industries. In fact,




     or an elaboration of this argument, and a simulation of the dii feren—
tial employment impact of capital deepening on labor—and capital—intensive
industries, see Krueger (1979b).                            -




     2Note, however, that it is not consistent with the Leontief finding
that U.S. exports are capital—intensive relative to U.S. imports.
                                      —6—


if the foreign supply curve of imports is constant over time, it would

be   difficult to attribute employment declines to "import competition":
at most, a case could be made that     the presence of import   competition
prevented      the domestic price from increasing as rapidly as it otherwise

would have. In that sense, imports permit higher domestic consumption
levels of labor—intensive goods than would otherwise be possible. Only

a part of imports can be regarded as replacing domestic output: in con—

sumption.

       The preceed.ing paragraph points up a major conceptual difficulty

in attempting to estimate the "employment losses" attributable to imports:

quite aside from general equilibrium problems, appropriate estimation

would entail the specification of domestic demand and supply functions,

and   in   addition would require estimation of the extent to which imports

in a particular category increased moving along a foreign supply curve

and the extent to which they rose because of shifts in foreign supply
           1
curves.

       It   is these considerations which motivate the method of measurement

used in the next section. Because of the deep—seated difficulties in

identifying the extent to which it is factors associated with economic

growth or it is imports that affect employment opportunities in labor—

Intensive industries, an accounting framework is instead employed.




     'There is another difficulty with the "imports cause job losses"
argument: insofar as the domestic supply of import—competing goods is
inelastic, increased imports would be met by a lower domestic price, with
employment fairly constant. It is only if the supply curve of domestic
labor—intensive goods is fairly elastic that one can argue sensitivity
to foreign competition. But an elastic domestic supply presumably
implies alternative uses of the factors of production.

        II, ACCOUNTING FOR THE SECTORAL COMPOSITION OF AMERICAN

             MANUFACTURING EMPLOYMENT CHANGES, 1970 to 1976



      The period 1970 to 1976 was chosen for analysis for several reasons.

On one hand,Frank has already analyzed the import—employment relation

for the period 1963 to 1971, finding that the AFL—CIO claims for the

impact of import levels on employment were greatly exaggerated and that:,

even for the three—digit industries for which imports were either largest

or had grown most rapidly, rates of growth of demand and of labor product-

ivity were significantly larger than import growth in affecting rates

of change of employment. For present purposes, the year 1970, rather 1971,

was chosen as an initial year for several reasons: 1) the existence of

Frank's work covering the 1960s; 2) 1970 marked the year before dollar

devaluation and is often pinpointed as the time when the large increase

in imports started; and 3) because dollar devaluation took place in        the
middle of 1971, price statistics for 1971 to 1976 are somewhat: less reliable
than those for 1970 to 1976.
      The choice of 1976 for a terminal year was affected by several factors:
1) it was the latest year for which data were available as of the time
the   computations were undertaken; 2) it   was still a year of ie.ss—t:han.
full—employment in the United States, so that concern with jobs and em-
ployment opportunities was perhaps better focused than was the case in
the   years 1977 and   1978 when   the overall unemployment rate was   lower;
and 3) the price adjustments of 1974 and 1975 had had a chance to work

their way through the system, so that data for 1976 may better reflect

underlying long—term factors than data for earlier years. It should be

noted also that the l970s were the period during which concern about import
                                       —8--



competition from the LDCs has been intense: focus upon the 1970—76 period

should therefore enable a judgment asto its validity.1

At any time t, labor has an average productivity:

average product of labor.
     Define S as the ratio of domestic output to domestic consumption
(S Q/C) and assume that the domestic share of output in consumption,
S, labor productivity, a, and domestic utilization all grow (or decline)
at constant continuous rates:

     11t should be noted, however, that the LDC share of imports into
the OECD countries remained relatively small in 1976 and subsequent years.
Manufactured exports from developing to industrialized countries in 1976
constituted 9.9 percent of total manufactured imports by industrialized
countries, and only 1.6 percent of consumption of manufactured products
in developed countries. See World Bank, World Development Report 1979,
P. 21.
                                            —9—


S,    S,    a, a, C         and C can all be ascertained from initial—year and

terminal values, thus yielding solutions for the three rates of growth.

      Employment, L, can then be expressed as:

                    L
                        t
                                a1 tt
                                 t SC       a'e pt s eat C e8
                                             0      0     0

                            =   Ee (   +ct —p)t


The rate of growth of employment is thus expressed as the sum of t:hree

components: the growth rate of domestic consumption,1 the growt:h rate

of the share of domestic output in domestic consumption, and (minus)

the growth rate of labor productivity.2 A negative sii for a, for

example, indicates that the share of domestic consumption met by

domestic production declined, and a can be interepreted as the additional

continuous    rate of growth in        employment that would have been attained

had   the   share of .domestic output in domestic consumption remained

constant, ALL ELSE UNRANGED. For              reasons spelled out above, it is not
at   all evident that all else would have remained unchanged, so that the

interpretation of a must be purely definitionaL In a closed economy,

a would be zero by definition. However, the growth rates t3 and p would

very likely be different, even given the same underlying tastes,




'Domestic consumption is defined alternatively as domestic 1)rOduct.iofl
plus imports (which implicitly includes exports as part of domestic
demand) and domestic production plus imports less exports. Comparison of
the two sets of results permits a contrast between the gross sectoral
effect and the net effect.


2Alternatively, one could compute time trends from regression equations
and use them to calculate rates in Equation (6). The difficulties of
gathering the data precluded such an effort.

production functions and factor endowments as in the open economy
        1
case.

        Using these relations, data were collected for 1970 and 1976.

Despite the apparent simplicity of the accounting framework, there is

nothing simple about data collection: trade statistics are on a commodity

basis, output and employment statistics are on an industry basis, and

price statistics are compiled on yet a third basis. Considerable

effort is involved in reconciling these three groups of data.

        Table 1 gives the continuous rates of growth of consumption (utili-

zation), labor productivity, imports,the net trade balance, and eniployrnent

derived by the procedures described above. By definition, the sum of

the   first three columns equals the last column. For non—electrical

machinery,    for example, the rate of growth of domestic utilization
(defined as domestic consumption plus imports) was     2.81   percent continuously,
while labor productivity grew .54    percent and the share    of domestic output
in domestic utilization fell at a continuous rate of .32 percents        Employ-
ment grew at an annual average rate of 1.95 percent (equal to 2.81 minus
.54 minus    .32), To state it   another way: had imports grown at the same

rate    as domestic production while domestic utilization and labor productivity

followed    their actual growth paths,   employment would have increased at a

continuous    rate .32 percent faster than the   realized one. If net t:rade




11t should be noted that cannot be interpreted simply as the rate of
upward shift in the demand curve: whatever price changes occurred during
the period under analysis would affect the estimated rate of growth of
utilization, and 3 links observed utilization levels. Only if price had
remained unchanged would f reflect the rate of upward shift of the demand
curve. Even then, the rate of growth of real income might well differ in
a closed economy, so that   would differ on that reason.


2The interested reader is referred to Krueger (l979a) for particulars with
regard to the data sources. Obtaining reliable price deflators is perhaps
the most difficult task, but any errors in those estimates are reflected
in both labor productivity and demand, and thus do not affect the estimate
of . Printing and publishing was omitted for lack of an appropriate
price index.

Exports and Imports as Related to Output 1970 and 1969 and 1976 and 1975.
Annual Survey of Manufactures, 1970 and 1976. Output and trade data for 1976

balance, rather than imports, is used, employment and labor product:ivity

growth rates are unaffected. Thus, "true" domestic utilization can

be derived by adding the difference between the trade balance rate and

the import rate to the domestic demand growth rates. For example, for

electrical and electronic equipment the import share decreased at a

rate of -. 90 percent while the share of the net trade balance declined

at a rate of —l4 percent. Thus, part of the increase in imports was

offset by growth of exports, and the growth of domestic utilization,

defined as Q   +M    X, was 1.44 percent annually (2.20 — .90          .14).
     Examination     of the data in Table 1 suggests that rates of change in

domestic demand and labor productivity were quantitatively larger than

the rate of growth of import share in all two digit sectors except for

leather, even without taking into account the behavior of exports in t:he

same sectors. Moreover, in only three sectors —          electrical   and electronic

equipment, apparel, and miscellaneous manufactures ——        in   which employment

declined could employment have grown       with   a constant import share even

if demand and labor productivity had followed their actual course.

     These conclusions emerge even more strongly if the net t:rade balance

colii, rather than the 'import columa, is examined. For miscellaneous

manufacturing,   the increase in exports was sufficient to change the sign
of the trade effect.
     It thus seems difficult to attach much credence, at the two—digit
level, to the arguments that imports have         significantly impacted employ-

ment. There are two      objections that   have been raised to that conclusion..

On one hand, proponents of protection have asserted that increases in

labor productivity may be associated with import competition; on the

other hand, it can be argued that more disaggregated data would tell a

different   story.
                                         —1 3—



      The first argument ——     that   increasing imports result in increased

rates of labor productivity growth ——            is   difficult to evaluate. If it

is true, it would significantly increase the welfare losses associated

with any protectionist measures. it is not, therefore, necessarily an

argument in favor of protection. At the two—digit level, however, there

does not appear to be any      simple    relationship between productivity growth

rates and imports: a regression of the rate of growth of labor product—

ivity   on   the rate of growth of imports (from the data in Table 1) yields

a   negative   (—.03) but statistically insignificant coefficient. It seems

equally plausible that increased imports might spur domestic entrepreneurs

to a greater efficiency, and that industries with slow rates of product-

ivity growth (and therefore above—average rates of increases in price)

would be the ones most likely affected by import competition.. There is

no compelling reason why causation should be the same in all findustries.

While further research might yield fruitful results in clarifying the

relationship between import competition and domestic efficiency, it seems

reasonable to conclude that the productivity—import competitioa argument

can go either way and     is   certainly not well enough documented to serve

as a basis for either a free trade or a protectionist case given the

present state of knowledge.

        The second argument ——    that    two—digit industries are not sufficiently

disaggregated —— has more appeal. It should be noted, however, that the

more disaggregated the industry, the higher in absolute value the price

elasticity of demand facing it is likely to be. To that extent, even

where import competition appears to be a significant factor, there is

a question about the extent to which protection would result in increased

domestic production levels, rather than reduced domestic consumption levels.
                                 —14—


    Nonetheless, in an attempt to evaluate the contention, the available

data were collected on four—digit subsectors of the two—digit industries:

textiles, apparel, leather products, and   electrical   and   electronic   equip-

ment. These are the four sectors which are most widely regarded as having

experienced significant dislocation due to import competition. Unfortunately,

the necessity to obtain price deflators becomes increasingly .difficiilt as

the definition of an industry narrows, and the number of subsectors for

which it was possible to estimate output, trade and employment levels
                                                                     -


was not large. Table 2 presents the results.

     As can be seen, the variation in employment growth rates across four—

digit industries is, as would be expected, considerably larger than for

two—digit sectors. Nonetheless, the general impression remains much the

same: demand and labor productivity growth rates, and not imports, have

been the dominant factor in affecting rates of employment growth. Of

the 42 four—digit industries for which data were available, there were

12 which experienced rates of employment decline in excess of 3 percent.

In only one of those was the rate of increase of the import share in ex-

cess of 1.33, and that was radio and TV sets, where employment decreased

3.72 percent at a continuous annual rate, while the import share rose at

a rate of 3.20 percent. Par the four—digit industry with the most rapid

rate of employment decline (electronic receiving tubes), the industry

experienced declining demand at a rate of 12.1 percent, increased labor

productivity at 7.45 percent, and an increased import share at 1.32 percent.

     Although the data are not conclusive because of the absence of appro-

priate data for other subsectors, the evidence seems fairly strong that

even at the four—digit level, it cannot be so that protection, or reduction

of imports, could in any major part have offset the tendency toward reduced

employment levels at the four—digit level. Production growth and demand

patterns were far too large relative to the growth rate of imports.

           III. WHO GAINS AND WHO LOSES FROM PROTECTION?


     In light of the evidence that protection could not in any major way

reverse the employment trends in most declining industries) it is of in-

terest to ask where protectionist pressures originate, and who gains from

protection. There is, first, the question of the division of whatever

spoils there are between labor and capital. As Magee     has   neatly documented,

owners and workers have generally lobbied on the same side of Irotectionist

legislation. If labor is relatively mobile contrasted with capital, in-

ternational trade models would suggest that the gains to capital from

protection would exceed the gains to labor.1

     There is another, somewhat re.lated,.aspect, which may be partly unique

to the United States. That is, a number of industries have relocated

geographically within the United States. Consider, for example, the data

in Table 3. They indicate the number of persons employed in the t:extile

industry (SIC 22) and   the apparel   industry (SIC 23) in two major regions

of the United States, along with total U.S. employment.2 As can be seen,

the fortunes of the two have been quite different, as employment in New

England and the Middle Atlantic States has dropped sharply since 1959,

while employment in the. South Atlantic states and the East South Central

region has grown continuously in the apparel industry, and been rising

or fairly steady in the textile industry. If one takes the states in the



     1See , for example, Mayer. There also questions about the interindustry
impacts of protection. For example, insofar as the multifiber agreement has
raised the European and American price of textiles above that East Asia, one
would anticipate that East Asia would gain a competitive advantage in the ex-
port of apparel. Similar questions must surely be raised about protection of steel

     2The New England and Middle Atlantic States include: Maine, New Hampshire,
Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey and
Pennsylvania. South Atlantic and East South Central include: Delaware, Maryland,
Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Kentucky,Tennessee,
Alabama and Mississippi.

U.S. and partitions theni into those in which employment rose and those in

which employment fell between 1970 and 1976 in textiles, and sums the

gross employment change within each group of states, the resulting number

is that there were 29.1 thousand additional jobs in the states with gains,

and 77.8 thousand less jobs in the states which experienced losses. In

apparel, there were 103.2 new jobs in states with gains, and 173.2 losses

in states where employment fell.

     All of these figures indicate an additional dimension to the problem

of declining industries in the United States industries are relocating

in areas where labor costs are lower at the same time as they are contract-

ing nationally. As Table 3 vividly indicates, the lost employment in

New England and the Middle Atlantic States was more than offset, at least

until 1970, by gains in employment in the South Atlantic and East South

Central States.

     These data point up an additional consideration of some importance

if the. dislocation costs of job losses are the motive behind protection:

the pace of relocation may increase or decrease with additional protection

from Imports. In one study on the subject, Isard argued that protection

in the textile industry raised profits, which in turn raised the rate

at which automated machinery replaced labor in that industry. To the

extent that increased profits are also an inducement for expansion, and

expansion occurs in parts of the country other than where existing plants

are located, the presumption that protection can do anything to reduce

the rate of dislocation in the states losing employment is still further

weakened.

     Little is known about the ways in which firms and industry structure

actually respond to shifts in demand, whether generated by protection from

imports or other phenomena. Taking a neutral assumption, that the rate of
                                 19—


shift of the share of employment between north and south is independent

of the height of protection (and presumably therefore the profitability

of the industry, although this latter is questionable unless it is

assund that the wage is competitively determined and that the supply of

labor to the textile industry is perfectly elastic), the data in Table 3

suggest that, even had protection in the textile industry been sufficient

to maintain employment in 1976 at its 1970 level, job losses in the north

would only have been reduced from 42.9 million to 32.7 million, while

employment in the south would have increased by 29.1 million. The

figures for apparel are even more striking, as the south in fact increased

textile employment in the face of a declining national total.. If, as

seems to be the case, it is the dislocation of job losses that is the

principal concern of those advocating protection, regional consideiatar

in the United States would suggest that, at least in textiles and apparel,

a large number of additional jobs would have to be created (in the South)

per job loss prevented in New England. The illustrative numbers for tex-

tiles (which, it should be remembered, are based on the neutral but un-

substantiated assumption that the share of the south was independent of

the absolute sue of national employment) suggest that prevention, even if

feasible, of 10.2 thousand job layoffs in New England could have been

achieved only with 29.1 thousand additional jobs in the south. Thus,

 three additional persons would have started employment in the south, in

 an admittedly uneconomic use of scarce resources, to save one job in the

 north.

      These numbers are illustrative, and nothing more. The dynamics of

 locational choice within industries are not well understood, and until

 they are, it will be difficult to carry the argument further. It should
                                      —20—



be   noted, however, that there was some (not necessarily highly effective)

protection accorded to the Pmerican textile industry (luring the 1970 1:0

1976 period. Given the regional shift that in fact occurred, the observed

changes in employment location obviously reflect, at least somewhat, the

degree to which job    losses   in the north were avoided: given that the in—

dustry continued its relocation to the south, the decline in national

employment that was prevented went in considerable proportion to increased

employment opportunities in the south.



                                 IV. CONCLUSIONS



       Despite the intuitive appeal of the notion that increased imports

must have been a significant determinant of the ttimpact: effecttt :i.n layoffs

and job losses in the United States, examination of the evidence doeS not

support the case to any substantial degree Not only do imports into

the United States, even in the industries where they are believed to be

harming American workers, constitute relatively small fractions of total

 domestic consumption, but in addition, rates of change     of   demand   and of
 labor productivity growth have been quantitatively larger than changes in

 the import share,

       Moreover,   there are important questions as to the extent    that pro-

 tection, even if    it were    intensified, would prevent job layoffs. On one
 hand, there is    some  evidence that higher profitability may lead to more
 rapid   investment,   which in turn may result in a more rapid rate of change

 in   technique toward more capital—intensive methods.     As such, it may    be

 capital, and not labor, which gains more by protectionist
                                                                 measures. In
                                     —21—


addition, the fact that industries can relocate regionally in the United

States further diminishes whatever link there might be between import

levels and job layoffs in particular industries. At least some part of

whatever additional employment     might result   from protection accrues to

regions and   states which   are not experiencing job losses: an important:

question is the extent to which protection might in fact increase the

rate of industrial relocation.

     While    there   are hardships involved with any job termination and ne-

cessity to relocate either occupationally or geographically,, it is not

evident that those hardships are more intense when layoffs are "caused't

by one factor, such as import competition, than by any other (such as

regional relocation, a- declining industry, or a poorly managed firm)

For the United States, a strong case can be made that social policy to-

ward those losing jobs should be independent of whether the lost       jobs
are attributable to imports or not. Not only is it conceptually difficult,,

if not impossible, to ascertain causation, but even if one could make

statements    such as that fraction      of job losses were "caused" by

import competition, while fraction (l—x1) were a consequence of other

factors, it seems implausible that a method for identifying which              of

the newly unemployed should be treated differently.

     Perhaps even more importantly, the available evidence for the United

States seems convincing that job turnovers have been nre a consequence

 of the process of economic growth than they have been of imports. The

 economic costs of "saving jobs lost due to imports", no matter how done,

would be very high per job saved. Not only theory, but the available

 empirical evidence, supports the view that trade policy is not an appro-

 priate instrument to deal with even the "impact effect" on employment.
