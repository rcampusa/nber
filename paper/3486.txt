    A number of interest rates ard interest rate spreads have been fourd to
be useful in predictir the cxxirse of the eoonany. We oatpare the predictive
pcer of sai of these suested interest rate variables for nine irdicators

those of Stock ard Watson (1989) ard Friethian aid Kuttner (1989), who fourxl
that the spread between the caTTercial paper rate aix3. the Treasury bill rate
has been a particularly good predictor. We present eviderxe that this spread
is inforsative not so much because it is a muasure of default risk (which has
been the usual presumption), but because it is an indicator of the stance of
nK)netary policy; for example, durir the "credit crunches" of the l960s aid
the 1970s, the ccarcial paper—Treasury bill spread typically rose
significantly. We also shc that, possibly because of charges in inetary
policy cçeratin procedures aid in financial markets, this spread appears r
to be a less reliable predictor than it used to be.

      Economists have long understood that financial market variables

contain considerable information about the future of the economy. Stock

prices, in particular, have always been a popular leading indicator.

Recently, though, a number of researchers have pointed out that interest

rates and interest rate spreads--that is, differences between interest

rates on alternative financial assets- -can be effective predictors of

the economy.

      Probably the most striking results along these lines have been

obtained by James Stock and Mark Watson1, who examined the information

contained in a wide variety of economic variables in an attempt to

construct a new index of leading indicators. Stock and Watson found

that two interest rate spreads- - the difference between the six-month

commercial paper rate and the six-month Treasury bill rate, and the

difference between the ten-year and one-year Treasury bond rates- -

outperformed nearly every other variable as forecasters of the business
cycle. The two Stock and Watson variables are not the only candidates

that have been advanced, however: A number of alternative interest

rates and spreads have been suggested by various authors, as we will

discuss further below.

      The finding that interest rates and spreads contain a great deal

of information is interesting, but it raises a number of questions.

Possibly the most important of these is the question of       interest

rates and spreads predict the course of the economy so well. In this

article we try to make some progress on this issue.

      To do this, a necessary first step is to determine which interest

rate variable (or variables) is the most informative about the future

         "New Indexes of Coincident and Leading Economic Indicators",
NEER Macroeconomics Annual, MIT Press, 1989.
                                                                        2



course of the economy. Section I of this paper runs a "horse race'

between a number of suggested predictors. We test the ability of the

alternative interest rate variables to predict nine different monthly

measures of real macroeconomic activity, as well as the inflation rate.

While many interest rate variables have been excellent predictors of the

economy during the period that we consider, we find that the best single

variable is the spread between the commercial paper rate and the

Treasury bill rate- -one of the two Stock and Watson variables.2 An

additional finding is that, unfortunately, the predictive power of this

variable (as well as of the other interest rate variables) appears to

have weakened in the last decade; this poses a potential problem for the

use of this variable in the new index of leading indicators proposed by

Stock and Watson.

        Given the superiority of the commercial paper- -Treasury bill

spread documented in Section I, in Section II we narrow our focus to

inquire why this particular spread has historically been so informative

about the economy. We consider two principal hypotheses: The first is

that the commercial paper--Treasury bill spread is informative because,

as the difference between a risky return and a safe return on assets of

the same maturity, it is a measure of perceived default risk. Suppose

that, for whatever reason, investors expect the economy to turn down    in
the   near future; because this will increase the riskiness of privately

issued debt, the current spread between private and safe public debt

will be bid up. The commercial paper--Treasury bill spread forecasts




        L
         Actually, the predictive power of this particular spread was
first noticed not by Stock and Watson but by Benjamin Friedman and
Kenneth Kuttner, as discussed below.
                                                                           3



the future, according to this explanation, because it embodies whatever

information the market may have about the likelihood of a recession.

         The second hypothesis discussed here is that the commercial paper-

-Treasury bill spread predicts the economy because it measures the

stance of monetary policy, which in turn     is   an important determinant of

future economic activity, We discuss two variants of the monetary

policy hypothesis, both of which require the assumption that cormnercial.

paper and Treasury bills are imperfect substitutes in the portfolios of

investors. The general idea underlying both variants is that monetary

policy affects the spread between commercial paper and Treasury bills by

changing the composition of assets available in the economy; because of

imperfect substitutability, interest rate spreads must      adjust in order
to   make investors willing to hold the new mix of assets. A more

detailed discussion of this hypothesis is deferred until Section II

below.

         It seems clear that the commercial paper- -Treasury bill spread

must reflect default risk to some degree (the first hypothesis), so much

of Section II is devoted to asking whether the spread also measures the

stance of monetary policy (the second hypothesis). Using several

alternative measures of monetary policy, we find evidence that it does.

Indeed, to a degree that we found surprising, the commercial paper- -

Treasury    bill spread seems more closely related to conventional

indicators of monetary policy (such as the Federal funds rate) than to

alternative measures of default risk.

         The paper's tentative conclusion--tentative, because of the

surprisingly weak association of the spread with other measures of

default risk- -is that the spread between commercial paper and Treasury
 bill rates has historically been a good predictor because it combines

 information about both monetary and non-monetary factors affecting the

economy, and because it does this more accurately than alternative

interest rate-based measures. However, because this spread has become

over rime a less perfect indicator of monetary policy, it may be a Less

useful predictor of economic fluctuations in the future.



      I. A Comparison of the Predictive Power of Alternative Interest

Rates and Soreads

      In this section we review some recent literature on the predictive

power of interest rates and spreads. We then compare the forecasting

power of a number of the variables that have been suggested by various

authors.

      Much of the recent attention to the predictive power of interest

rates can be traced back to a provocative 1980 paper by Christopher A.

Sims.3 At the time, Sims was interested in interpreting his own earlier

finding that the growth rate of the money stock helped forecast output4;

in particular, he wanted to know if this earlier finding could be taken

as evidence that monetary policy can be used to affect the real economy.

In the 1980 paper Sims showed, in a vector autoregression (VAR) system

including postwar data on industrial production, wholesale prices, and

the Ml money stock, that Ml was an important predictor of production;

indeed, in this VAR, disturbances to Ml were found to explain 37% of the

forecast variance of industrial production at a horizon of 48 months.

This predictive power for money was in line with the earlier results of

         "Comparison of Interwar and Postwar Cycles: Monetarism
Reconsidered", American Economic Review 70, May 1980, 250-7.
         See Sims, "Money, Income, and Causality", American Economic
Review 62, September 1972, 540-52.
                                                                         5



Sims and others. However, in his paper Sims also showed that, when the

commercial paper rate was added to the VAR, nearly all of money's

predictive power for output was "absorbed" by the interest rate: In the

expanded VAR, the commercial paper rate explained 30% of the forecast

variance of industrial production at the 48-month horizon, while money

accounted for only 4%-.   Similar results were later obtained, but for the

Treasury bill rate rather than the commercial paper race, by Robert B.

Litterman and Laurence Weiss.5

      From the finding that money did not predict output when interest

rates were also in the forecasting equations, both Sims and Litterman

and Weiss concluded that monetary policy does not in fact affect real

output. This interpretation was disputed by Bennett McCallum, who

pointed out that in practice interest races might be a better indicator

of monetary policy than money growth rates; hence the predictive power

of interest rates was not necessarily evidence against the effectiveness

of monetary policy.6 A paper by Ben Bernanke and Alan Blinder concurred

with McCalluin's view, pointing out that the Federal funds rate--the

interest rate most closely associated with monetary policy- -was in fact

unusually informative about the future of the real economy.7 We present

some evidence which bears on the debate about monetary policy in Section

II; for the time being, though, let us just note that the literature

following Sims' contribution demonstrated the forecasting power of

several alternative interest rates.

      The research that followed Sims suggested that it was the level of

interest rates that was important for forecasting the economy. However,

a number of papers written during the 'eighties showed that spreads

between different interest rates could also be extremely informative.

For example, in a study of financial crises during the Great Depression,

Bernanke showed that the spread between the rates on Baa-rated corporate

bonds and Treasury bonds was a leading indicator of output during the

interwar period.8 Arturo Estrella and Gikas A. Hardouvelis demonstrated

the forecasting power of the difference between short-term and long-cern

Treasury rates9; the "tilt" of the term structure, as this spread is

sometimes referred to, is in fact a popular forecasting variable in

financial circles, as Estrella and Hardouvelis mentioned. In a paper

cited above, Bernanke and Blinder suggested that the spread between the

Federal funds rate and the long-term government bond rate- -which they

interpreted as an indicator of monetary policy- -would be a useful

predictor; similar conclusions were drawn by Robert D. Laurent.1° The

high information content of the spread between the commercial paper race

and the T-bill rate was first documented in an important paper by

Benjamin M. Friedman and Kenneth N. Kuttner.11 Finally, as discussed in

the introduction, Stock and Watson's comparison of a wide variety of

potential leading indicators gave high marks to the commercial paper- -

Treasury bill spread and the spread between short-term and long-term

Treasury rates (the tilt of the term   structure).

        Cpmvarisons of univariate forecasting tower

        Given the variety of interest rate-based predictors that have been

suggested, it is important to try to determine more precisely which of

the candidate variables contain the most information. A preliminary

examination of eight proposed forecasting variables, taken one at a time

(i.e., in univariate fashion), is reported in Tables 2 and 3.

(Definitions of the alternative interest rates and spreads used in this

paper are given in Table 1.) Here we consider four interest rates and

four interest rate spreads. The four interest rates include the    Federal
funds   rate (RFF), the three-month Treasury bill rate (RT3MO), and the

six-month commercial paper rate (RCP6MO), all of which have been used in

previous studies of the forecasting power of interest rates. We also

bring in at this stage the ten-year Treasury bond rate (RT1O), both

because Stock and Watson include the first difference of this variable

in their experimental index of leading indicators and because we wanted

to have a representative long-term rate. The four interest rate spreads

examined are 1) the commercial paper- -Treasury bill spread (at six

months' maturity), which we call SHORT because Stock and Watson refer to

it as the short-term public-private spread; 2) the spread between the

long-term corporate bond rate (Baa rating) and the ten-year government

bond rate, or LONG; 3) the difference between the one-year Treasury

bill rate and the ten-year Treasury bond rate, called TILT because it

measures the tilt of the term structure; and 4) the spread between the
                                                                        8



Federal funds rate and the ten-year Treasury bond rate, referred to here

as FUNDS.

      We examined the ability of each of the eight forecasting variables

to predict ten macroeconomic variables (nine indicators of real

activity, plus the CPI inflation rate); the chosen macro variables are

listed down the left-hand side of Tables 2 and 3. The ten macroeconomic

variables are essentially the same as those used by Bernanke and Blinder

in their paper, with the addition of nonagricultural employment and

personal consumption expenditures; all of these variables are closely-

watched measures of the economy, which also meet the criterion of being

available on a monthly basis. We tested the predictive power of the

interest rate variables for a number of different economic series,

instead of just (say) industrial production, as a check on the

robustness of the relationships that we find)2

      We evaluated the univariate forecasting power of the individual

interest rates and spreads, as follows: For each macro variable and

each interest rate variable (rate or spread), we estimated three in-

sample, one-month-ahead prediction equations, using monthly data for

1961.89.13 In the first of the three prediction equations, the macro

variable being forecasted was regressed on a constant, a trend, six lags

          Obviously the ten macroeconomic variables are not independent,
since they are all related to the aggregate business cycle; thus, we
should not overstate the advantage of looking at a number of different
variables. On the other hand, the ten variables do reflect different
measurement techniques, different sectors, and different cyclical
dynamics; thus a finding that an interest rate variable predicts many of
the macro variables is less likely to be spurious than a finding that an
intere rate variable predicts a single macro variable.
          The start date is determined by data availability. Using one-
month rather than longer forecasting horizons gets at the main issue of
information content while avoiding technical problems arising from
overlapping forecast errors. We present some evidence from six-month-
ahead forecasts below which suggest that our main results are robust to
the choice of forecast horizon.
                                                                        9



of itself, and six lags of the interest rate variable. The second

prediction equation augmented the first equation by adding six lags of

CPI inflation and six lags of real M2 growth to the right-hand side of

the equation)4 The third equation augmented the first equation by

adding six lags of the growth rate of the index of leading indicators to

the right-hand side.15

      Given these estimated forecasting equations, each containing the

interest rate variable and other predictors, we tested the hypothesis

that all lags of the interest rate variable could be excluded from the

equation (that is, that the interest rate variable had no marginal

predictive power). The results are given in Table 2 (for interest

rates) and Table 3 (for interest rate spreads). For each macro variable

and each interest rate variable, the tables give three numbers; these

correspond to the probability that the interest rate variable can be

excluded from the first, second, or third prediction equation,

respectively. Low values imply strong marginal predictive power; thus,

a value of .0001 means that there is only one chance in 10,000 that the

interest rate variable does not belong in that particular prediction

equation.

      The two tables show that interest rates and spreads clearly

contain information about the future of the economy that is not included
      £4 Stock
                and Watson used a similar procedure. Only real money
growth was added in the prediction equation for inflation, since lags of
inflation were already included in the first equation. Deflation of M2
was by he CPI.
          This is the traditional index, not to be confused with the
Stock and Watson experimental index. The traditional index of leading
indicators is a weighted average of twelve macroeconomic time series
that have been found historically to be quite useful for forecasting
real activity. The available leading indicator series includes
revisions that were not available at the time of actual forecasts; since
interest rates are rarely revised, this introduces a bias against
finding marginal predictive power for interest rate variables.
                                                                             10


even in the index of leading indicators. For example, the Federal funds

race (RFF in Table 2) predicts each of the macro variables at the .0001.

level   of significance when only lags of the forecasted variable are

included; it predicts all of the macro variables at the .05 level or

better when inflation and real money growth are added; and it predicts

seven of the ten variables at close to the .01 level or better even in

the presence of the index of leading indicators.

        Which interest rate variables are the best predictors of the

economy? Direct comparisons are undertaken in the next sub-section of

the paper. However, as a simple and informal way of quantifying the

impressions given by the univariate results in Tables 2 and 3, suppose

that we assign "points" to each interest race variable as follows:       5


points for each entry in Table 2 or 3 which is less than .001; 4 points

for entries between .001 and .01;       3 points for entries between .01 and

.05; 2 points for entries between .05 and .10; and 1 point for entries

between .10 and .20. The scores arrived at in this way are as follows:



        Federal funds rate (RPT)            119 points

        3-month T-bill rate (RT3MO)           96 points

        Commercial paper rate (RCP6MO)      119 points

        10-year T-bond rate (RT1O)            85 points

        SHORT spread (RCP6MO - RT6MO)       109 points

        LONG spread (RBAA - aTlO)           105 points

        TILT spread (RT1 - RT1O)             89 points

        FUNDS spread (RFF - RT1O)           106 points
                                                                         11


         On a univariace basis, and by this informal scoring measure, the

Federal    funds rate and the commercial paper rate do better than the

Treasury bill race and the long-term bond rate. Of the spreads, the

TILT variable seems weaker than the others, which are more or less

equal.



         Multivariate comparisons

         All the interest rate variables we have looked at appear to have

significant forecasting power. Is this because all interest rates

capture basically the same    information   about the future? Or does each

interest rate or spread have separate information about the evolution of

the economy? To try to answer these questions, and to make more direct

comparisons between the different interest rate variables, a

multivariate analysis is necessary.

         In the previous section, we found that the Federal funds rate and

the commercial paper rate seemed to be better predictors than the

Treasury bill rate and the long-term Treasury bond rate. Since this has

also been indicated by previous research, we drop the two Treasury rates

from the comparison.16 This leaves six interest rate variables- -two

interest rates and four interest rate spreads--to be comparedJ7 The

historical behavior of these variables is shown in Figures 1-6; vertical

lines in those figures indicate the dates of business cycle peaks.




      Lb The short-term Treasury rate is still implicitly included,
since it is a linear combination of the commercial paper race and the
commerçal paper rate- -Treasury bill spread.
          We retain the spread between short-term and long-term Treasury
bonds (TILT) because, even though it did relatively poorly in the
univariate comparison, it has been strongly advocated as a forecasting
variable.
                                                                           12


      To see which of these variables are the best predictors, and to

try to determine the "dimensionality" of the information in interest

rates, we proceeded again by estimating in-sample forecast equations for

each of the macro variables. Each forecast equation contained a

constant, a trend, six monthly lags of the forecasted variable, and six

lags each of from between one and four interest rate variables. We

refer to a forecasting equation containing k different interest rate

variables on the right hand side (along with the constant, trend, and

lagged values of the dependent variable) as a model of size k.

      We estimated all possible models of size k for each macro variable

and for k —   1.2,3,4.   Since there were six interest variables to choose

from, this means that for each forecasted variable we estimated six

models of size one, fifteen models of size two, twenty models of size

three, and fifteen models of size four. The best-fitting (highest R2)

models for each forecasted variable and for each model size are listed

in Table 4. The best overall fits (regardless of model size) are

indicated by superscripts in the table: Superscript r indicates the

model that fir best by the adjusted a2    criterion,   superscript a the

model that is best by the Akaike information criterion, and superscript

s the model that is best by the Schwarz criterion)8

      Putting aside for a moment the question of which model size

produces the overall best equations, let us consider first how our

alternative interest rate variables compare in this head-to-head


          See for example M.B. Priestly, Soectral Analysis and Time
Series, London: Academic Press, 1981, pp. 372-6. The best equation by
each of these criteria is the one that minimizes the log of the sum of
squared residuals plus a penalty term that is increasing in the number
of right-hand side variables. The Schwarz criterion assesses the
haviest penalty for adding extra independent variables, the adjusted
R criterion the lightest.
                                                                         13



forecasting competition. Obviously, the answer depends on which macro

variable we are considering; but, generally, the SHORT variable- -the

spread between the commercial paper rate and the Treasury bill rate- -

appears to be the best predictor. When only one interest rate variable
is allowed (i.e., in the models of size one), SHORT gives the best fit

in six of the ten cases; it also appears in seven of the best size two

models.

      To see the size of SHORT's advantage as a predictor, as before let

us try to summarize the results of Table 4 by an informal point system.

Suppose we award 5 points to each interest rate or spread variable for

each time it appears in the best size-one model; 3 points for each

appearance in the best size-two model; 2 points for each time in the

best size-three model; and 1 point for each appearance in the best size-

four model. The point totals this time are:



      Federal funds rate (RFF)            27 points

      Commercial paper rate (RCP6MO)      35 points

      SHORT spread (RCP6MO - RT6MO)       69 points

      LONG spread (RZAA - RT1O)           38 points

      TILT spread (RT1      RT1O)          4 points

      These totals point fairly clearly to SHORT as the best overall of

the six interest rate predictors; this is in line with the previous

finding of Friedman and Kuttner and of Stock and Watson. At the other

end of the scale, TILT (the difference between the one-year T-bill rate

and the ten-year Treasury bond rate) appears to add little when the
                                                                         14


ocher variables are included.19     The ocher four interest rates and

spreads embody intermediate amounts of independent information. Of

these four, perhaps the most interesting is LONG, the spread between the

Baa corporate bond rate and the long-term bond race. LONG is not the

best variable in arty of the size-one models, but it appears in four of

the size-two models, eight of the size-three models, and all ten of the

size-four models. Since the correlation of LONG with the ocher interest

rate variables is low, our interpretation is that this variable, while

not containing the most "essential" information which is present in

interest rates, does contain useful additional information.

      The comparison among forecasting variables that we have just drawn

ignored the issue of the optimal size of the forecasting models (which

is closely related to the issue of the "dimensionality" of the

information in interest rates). Unfortunately, our conclusions on this

count are somewhat ambiguous.    Of the three criteria used to compare

models of different sizes, the one which puts the stiffest penalty on

extra parameters (the   Schwarz criterion) always indicated that the model
of size one was best, while the criterion with the   smallest   penalty on

extra parameters (adjusted R2) chose models of size three or (usually)

size four. (See Table 4.) The Akaike criterion, which gives art

intermediate penalty for increased model size, indicated in two cases

that the best model was of size one but in the other eight cases that

the best size was either three or four.

      In many cases the models chosen by the stringent criteria are

nested in the larger models chosen by the alternative criteria. When a

          This poor showing for TILT was not due to the inclusion in the
analysis of another term structure variable, the spread between the
Federal funds rate and the long-term bond rate (FUNDS). Exclusion of
FUNDS from the analysis gave approximately the same results for TILT.

larger model nests a smaller one, the hypothesis that the smaller model

is to be preferred can be directly tested by testing the hypothesis that

the additional forecasting variables can be excluded. We usually found

in these cases that the larger model was statistically preferred at

conventional significance levels. The fact that larger models are

typically preferred is weak evidence for the view that there are several

different types of independent information in interest rate variables,

which cannot be completely captured by using a single interest rate or

spread in a forecasting equation.



      Qut-of-samle forecasting

      While in-sample fit is one criterion for judging prediction

equations, the ultimate test of an equation is the ability to forecast

out of sample. Our experiments along this line suggested that,

unfortunately, the strong predictive power of interest rates that has

been noted is most apparent for the period before (approximately) 1980;

since that time the forecasting power of interest rates has deteriorated

significantly.20

      As a simple illustration of this point, we present results here

for only three key macro variables (industrial production, the

unemployment rate, and inflation) and for models including only one

interest rate variable. What we wanted to determine was whether the use

of an interest rate variable could improve out-of-sample forecasting for

the key macro variables, given the inclusion in the equation of lagged

values of the macro variable and of the index of leading indicators. In

          This is also true in sample. For example, if the prediction
equations reported in Tables 2-4 are re-estimated for 1961-79, the
results remain strong; if they are re-estimated for 1980-89, there is a
substantial reduction in fit.
contrast to the prediction equations in the previous section, which

focused on one-month-ahead forecasts, we consider here six-month-ahead

forecast equations.

      For each of the three macro variables, we estimated prediction

equations for samples beginning in January 1961 and ending in December

of 1971, 1974, 1977, 1980, 1983, or 1986. The dependent variable in

each case was the cumulative growth rate of the forecasted macro

variable over the previous six months. Each prediction equation

included a constant, a trend, and the seventh through twelfth lags of

the monthly growth rate of the forecasted variable, of the growth rate

of the index of leading indicators, and of one of the candidate interest

rate variables. For each forecasted variable and sample period we chose

the prediction equation that fit best in-sample. The "winning" interest

rate variable in each case is shown in Table 5; just below the name of

each interest rate variable is the probability that all lags of that

variable could be excluded from the associated prediction equation.

      Using the best prediction equations for each sample period, we

made out-of-sample forecasts for each subsequent three-year period. The

forecast periods were non-overlapping; so, for example, using the

equation estimated through December 1971, we made forecasts of the six-

month growth rates beginning in January or July of 1972, 1973, and l97.

The accuracy of these forecasts was compared to what could have been

obtained if the interest rate variable had been omitted, and the

forecasting equation had been estimated using only lagged values of the

forecasted variable and the index of leading indicators. The second

entry below each variable name in Table 5 gives the ratio of the average

absolute forecasting error obtained when the interest rate variable is
                                                                       17


included to the average absolute error obtained without the interest

rate variable. Similarly, the third entry below each variable name

gives the ratio of average squared forecast errors. Entries less than

one indicate that using the interest rate variable improves the out of

sample forecast, relative to an equation which uses only the lagged

forecast variable and the index of leading indicators.

      Table 5 shows once again that SHORT is the best interest rate

variable for predicting real activity (thus this finding appears to be

independent of the forecast horizon). Although the spread between the

Federal funds rate and the long-term bond rate (FUNDS) is best for

forecasting the nominal variable (inflation), for the two real variables

(industrial production and the unemployment rate), SHORT fits best in

ten of twelve cases. Table 5 also shows that, up through 1980, the use

of interest rate variables would have consistently improved out-of-

sample forecasts.

      After 1980, however, the story is different. Although the use of

SHORT would have helped to forecast real variables in 1984-86, in 1981-

83 and 1987-89 an equation using SHORT would have performed considerably

worse. Further, the inflation prediction equation deteriorates in all

sub-periods of the 1980s.

      The "reason" for the poor performance of SHORT in the 198Os is

that, first, this variable, like all interest rate variables, was very

volatile in 1979-83 (compare Figure 3); although there was of course a

severe recession during this time, the real economy did not exhibit

volatility proportional to that in interest races. Second, SHORT rose

in the last third of the l980s, indicating (based on previous

experience) that the economy should have gone into a mild recession; but
                                                                         18


 no recession occurred. To understand at a deeper level why the

 forecasting power of SHORT has weakened, we riced to explain why this

 variable seemed to contain so much information in the first place. To

 this issue we now turn.



       II. Why Does the Cornnercipl Paoer--Treasury Bill Spread Predict

 the Economy?

      The first main section of the paper showed that, while many

interest rates and spreads are informative about the economy, the best

single interest rate indicator among those we examined is probably the

spread between the commercial paper rate and the Treasury bill rate, or

SHORT. At this point we narrow the focus of the paper to consider

specifically why this variable seems to contain so much information

about the future of the economy. Though for concreteness we focus on

SHORT, much of the discussion to follow would apply to several of the

other interest rate indicators as well.

      As discussed in the introduction, the simplest explanation of why

SHORT forecasts the economy is that it measures the amount of default

risk perceived by the market. As such, this spread may be useful

because it summarizes available information about the likelihood of a

recession.

      A difficulty with this explanation is that SHORT would seem to be

a poorer measure of general default risk than several other available

interest rate spreads. Defaults on prime nonfinancial commercial paper

are extremely rare (much too infrequent, in our view, to plausibly

account for the 300 basis point swings in this spread that have been

observed); if obtaining an objective measure of default risk were
                                                                        19



important, a variable such as the Baa corporate bond- -Treasury bond

spread ought to do a better job in forecasting than SHORT. Indeed, the

correlation of SHORT with other indicators of default risk is remarkably

low: For example, the correlation of monthly changes in SHORT with

monthly changes in the spread between Baa corporate bonds and Treasury

bonds (LONG) is just .09 over the 1961-89 period; when the Aaa rate is

used instead of the Baa rate, the correlation is still .09, and when the

Baa- -Aaa rate differential is used, the correlation in changes with

SHORT is less than .04. James C. Van Home has shown that the

correlation between the commercial paper spread and the long-term

corporate bond spread is low even when measured company by company.21

      Although the correlation of SHORT with other default measures is

low, its correlation with various measures of monetary policy is higher;

for example, the correlation of monthly changes in SHORT with monthly

changes in the Federal funds rate over 1961-89 is .46. While of course

not necessarily proof of anything, this correlation does motivate

consideration of the possibility that SHORT is a good forecaster because

it contains information about monetary policy. We will call this

general proposition the monetary policy hypothesis. We consider two

different versions of this hypothesis; the common element of both, as

mentioned in the introduction, is that it is assumed that commercial

paper and Treasury bills are imperfect substitutes in investors'

portfolios.

      The first version of the monetary policy hypothesis might be

called the "credit crunch" story, and is due principally to Timothy Q.



          "Behavior of Default Risk Premiums for Corporate Bonds and
Commercial Paper", Journal of Business Research, December 1979, 301-13.
                                                                         20


 Cook.22    Cook's argument is that, prior to institutional changes in

 1978, monetary policy affected SHORT (and other money market spreads) by

 inducing disintermediation from the banking system. Because of

 Regulation Q-imposed deposit interest rate ceilings, during the latter

part of the 1960s and in the 1970s monetary tightening and the

associated increase in interest rates periodically led to large outflows

of deposits from banks. Depositors were motivated to withdraw, of

course, in order to obtain higher open-market yields. However, because

private money market instruments such as commercial paper could be

purchased only in large minimum denominations, during these episodes

disintermediated deposits flowed primarily into T-bills. Cook argued

that, during these credit crunch episodes, the large switches from

deposits to T-bills in private portfolios lowered the yield on T-bills

relative to commercial paper (and other money market instruments). Thus

tight money was reflected in an increase in the commercial paper- -

Treasury bill spread. The increase in this spread during the credit
crunches of 1966, 1969, and 1973-4 can easily be seen in Figure 3•23

      Why didn't the increase in the spread cause banks or other

investors not constrained by the minimum denomination restriction to

sell off their Treasury bills and buy commercial paper, thus offsetting

the switch by depositors? This did happen to some extent. But as

Cook's article explains in detail, Treasury bills are valuable to banks

          "Determinants of the Spread Between Treasury Bill Rates and
Private Sector Money Market Rates", Journal of Economics and Business,
Springummer 1981, 177-87.
       '   Itis also the case that credit crunches, because they reduced
the funds available for bank lending, led to large increases in the
issuance of commercial paper by nonfinancial firms. This would also
tend to raise the yield on commercial paper relative to Treasury
securities. See Timothy D. Rowe, "Commercial Paper" in Timothy Q. Cook
and Rowe, editors, Instruments of the Money Market, Federal Reserve Bank
of Richmond, 1986.
                                                                        21


and other investors for reasons beside their direct yield. For example,

T-bills can be used for posting margin, for collateralizing overnight

repurchase agreements, and for satisfying bank capital adequacy

requirements; commercial paper generally cannot fulfill these functions.

Thus it is reasonable that the demand for Treasury bills will be less

than perfectly elastic as the commercial paper- -Treasury bill spread

widens; that is, Treasury bills and commercial paper are imperfect

substitutes.

      Given Cook's explanation of why credit crunches caused the spread

SHORT to increase, then as long as the monetary actions which caused the

credit crunches also tended to induce recessions, SHORT should help

predict the economy. A nice feature of this explanation is that it

suggests that SHORT should no longer be strongly related to monetary

policy after the institutional changes (such as the introduction of

money market mutual funds and the removal of deposit rate ceilings)

which eliminated credit crunches; this is consistent with the finding

that SHORT is no longer a good predictor after 1980.

      The credit crunch story implies that SHORT will be related to

monetary policy only during periods when deposit rate ceilings are

binding. An alternative form of the monetary hypothesis, which lacking

a better name we call the "simple imperfect substitutability"

hypothesis, suggests that SHORT will respond to monetary policy whenever

the Federal funds rate (or some other short-term interest rate) is used

as an intermediate target.24 This story goes as follows: Suppose that,

in the process of tightening the stance of monetary policy, the Federal

Deposit 'Market' Disequilibrium", Economic Review, Federal Reserve Bank

Reserve induces a rise in the Federal funds rate. This directly

increases the cost of funds to banks. However, banks have several

principal alternatives to borrowing Federal funds:     1) They can issue

CDs or other managed liabilities; 2) they can sell some of their

holdings of Treasury securities; or 3) they can cut back on credit to

their loan customers (or raise loan interest rates).

      If Treasury bills and other assets are imperfect substitutes, then

either action (1) or action (3) by banks would tend to increase the

open-market commercial paper rate relative to the Treasury bill rate.

To sell additional CDs. the banks would have to raise the rate they

offer on that instrument; since commercial paper is a very close

substitute for CDs in investor portfolios, this would lead the

commercial paper rate to rise as well.25 If banks respond to the higher

cost of funds instead by raising the cost of credit to business loan

customers, firms that are able to do so will borrow directly from the

public by issuing additional commercial paper; this too will raise the

commercial paper rate.

      If banks sell off Treasury securities (option (2)). on the other

hand, the tendency for the spread to increase will be arrested; however,

following Cook's argument above, banks will not sell off their T-bills

in response to a modest increase in the yield differential. Thus, an

increased commercial paper- -Treasury bill spread will be associated with

tight monetary policy, which would help explain why this spread is a

useful forecaster. The decline in SHORT's forecasting power after 1980

would in this case be explained by the observations that 1) because of


          The correlation of monthly changes in the commercial paper- -
Treasury bill spread and the CD- -Treasury bill spread is .88 over 1970-
89, the period for which data were available.

changing Federal Reserve procedures, interest rates in general have been

much less reliable indicators of monetary policy since the October 1979

policy shift, and 2) financial innovation, deregulation, and

internationalization over the last decade may have increased the

substitutability among alternative short-term assets. Another

possibility is that monetary policy has simply been relatively less

important in recent years.26 Note that, relative to the credit crunch

hypothesis, this alternative view would predict a more gradual reduction

in the sensitivity of SHORT to monetary policy after 1978.

         Like the credit crunch version of the monetary policy hypothesis,

the simple imperfect substitutability version is sensitive to the

possibility that there are investors in the economy, outside of banks,

for whom commercial paper and Treasury bills are (nearly) perfect

substitutes; if these investors exist, their arbitrage activity will

cause the spread between these two assets to reflect only differences in

after-tax expected yields. Rather than discuss in the abstract whether

such arbitrage is likely to exist, however, we turn to some empirical

evidence on the relationship of interest rate spreads to Fed policy.



      The Resvonse of Interest Rate Soreads to Changes in ionetarv

Policy

      We now consider how some key interest rate spreads, including

SHORT, respond to changes in monetary policy. As will be shown, the


      Zb It may be that monetary policy has appeared less important in
recent years because the Federal Reserve has acted aggressively to
forestall any increase in inflationary expectations; with inflation
under control, there has been no need for the Fed to administer the
strong contraccionary medicine (with the resulting effects on real
activity) that it did in some previous episodes.   I thank Timothy Cook
for this suggestion.
                                                                        24


evidence is consistent with the general view that SHORT is if anything

more closely related to indicators of monetary policy than to the

economy-wide level of default risk.

      Precise dates of changes in monetary policy are, of course, not

available. Instead, we rely on two very different studies that tried to

measure shifts in Federal Reserve policy:

      The first of these studies is by Christina D. Romer and David H.

Romer.27 By a reading of Federal Reserve records, Romer and Romer

identified dates in the postwar era at which monetary policy shifted to

a tighter, anti-inflationary mode. Four of these dates (December 1968,

April 1974, August 1978, and October 1979) fall within our 1961-89

sample period. Table 6 shows the behavior of the Federal funds rate

(RFF), the commercial paper--Treasury bill spread (SHORT), the spread

between Baa and Aaa corporate bond rates (which we will call DEFAULT),

and the difference between the one-year and ten-year Treasury bond rates

(TILT) for the period from two months before until twelve months after

each Romer and Romer date. We introduce DEFAULT here in as a measure of

the behavior of perceived default risk in the economy. DEFAULT is

probably superior to LONG as a measure of default risk (although the two

spreads are highly correlated), since changes in LONG may also be

affected by changes in the value of the call option attached to most

corporate bonds.28

     The most important observation to make from Table 6 is that SHORT

and DEFAULT respond rather differently to increasing monetary tightness,

as measured by the Romer and Romer dating. Generally, SHORT rises and

falls sympathetically with the Federal funds race RFF during the

contractionary episodes; in this sense, its behavior is similar to the

term structure spread TILT, which also moves with the funds rate. In

contrast, DEFAULT typically responds only with a lag, usually not rising

until after RFF and SHORT have fallen back.29 This is a bit of evidence

for the view that SHORT responds more to monetary policy than to

changing perceptions of default risk. The fact that SHORT still appears

to respond to the funds rate in 1979, when credit crunches were no

longer a possibility, seems to favor the alternative "simple imperfect

substitutability" version of the monetary policy hypothesis.3°

      The second study of monetary policy we utilize is by Cook and

Hahn.31 Using Wall Street Journal reports, Cook and Hahn determined the

dates of approximately 75 changes in the Federal funds rate target which

occurred between September 1974 and September 1979. (This period was

chosen because, according to the authors, during this time the Federal

funds rate was a very precise indicator of monetary policy.) Using

daily data, Cook and Hahn showed that changes in the Federal funds

target caused changes in Treasury bill and bond interest rates; this

implies that the target changes conveyed new information and were not

simply passive adjustments to the existing level of rates.


          For a similar result, compare the cyclical behavior of the
Federal funds rate, the commercial paper--Treasury spread, and the
spread between Baa and government bonds (an alternative default measure)
in Figures 1, 3, and 4. RFF and SHORT tend to lead the cycle, while
LONG clearly lags. It is odd though that changes in default premia
appear to be forecastable, since if true this would imply potential
profit Rpportunities.
          A caveat is that, because of tax considerations, SHORT should
respond to the level of interest rates in general. This is analyzed
furthe 1below.

      Table 7 reports the results of regressing changes in the Federal

 funds rate (RFF), the commercial paper- -Treasury bill spread (SHORT),

the Baa bond--Aaa bond spread (DEFAULT), and the term structure spread

(TILT) against changes in the Federal funds target, as identified by

Cook and Hahn. Since the Federal funds rate did not seem always to

respond contemporaneously to the target change (which implied that there

may have been market uncertainty about the size and timing of the

change), we used weekly data and regressed changes itt the interest rare

variables against the current and lagged change in the Federal funds

target.32

      Table 7 shows that, first, the actual Federal funds rate responded

strongly to changes in the target during this period, with the

coefficients over the week of the change and the subsequent week adding

up approximately to one. The term structure variable also responded

strongly to target changes, and with high statistical significance; this

suggests that the tilt of the term structure is in fact largely driven

by monetary policy. Most interesting, though, is that the responses of

SHORT and DEFAULT to a change in the funds target are found to have been

in opposite directions during this period; with a one week lag, SHORT

responded positively and with high statistical significance to an

increase in the funds target, while DEFAULT, somewhat surprisingly,

actually fell. (The decline in DEFAULT is small but quite statistically

significant.)   The rather different responses of these two variables

are consistent with the previous observation, based on the Rower and

Romer dates, that SHORT is more closely related to monetary policy

indicators than to general default risk.



         An estimated ecuation for the commercial paoer- -Treasury bill

spread

         To get at the determinants of SHORT more directly, we specified

and estimated some simple regressions in monthly data.

         A first consideration in modelling SHORT empirically is that some

account must be taken of tax effects. Unlike commercial paper returns,

Treasury bill yields are not taxable at the state and local level. On

this account the before-tax yields to the two instruments must be

related by RCP6MO —     t RT6MO, where t > 1 is a factor measuring the tax
advantage of T-bills. This relationship implies that RCP6MO - RT6MO —

(t   -   1) RT6MO, i.e., the spread increases proportionally to the level of

the bill yield. In contrast, the ratio RCP6MO/RT6MO —      t should be
independent of the level of bill yields. We followed previous work and

used as our dependent variable the ratio RCP6MO/RT6MO rather than the

spread RCP6MO - RT6M033; however, estimated equations using the spread

as the dependent variable and including the Treasury bill yield on the

right-hand side gave similar results.

         The previous discussion suggests that the ratio RCPGMO/RT6MO

should depend on perceived default risk and the stance of monetary

policy. We used the Baa- -Aaa spread (DEFAULT) as a measure of default

risk and the Federal funds- -Treasury bond spread (FUNDS) as an indicator

of monetary policy.34 Regressions of RCP6MO/RT6MO against these two

variables yielded significant coefficients with the right sign, but the

equations exhibited high serial correlation. After correction for

first-order serial correlation, we obtained

      1) for January 1961- -June 1978 (the credit crunch" period):



      RCP6MO/RT6MO —   1.10 + .0215 DEFAULT ÷ .0347 FUNDS

      2) and for August 1978--December 1989:



      RCP6MO/RT6MO —   1.06 + .0077 DEFAULT + .0084     FUNDS

     where rho is the estimated first-order serial correlation

coefficient and t-statistics are in parentheses.35

     These results show that the ratio of commercial paper and Treasury

bill yields is positively related to default risk, as the theory

suggests, but that the relationship is rather weak.36 The relationship

          We use the spread variable FUNDS rather than the Federal funds
rate itself in order to be sure that we are not attributing to monetary
policy possible effects (such as tax effects) arising from changes in
the general level of nominal interest rates. However, for the record,
replacing FUNDS with the Federal funds rate RFF led to essentially the
same rults.
          The relatively high serial correlation suggested      the
alternative of doing the estimation in first differences.       This gave
about e same results as in the reported equations.
          Higher t-statistics for DEFAULT were obtained in      the
alternative specification with SHORT on the left-hand side      and the level
of the Treasury bill rate on the right-hand side.
                                                                        29



to monetary policy, as measured by FUNDS, is statistically much

stronger, and in the earlier period is economically significant as well.

(For example, if the Treasury bill rate is 8%, and the Federal funds

rate spread rises by one percentage point, the equation for the earlier

period implies an increase in the commercial paper- -Treasury bill spread

of about 28 basis points). In contrast, after 1978 the effect of the

Federal funds rate spread on the commercial paper- -Treasury bill spread

is only about one-fourth as large as before.

      That the relationship of SHORT to monetary policy weakens but does

not disappear after 1978 is more consistent with the simple imperfect

substitutes version of the monetary hypothesis than with the credit

crunch version. In order to make a more direct comparison of the two

versions of the monetary hypothesis, we examined the effects of adding

to the equation for RCP6MO/RT6MO a variable equal to the spread between

the six-month Treasury bill rate and the deposit rate ceiling imposed by

Regulation Q, whenever that difference was positive.37 This new

variable, called CRUNCH, is supposed to capture episodes of

dis intermediation.

      When CRUNCH and DEFAULT were included together in the equation for

RCP6MO/RT6MO, for the sample period January 1961--June 1978, CRUNCH

entered significantly and with the right sign in the OLS estimates.

However, with correction for serial correlation, CRUNCH entered with the

wrong sign. When both CRUNCH and FUNDS were included in the equation,

with correction made for serial correlation, the result was




          The ceiling rate we used was the one corresponding to time
deposits of six months to one year.
                                                                        30




      RCP6MO/RT6MO — 1.15 + .0112 DEFAULT + .0499 FUNDS

              (5.86)

      rho— .82         R2— .779



      In this equation FUNDS enters much as before but CRUNCH has the

wrong sign. Although these results should be taken oniy as suggestive,

they do tend to support the simple imperfect substitutes version of the

monetary hypothesis over the credit crunch version.



      The Information Content of SHORT

      At this point, we may return to the question of why SHORT is such

a good predictor. Some part of the reason appears to be that this

spread combines information about both monetary policy (and the state of

the money market) and expected default risk.38 As a test of this

answer, we ran one more experiment: We estimated prediction equations

for each of the ten macro variables used in Section 1, over the entire

sample period 1961-89.      Each equation included a constant, a trend, six

lags of the forecasted variable, six lags of DEFAULT (as a measure of

default risk), six lags of FUNDS (as a measure of monetary policy), and

six lags of SHORT. If SHORT is a good forecaster because it contains


          The reader will have noticed that, based on the statistical
evidence we have reported, the relationship of SHORT to default risk
looks rather weak. We don't want to push that conclusion too far:
There are periods, such as 1970 (following the Penn Central bankruptcy)
and the spring and summer of 1982 (following the collapse of Drysdale
Securities and Penn Square) in which SHORT seems to respond strongly to
fears about possible defaults.
                                                                        31


information about both default risk and monetary policy, in the presence

of DEFAULT and FUNDS its predictive power should be much weakened.

      The results are in Table 8. For each prediction equation we give

the probabilities 1) that       DEFAULT and FUNDS should be excluded from

the equation (leaving only SHORT) and 2) that SHORT should be excluded

from the equation. The results are mildly supportive of the view that

information about default and monetary policy is important for

forecasting: In nine of the ten cases, the probability that both

DEFAULT and FUNDS can be excluded from the equation is lower than the

probability that SHORT can be excluded. On the other hand, SHORT

retains significance at conventional levels in a number of the

equations, despite the presence of the other two variables. It must be

either that SHORT somehow measures default risk and monetary policy more

accurately than do DEFAULT and FUNDS, or that this variable also

contains other kinds of information.39



      III. Conclusion

      This paper began by comparing the predictive power of a number of

different interest rates and spreads. While several of these variables

were found to contain a great deal of information about the future

evolution of the economy, the spread between the commercial paper rate

and the Treasury bill rate appears to be the best predictor- -   although
this predictive power has weakened recently.



          We also considered whether SHORT remains informative when the
CD--Treasury bill spread is included in the forecasting equations; under
the imperfect substitutes story, the two spreads should contain similar
information. In this case SHORT can almost always be excluded. These
two spreads move so similarly that it doesn't appear to matter whLch is
used for forecasting.
                                                                        32


      We have made some progress toward explaining why this interest

rate spread is so informative. Besides containing information about

default risk, which is the natural first hypothesis, this spread seems

also to be a measure of monetary policy. (Indeed, if anything, the

relationship between the commercial paper- -Treasury bill spread and

monetary policy has historically been more clearcut than the spread's

relationship with default risk.) The commercial paper--Treasury bill

spread predicts well because it registers developments in both the non-

monetary and monetary sectors of the economy.

      There are at least two possible explanations for why the

predictive power of the commercial paper- -Treasury bill was lower in the

1980's than previously. First, a number of changes in Federal Reserve

operating procedures during the decade reduced the reliability of

interest rates in general as indicators of the stance of monetary

policy. Second, financial innovation, deregulation, and international

integration may have increased the substitutability among various money

market instruments; all else equal, this would act to reduce the

sensitivity of interest rate spreads to monetary policy.

      Whether the commercial paper- -Treasury bill spread will be as

useful a predictor in the future as it was in the past depends very much

on which of the two explanations just given is the more important. If

the first is correct, then to the extent that the Federal Reserve

returns to its earlier emphasis on interest rates as targets or

indicators, the predictive power of the spread (and of other interest

rate variables) should return. If the second explanation is the right

one, and commercial paper and Treasury bills have become effectively

perfect substitutes, then the spread should not be a useful predictor in
                                                                   33


the future. Unforturately, it is too soon to tell which of these

explanations should be given the greater weight.

      Note: For each variable and forecasting period, the interest rate variable
named is the one that fit best using data prior to the forecasting period.
(Variable names are defined in Table 1.) The number in parentheses is the
probability that all lags of the named interest rate variable could be excluded from
the prediction equation. The next two numbers are the ratios of (respectively) the
average absolute forecasting errors and the average squared forecasting errors
between equations with and without the interest rate variable, as discussed in the
text.
