                                         ABSTRACT

In 1966, Southern hospitals were barred from participating in the Medicare program unless they
discontinued their long-standing practice of racial segregation. Using data from five Deep South
states and exploiting county-level variation in Medicare certification dates, we find that gaining
access to an ostensibly integrated hospital had no effect on the Black-White infant mortality gap,
although it may have discouraged small numbers of Black mothers from giving birth at home
attended by a midwife. These results are consistent with descriptions of the federal hospital
desegregation campaign as producing only cosmetic changes and illustrate the limits of anti-
discrimination policies imposed upon reluctant actors.

1. INTRODUCTION

       In the Jim Crow Era, Southern hospitals were racially segregated. Hospitals that focused on

providing care to Black patients (i.e., "Black hospitals") were, with a few exceptions, understaffed

and lacked the latest medical technology (Thomas 2006; McBride 2018, pp. 49-50). White-run

hospitals could be "biracial" but Black patients were physically separated from their White

counterparts and did not receive equal care (Reynolds 2004; Thomas 2006). Eradicating this

entrenched system of racial discrimination and exclusion was a key objective of the American Civil

Rights Movement (Washington et al. 2009).

       Under political and legal pressure, a handful of hospitals in the South desegregated between

1962 and 1965 (Brown-Nagin 2011, p. 207; Smith 2016). Most, however, remained racially

segregated until 1966, when the Johnson administration threatened to withhold Medicare funding

from hospitals not in compliance with the Civil Rights Act. The newly created Office of Equal

Health Opportunity (OEHO) was tasked with determining whether hospitals were in compliance.

Beginning in April of 1966, OEHO investigators, working closely with civil rights activists, visited

hospitals across the country with the goal of identifying, and correcting, discriminatory practices

(Nash 1968; Reynolds 1997). Six months later, more than 7,000 hospitals had been certified by the

OEHO as eligible to receive Medicare funds; two hundred and fourteen Southern hospitals opted to

remain racially segregated, forgoing all federal funding (Nash 1968; Reynolds 1997).

       The federal campaign to desegregate Southern hospitals has been described as a "powerful

force for equal treatment" (Smith 2016, p. 181) and "among the most important Civil Rights

achievements in U.S. history" (Sternberg 2015, para. 2), yet, with one prominent exception, its

effects on Black health are woefully understudied. Using data from Mississippi, Almond et al. (2006)

                                                        1
show that the Black postneonatal mortality rate (PNMR) fell faster in counties that were served by a

Medicare-eligible hospital than in counties that were not.1 Almond et al. (2006) conclude that

hospital desegregation saved thousands of Black lives and contributed substantially to the narrowing

of the national Black-White postneonatal mortality gap but these authors do not account for the

strong downward trend in the Black PNMR.

           In this paper, we use data from the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) to examine the

effects of the hospital desegregation campaign on Black infant mortality and the decision of where

to give birth (i.e., at home or in the hospital). By focusing on five states in which support for

segregationist policies and practices was especially staunch (Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana,

Mississippi, and South Carolina), we are able to leverage sufficient cross-county variation in

Medicare certification dates to distinguish the effects of hospital desegregation from secular trends.

We find no evidence that having access to a Medicare-eligible hospital reduced Black infant

mortality. Likewise, there is no evidence that the hospital desegregation campaign appreciably

accelerated the trend towards in-hospital births among Southern Black mothers originally

documented by Chay and Greenstone (2000).

           The litmus test for Medicare eligibility was random assignment. OEHO investigators

required that patients be assigned to physicians and hospital beds without regard to race, color, or

national origin (Smith 2016, pp. 110-111). OEHO investigators could not, and were not asked to,

address fundamental structural barriers that prevented minority patients from accessing high-quality

healthcare (Smith 1998; Sarrazin et al. 2009; Chandra et al. 2017). Nor could they expunge difficult-

to-observe racial attitudes and modes of communication that, to this day, shape the delivery of

healthcare in the United States (Cooper et al. 2003; Alsan et al. 2019; Greenwood et al. 2020; Hill et



1   The PNMR is the number of deaths among infants ages one through 11 months per 1,000 live births.

al. 2020). In 1972, the Government Accounting Office (GAO) released an assessment of hospital

compliance with the Civil Rights Act. The report concluded that the hospital desegregation

campaign had virtually eliminated "overt" racial discrimination, while more "subtle" forms of racial

discrimination persisted (Comptroller General 1972, p. 10). Our results suggest that correcting

overtly discriminatory practices on the part of Southern hospitals was simply not enough to ensure

that Black infants experienced the same health outcomes as their White counterparts. More

generally, our results are consistent with an argument from the anti-discrimination literature that

punitive actions against employers are of limited effectiveness because they do not address

underlying biases and prejudices (Valfort 2018).

       The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we provide historical

context, discuss previous studies, and briefly describe some of the challenges faced by minorities

today when trying to gain access to high-quality hospital care. In Section 3, we describe our

methods and identification strategy, report our principal results, and document why our estimates

are so different from those reported by Almond et al. (2006). In Section 4, we estimate the effect of

the hospital desegregation campaign on the choice of where to give birth. Section 5 concludes.



2. BACKGROUND

2.1. Hospital desegregation

       Information on the extent of segregation in Southern hospitals is available from a 1955

survey coordinated by Cornely (1956, 1957). Sixty-seven urban general hospitals in seven Southern

states were assessed by local affiliates of the National Urban League. Only four of the 67 hospitals

admitted Black patients without restrictions. The remaining hospitals either refused to admit Black




                                                   3
patients, had segregated wards, or had other "modifications of established segregated or

discriminatory practices" (Cornely 1956, p. 1079). 2

         When the Civil Rights Act passed in 1964, nobody was certain how it would impact the

health care system. The amendments to the Social Security Act that would eventually establish the

Medicare and Medicaid programs had yet to be taken up by Congress, and most observers believed

that the process of hospital desegregation would proceed slowly, dependent upon private initiative,

voluntary compliance, and lawsuits brought by the victims of discrimination (Kenny 1965; Smith

2016, pp. 84-86; Largent 2018). 3

         Initially, the Johnson administration focused on encouraging hospitals to voluntarily comply

with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which banned the allocation of federal funds to entities that

discriminated on the basis of race (Largent 2018). This strategy, however, was only partially

successful. In July-October of 1965, the U.S. Civil Rights Commission surveyed 39 hospitals in

Southern and border states with the goal of determining whether they were in compliance. The

Commission found that two hospitals, both of which were located in Maryland, had "desegregated

substantially" before the passage of the Civil Rights Act; 11 of the 39 hospitals had made

"significant changes in their discriminatory patterns of patient assignments, staff assignments, and


2 See Cornely (1956, pp. 1078-1079) and Cornely (1957, pp. 8-9) for more details on how the survey was conducted and
its results. Seventy-two hospitals in 3 border states (Maryland, Missouri, and Oklahoma) were also included in the study.
Ten of these 72 hospitals admitted Black patients without restrictions (Cornely 1957, p. 9). Thomas (2006) describes the
availability of North Carolina hospital beds in 1960: there were 919 hospital beds in Black hospitals and 2,905 beds in
White-only hospitals; in "biracial hospitals," there were 1,758 beds reserved for Black patients and 8,822 beds reserved
for White patients. According to Thomas (2006, p. 854), "[b]y 1960 the vast majority of both black and white patients
were being treated in biracial hospitals, whereas nearly half of white hospitals had either opened their doors to black
patients or shut down since the end of World War II."

3Joseph Califano Jr., who served as special assistant to President Johnson, was interviewed by Smith (2016, p. 82).
According to Califano,

         No one understood Johnson's plan. The Civil Rights was passed in 1964 before the enactment of all
         the domestic programs the following year. No one anticipated the massive flow of federal funding
         that would begin in 1965. If the civil rights bill had been pushed after all of that subsequent
         legislation, it would have never passed.

access to public facilities" since its passage, while the other 26 still engaged in discriminatory

practices (U.S. Civil Rights Commission 1966, p. 6). For instance,


           At the time of the Commission investigation, James Walker Memorial Hospital in
           Wilmington, North Carolina, which had been involved in a decade of litigation over
           its segregated facilities, continued to maintain a building for Negro patients at the
           rear of the main facility. Negro patients were wheeled from the separate structure
           into the main facility for surgery and other services. Some Negro patients were
           housed in segregated wards in the main building. The hospital also made staff
           assignments according to race although the administrator said some Negro nurses
           had been assigned to care for white patients since the passage of the Civil Rights Act
           (U.S. Civil Rights Commission 1966, p. 8). 4


The Commission concluded that the pace of hospital desegregation was largely determined by local

factors (e.g., the hospital "administrator or board") as opposed to efforts on the part of the Public

Health Service (PHS), which was, in theory, responsible for ensuring Title VI compliance (U.S. Civil

Rights Commission 1966, p. 14). 5

           Under increasing pressure from civil rights groups, a profound shift in the federal

government's strategy occurred in the beginning of 1966: hospitals that wanted to participate in the

soon-to-be launched Medicare program would have to be certified as Title VI compliant and the

OEHO (which was created in February of 1966 and was under the auspices of the PHS) would be in

charge of the certification process. The OEHO quickly promulgated a detailed set of guidelines for

participating hospitals. The litmus test of Title VI compliance was random assignment: the new




4   To take another example of discriminatory practices documented by the Commission, the

           Macon Hospital in Georgia had made only minimal changes to comply with Title VI provisions.
           After passage of the Civil Rights Act, the hospital converted its formerly all-Negro building into a
           facility for welfare patients only. Negros account for 60 to 70 percent of the welfare patient load. No
           Negro and white patient occupied the same room or ward in this building at the time of the
           Commission staff visit (U. S. Civil Rights Commission 1966, pp. 8-9).
5As late as April of 1966, the OEHO estimated that only 25 percent of hospitals in the South (and only 11 percent of
hospital beds) were in compliance with Title VI (Reynolds 1997).


                                                             5
OEHO guidelines stipulated that patients were to be assigned to hospital rooms, wards, and

buildings "without regard to race, color, or national origin"; likewise, medical staff were to be

matched with patients "without regard to race, color, or national origin" (Smith 2016, pp. 110-111). 6

         The OEHO trained hundreds of investigators to conduct on-site inspections (Griffin 1966;

Smith 2016). Working closely with local civil rights activists and Black hospital workers, they

identified, and tried to correct, discriminatory practices. Although there are accounts of medical

staff and administrators adopting the Title VI guidelines with little fanfare (Nash 1968; Brown-

Nagin 2011; Smith 2005, 2016, pp. 120-128), the demands of the OEHO investigators were

occasionally met with fierce resistance (Smith 2005, 2016, pp. 120-128). In fact, 214 Southern

hospitals decided that they would forgo federal funding rather than integrate their facilities (Nash

1968; Reynolds 1997).

         By November of 1966, the OEHO had certified more than 7,000 hospitals as Medicare-

eligible (Nash 1968; Reynolds 1997). 7 A few months later, the OEHO was dismantled and

enforcement of the Title VI guidelines fell to the Office of Civil Rights (OCR). Under the OCR,

enforcement was not nearly as strict as it had been under the OEHO (U.S. House of

Representatives 1973; Quadagno 2000). The OCR relied heavily on complaints of discrimination

made by Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries to identify non-compliant hospitals; on-site reviews

were rare and there is anecdotal evidence of ostensibly desegregated hospitals blatantly flouting Title

VI guidelines (U.S. House of Representatives 1973; Quadagno 2000). 8


6Hospitals were also required to notify employees and persons previously excluded from services that they were in
compliance with the Civil Rights Act (Reynolds 2004).

7For more information on the history of hospital desegregation and the efforts of the OEHO, see Nash (1968),
Reynolds (1997, 2004) and Smith (2016).
8 There were only 300 on-site hospital reviews conducted by the OCR in 1971 (Comptroller General 1972). In hearings

before the Civil Rights and Constitutional Rights Subcommittee (U.S. House of Representatives 1973), Jeffrey Merrill, a
representative of the American Public Health Association (APHA), testified that:


                                                           6
         In July of 1972, the GAO released an assessment of hospital Title VI compliance. Focusing

on four metropolitan areas (Atlanta, Birmingham, Detroit, and Los Angeles), it described the federal

hospital desegregation campaign as having all but eliminated "overt" discrimination (Comptroller

General 1972). GAO investigators did, however, observe that a "disproportionately large share of

minority patients received their healthcare at government-owned hospitals" and that private

hospitals routinely denied staff privileges to Black physicians (Comptroller General 1972, p. 10).

The practice of denying privileges to Black physicians effectively barred their patients, who were

themselves predominantly Black, from being admitted to private hospitals. 9 According to GAO

investigators, public hospitals "attracted" minorities because they provided low-cost care to indigent

patients, were easily accessible, and had a history of treating minority patients.10



2.2. Hospital desegregation and the Black-White infant mortality gap

         Over the past century, the Black infant mortality rate (IMR) in the United States has fallen at

an average annual rate of 2.6 percent (Singh and Yu 2019). However, because the White IMR has



         Last year the APHA was involved in a study in Mississippi where we had the opportunity to examine
         a lot of hospitals within the delta area. There were two things we found out through this study. One
         is...that, on a given day when the hospital is forewarned of a visit by some sort of enforcement
         agency, beds are shifted and it is very simple to shift a bed on wheels. And so coincidentally, on that
         and maybe for a couple of days, the hospital appears totally integrated.

9 Only 93 Black physicians were practicing medicine in Atlanta and Birmingham. Black patients in these cities relied

heavily on outpatient clinics run by public hospitals, and the Black physicians who worked at these clinics and public
hospitals did not want (or did not use) staff privileges at private hospitals because "of (1) loyalty to predominantly black-
patient hospitals..., (2) the desire to have their patients near their offices, or (3) the time and expense of making rounds
at several hospitals" (Comptroller General 1972, pp. 32-33).

10There were 24 Medicare-certified hospitals in Atlanta and Birmingham when the GAO conducted its investigation, all
but two of which were private. In Atlanta, the county-run Grady Memorial Hospital served fully 58 percent of all Black
patients during the period July 19-26, 1971. In Birmingham, University Hospital served 49 percent of Black patients.
Five of the 22 private hospitals in Atlanta and Birmingham admitted a combined total of 12 Black patients and 442
White patients. According to the report, most Black patients in Atlanta and Birmingham knew that Medicare and
Medicaid would cover their costs at private hospitals (Comptroller General 1972). Quadagno (2000) describes Black
patients as fearing that they would be refused care at hospitals with a long tradition of exclusively serving White patients
despite the fact that these hospitals were certified and ostensibly desegregated.


                                                              7
fallen at a faster rate (3.1 percent), the Black-White IMR ratio actually increased (Singh and Yu

2019). 11 Intriguingly, the Black-White IMR ratio fell by 13 percent during the period 1965-1971,

from 1.9 to 1.65 (Chay and Greenstone 2000). Although there had been smaller, one- and two-year

reductions in the Black-White IMR ratio since the end of World War II, this was the first sustained

decline for 20 years.

         Almond et al. (2006) attribute much of this decline to the hospital desegregation campaign in

the South. They reach this conclusion by estimating the effects of the hospital desegregation

campaign on postneonatal mortality rates (PNMRs) by race in Mississippi. Almond et al. (2006)

show that the Black PNMR fell much faster in counties served by at least one Medicare-eligible

hospital as compared to counties served by hospitals that refused federal funding. The estimated

effect on the Black PNMR is large enough to explain the entire convergence between Black and

White IMRs in Mississippi over the period 1965-1971. 12

         Opposition to the hospital desegregation campaign was particularly fierce in Mississippi

(Reynolds 1997; Smith 2005). Despite this opposition, most Black mothers in Mississippi had the

option of delivering their baby at a Medicare-eligible hospital by the end of 1967. 13 By the end of

1969, all but five counties in the state were served by at least one Medicare-eligible hospital (or their

residents had the option of receiving care at a certified hospital in a bordering county). This

"modest variation" in Medicare certification dates precluded Almond et al. (2006, p. 15) from


11 In 1916, the Black IMR was 184.9 per 1,000 live births and the White IMR was 99.0; by 2017, the Black IMR had
fallen to 10.8 per 1,000 live births and the White IMR had fallen to 4.9 (Singh and Yu 2019).

12Almond et al. (2006, p. 18) conclude that the "integration of hospitals in the rural South accounted for...25% (based
on all post-neonatal fatalities) of the national 7.5 per 1,000 decline in the national black PNMR between 1965 and 1975."
See also Finkelstein and McKnight (2008). Using data from the Mississippi Delta, these authors examine the effect of
having access to a Medicare-eligible hospital on mortality among the elderly. They find that access to a Medicare-eligible
hospital was associated with a 35 percent reduction in non-White elderly pneumonia mortality.
13See Appendix Table A1. In 1967, 45 out of 82 Mississippi counties were served by a Medicare-certified hospital, while
12 counties had no hospital (certified or otherwise) but their residents had the option of receiving care at a certified
hospital in a bordering county. During the period 1955-1975, 64 percent of Black births occurred in these 57 counties.


                                                            8
including year fixed effects in their regressions.14 One of the advantages of using data from five

Deep South states, as opposed to only Mississippi, is that we observe more than twice as many

counties whose residents gained access to a Medicare-eligible hospital after 1967, which allows us to

distinguish the effects of access from the secular Black IMR trend.

         Aside from the pioneering work of Almond et al. (2006), we do not know a great deal about

the relationship between hospital desegregation and health. Researchers have, however, attempted

to gauge the effects of school desegregation on various educational outcomes. These effects are, a

priori, difficult to sign (Reber 2007; Reardon and Owens 2014), although several studies provide

evidence that Black students benefit from attending integrated schools (Guryan 2004; Reber 2010,

2011; Johnson 2011). 15 There is also a large literature on anti-discrimination policies and labor

market outcomes. In a review of this literature, Valfort (2018) concludes that the "punitive

approach" (i.e., imposing sanctions on employers who discriminate) is not particularly effective

because it does not counter prejudice or limit the expression of cognitive biases.



2.3. Other determinants of the Black-White infant mortality gap

         The Black-White infant mortality gap has existed in the United States since at least the turn

of the 20th century, when reliable mortality data by race first became available (Ewbank 1987). Its



14Specifically, Almond et al. (2006, p. 15) note that their estimates become statistically insignificant when year fixed
effects are included on the right-hand side of their regression "due to the difficulty of separately identifying the year and
event time fixed effects with the modest variation in Medicare certification dates."

15 For instance, Guryan (2004) finds that desegregation led to an almost three percentage-point decline in the dropout
rate of Black students but had no appreciable effect on White dropout rates. Reber (2010, 2011) finds that, after
desegregation, predominantly Black school districts in Louisiana received more funding and were able to reduce class
sizes, while funding and class sizes in predominantly White school districts did not change. Johnson (2011) finds that an
additional year of court-ordered desegregation led to a one percentage-point increase in Black high school graduation
rates but had no effect on White high school graduation rates. For more information on the relationship between
school desegregation and student outcomes, see Ashenfelter et al. (2006), Billings et al. (2014), Bergman (2016), and
Gamoran and An (2016). Relatedly, Thompson (2020) finds that school desegregation led to a 42 percent reduction in
Black teacher employment.


                                                              9
causes are still being researched, and debated, today (Elder et al. 2016; Wallace et al. 2017; Smith et

al. 2018; Anderson et al. 2019; Taylor et al. 2019).

         Relatively crude measures of socioeconomic status (e.g., mother's age, education, and marital

status) can explain approximately one-third of the Black-White infant mortality gap (Elder et al.

2014; Elder et al. 2016). The other two-thirds of the gap are attributable to myriad factors,

including, but not limited to, local geography, hospital quality, physician behavior and characteristics,

and government policies. 16 Isolating the effects of racial discrimination has proven to be especially

challenging (Wallace et al. 2017).

         Greenwood et al. (2020) examine newborns delivered in Florida hospitals during the period

1992-2015. Matching the race of the attending physician to that of the newborns, these authors find

that Black newborns cared for by a Black physician are more likely to survive than those cared for by

a White physician. The reverse, however, is not true: physician race is essentially unrelated to White

newborn mortality. Because differences in hospital and physician quality do not explain these results

(the authors control for hospital and physician fixed effects), Black physicians appear to be

systematically outperforming their White colleagues for other, difficult-to-measure reasons.

         Racial prejudice could explain why Black physicians are better at treating Black newborns

than their White counterparts. It is also possible that the estimates in Greenwood et al. (2020) are

driven by mistrust between Black patients and their White physicians. Cooper et al. (2003) provide

evidence that healthcare visits are shorter when Black patients are assigned to a White, as opposed to




16Elder et al. (2014, 2016) include state indicators on the right-hand side of their regressions, but local geography can be
an important obstacle to accessing high-quality healthcare. As noted by Chandra and Skinner (2004) and Chandra et al.
(2017), providing health insurance and strictly enforcing Title VI does not make it any easier for minorities to access
hospitals that are located far from where they live and work.

care when randomly assigned to a Black physician. 17



3. CERTIFIED HOSPITAL ACCESS AND INFANT MORTALITY

         Figure 1 shows IMRs by race and year in the Deep South for the period 1959-1973. 18 The

Black and White IMRs are both trending downward, but the Black IMR trend is clearly steeper,

especially after 1966.

         Did the hospital desegregation campaign, which was launched in 1966, contribute to the

narrowing of the Black-White infant mortality gap shown in Figure 1? Black Southerners were

making significant economic progress both in absolute terms and relative to Whites throughout the

1960s (Freeman 1981; Donohue and Heckman 1991; Wright 1999). Other government

interventions, including the rollout of Community Health Centers (CHCs) and the implementation

of state Medicaid programs, could have also contributed to the observed trends (Goldman and

Grossman 1988; Bailey and Goodman-Bacon 2015; Goodman-Bacon 2018). 19




17See also Hill et al. (2020) and Alsan and Wanamaker (2018). Hill et al. (2020) find that being attended by a same-race
physician in the emergency department is associated with a 13 percent reduction in mortality. Alsan and Wanamaker
(2018, p. 412) find that proximity to the Tuskegee study had long-lasting effects on whether Blacks "trust a doctor's
judgement and whether they suspect that the medical establishment will deny them necessary treatment or services."
18
  In 1972, due to personnel and budgetary restrictions, the mortality counts from the Multiple-Cause-of-Death Files
were based on information obtained from a 50-percent sample of death records, as opposed to the complete census of
death records as in other years (U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare 1976). In practice, this means
aggregating the mortality counts to the county level and multiplying by two.

19The rollout of CHCs across the South began in 1965. Bailey and Goodman-Bacon (2015, p. 1075) note that "CHCs
could have facilitated the diagnosis of potentially lethal diseases and afford medications for treatment, but they were not
substitutes for hospitals' acute care for sick infants." In 1966, Louisiana became the first state in the Deep South to
implement Medicaid. It was followed shortly thereafter by Georgia (1967), South Carolina (1968), Mississippi (1969),
and Alabama (1970). Goodman-Bacon (2018) provides evidence that the introduction of state Medicaid programs
reduced non-White infant mortality. Below, we report separate pre- and post-Medicaid estimates of the effect of having
access to a desegregated (i.e., Title VI-compliant) hospital. Hospitals that were certified as Title VI-compliant could
participate in both programs.


                                                            11
         To distinguish the effect of the hospital desegregation campaign from the effects of Black

economic progress and other government interventions, we begin by estimating the following

baseline regression by race:



(1)                                   IMRct = 0 + 1Medicarect + vc + ct,



where c indexes counties and t indexes years.20 Our independent variable of interest, Medicarect, is

equal to one if Black mothers in county c during year t had access to a general or maternity hospital

that was certified as Medicare-eligible (and is equal to zero otherwise). It is based on when the first

hospital in county c was listed as Medicare-eligible in "Guide Issues," published by the Journal of the

American Hospital Association (JAHA).21 If there were no hospitals in county c, then access was

determined based on whether there was a certified hospital operating in a bordering county. County

fixed effects, vc, account for determinants of infant mortality that were constant over time.

         Estimates of 1 by race are presented in columns (1) and (5) of Table 1. Regressions are

weighted by live births and standard errors are corrected for clustering at the county level (Bertrand

et al. 2004). Consistent with the results of Almond et al. (2006), we find that having access to a

Medicare-eligible hospital is associated with substantially fewer Black infant deaths. Specifically,

certified hospital access is associated with a 13.3 reduction in the Black IMR, which is 28 percent of




20While we report estimates based on the IMR throughout, results are similar if we take the natural log of one plus the
IMR or the quartic root of the IMR. The quartic root function has been used by other researchers to account for zeros
(Thomas et al. 2006; Tarozzi et al. 2014; Ashraf et al. 2015).

21The Medicare program was officially launched on July 1, 1966. The 1967 JAHA Guide Issue lists Medicare-eligible
hospitals through February of 1967. If any hospital in county c was certified as Medicare-eligible in 1966 or in
January/February of 1967, then the access indicator is equal to 1 in t = 1967, 1968, ..., 1973. The 1968 JAHA Guide
Issue lists Medicare-eligible hospitals through February of 1968. If the 1967 Guide Issue did not list any hospital in
county c as certified but the 1968 Guide Issue did, then the access indicator is equal to 1 in t = 1968, 1969, ..., 1973, and
so forth. See the notes to Appendix Table B1 for more details.


                                                             12
the pre-treatment mean. Having access to a certified hospital is associated with a 4.9 reduction in

the White IMR, or 21 percent of the pre-treatment mean.

         Because year fixed effects are not included on the right-hand side of (1), we cannot

distinguish between the effects of having access to a Medicare-eligible hospital and common shocks

to IMRs across the Deep South.22 Exploiting cross-county variation in Medicare-certification dates,

we estimate:



(2)                                  IMRct = 0 + 1Medicarect + vc + t + ct,



where the year fixed effects are represented by t.

         The results, which are reported in columns (2) and (6) of Table 1, provide little evidence that

the hospital desegregation campaign was effective. In fact, the estimate of 1 for Black infants

becomes positive and statistically insignificant at conventional levels. The estimate of 1 for White

infants is still negative but is only half as large as the estimate shown in column (5).

          Including a vector of county-level controls, Xct, and county-specific linear trends on the

right-hand side of the estimating equation does not appreciably affect the basic pattern of results.23

Access to a certified hospital is associated with a 1.4 increase in the Black IMR and a 2.0 decrease in



22 Appendix Table A1 shows the number of counties in the Deep South in which Black mothers had access to a
Medicare-eligible hospital by state and year. In 1967, Black mothers had access in 335 out of the 403 Deep South
counties in our sample; by 1968, they had access in 378 of these counties; and by 1969 they had access in 385. Black
mothers in the remaining 18 out of 403 counties gained access to Medicare-certified hospitals between 1970 and 1973.
Fifteen Deep South counties are missing from our sample. Nine Alabama counties are excluded due to missing data on
live Black births. Six Georgia counties are excluded because no live Black births were recorded during the sample
period.

23 The controls are listed in Appendix Table A2, along with descriptive statistics, definitions, and sources. They include
the percent of the county population that was 25 years of age or older with a high school diploma, direct health and
hospital expenditures by the county government, and the county employment to population ratio. Missing values were
calculated via linear interpolation and extrapolation. Appendix Table B2 lists the sources used to collect data on county-
level live births.


                                                           13
the White IMR. Although statistically insignificant at conventional levels, these estimates are

reasonably precise. Based on the lower bound of the 90 percent confidence interval of the estimate

of 1 shown in column (4), certified hospital access did not reduce the Black IMR by more than 1.00,

or only 7 percent of the actual change in the Black IMR between 1965 and 1973. 24



3.1. Event-study estimates

         Regression models such as (2) can produce biased estimates if the effect of treatment grows

stronger (or weaker) over time (Goodman-Bacon 2019). To address this issue, we report event-

study estimates of the relationship between having access to a Medicare-certified hospital and IMRs

in Table 2 (Sun and Abraham forthcoming). Replacing the access indicator with a series of its leads

and lags also allows us to explore whether the parallel trends assumption holds. Because we have no

strong priors about the correct lag structure, we flexibly estimate the effect of having access one,

two, three, and four or more years after treatment (i.e., the year in which certification occurred).

         The first column of Table 2 shows event-study estimates for Black infants produced without

including year fixed effects. In year 0 (i.e., the year of treatment), having access to a Medicare-

certified hospital is associated with a 3.21 reduction in the Black IMR. After year 0, the estimated

effect of having access to a Medicare-eligible hospital steadily becomes stronger. Four or more years

after treatment, access is associated with 13.3 fewer Black infant deaths per 1,000 births, which is

very close to the largest event-study estimates reported by Almond et al. (2006). The pre-treatment

trends, however, cast doubt on whether these estimates should be given a causal interpretation: the

positive and significant coefficient estimates for the indicators 3 Years Before Medicare and 4+ Years



24 During the period 1965-1973, the Black IMR fell from 45.7 to 31.3, and the White IMR fell from 23.1 to 18.9 (Figure
1). Based on the upper bound of the 90 percent confidence interval of the estimate of 1, certified hospital access did
not increase the White IMR by more than 0.097.


                                                          14
Before Medicare suggest that the post-treatment estimates are simply a continuation of the pre-

treatment trend.

           In column (2) of Table 2, we report event-study estimates controlling for year fixed effects.

With their inclusion, the pre-treatment trend for the Black IMR disappears but the estimated post-

treatment coefficients are small, statistically insignificant, and (with one exception) positive. In

columns (3) and (4), we first include Xct and then county-specific linear trends on the right-hand side

of the estimating equation. Three years after treatment, having access to a Medicare-eligible hospital

is associated with a (statistically insignificant) 3.21 reduction in the Black IMR; 4 years after being

treated, access is associated with a (statistically insignificant) 5.79 reduction in the Black IMR. These

estimates, although negative, appear to be a continuation of a pre-treatment trend with no evidence

of acceleration after year 0. Figure 2 plots the coefficient estimates (and their 90 percent confidence

intervals) reported in columns (3) and (4) of Table 2.

           In the remaining columns of Table 2, we report event-study estimates for the White IMR.

The fully specified regression model produces a similar pattern of results as was found for the Black

IMR. Three years after treatment, access is associated with a (statistically insignificant) 4.64

reduction in the White IMR; 4+ years after being treated, access is associated with a (statistically

insignificant) 3.91 reduction in the White IMR. 25 We view these estimates as evidence that both

event-studies are simply capturing common determinants of infant health as opposed to the effects

of the federal desegregation campaign.




25   Figure 3 plots the coefficient estimates shown in columns (7) and (8) for the White IMR.


                                                             15
3.2. Mortality by cause

         From 1959 to 1973, the Black IMR fell from 50.8 to 31.3 (Figure 1). Nearly half of this

reduction can be attributed to fewer deaths during the postneonatal period (Figure 4). Almond et al.

(2006) argue that, given the medical technology available in the 1960s, gaining access to a Medicare-

certified hospital should have had a more pronounced effect on postneonatal, as opposed to

neonatal, mortality.26

         In columns (1) through (4) of Table 3, we explore this possibility by distinguishing between

the Black neonatal mortality rate (NMR) and the Black PNMR. Regardless of whether we control

for county-specific linear trends, there is little evidence that gaining access to a Medicare-eligible

hospital reduced either the Black NMR or PNMR. The estimated coefficients are small, statistically

insignificant, and positive.

         Pneumonia/influenza and diarrhea were two of the leading causes of mortality among U.S.

infants during the sample period (U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare 1963).

Figures 5 and 6 show pneumonia/influenza and diarrhea mortality rates, respectively, for infants in

the Deep South by race and year.27 From 1959 through 1965, there is little evidence that deaths

from these causes were on a downward trend. However, Black infant mortality from diarrhea began

to fall after 1965, followed by Black infant mortality from pneumonia/influenza the next year. In

the remaining columns of Table 3, we formally test whether the campaign to desegregate hospitals



26Technologies benefitting premature and low-weight infants were not developed and diffused widely until the 1970s
and 1980s (e.g., improvements in mechanical ventilation and the adoption of local neonatal intensive care units)
(Almond et al. 2006).

27Infants suffering from severe diarrhea can be rehydrated intravenously or orally in the hospital and administered
antibiotics (Koletzko and Osterrieder 2009). Influenza can lead to secondary bacterial infections (including pneumonia)
that are treatable with antibiotics (Munoz 2002). Pneumonia and gastroenteritis "were readily and necessarily" treated in
hospitals during the 1960s (Almond et al. 2006, p. 12). Appendix Table B3 lists the International Classification of
Disease (ICD) codes that were used to generate infant mortality counts by cause. During the period under study, the
ICD underwent its 8th revision, taking effect in 1968. Because these changes applied to all counties in our sample, they
are captured by the year fixed effects.


                                                           16
contributed to these trends. Again, the estimates of 1 are small, statistically insignificant, and

positive. For instance, according to the fully specified model, having access to a certified hospital is

associated with a 0.24 increase in the diarrhea mortality rate among Black infants.



3.3. Extensions and robustness checks

            Up to this point in the analysis, we have defined treatment based on when the first hospital

in county c was certified as Medicare-eligible. Using information available in the JAHA Guide

Issues, we explore alternative measures of treatment in the first three columns of Table 4.

Specifically, we define treatment based on the following thresholds: whether 25 percent (or more) of

the hospital beds in county c belonged to Medicare-eligible hospitals, whether 50 percent of the

hospital beds belonged to Medicare-eligible hospitals, and whether 75 percent of the hospital beds

belonged to Medicare-eligible hospitals. Results based on these alternative specifications provide no

evidence that the Black IMR was related to hospital desegregation. 28

            Next, we distinguish between counties in which the first hospital was certified as Medicare-

eligible in 1966-1967 and those in which the first hospital was certified in 1968 or later. Presumably,

non-compliance after 1967 is indicative of greater racial animus. 29 The results, which are reported in

column (4) of Table 4, suggest that, regardless of when certification occurred, Title VI compliance

had no effect on the Black IMR.


28   Appendix Table A3 lists the proportion of treated counties by state and year based on these alternative thresholds.
29 Smith (2005) describes the process of desegregating the two private hospitals in Jackson, Mississippi. St. Dominic
Hospital was part of a hospital system based in Springfield, Illinois. It quickly complied with Title VI guidelines and
began receiving Medicare payments in July of 1966. By contrast, Baptist Hospital's board of trustees was composed of
"white Mississippians" (Smith 2005, p. 262). Baptist Hospital remained segregated through April of 1969, when, under
intense financial pressure, the board voted "to take steps to develop a plan for qualifying the hospital for Medicare and
Medicaid patients" ("Hospital to Seek CR Okay" 1969). In response to this vote, the state field director of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), Charles Evers, sent a telegram to Robert Finch, the
Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, describing Baptist as "the most segregated hospital
in Mississippi" (Associated Press 1969).


                                                              17
        Seventy-five out of the 403 counties in our analysis were not served by a general or maternity

hospital prior to 1967. Up to this point in the analysis, treatment for these counties has been based

on whether there was a Medicare-eligible hospital operating in a bordering county. In column (5) of

Table 4, we report an estimate of 1 dropping these no-hospital counties from the sample. Again,

the estimate is small, positive, and statistically insignificant. In column (6), we control for the

number of bordering counties with at least one Medicare-eligible hospital. Including this variable on

the right-hand side of our regression model has little effect on the estimate of 1. Similarly, if we

include state-by-year fixed effects or do not weight the regression by live births, the estimate of 1 is

small, positive, and insignificant.

        The Louisiana Medicaid program began issuing payments to hospitals as of July 1, 1966,

which means that we cannot distinguish between the effects of having access to a Medicaid- vs.

Medicare-eligible hospital in Louisiana. Participation in both of these programs required Title VI

compliance. In the other Deep South states, Medicaid implementation came after 1966, allowing us

to estimate the following regression:



(3)              IMRcst = 0 + 1Medicarect + 2(Medicarect x Medicaidst) + Xct3 + vc + t + c  t + cst,



where the effect of having access to a Title VI-compliant hospital is given by 1 and the effect of

having access to a Title VI-compliant hospital with the option of Medicaid covering the expenses is

given by 1 + 2.30 The results of this exercise are reported in column (9) of Table 4. The estimate

of 1 is essentially unchanged. The estimate of 2 is negative, small in magnitude, and statistically


30 The Georgia Medicaid program was implemented in October of 1967; the South Carolina program was implemented
in July of 1968; the Mississippi program was implemented in October of 1969; and the Alabama program was
implemented in January of 1970. Estimating a regression model that also controls for the direct effect of Medicaid
produces qualitatively similar results.


                                                        18
indistinguishable from zero, suggesting that the Medicaid program had little, if any, effect on Black

infant mortality. 31



3.4. State-by-state estimates

         In Table 5, we show separate estimates of the effect of having access to a Medicare-certified

hospital on the Black IMR for each of the five Deep South states.32 Three out of the five estimates

are positive, including the estimate for Mississippi. The estimated effect of having access in

Alabama is positive and actually statistically significant at the 10 percent level. None of the other

estimates of 1 are statistically distinguishable from zero.33

         The estimates reported in Table 5 are based on the fully specified regression model, which

includes county-level covariates and county-specific linear trends. In Appendix Table A4, we build

up to the fully specified regression model by sequentially adding controls. Estimates based on

equation (1), which does not include year fixed effects, are reported in the first column and are

uniformly negative, large in magnitude, and statistically significant at the one percent level. Tellingly,

the largest negative estimate is for South Carolina, the state that experienced the largest decline in its

Black IMR from 1959 to 1973 (Figure 7).

         Estimates based on equation (2) are shown in column (2) of Appendix Table A4. These

estimates make it clear that, across all five states, the estimates of 1 reported in column (1) are




31Exploiting cross-state variation in categorical eligibility, Goodman-Bacon (2018) documents a sharp reduction in non-
White infant mortality after the implementation of state Medicaid programs. Dropping Southern states did not
appreciably affect his estimates.

32Figure 7 shows the Black IMR by state and year. There is a clear downward trend across the Deep South during the
period under study. Through 1964, Black IMRs were higher in Mississippi and South Carolina than in Alabama,
Georgia, and Louisiana. From 1964 through 1968, the Black IMR was notably higher in Mississippi than in the other
four states.

33Appendix Figures A1 through A5 show event-study estimates of the effect of having access to a Medicare-eligible
hospital on the Black IMR for each of the five Deep South states.

                                                          19
simply capturing the secular trend in the Black IMR. With the inclusion of year fixed effects, they

lose statistical significance and four out of five become positive. Controlling for the county-level

covariates and county-specific linear trends has little impact on these estimates.

          In the first two columns of Appendix Table A5, we report the event-study estimates

produced by Almond et al. (2006, Table 4, columns 1a and 1b) for postneonatal mortality, which are

based on data from Mississippi alone. Their fully specified model includes county-level controls,

county fixed effects, and county-specific linear trends. As noted above, their estimates are negative,

significant, and large enough to explain the narrowing of the Black-White IMR gap in Mississippi

from 1965 to 1971. For instance, having access to a Medicare-eligible hospital for four years is

associated with a 10.3 reduction in the Black PNMR.

         Although we do not have the information necessary to perfectly reconstruct Almond et al.'s

(2006) county-level controls, we are able to come reasonably close to reproducing their estimates in

columns (3) and (4) of Appendix Table A5.34 In column (5), we omit the county-specific linear

trends and instead add year fixed effects to their regression model. The estimated effects of having

access to a Medicare-eligible hospital become much smaller and lose statistical significance. In

column (6), we include both the county-specific linear trends and year fixed effects on the right-

hand side of Almond et al.'s (2006) regression model. The standard errors become sufficiently large

that we cannot reject the hypothesis that the estimates reported in column (6) are equal to those

reported in either column (4) or (5). Similarly, we cannot reject the hypothesis that the estimated

effects on the Black PNMR are equal to the estimated effects on the White PNMR, which are also




34Specifically, Almond et al. (2006) control for the fraction of mothers across five age categories, the fraction of
unmarried mothers, per-capita income, and per-capita transfer payments.

consistently negative and of roughly comparable magnitude in the fully specified model (panel II of

Appendix Table A5).35



4. IN-HOSPITAL BIRTHS AND MATERNAL MORTALITY

         During the period 1955-1965, out-of-hospital births to Southern Black mothers were

declining steadily (Chay and Greenstone 2000). By 1965, less than 10 percent of Black infants in

urban Southern counties were delivered at home, attended by either a doctor or midwife; less than

30 percent of Black infants in rural Southern counties were delivered at home (Chay and Greenstone

2000).

         Giving birth in the hospital did not, however, guarantee receipt of high-quality care for Black

mothers and their babies. "Biracial hospitals" discriminated against Black patients, assigning them

to separate wards or buildings, while Black hospitals were, with only a few exceptions, understaffed

and under-resourced (Reynolds 2004; Thomas 2006; McBride 2018, pp. 49-50). 36 After the

introduction of Medicare and Medicaid, Black hospitals struggled financially and most eventually

closed (Beardsley 1996; Odum 1992; Smith 2016, pp. 168-169). Black mothers living in the South

were left with the choice of delivering in a formerly discriminatory (i.e., White-only or segregated)


35 In Appendix Table A6, we report the event-study estimates produced by Almond et al. (2006, Table 4, columns 2a and
2b) for postneonatal mortality due to pneumonia, influenza, and diarrhea. The results are similar to those reported in
Appendix Table A5. In the top panel of Appendix Figure A6, we reproduce the event-study estimates in Almond et al.
(2006, Figure 3), which are from a specification that does not include year fixed effects, county fixed effects, or county-
level covariates. In the bottom panel of Appendix Figure A6, we illustrate what happens to these estimates when county
and year fixed effects are included in the regression model. Finally, we adopt Almond et al.'s (2006) specification in
Appendix Table A7 and estimate the effect of the hospital desegregation campaign on Black postneonatal mortality in all
five Deep South states. When we include year fixed effects and county-specific linear trends, the estimated effects of
having access to a Medicare-eligible hospital on Black postneonatal mortality due to pneumonia, influenza, and diarrhea
become positive and significant (panel II, column 4), allowing us to formally reject the hypothesis that they are equal to
those produced without controlling for year fixed effects (panel II, columns 1 and 2).

36The practice of assigning Black patients to their own wards, floors, or buildings also had the effect of limiting access.
To avoid overcrowding, Black patients could be refused admission despite the availability of "white beds" (U.S. Civil
Rights Commission 1966, pp. 12-13). Black hospitals were often White-run but focused on providing care to Black
patients (Rice and Jones 1994).

hospital or at home, attended by a midwife or physician, neither of whom was necessarily well

trained in obstetrics (Mongeau et al. 1961; Houde et al. 1982; Ward 2003).

         Figure 8 shows the in-hospital birth rate (i.e., the number of in-hospital births per 1,000 live

births) by race in the Deep South for the years 1959-1973. In-hospital Black births were rising

steadily throughout this period. In 1959, the first year of our analysis, 57 percent of Black births

took place in the hospital. By 1973, 94 percent of Black births were in-hospital.

         Did federal efforts to desegregate hospitals contribute to the trends shown in Figure 8? To

answer this question, we use data from state vital statistics reports and the NVSS37 and estimate:



(4)               In-Hospital Birthsct = 0 + 1Medicarect + Xct2 + vc + t + c  t + ct,



which includes the vector of county-level controls described above, county fixed effects, year fixed

effects, and county-specific linear trends. The dependent variable, In-Hospital Birthsct, is equal to the

number of in-hospital Black births per 1,000 live Black births. 38

         The results of this exercise are reported in the first column of Table 6. Access to a

Medicare-eligible hospital is associated with an additional 32 Black in-hospital births per 1,000 live




37 Because the Natality Files, published by the NVSS, did not make information available on birth attendant type for the
years 1960-1967, we transcribed records from individual state vital statistics reports. Appendix Table B2 lists the sources
used to collect information on county-level live births by location (i.e., in- versus out-of-hospital) and attendant (i.e.,
physician versus midwife). Another advantage to using state vital statistics records is that the NVSS is missing data on
live births by race for roughly 10 percent of the counties in our sample. Information on live births by attendant is
unavailable at the county level from Alabama vital statistics records. As a result, Alabama is excluded from all birth
location/attendant analyses in this section.

38Prior to 1975, information on whether a hospital birth was attended by a physician or a midwife was not included on
the birth certificate. Presumably, however, the vast majority of these births were attended by a physician. In 1975, 97
percent of in-hospital births in the United States were attended by a physician. Of the remainder, 0.6 percent were
delivered by midwives and 2.3 percent were delivered by "other" persons or persons for whom no status was specified
(U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare 1978).


                                                            22
births. While this estimate is precise, it explains less than nine percent of the movement towards in-

hospital births among Black mothers during the period under study.39

         Next, we examine the effects of having access to a Medicare-eligible hospital on Black out-

of-hospital births by attendant type.40 The results, reported in columns (2) and (3) of Table 6,

suggest that the shift towards in-hospital births came entirely from out-of-hospital births attended

by a midwife. 41 There is no evidence of a reduction in out-of-hospital births attended by a physician

when Black mothers were given the option of delivering at a Medicare-eligible hospital.

         During the period under study, midwives across the Deep South were required to be

licensed (Anderson et al. forthcoming). According to contemporary accounts, licensing greatly

improved the quality of midwifery services provided. 42 Nonetheless, midwives were not trained to




39 In Appendix Figure A7, we show event-study estimates of the effect of having access to a Medicare-eligible hospital
on the in-hospital Black birth rate. There is strong evidence that the positive estimate reported in column (1) of Table 6
is a continuation of an upwards pre-treatment trend. In addition to estimating equation (4), we also explored the
relationship between the federal effort to desegregate hospitals and the overall Black birth rate, defined as the number of
live Black births per 100,000 Black population. We found no evidence that access to a Medicare-certified hospital
affected the overall Black birth rate.

40 Figure 9 shows out-of-hospital physician-attended birth rates by race; Figure 10 shows out-of-hospital midwife-
attended birth rates by race.
41During this period, birth certificates recorded whether an out-of-hospital birth was attended by a physician, midwife,
or other/not specified attendant (U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare 1978). We included out-of-
hospital births by "other/not specified" in the count of out-of-hospital births attended by a midwife. Based on our own
calculations, over 90 percent of births in this combined category were attended by midwives. In Appendix Figure A8,
we show event-study estimates of the effect of having access to a Medicare-certified hospital on Black births attended by
a midwife. There is strong evidence that the negative estimate reported in column (3) of Table 6 is a continuation of a
negative pre-treatment trend.
42For instance, licensed midwives in South Carolina were required to attend a two-week course of instruction (South
Carolina 1960). According to South Carolina public health officials, the licensing of midwives had a dramatic effect on
both infant and maternal mortality among Blacks:

         It is interesting to note that from 1919 to 1928, the last year for which we have figures tabulated
         separately for white and colored, there was a decided reduction in the colored rates [of death] for
         both infants and mothers although there was an increase in both rates for whites. This would
         seem to indicate that the instruction of midwives, who deliver most of the negro mothers, has
         not been without value to the State (South Carolina Board of Health (1932) cited in Bonaparte
         (2014, p. 172)).


                                                            23
attend complicated pregnancies (Dodd 1920; Mongeau et al. 1961) and it is not unreasonable to

expect that the shift to in-hospital births resulted in fewer mothers dying during childbirth.

         In column (4) of Table 6, we report the estimated effect of having access to a Medicare-

certified hospital on the maternal mortality rate in county c and year t.43 The estimate, although

negative, is small and statistically insignificant. Access is associated with a 0.018 reduction in the

Black maternal mortality rate, which is less than two percent of the pre-treatment mean. 44



5. CONCLUSION

         According to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, no person "on the ground of race,

color, or national origin" should be denied the benefits of any program receiving federal financial

assistance (U.S. Department of Labor n.d.). When the Civil Rights Act was passed, most U.S.

hospitals did not rely on federal money and the discriminatory practices of Southern hospitals

continued largely unabated. The landscape radically changed, however, when President Johnson

signed Medicare into law on July 30, 1965, promising to generously pay for the health care of

millions of people. The threat of withholding Medicare funding, coupled with the efforts of

investigators from the newly created Office of Equal Health Opportunity who were tasked with




43We measure the maternal mortality rate as deaths due to complications from pregnancy or childbirth per
1,000 live births. Maternal mortality counts included women in the "puerperal state," which lasted through pregnancy
and continued for 42 days after delivery (Guyer et al. 2000). Because the maternal mortality rate is equal to zero for 78
percent of our county-year observations, we also estimated a Poisson regression model. The results from this exercise
were qualitatively similar to those reported in Table 6.

44In an effort to study the effects of Black hospitals, we used data from Rice and Jones (1994), Wesley (2010), and a host
of contemporary sources (available from the authors upon request) to distinguish between counties that were served by a
Black hospital in the pre-treatment period and those that were not. Appendix Table A8 shows estimates obtained by
interacting Medicarect with an indicator, Black Hospitalc, that is equal to one if a county was served by at least one Black
hospital in 1966 (and equal to zero otherwise). These estimates suggest that, regardless of whether county c was served
by a Black hospital, gaining access to a Medicare-eligible hospital had no effect on where Black mothers chose to give
birth or on Black infant mortality.


                                                            24
identifying hospitals that were not in compliance with Title VI, led to the eventual desegregation of

even the most notoriously segregated hospitals in the South (Associated Press 1969).

        Focusing on one Deep South state, Mississippi, Almond et al. (2006) find that access to a

Medicare-eligible hospital is associated with sharp reductions in Black postneonatal mortality,

especially mortality due to causes considered preventable with timely hospital treatment. They

conclude that, by prohibiting institutions that received federal funds from discriminating, the Civil

Rights Act saved tens of thousands of Black infant lives. Aside from Almond et al. (2006), we know

very little about the relationship between hospital desegregation and health.

        Using county-level mortality data from five Deep South states and exploiting considerably

more variation in Medicare certification dates than was available to Almond et al. (2006), we revisit

the relationship between the federal hospital desegregation campaign and the Black IMR for the

period 1959-1973. Consistent with Smith's (2005, p. 264) description of the hospital desegregation

campaign as producing only "cosmetic" changes, our results suggest that having access to a

Medicare-eligible hospital had little, if any, effect on infant mortality. Specifically, we find that

having access to a certified hospital is associated with 1.37 additional Black infant deaths per 1,000

births. Although this estimate is not statistically significant, it is sufficiently precise to reject the

hypothesis that the hospital desegregation campaign contributed meaningfully to the narrowing of

the Black-White infant mortality gap. Likewise, we find that having access to a Medicare-eligible

hospital had no appreciable effect on the Black PNMR, nor did it affect Black infant deaths due to

preventable causes (i.e., pneumonia/influenza and diarrhea). Again, these estimates are measured

with precision, allowing us to reject the hypothesis that the hospital desegregation campaign drove

the narrowing of the Black-White postneonatal mortality gap.

        Importantly, our results for the Deep South do not mask heterogeneity by state. After

controlling for common trends, we find no evidence that the hospital desegregation campaign

                                                      25
reduced the Black IMR in Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, or South Carolina. In fact,

three of these five estimates are actually positive, including the Mississippi estimate.

        Finally, using newly transcribed data on live births by race, location (in-hospital versus out-

of-hospital) and attendant type (physician versus midwife) available from annual state vital statistics

reports, we explore whether the hospital desegregation campaign accelerated the trend towards in-

hospital births among Southern Black mothers, which was originally documented by Chay and

Greenstone (2000). We find that having access to a Medicare-eligible hospital is associated with an

increase in the rate at which Black mothers chose to give birth in-hospital and a similarly sized

decrease in out-of-hospital Black births attended by a midwife. These estimated effects are,

however, not nearly large enough to explain the trend towards in-hospital births.

        The effort to desegregate Southern hospitals was met with considerable resistance. Two

hundred and fourteen hospitals in the South initially refused to integrate their facilities, forgoing all

federal funding (Nash 1968; Reynolds 1997); ostensibly integrated hospitals openly flouted Title VI

guidelines (U.S. House of Representatives 1973; Quadagno 2000); and Black patients were reticent

to seek care at private hospitals that had, for generations, segregated or excluded them altogether

(Comptroller General 1972; Quadagno 2000). Had the goals of the federal effort been embraced by

White-run hospital administrators and physicians, its short-run effects on Black infant and maternal

health may have been more pronounced than those we document above.

        Our empirical strategy prevents us from exploring the longer-run effects of the hospital

desegregation campaign but it is worth noting that the Black-White infant mortality gap has been

closing steadily in several Southern states over the past two decades (Speights et al. 2017). This

progress may have been impossible had investigators from the OEHO not compelled Southern

hospitals to abandon their long-standing discriminatory practices. Identifying the factors that

contributed--and continue to contribute--to the narrowing of the Black-White infant mortality gap

                                                    26
will depend on identifying well-defined natural experiments and carefully accounting for secular

trends.

Notes: OLS coefficient estimates (and their 90% confidence intervals) are reported, where the omitted category is one
year before treatment. The dependent variable is equal to the number of Black infant deaths per 1,000 live Black
births in county c and year t. All models control for the county-level covariates listed in Appendix Table A2, county
fixed and year fixed effects. Regressions are weighted by live Black births. Standard errors are corrected for
clustering at the county level.

Notes: Based on annual data from the Multiple Cause-of-Death Mortality Files, published by the National Vital Statistics System. Each
column within each panel represents results from a separate OLS regression. The dependent variable is equal to the number of Black
infant deaths per 1,000 live Black births in county c and year t. All models control for county fixed effects. Regressions are weighted by
live Black births. Standard errors, corrected for clustering at the county level, are in parentheses.

Notes: The results in columns (1)-(3) are based on annual data from individual state vital statistics reports and
the Natality Files, published by the National Vital Statistics System. The results in column (4) are based on
annual data from the Multiple Cause-of-Death Mortality Files, published by the National Vital Statistics System.
Each column represents results from a separate OLS regression. In columns (1)-(3), the dependent variable is
equal to the number of live Black births by location and attendant per 1,000 live Black births in county c and
year t. In column (4), the dependent variable is equal to the number of Black infant deaths per 1,000 live Black
births in county c and year t. All models control for the county-level covariates listed in Appendix Table A2,
county fixed effects, year fixed effects and county-specific linear trends. Regressions are weighted by live Black
births. Standard errors, corrected for clustering at the county level, are in parentheses.
