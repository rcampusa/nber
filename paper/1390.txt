                              Household Formations



                                   ABSTRACT



      Between 1960 and 1980, the number of households in the U.S. increased by

50 percent and the proportion of the population that were household heads rose

from 29.5 to 36.3. While some of this increase was due to the maturing of the

"baby boom" population, over half was caused by rising age—specific headship

rates. In contrast, between 1980 and 1983, headship rates fell sharply for the

under 34 population. This paper explains household formations due to changes

in headship rates in terms of changes in real income and the price of privacy.

               HOUSEHOLD FORMATIONS AND THE DEMAND FOR HOUSING



      INTRODUCTION

Over a quarter of the nearly 10 trillion dollars net worth of Americans at the

end of 1982 was in the form of residential structures. When the value of the

land on which the structures rest is included, the ratio was over a third.

Surprisingly, these ratios have not declined since 1960. One might have

anticipated declines for two reasons. First, there seems to have been

widespread belief over much of the last decade that housing has been

unaf fordable.' Second, real income per capita doubled in the last quarter

century, and the income elasticity of housing demand is generally taken to be
                               2
less than unity (Rosen 1979)

      The primary force preventing declines in the ratios has been a sharp in-

crease in the ratio of households (groups occupying separate housing units) to

population. In 1960, 29.5 percent of the population were household heads; in

1980, 36.3 percent were. Given a 1980 population of 218 million, this

increase translates into nearly 15 million additional households. Substantial

economies exist when people live together: a couple share a kitchen, dining

room, and so forth; living separately, they each need these rooms. While two

can't live as cheaply as one, together they can obtain housing services for

less than twice what each could separately. Thus an increase in households,

even holding population and income constant, raises the demand for housing.

If the formation of one extra household, still holding income and population

constant, increases the demand for housing by 5 to 10 thousand dollars, then

15 million additional households raised the aggregate demand for housing by 75

to 150 billion dollars.
                                                                           5—2




      The obvious question is why did the household/population ratio increase

so markedly? Part of the increase was due to the movement of the post—World

War II "baby boom" population into the prime household—forming age group.

Even if the rate at which the population in different age groups formed

households had remained constant between 1960 and 1980, the household/

population ratio would have risen by 3 percentage points. The remaining 4

percentage point increase in the ratio reflects an increased demand by

Americans for privacy. This increase could reflect rising real incomes,

declining real costs of privacy (especially for low—income families with

dependent children), improving health of the elderly and/or shifting tastes

toward privacy (including a decreased aversion to divorce). The goal of this

study is determination of the relative importance of these factors in

explaining the increase in households.

      This chapter is divided into three sections. The first develops the

household—formation estimation equation, and the second presents and

interprets the estimates. A summary concludes the chapter.



      THE HOUSEHOLD FORMATION DECISION

From an accounting framework, household formations can be expressed in terms

of two factors: the size and age structure of the population and age—specific

headship rates. Age structure is important because persons in different age

categories have differing likelihoods of being household heads. An age—

specific headship rate refers to the rate at which the population in a

specific age category forms itself into households; it is the ratio of the

number of household heads in an age category to the number of people in that

category. Age—specific headship rates change as the population varies its

demand for privacy.
                                                                                 5—3




        Headship       rates for specific age categories are listed in Table 5—1 for

March 31 of selected years. Also listed are the shares of the population in

each age group (the p.) in 1960 and 1983. As can be seen, headship rates for

 all categories rose dramatically between 1960 and 1980. The increases were

                                       ——Place Table 5—1 Near Here——

proportionally greatest for the young (under 35) and old (over 75). For the
young, the increase was concentrated in the 1967—74 period. For the elderly,
the increase was relatively steady, although the largest increase was again
between 1967 and 1974. Between 1980 and 1983, a sharp divergence in headship

rates occurred; those for the under 35 age categories fell sharply, while

those for the over 44 age groups continued to rise.

        The headship rate hh. for the ith age category is defined as:



                       HR
               —           1                                               (1)

                               1



where RH. is the number of households in the category and POP, is the

population in the category. The aggregate headship rate can be expressed as



              hh =         Zhh.p.,
                             11

where         the ith population share in the base period. With 1960 as the
        p1s
base, hh rose from 0.295 in 1960 to 0.328 in 1980; with 1980 as the base, the

increase was from 0.324 to 0.363. Because the age structure of the population

over 14 is relatively exogenous (and there are few household heads under the

age of 15), it is useful to partition the growth in households into that due

to changes in age—specific headship rates and that due to the exogenous

population age structure. The total number of households is:



              HH = EHH.,                                                           (2)




and the change in households between periods o and t is:



              HH = HHt    — HH°   .
                                                                                   (3)



Solving (1) for HH. and substituting into (2) and the result into (3) yields:



              HH = hhPOP      — Ehh°POP?.                                          (3')

                      1               1


This formula can be rewritten to reflect two distinct effects:


              tHH =   hh?tPOP. +          POPhh.,                                  (3")




where tx is, in general, defined as                —   X°.   The first term indicates the

effect of population growth and shifts and the second term the influence of

changes in headship rates.
                                                                        5—5




      The effect of population growth and shifts is deduced by computation of

the first summation in equation (3"). The population has been divided into

ten age categories: 0—14 and the nine listed in Table 5—1.   The 20—24 and

25—29 age groupings are the prime years during which individuals form new

households (see Table 5—1). The computed variable, which indicates the change

in households if headship rates remained at the previous year's level, is

called exogenous household growth and is denoted by AHX.



      Income and the Price of Housing

Economic variables appear to explain part of the nondemographic increase in

headship rates. Most obvious among these variables are real income and the

real price of housing services (Smith, et. al., 1982). As real incomes rise,

potential households are better able to exercise their desire to establish a

new household. Similarly, lower real prices of housing services enable groups

which otherwise would not have been able or willing to acquire a housing unit

to form a household.

      The income variable utilized is real disposable income per capita. This

variable has increased throughout the period from a level of $2697 in 1960 to

$4545 in 1982. For the real price of housing services for rental housing, we

employ the CPI rent component, as adjusted by Lowry (1981) to account

adequately for depreciation and to treat utility costs consistently, deflated

by th CPI net of shelter. This price series generally declined from 1.017 in

the 1962—65 span to 0.947 in the middle to late 1970s and has since risen to

near unity. For the real price of housing services from unsubsidized owner—

occupied housing, the user cost series for households in the 15 percent tax

bracket is approximately that computed by Hendershott and Shilling (1981)

The 15 percent tax rate is close to that calculated by Hendershott and Slemrod
                                                                          5—6




(1983) as the most relevant to the tenure choice decision in 1977. The user

cost declined fairly steadily from 7.8 percent in 1960—63 to 3.9 percent in

1978 and then rose sharply to 12.7 percent in 1982.

      Subsidized housing effectively lowers the real price of housing services

for households selected to occupy such units. To the extent that subsidies go

to groups that would not have been households in the absence of subsidies,

household formations and the demand for housing units increases. Over three—

quarters of subsidized housing during the 1961—1982 period has been rental,5

and the existence of below—market rents is reflected in the CPI rent index.6

Because owner subsidies have been small and have not been especially targeted

to first—time buyers, no general attempt is made to relate household

formations to owner subsidies.7

      An additional possible determinant of household formations is the real

initial mortgage payment burden. With the standard fixed—rate mortgage,

nominal mortgage payments are fixed over time, while real mortgage payments

decline at the rate of inflation. Moreover, the higher is anticipated

inflation and thus the nominal mortgage rate, the larger is the initial

mortgage payment. As attractive as expected future inflationary gains may be,

young wealth—constrained households may find the initial mortgage payments to

be "unaffordable" and thus be compelled to purchase a smaller house than they

would if inflation did not tilt the real mortgage payment stream forward in

time (Kearl 1979; Follain 1982, Schwab 1983) .   More importantly, from our

perspective, some persons may not move away from parents, other relatives, or

group quarters to form households until they can attain ownership of a

"reasonably" sized house. As a result, high initial mortgage payments

relative to income could reduce the level of household formations. The real—

mortgage—payment—to—income variable is defined as the real net—of—tax mortgage
                                                                           5—7




payment on a constant quality house (the average new house constructed in

1974), assuming 75 percent financing at the current mortgage rate or 12

percent, whichever is lower. The truncation of the mortgage rate reflects the

widespread use of owner financing and builder buy downs in the 1980s when

interest rates exceeded 12 percent. The tax rate employed is the same as that

for the real user cost of homeownership. This variable generally increased

during the 1960—82 period and increased especially rapidly from 21 percent in

1978 to 28 percent in 1981 and 1982.

        Summarizing the above, the dependency of the age specific headship rates

on economic variables can be expressed as



                             hh, =   hh(, , , m),                    (4)




'nere      y =   real   per capita disposable personal income

           r =   real   price of rental housing

           o =   real   price of owner housing

           m =   real   mortgage payment burden

for the particular age category, and the signs above the arguments denote the

expected signs of the partial derivatives. From equation (3"), the endogenous

change in households is the sum of the product of changes in age—specific

headship rates and the population in the age groups. The relevant independent

variables, based on (4), are thus changes in the price of housing services

(rental and owner), income, and the mortgage—payment burden for each age group

times the populations in the groups. We approximate these variables by the

products of total population and changes in the economy—wide variables.
                                                                           5—8



      Other Variables

Among social variables, the increase in divorce (the divorce rate per thousand

U.S. residents jumped from 2.2 in 1960 to 5.2 in 1980) is sometimes cited as a

major factor causing the increase in household formations during the 1960s and

1970s (Rosen and Jaffee 1981: 21). The effect of increases in the number of

divorces on formations is uncertain, however. While the number of primary

individual households will certainly increase (these households increased from

under 8 million in 1960 to 20 million in 1980), the impact on total households

is ambiguous. If both husband and wife form separate households after a

divorce, then one additional household is created. Alternatively, if both

husband and wife move back with family or friends, one household is lost. To

complicate matters further, the decision the divorcing couple makes will

likely be determined in part by the real incomes of the couple, the real price

of housing services and, possibly, the form welfare takes (see below).

      Nonetheless, four divorce variables are tested in the household—

formations equation: the total number of divorces each year, the change during

the year in the total number of divorced persons (the first variable less

remarriages and deaths of single previously divorced persons), the change in

the total number of divurceti persons over 34 years of age, and the change in

the number of households headed by divorced women with children under age 18.

The latter two variables reflect our presumption that older people and those

with at least one minor child are less likely to move in with family or

friends (Carliner 1975) .   To put these variables in perspective, the increases

in their annual values between the early 1960s and late l970s were 800,000,

600,000, 300,000, and 50,000.
                                                                          5—9




     A likely factor affecting household formations in the late l960s and

early 1970s was the change in the aid for families with dependent children

(AFDC). This aid has both income and price dimensions. An increase in real

benefits should, like increases in any form of income, raise the demand for

privacy and thus increase household formations. However, insofar as the

actual benefits received are negatively related to total household income, the

effective benefit level can be raised (often from zero) by a single parent

establishing a separate household. Thus an increase in scheduled real

benefits also lowers the price of establishing a separate household. In fact,

the price effect would be expected to far outweigh the income effect.

      Between 1960 and 1980, the number of families receiving AFDC rose by 3

million (from 0.8 to 3.8 million). Two—thirds of the increase came in the

1967—74 period. This sharp jump reflected a 30 percent increase in real

benefits per recipient (in the 1964—70 period) and a substantial reduction in

eligibility requirements. The latter, part of 1967 legislation, required

states (after July 1, 1969) to disregard the first $30 of monthly earnings

plus one—third of the remainder in computing benefits. The former was largely

attributable to the federal government offering in mid—1966 to pay at least

one—half of whatever the state paid to AFDC families, provided the state

offered Medicaid. Given the substantial increase in incentives to establish a

single parent household, the surge in the divorce rate between 1967 and 1973

—— 60 percent of the increase observed over the entire 1960—80 span occurred

in these six years —— and the bulge in household formations are hardly

surprising. The change in the number of families on AFDC is added to our list

of explanatory variables.
                                                                                              5—10



       The Estimation Equation

The estimation equation is the result of replacing the first sum in equation

(3") by ci1HX     and the second sum by a linear function of total population

(POP) times the changes in the variables in the functional of (4), the change

in some divorce variable, and the change in families on AFDC. The equation

for the change in households is thus:



HH =        +         +            +            +            +             +

where DIV equals one of the four divorce variables tested. The expected

signs, and magnitudes where readily known, of the coefficients are

      EXPLANTION OF HOUSEHOLD FORMATIONS

Nine different household equations are presented in Table 5—3. The first

equation includes exogenous households and the four basic economic variables:

real income, real prices of owner and renter housings and the real mortgage—

                         ——Place Table 5—3 Near Here——

payment burden. The exogenous household formations variable, which measures

the effect of population growth and changing age structure on household

formations, is expected to have a coefficient of one and is about a half

standard deviation less than this value. All the other variables are

correctly signed, but only the real owner price is significantly different

from zero. The adjusted R2 indicates substantial unexplained variation.

      Addition of the AFDC variable improves the relation in numerous

respects. Not only does the variable enter appropriately and the explanatory

power rise sharply, but the coefficient on endogenous household formations is

very close to unity and the constant is much closer to its expected value of

zero. Further, the income coefficient rises slightly and is now statistically

greater than zero.

      Equations 3 through 6 test different divorce variables. The total

number of divorces each year has an unexpected negative coefficient in

equation 3, and the annual change in the total number of divorced persons

(equation 4), the change in divorced persons over the age of 35 (equation 5),

and the change in the total number of divorced females with children under 18

(equation 6) all have coefficients smaller than their standard errors. In

general, the coefficients on other variables are insensitive to inclusion of

the divorce variables.

     One might argue that the 0.8 coefficient on the change in AFDC

households is too large. First, part of the increase in AFDC families must

have been broken families who were separate households prior to going on AFDC.

Second, some of the husbands who separated from their families undoubtedly did

not establish new households themselves. Moreover, because the change in

households on AFDC is part of the independent variable, this coefficient is

likely biased toward unity.9 The AFDC coefficient is arbitrarily constrained

to 0.4 in equations 7 and 8 to determine the sensitivity of the other

coefficients to changes in the AFDC response. As can be seen by comparing

equations 2 and 7, the decline in explanatory power is small, and the only

marked change in coefficients is a doubling of the constant term. In equation

2, the constant accounts for 2 1/4 million household formations over the

1961—82 period (103 times 22); in equation 7, the constant accounts for 4 3/4

million.

      In both equations 2 and 7, the coefficient on exogenous household

formations is less than the expected unity value. This is not surprising

because the variable is obviously measured with error and thus its coefficient

will be biased toward zero. To compensate, the unity coefficient has been

imposed in equations 8 and 9; the 0.4 coefficient on AFDC is also enforced in

equation 8. The constant terms in the equations decline to compensate for the

increased coefficient on exogenous household formations.

      Table 5—5 details the sources of changes in the number of households for

two periods, 1961—78 and 1979—82, based on equations 8 and 910 During the

                         ——Place Table 5—5 Near Here——

1961—78 period, steady increases in headship rates induced the formation of 8

million households or nearly a third of the total 25 1/2 million households

formed. These are attributable to the rise in real income per capita (3

million), to the decline in the real price of owner housing (3/4 million, 1/4

of which was offset by the increase in the mortgage—payment burden), to the

expansion of the AFDC program (1 1/2 to 2 1/2 million), and to the constant

term or trend (2 to 3 million). In the 1979—82 period, headship rates fell;

the number of households was a million less than that which would have

occurred with constant headship rates. The cause was the sharp rise in the

owner user cost which triggered a 1 1/2 million decline in households.

      The most perplexing problem is the interpretation of the growth in

households caused" by the constant term. To understand the source of the

positive constant term, it is useful to examine the age—specific headship

rates more closely. This is accomplished by computations of changes in

headship rates by five year intervals (see Table 5—6). Two obvious points

stand out. First, the over 75 age category experienced the largest increase

in headship rate over the two decades, 0.138, followed by the 25—44 age

                        ——Place Table 5—6 Near Here——

categories (see the far right column). Second, the changes in the demogra-

phic—adjusted headship rate (bottom row of Table 5—6) indicate that headship

rates increased far more in the 1967—72 period than in the other five year

spans. Consistent with this, six of the nine age groups experienced their

largest five—year increases in the 1967—72 period.

      The positive constant term, which accounts for 2 to 3½ million of the

increase in households between 1960 and 1982, probably stems in part from the

steady increase in household heads over age 75. The increase in this headship

rate, along with the growth in population in this age category, accounted for

the formation of over a million households. Much of the million is likely

attributable to a continuing increase in the health and life span of the

elderly. A second factor the constant term may reflect is an apparent

increase in the taste for headship by people born after about 1937. These

people were 24 and younger in 1961. Note how their movement into the 25—29

age group in the 1962—67 period sharply raised that headship rate. Later, in

1967—72, they raised the 30—34 headship rate, and, again in 1972—82, they

continually pushed the 35—44 headship rate upward. People born in even later

years maintained this desire for headship (note that the 20—24 rate did not

fall in 1962—67, the 25—29 rate did not fall in 1967—72 and the 30—34 rate did

not decline in 1972—77). Why people born after 1937 have a greater desire for

headship is unclear, but they certainly have it. Possibly they have

substantially greater future income prospects owing to greater investment in

human capital (Johnson 1985) and our income variable picks this up. But we

expect that the positive constant reflects, in part, people born after 1937

continually constituting a larger proportion of the adult population.



      SUMMARY

Between 1961 and 1978, the number of households grew by 25½ million or nearly

50 percent. Of this increase about a third was due to population growth,

another third to changes in the age structure of the population (the aging of

the postwar baby boom) and the last third to an increase in age—specific

headship rates. A doubling of real per capita income and a halving of the

real price of owner—occupied housing (the real after—tax mortgage rate) caused
                                                                          5—15



headship rates to increase for all age categories. The increases were the

greatest for the young (under 35) and the old (over 75). The sharply higher

headship rates of the young were a response to (1) the abrupt increase in real

benefits and lower eligibility standards of the aid to families with dependent

children (AFDC) program in the late l960s and (2) a greater propensity for

headship by the population born after 1937. The enormous (over ten percentage

point) increase in the over—75 headship rate reflected better health and real

incomes that are far greater (due to a 75 percent increase in real social

security payments) and more certain (due to indexation) than existed in the

early 1960s.

      In the early l980s, a sharp divergence in headship rates has occurred;

those for population under age 35 have fallen, while those for the population

over age 44 have continued to rise. The reduced headship rates for the young

reflect both the marked increase in the real price of owner—occupied housing

(real after—tax mortgage rate) and the cutback in real benefits and increased

eligibility standards for the AFDC program)° Each of these tends to fall

more heavily on younger households who are more mobile (and thus are more

likely to have to pay the market mortgage rate) and are more likely to have

dependent children.

      Specific numbers of household formations can be attributed to the

various factors that have altered headship rates. Increased headship rates

between 1960 and 1978 resulted in 8 million additional households, about half

of which were induced by rising real incomes (3 million) and falling real

prices of owner housing (3/4 million). Another 1½ to 2 3/4 million is attri-

butable to the increased real benefits and 1ower eligibility standards of the

AFDC program. Because actual AFDC benefits received are negatively related to

total household income, the effective benefit level can easily be raised by a
                                                                        5—16



low—income single parent establishing a separate household. It should not be

surprising that a 30 percent increase in real scheduled benefits and

significant reduction in eligibility standards in the late l960s coincided

with: a jump in the divorce rate, unprecedented increases in families on AFDC,

and a surge in household formations. Another 1 3/4 to 3 million of the 8

million increase is likely explained by both the steadily rising longevity and

health of older people and the increasing importance to household formations

of those born after the late 1930s.

      Between 1979 and 1983, household growth continued at a high level, owing

to the further maturation of the baby boom. However, the above—noted sharp

rise in real after—tax interest rates, and thus the cost of owner housing,

reduced formations (of those under age 34) by 1½ million relative to what

would have otherwise occurred.

                      CONSTRUCTION OF THE HOUSEHOLD SERIES

Data on the number of households and population in the respective age groups

are available through two annual U.S. Bureau of the Census, Current Population

Survey (CPS) reports: "Household and Family Characteristics" and "Marital

Status and Living Arrangements". Numerous adjustments were necessary,

however, to develop consistent household and exogenous household series for

the 1960—82 period.

      For most years the CPS reports contain data on the number of households

by age for nine age groups: under 20, 20—24, 25—29, 30—34, 35—44, 45—54, 55—

64, 65—74, and 75 and over. In the years 1968—1975, however, the four

youngest age groups are combined into two groups: under 25 and 25—34. Because

those age groupings comprise the prime household forming years in which large

changes in headship rates occur, an attempt was made to divide the number of

households in these two broader age groups into the smaller subdivisions.

First, the proportion of under 25 households which were under 20 and 20—24

(and the proportion of 25—34 households which were 25—29 and 30—34) were

averaged for the three years prior to 1968 and the three yearsfollowing 1975.

The assumed proportions over the 1968—75 period were then obtained by

extrapolating linearly between the prel968 and postl975 averages.

      A larger problem with the CPS is the reconciliation of the CPS data to

the 1970 and 1980 Census counts. When the Census data became available, the

CPS population controls were adjusted upward to compensate for the excess of

the Census count over the CPS estimates. Thus a large jump in the household

data occurs in the year of adjustment. However, various issues of the CPS

Series P—25 provide yearly estimates that have been adjusted to correspond to
                                                             Hendershott & Smith
                                                                    Appendix 5/2



the decennial Census counts. Yearly change in households (and in exogenous

households) that are consistent with the decennial data are calculated using

the revised population data in equation (3"). To apply equation (3"),

headship rates were first calculated using the unadjusted household and

population numbers from the CPS reports, and then these rates and the adjusted

population data were employed.

      A further problem in this calculation was that prior to 1972, inmates of

institutions (which includes, for example, the elderly living in nursing

homes) were included in the unadjusted population count; in 1972 and

thereafter, they were excluded. All population and thus household data have

been converted to a noninstitutionalized basis, that is, inmates of

institutions were deleted from the population data prior to 1972. Because the

adjusted population series includes inmates of institutions, the sum of the

change in household series computed from equation (3") for the 1961—80 period

was 800,000 greater than the actual change in households between the 1960 and

1980 decennial counts. The computed change in household series was multiplied

by the average ratio of population excluding inmates of institutions to total

population in order to make the change series consistent with the decennial

counts.

      The CI'S data are reported for March 31 of each year. To convert the

data to an annual basis, we have assumed that an households grew linearly

between March 31 dates. Thus the calendar year change in households consists

of 75 percent of the change in households in one year and 25 percent of the

preceding year (for example, the 1964 change would be 75 percent of the change

from March 64 to March 1965 and 25 percent of the change from March 1963 to

March 1964)

4. This tax bracket is roughly appropriate throughout the study period

   because the effects of bracket creep and increases in mortgage interest

   deductions have roughly offset each other, leaving the typical new

   homeowner in approximately the same tax bracket.



5. Owner subsidies were not available until the Section 235 program began in

   1969. While owner subsidized units rose to 41 percent of total

   subsidized starts in 1972, they averaged only 27 percent of total

   subsidized starts between 1969 and 1982.



6. The CPi rent component is constructed by asking consumers how much they

   pay each month for rent. If they are receiving subsidy assistance, they

   would report only the portion of total rent which they pay. The CPI

   rental component therefore would reflect the impact of subsidy programs

   on tenant rental payments.

     the development of the ADFC program (and welfare policy generally).



 9. In future work, it would be useful to attempt to relate household

     formations to changes in AFDC real benefits and eligibility standards.



10. The calculation of the change in the number of households due to

     demographic changes holds headship rates for each age group constant at

     their 1960 and 1978 levels for the respective periods. In the model,

     however, the exogenous household formations variable is calculated each

     year based on the preceding years headship rate. Given that headship

     rates rose (fell) between 1960 and 1978 (1978 and 1982), the sum of the

     exogenous household formations variable over time would exceed (fall

     short of) the demographic change in the Table. This difference is

     distributed proportionately across the other variables in Table 5—4.
