Household Demand for Low Carbon Public Policies: Evidence from California

NBER Working Paper No. 19965
March 2014
JEL No. Q54,R41

                                              ABSTRACT

In recent years, Californians have voted on two key pieces of low carbon regulation. The resulting
voting patterns provide an opportunity to examine the demand for carbon mitigation efforts. Household
voting patterns are found to mirror the voting patterns by the U.S Congress on national carbon legislation.
Political liberals and more educated voters favor such regulations while suburbanites tend to oppose
such initiatives. Survey responses at the individual level are shown to predict the spatial variation
in actual voting patterns and hence convergent validity for results obtained with stated preference data
on voting markets.

Introduction


           Climate change mitigation represents the ultimate collective action problem as

individuals and nations have strong incentives to free ride and wait for others to reduce their

carbon emissions. Even nations that have previously shown a willingness to reduce their

emissions have retreated from ambitious carbon mitigation targets. In April 2013, the European

Parliament rejected tightening their carbon emissions caps.2 This governing body worried that

tighter caps would further slow Europe’s economic growth.

           California has enacted low carbon regulation and invested in public infrastructure seeking

to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. Two recent examples of these efforts are the California

Global Warming Solutions Act (AB32)3 and the California High Speed Rail (HSR) project.

Passed in 2006, AB32 represents one of Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger’s major legislative

successes. AB32 bundles a suite of policies, including a carbon cap and trade market, as it seeks

to reduce the state’s greenhouse gas emissions to 20% below 1990’s level by the year 2020 and

to 80% below the 1990 baseline by the year 2050. HSR is a statewide project to build a train

that will travel from San Diego to San Francisco and is projected to reduce reliance on air travel

and private vehicles for travelling in the state. This is a long run project that requires billions of

state and federal dollars.

           From a research perspective, a novel feature of both of these ambitious pieces of low

carbon policy is that California voters had the opportunity to express their preferences over them.

California has long been known as a center of direct democracy (Matsusaka 2005). In fall 2010,

California voters rejected Proposition 23 that sought to void the AB32 regulation. This

    This act is often referred to by its legislative name, Assembly Bill 32, or “AB32”.

Proposition garnered 38% of the total vote in 2010. In 2008, 52.7% of voters approved of

issuing nearly $10 billion in bonds to finance the development of a high-speed rail project.

       This paper studies voting on these low carbon initiatives using precinct and census block

group level data. We also use micro survey data to test hypotheses concerning the support for

low carbon policies. We document that stated preferences based on micro data are highly

informative about predicting local aggregate voting patterns (Luttmer 2001).

       Our central focus is documenting the role that political ideology and economic geography

plays in determining voting patterns on low carbon policies. We posit that political liberals are

more likely to support such legislation. In addition, we explore the role that suburban living

plays in determining voter support. As we discuss below, suburbanites face higher costs for

complying with low carbon regulation’s requirements and are located physically further from

new rail transit infrastructure. These “price effects” should, all else equal, reduce suburban

support for such policies.


The Two California Low Carbon Ballot Initiatives

       Proposition 23 sought to place a moratorium on the rollout of California’s ambitious

climate change mitigation efforts (known as Assembly Bill 32 (AB32)). It was signed into law in

2006 by Governor Schwarzenegger, and is a landmark piece of environmental regulation. Prop

23 would have suspended AB32, until the unemployment rate fell to 5.5% for one full year.

Thus, a vote for Proposition 23 is a vote against California’s unilateral efforts to reduce its

greenhouse gas emissions.

       The Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, also known as AB32, is a California state

law that requires the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to reduce greenhouse gas

emissions from all sources throughout the state to 1990 levels by 2020. This represents

                                                  3
emissions reductions of about 25% with much more stringent emissions reductions required by

the year 2050 (Hanemann 2008). The penalties for missing these targets are not known.

        AB32 represents a bundle of several types of regulations and market mechanisms

targeting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The largest policy in CARB’s toolbox is the cap and

trade system, which in 2013 went into effect for electric utilities and large industrial facilities,

and in 2015 is scheduled to go into effect for distributors of transportation, natural gas and other

fuels. In addition to the cap and trade system, CARB is responsible for overseeing numerous

regulations, including a first-in-the-country GHG emissions standards for light duty vehicles,

subsequently adopted by other states and the federal government. Other regulations include an

aggressive renewable portfolio standard for the electric utilities so that 33% of the state’s power

is to be generated by low carbon wind and solar power by the year 2020.4 An open debate

continues on the likely impact of such regulation on electricity prices. Some industry consulting

studies have claimed that these costs are very high.5

        The second political issue we study is voter support for California’s high speed rail. In

2008, voters approved Prop 1A. The Voter Information pamphlet for that election described

Prop 1A (the “Safe, reliable high-speed passenger train bond act.”) as:


        To provide Californians a safe, convenient, affordable, and reliable alternative to driving
        and high gas prices; to provide good-paying jobs and improve California's economy
        while reducing air pollution, global warming greenhouse gases, and our dependence on
        foreign oil, shall $9.95 billion in bonds be issued to establish a clean, efficient high-speed
        train service linking Southern California, the Sacramento/San Joaquin Valley, and the
        San Francisco Bay Area, with at least 90 percent of bond funds spent for specific
        projects, with private and public matching funds required, including, but not limited to,
        federal funds, funds from revenue bonds, and local funds, and all bond funds subject to
        independent audits? Fiscal Impact: State costs of $19.4 billion, assuming 30 years to pay
        both principal and interest costs of the bonds. Payments would average about $647

         over $1 billion annually; at least partially, and potentially fully, offset by passenger
         fares.6

         Figure 1 displays a map of California and shows the HSR’s station stops. This figure

highlights that this place-based multi-billion dollar investment will have differential effects

across California. Previous research has examined how Europe’s high-speed rail has impacted

economic activity (Brakman, Garretse and Schramm 2000). Information provided to ballot

voters in 2008 stated that the train would reach top speeds of 220 MPH and allow for a travel

time from Los Angeles to San Francisco in about 2½ hours for about $50 per person.7

         High-speed rail is explicitly described as a low carbon form of transportation. The

California Air Resources Board subsequently approved a California HSR Authority report that

documents the level of greenhouse gas reductions resulting from the bullet train project.8

         Figures 2 and 3 display the cross-county spatial distribution in the share of voters who

voted in favor of each of these initiatives. Recall that a vote in favor of Prop 23 is an “anti-

carbon vote” (because it would freeze the implementation of AB32). The figures clearly show

that coastal California is more pro-transit and pro-environment than the rest of the state, as is the

northern portion, at least along the coast.

The Determinants of Low Carbon Voting

         AB32 represents a bundle of different efforts to reduce every sector’s carbon emissions.

One major piece of this effort is the nation’s first carbon cap and trade market. This new market

will raise the price of both gasoline and electricity.

         In comparing the private benefits and costs of supporting a piece of carbon mitigation

regulation, it is intuitive that environmentalists will gain greater benefits from enacting such

regulation. There is a subset of the population who loses utility from polluting and this creates a

personal incentive for these individuals to engage in voluntary restraint even when they face no

Pigouvian incentive not to pollute (Kotchen and Moore 2008).

         In this section, we present a rational choice model of voting in favor of low carbon

legislation. Each person gains utility from private consumption, , housing, , and loses utility

from its emissions of carbon. For simplicity, we assume that the population has the same

preferences over consumption and housing and that carbon enters the utility function in an

additively separable component. The population differs with respect to its disutility from

producing pollution. For people who are free riders,             equals zero in equation (1), while a larger

    indicates a greater willingness to engage in voluntary restraint.9

                                                 ,                                                          (1)

In addition to differing with respect to , households also differ with respect to their hourly

wage, measured in dollars and defined as             . In equation (1), carbon is a choice variable that

will be a function of household transportation and housing choices.10


9
 Each household views themselves as small in the market economy and thus aggregate carbon emissions are
unaffected by each household’s contribution to the total stock of the pollutant. We could augment the utility
function to include the aggregate stock of carbon emissions. Those with a larger “B” for private carbon emissions
would derive more disutility from the growing aggregate GHG stock.
10
   In our model, we do not explicitly incorporate other features of geography such as summer temperature. In
California, areas closer to the water are both more expensive and feature cooler summers. Inland residents will

                                                        6
        Each household must commute to the city center by car or by bus. To simplify the

problem, we assume that commuters rent access to the bus or car. The car is more expensive

and emits more carbon per mile than the bus (because of economies of scale for public transit)

but the car is faster. The car’s rental price is                   and the bus’s daily rental price (i.e. its fare) is

    .

        In addition to choosing a commuting mode, each household must also choose the distance

from the city center at which it lives, and the quantity of housing it will consume. These choices

in turn also determine the household’s carbon production. The hedonic pricing gradient

determines the price of housing at each distance from the city center. Homes closer to the city

center will be more expensive (because a shorter commute is a desirable attribute) and at any

distance from the city center, the price of a home will be an increasing function of its size. Call

this hedonic pricing gradient              ,     .

        With this notation, each household faces the following optimization problem:

                                               , , ,       ,       ,

        Subject to:

        24                             ,                                     , if commute by car                    (2)


                         24                                    ,             , if commute by bus                    (3)


                                                                               , for bus commuters.                 (4)
                                                       /


                                                                   , for car commuters.                             (5)

        Equation (2) presents the budget constraint for a person who chooses to commute by car.

The left side of the equation represents the total income this person earns. Note that total income

recognize that they will consume more electricity during the summer to cool their homes. In our empirical results
below, we will include county fixed effects.

                                                               7
is a decreasing function of his commute distance (holding speed of the car constant). His total

income is greater if the speed of the car is faster because he has more time to work. This car

commuter’s expenditure is presented on the right side of the budget constraint where he can buy

private consumption, housing and one car rental. This car driver must pay the market price for

a gallon of gasoline,    , where the number of gallons required depends on commute distance

and vehicle fuel efficiency (miles per gallon,)         . Equation (3) presents the budget

constraint for the bus rider. Bus riders do not pay for gasoline and the bus speed is slower and

the bus ticket is cheaper than renting a car.

       Finally, equations (4) and (5) distinguish this model from classic monocentric city

models with a transport modal choice (Leroy and Sonstelie 1983, Glaeser, Kahn and Rapapport

2008). These equations represent the carbon production functions for bus commuters and car

commuters, respectively. The household’s carbon production is an increasing function of his

commute’s total gasoline consumption and thus is weighted by the carbon emissions factor          if

he commutes by car. If he commutes by bus, we must incorporate that the bus is a club good. In

this case we take the total gasoline consumption to move the bus an extra mile and divide by the

parameter               , which the household treats as the historical average occupancy of the

bus, to calculate each person’s share of total bus gasoline consumption. Multiplying this amount

by    yields the amount of carbon generated by the average bus rider, per mile from the city

center. Finally, the term        reflects that for any house of size , electricity consumption

scales with the size of the home. Those who live in larger suburban homes will consume more

electricity. Given that over 80% of U.S power is generated using coal and natural gas, this will

increase carbon emissions. In this case,    represents the local electric utility’s carbon emissions




                                                  8
factor. This term would drop out if the utility generated its power with zero carbon wind and

solar.11

           Solving this maximization problem as a function of            and     yields the following

comparative statics.      Fixing the wage        , a person who has a slightly higher         will live in a

smaller house, closer to the city center and be more likely to commute by public transit. Holding

     constant, a higher wage household will be more likely to live closer to the city center, in a

bigger home, and to commute by car.            Households with a very low , and households with

moderate wages would be the most likely to locate far from the city center. There, they could

enjoy a large home and commute by car to reduce their commute time. Such low B suburban

households would lose little direct utility due to the carbon they create.

           In this economy, household carbon production will be an increasing function of distance

to the city center. Further from the city center, the homes are bigger, the commute is longer, and

people are more likely to commute by the high carbon private car mode. To provide a sample of

the magnitude of the extra operating costs imposed by AB32, suppose that in the near future that

the cap and trade provisions raise the price of gasoline by 50 cents a gallon in California. A

center city resident with easy access to public transit will face a lower cost imposed by this

regulation than a suburban home owner who drives 15,000 miles per year in an SUV that

achieves 20 miles per gallon. Under these assumptions, this suburban household will face a

marginal increase in transportation cost of $375 per year due to the carbon regulation. This

example highlights how locational choice and past durables choices together determine the price

of complying with carbon regulation.



11
  Note that we are assuming that private consumption generates zero carbon. It would be simple to relax this
assumption or we could augment the model to have multiple types of consumption that differ with respect to their
carbon content.

                                                        9
        In this model, those eager to engage in voluntary restraint choose to live close to the city

center and choose a commuting mode (the bus) such that the costs they face from AB32 are

lower than those who live in the suburbs in a large home, and who commute by private car. In

this sense, personal ideology determines the economic price that voters face for complying with

new regulation.

        This point distinguishes carbon voting from other pieces of environmental regulation. In

past work, Peltzman (1984) and Kahn and Matsusaka (1997) have argued that economic factors

(rather than ideology) are the dominant determinant of voting on environmental referenda. For

example, Kahn and Matsusaka document that counties featuring a larger share of agricultural

interests are more likely to vote against environmental regulation that potentially lowers this

sector’s profitability.

        In the case of carbon voting, a household’s locational choice is jointly determined by its

ideology and its economics circumstances. As highlighted by our model, the interplay of the

parameters B and W determine the cost of voting in favor of carbon mitigation. We could

further enrich our model by incorporating the fact that households have “locked in” to a set of

durables and a residential community where they have formed their social networks and have

local knowledge over shopping opportunities.12 Those who have chosen the suburbs will

recognize that it is more costly for them to comply with low carbon regulation mandates. If

homes and cars are durable owned assets, rather than rented assets, then the suburbanites who

own fuel inefficient vehicles will suffer an asset loss from the introduction of carbon pricing.

Standard reasoning from urban economics predicts increased costs of transportation will be

12
  We recognize that our model is static. In a more realistic dynamic model, households would purchase durables
such as their home and their car. It is reasonable to assume that AB32’s introduction represented a surprise for
California’s voters who had purchased such durables years before. Future research should study how the
expectation of rising energy prices in California affects durables demand relative to durables demand by
observationally identical households who live in states that are not expected to enact cap and trade legislation.

                                                        10
capitalized into lower prices for suburban real estate—and higher prices of urban land (Blake

2012, Sexton, Wu and Zilberman 2012).

        This model has implications for voting on Proposition 23. Consumers make decisions

knowing their own private disutility from polluting, their . It is reasonable to assume that those

people with a high      also derive higher private benefits from enacting AB32’s goals of reducing

California’s greenhouse gas emissions and serving as a guinea pig for the rest of the world. This

suggests that    is positively correlated with the private benefits of voting for AB32. As we

discussed above, all else equal, consumers with a higher     will face a lower cost of voting

against Prop 23 because their carbon production is lower as they live closer to the city center in

small homes and commute using public transit.

        Distance to the city center should also have implications for voting on high-speed rail.

Given that the station stops will be in the center cities, those who live downtown will have better

access than those who live in suburbs of the metropolitan areas along the route. Our residential

sorting model also suggests that those with a taste for voluntary restraint will be more likely to

live closer to the city center. Under the assumption that people with a taste for voluntary

restraint (i.e a high   in equation (1)), care about reducing California’s total stock of GHG

emissions, then these same individuals should be more likely to support HSR.




The Empirical Framework



        To study the determinants of support for low carbon legislation in California, we study

two types of data. The first will be household level surveys of support for the two propositions


                                                 11
and the second set will be actual voting at the census block group level. Following the earlier

literature on environmental voting, we will include standard demographic controls such as age,

ethnicity, education and income.13 In terms of the socioeconomic variables, we expected that

more educated, richer voters will support carbon mitigation.

         We are especially interested in the role of political ideology in the household or in the

neighborhood where the household lives, and the role of urban form where urban form will be

measured by distance to the center city and the population density in the household’s local

geographic area.

         In studying California voter behavior, when using survey data we estimate the following

model:

                                                                                            (6)


Where                is a zero or one variable indicating whether or not the respondent supports

proposition . When using aggregate data we estimate the following model:


                                                                                            (7)


where                    refers to the percent of precinct voting yes on a proposition . We

include county ( ) fixed effects in each regression,           . Three types of explanatory variables

are defined by the vectors      , and : In equation (7),          is a vector and represents

the coefficient vector on these terms. We will estimate equation (7) using ordinary least squares

(OLS), while weighting the observations by the total number of votes in precinct to mitigate

heteroskedasticity concerns.14 For conceptual clarity, we use the same notation on the right-hand

side of equations (6) and (7). This is a slight abuse of notation as the measures in the                 , and

vectors, though capturing identical concepts, are made of up variables taken from survey

responses in equation (6), whereas the measures in equation (7) are block group level aggregates.

         The urban form variables are meant to capture the forces we discussed in the previous

section’s model. All else equal, we predict that households who live closer to a metropolitan

area’s city center will be more likely to vote against Prop 23. In previous research, we have

documented that households who live closer to the city center drive less (Holian and Kahn 2014).

Suburban residents also spend more on electricity than observationally identical center city

residents (see Glaeser and Kahn 2010).

         In the economic model presented earlier, we simultaneously modeled the choice of

residential location, commute mode and housing demand. All else equal, high “B” households

will choose to live closer to the city center and will configure their lives to have a minimal

environmental externality impact. Such households will face a low cost of voting for low carbon

regulation. This “B” parameter is known by the households but cannot be observed by the

econometrician. One way to proxy for this is to use political party registration data. We are

implicitly assuming that Democrats have a high “B”. Costa and Kahn (2013) document that

political liberals consume less electricity than observationally identical households and consume

  Technically, the unit of analysis in our study of the voting data is the block group. We merge voting data to block
groups. However, it is less intuitive to describe “the percent of the block group voting for X”, because most readers
know that in the U.S. voting takes place in precincts whose boundaries rarely coincide perfectly with block groups.


                                                         13
even less on hot summer months. Kahn (2007) document that political liberals are more likely

to own hybrid vehicles and to install solar panels.

           Figure 4 documents where Democrats and Republicans live within California’s

metropolitan areas. More than 50% of residents who live within five miles of a city center are

Democrats. This share shrinks monotonically with distance from the city center. In contrast,

roughly 25% of residents who live within five miles of a city center are Republicans and this

share rises monotonically with distance from the city center. Note the fractions of Democrats and

Republicans do not sum to one in the figure as there are a number of independent voters and

those who register within one of several minor parties.

           Our reduced form estimates of the voting propensities represents a conditional analysis.

Given where households have chosen to live, we study their voting patterns. We acknowledge

that we do not explicitly model the residential locational choice decision. 15 In the absence of

random assignment of households to different distances from the city center, we cannot recover

the causal effect of suburbanization on opposing low carbon policy efforts.

           While we acknowledge this point, it is important to note that households also choose their

locations based on many idiosyncratic factors that are unlikely to be correlated with their

propensities to vote on environmental legislation. People differ with respect to their place of

work with some working downtown and others working in the suburbs (Glaeser and Kahn 2001).

People differ with respect to whether they have school-aged children and whether they are

willing to use the center city public schools. Some households may have a strong taste for the

downtown culture and retail opportunities and the city center’s consumer city (Glaeser, Kolko

and Saiz 2001). Households may seek to live near a family member who can help with

babysitting or near an elderly parent who requires their assistance. These examples highlight
15
     We know of no empirical studies that jointly examine where households choose to live and how they vote.

that households are sorting within metropolitan areas for many reasons that may be independent

of the unobserved determinants of voting on low carbon legislation. We must rely on the fact

that we have included a detailed set of explanatory variables in our attempt to isolate the

association between geographic location and support for low carbon policies.




Data

            We obtained our data from a variety of sources. The Statewide Database (SWDB) at UC

Berkeley distributes statement of vote files matched to Census blocks for elections between 1992

and present. The two survey data sets we analyze were both collected by the Public Policy

Institute of California (PPIC).

           For our analysis of voting data, we merge additional variables to the data supplied by

SWDB, namely the 2006-2010 American Community Survey (ACS) Five-Year Estimates

(which replaced the decennial Census as the primary source for important socioeconomic

variables, including income and education at the block-group level.)

           The survey data was collected in July 2010 and in March of 2012. The 2010 survey

asked about opinions towards global warming in general and AB32 in particular, although it did

not specifically name Proposition 23. One important characteristic of this survey for our

purposes is the availability of zip code identifiers for respondents, thus allowing us to calculate

measures of distance from zip code centroids to downtown, as well as neighborhood population

density.16 The 2010 PPIC survey also asked the following question,

           Next, to address global warming, do you favor or oppose the state law that requires



16
     Though not as refined as our measure of these variables calculated using block group centroids in the voting data.

                                                           15
        California to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions back to 1990 levels by the year 2020?

While the 2012 PPIC survey asked:

       Do you favor or oppose building a high-speed rail system in California? (favor, oppose)

       We coded “favor” answers to these questions as one, “oppose” answers as zero, and we

dropped the few dozen respondents who either refused to answer or were unsure.

       To proxy for environmental ideology, we include voting indicators. To study voting on

both propositions, we use the fraction of the block group voting for George Bush in the 2004

election as a control for ideology. Snyder (1996) documents that political party registration data

is an important correlate of voting on California referenda. For the survey data, we drop all

unregistered voters, and generate an indicator variable equal to one if the respondent is a

registered Republican.

       The variable lnDISTANCE was created by merging geocodes to the ACS block group

and the PPIC zip code level data, and then using the 2006 definitions of metropolitan areas, we

calculated the distance from each block group to the center of the MSA in which the block group

or zip code is in. For block groups and zip codes that are not in an MSA, we set their distance

equal to 80 kilometers, which is the location we have arbitrarily chosen as the urban fringe.

Given the presence of some zero and very low distances and densities, we take the natural log of

one plus the distance in kilometers. Similarly, the lnDENSITY variable is the natural log of one

plus population density at the block group level, measured as population by land area, measured

in square miles.

       Our study’s variable definitions and summary statistics are reported in Tables 1 through

4. Comparing the variable descriptions in Tables 1 and 2 clarifies the differences between the

component variables of the    , and     vectors in equations (6) and (7). For example, lnINC is


                                                16
the natural log of (one plus) block group average household income in the aggregate data, and

the natural log of (one plus) the respondent’s self-reported income in the survey data. Tables 3

and 4 provide summary statistics for the three datasets. Across the two surveys most averages

are quite similar; one exception is that the average value of BLACK was 19% in the 2010 survey

but 7% in the 2012 survey. In comparison, the average value of BLACK was 6% in the

aggregate data. As a general statement, the survey data appear to slightly oversample older,

richer, more educated and more liberal voters.



Results

       Table 5 reports four regressions to investigate the correlates of support for AB32. The

first two columns report estimates of equation (7) using the block group level data while the last

two columns report estimates of equation (6) using the survey data. It is important to note that in

columns (1) and (2) the dependent variable is the share of the block group who voted “no” on

Prop 23 so this is indicative of support for AB32. We transform the dependent variable so we

can directly compare the precinct level regressions with the survey regressions. County fixed

effects are included in each regression.

       Table 5 highlights the similarities and the differences in the results between the precinct

regressions and the survey regressions. To streamline this discussion, we focus on the results

reported in columns (2) and (4) where we include the political variables. Across the

specifications, we consistently find that Republicans oppose AB32. A ten percentage point

increase in the share of registered Republicans reduces the probability of voting “No” on Prop 23

by 5.5 percentage points. To compare with the survey data, we consider a 100 percentage point

increase, which reduces the probability of voting no on Prop 23 by 55 percentage points. This


                                                 17
compares with the 37 percentage point reduction associated with the results from the survey data

in column (4). Both results suggest ideology has a very large effect on support for carbon

mitigation regulation.

         A second finding is that those who live at higher population density and closer to the city

center are more likely to favor AB32. While the urban form variables are statistically

significant and of the expected signs, they do not explain as much as ideology.17

         One new finding is that controlling for education, richer people are not more likely to

support AB32. The standard J-curve logic is that richer people and nations are more likely to

support environmental regulation. The income effect’s magnitude shrinks when we control for

the community’s political party voting. As shown in Tables 5 and 6, both homeowners and

homeowner communities consistently vote against low carbon regulation.

          Several of the demographic variables do not yield similar findings in the survey micro

regressions and the precinct level regressions. While more educated people support AB32, this

variable is statistically insignificant in the survey regressions. Relatively few demographic

variables are statistically significant in the survey regressions.18




17
   In unreported results, we estimated restricted models with county fixed effects and ideology only, and also
models with urban form and fixed effects only, and the R-squared in the former restricted model is much higher. As
a robustness check, we also estimated a specification using the voting data that included the fraction of voters
registered with the Green Party. The coefficient on this variable had the theoretically expected sign, was statistically
significant, and was larger in magnitude in the Prop 23 model than the Prop 1A model. The R-squared increased
only very slightly when we included this additional measure of ideology, and the coefficients on the other variables,
specifically the urban form variables (lnDISTANCE and lnDENSITY) also changed only very slightly. These
results are available upon request.

18
   We carried out several joint F-tests. We reject the hypothesis that the coefficients on all of the demographic
variables are jointly zero (p<0.01), and we reject the hypothesis that the coefficients on the race and ethnicity
variables are jointly zero (p<0.01). However, we do not reject the hypothesis that lnINC and COLLEGE are jointly
zero (p<0.14) in the survey data results for AB32.


                                                          18
         Table 6 reports the high-speed rail results.          Richer people oppose it while more

educated people support it. Similar to the voting on AB32, people who live further from the city

at lower population density oppose it and Republicans are less likely to support it.

         Homeownership is found to reduce support for HSR on average. At first glance, this is a

surprising result. In the case of high-speed rail, voters should recognize that there will be a

direct real estate capitalization effect for those who live closer to the planned station stops.

Recent evidence from China’s bullet trains (see Zheng and Kahn 2013) documents positive

capitalization effect of distance to the rail stop.

         HSR represents a complex treatment because of its implications for existing land use

patterns. In the major cities, suburban NIMBY’s and in agricultural areas, farmers, have used

their voice to vote against Prop 1A and also to challenge its legality. At the same time, a

majority of voters did support Prop 1A in Central Valley areas like Bakersfield and Fresno,

which are historically conservative areas but which will effectively become suburbs of Los

Angeles and San Francisco once HSR is built. However Prop 1A did not receive the support of a

majority of voters, even in some Central Valley communities where the train will stop.19

Fischel (2001) describes the powerful incentives faced by homeowners to vote, and more

generally behave, in ways consistent with improving but especially preserving the value of their

homes.20



19
   In Fresno, Kern, Merced and San Joaquin a majority of voters approved Prop 1A, while in Stanislaus, Sacramento,
Kings, Madera and Tulare a minority approved. The three largest city in these counties are Fresno (461,116),
Sacramento (456,441 ) and Bakersfield (295,536, which is in Kern County.) Population as of 2005. For an
overview of these issues see: http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/10/20/calif-high-speed-
rail/3090811/
20
    We visited Fresno in spring of 2013 and attended a realtor conference. One of the speakers, a realtor specializing
in agricultural land, provided anecdotal evidence that agricultural land values in the area were indeed on the rise,
and moreover that out of town buyers from places like San Francisco were increasingly involved in transactions.
Although he attributed this to a rise in almond prices rather than speculation fueled by HSR, this is suggestive and
future research should disentangle these various effects of HSR on property values.

Self Reported Low Carbon Preferences and Aggregate Voting Outcomes



       In this section, we follow Luttmer (2001) and use the survey regression results to test

whether the marginal effects generated from survey data are informative in predicting aggregate

voting outcomes. We use the results from equation (6) and take the regression coefficient vector

and multiply this by community level demographics and predict each census tract’s average

likelihood of supporting low carbon regulation. We then correlate this predicted index with the

actual aggregate voting data. If the survey results are truthfully reported then the regression

estimates should have some predictive power of actual voting behavior. Table 7 reports the

results. We find a strong positive correlation between these two measures of preferences for low

carbon regulation.

       The scatterplot presented in Figure 5 shows the actual block group vote share on the y-

axis and the predicted vote share (calculated without fixed effects, given our survey sample did

not contain respondent data from the majority of counties) on the x-axis. In his study of welfare

preferences, Luttmer found the adjusted R-squared in this simple regression to be 0.407. Fitting

a straight line to the points in our scatter plot, the adjusted R-squared is 0.685.


Discussion

       In recent years, more and more people are living further from city centers. Table 8

presents data for the U.S metropolitan population for each decade from 1970 to 2010 on the

share of residents who live within different distance bands of the city center. In each row, the

entries sum to one. In 1970, 31.6% of the metropolitan population lived within five miles of the

city center while by the year 2010, this percentage had shrunk to 16.9%. In 1970, the share

living within ten miles of the city center was 57.2% and this had shrunk to 35.7% by 2010. In

                                                  20
Tables 5 and 6, we documented a negative correlation between living further from the city center

and favoring low carbon policies. If this correlation represents a causal effect, then this

suburbanization trend has implications for the political economy of low carbon voting.

        The link between suburbanization and carbon production, as highlighted by our model,

can be attenuated by the introduction of more fuel-efficient vehicles and electricity generated by

zero carbon renewable power. If these products exist, then a suburbanite’s GHG emissions

would be roughly equal to his center city counterpart. In this case, the cost of voting for low

carbon regulation would fall significantly for suburbanites.


Conclusion

        In recent years, California’s voters have had the opportunity to repeal the low carbon

AB32 regulation and to choose whether to go forward with investing in costly High-Speed Rail.

In both cases, the voters chose the low carbon choice but there was significant spatial variation in

the support for these measures. Controlling for standard demographics such as ethnicity,

education and income, we have focused on the role of political affiliation and geography as

correlates of low carbon voting. We find that political liberals consistently support low carbon

initiatives.

        All else equal, those who live further from the city center are more likely to oppose low

carbon policies. The U.S is a suburban nation with the median metropolitan area resident living

9.9 miles from the city center and 25% of the population living at least 17.1 miles away from the

city center in the year 2000. Relative to nations with more urbanized populations, people in the

U.S drive more, live in larger homes and consume more electricity. This fossil fuel driven

lifestyle raises the short run price of voting in favor of carbon mitigation regulation.




                                                 21
        Our findings mirror nationwide findings concerning the correlates of Congressional

voting on low carbon legislation such as the 2009 American Clean Energy and Security Act

concludes that Representatives whose districts are rich, liberal and low carbon are much more

likely to vote in favor of carbon mitigation (Cragg et. al. 2013).

        Together these results highlight that even within a well known “Blue State” such as

California that there is both an ideological divide and a city versus suburb divide on carbon

mitigation policy efforts. While economists have stressed the insurance benefits from avoiding

“known unknown” fat tail risks (Weitzman 2009, Pindyck 2011), subsets of voters are rejecting

this vision.

        Past political economy studies have stressed that voters will oppose environmental

regulations that threaten their jobs (Kahn and Matsusaka 1997). This paper has presented new

evidence on the role that residential lifestyle choices and ideology play in determining low

carbon voting patterns. Given existing technologies, our results suggest that the

suburbanization of the median voter poses a challenge for policy makers who seek to have the

United States lead in international efforts to sign a global carbon treaty.
