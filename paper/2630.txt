                      SMUGGLING, CAMOUFLAGING, AND MARKET STRUCTURE


                                             ABSTRACT


        We    examine how market   structure and enforceaent affect smuggling and
welfare       in a model where smuggling is camouflaged by legal sales.           Conditions

are given for when some, but not necessarily all, firms smuggle.                 With camou-

flaging, the market price is below the price when all sales are legal, so

smuggling improves welfare         i-f   the price effect outweighs   excess smuggling

cost.        This welfare effect is directly related to the degree of competition.

Incressed enforcement       in this model potentially reduces welfare.           The model

is shown to       be consistent with evidence on cigarette smuggling in the United

States for 1975-1982.

                                             I. Introduction

          In recent years there has been an increasing interest in the analysis of smuggling as

an economic phenomenon.' The seminal paper in this area is by Bhagwati and Hansen
[1973), who examined the welfare effects of smuggling under perfect competition and

monopoly in a two good trade model. They found that smuggling would necessarily reduce

welfare only when smuggling coexisted with legal trade. This spawned a series of articles

which, to a large extent, dealt with when the coexistence of legal trade and smuggling
could be welfare increasing. By introducing a third non-tradedgood, Sheikh [1974] showed

that smuggling which coexisted with legal trade could be welfare improving. Pitt [1981]
and Martin and Panagariya [1984] obtained the same result by allowing legal trade to

coexist    with smugglingwhen firms        camouflage their illegal trade by importing some goods

legally.

       The appeal of these recent papers              is   that they focus on the microeconomic

foundations of the two types of trade coexisting. Pitt's contributionwas to show that when
competitive firms smuggle by camouflaging, the condition for zero profits in long run

equilibrium implies a price disparity2 (i.e. a domestic price of imports lower than the
tariff inclusive world       price).   The model of Martin and Panagariya is particularly

important because it explicitly introduces the uncertain nature of smuggling into the
individual firm's decision problem and shows that the first order conditions for profit

maximization require a price disparity when the probability the firm will                be detected

smuggling is a function of the amount          it trades   legally. The Bhagwati-Hansen (BH) type

of coexistence without price disparity is shown to follow when the           probability of detection

depends only on the total amount smuggled.
       One of the shortcomings of the Pitt and Martin and Panagariya (hereafter P-MP

models) is    that   pure legal traders   are driven out of the market   when smugglingoccurs. At

the other extreme, BH type of smuggling allowe each firm to either smuggle or trade

legally (but not both).       This leaves unexplained the intermediate case         of   camouflaged
smugglingby some, but not all, firms in a market.3 This case is more than a theoretical
curiosity. For example, commercial smuggling of cigarettes from low tax to high tax
states for sale in legal retail or vending outlets has been a problem in the United States.
In    1975 ten   states reported this type      of smuggling   as their most   serious cigarette tax

evasion problem [ACIR, 1977, p. 10], and the revenue loss to state and local governments

in high tax states from cigarette tax evasion was estimated to be $391 million per year

[ACIR, 1977, p. 1]. The Federal Contraband Cigarette Act of 1978 was enacted because

the problem with commercial smuggling was considered so widespread. It seems unlikely,

however,    that   all legal outlets were selling contraband cigarettes. Another example of

camouflaged smugglingis misweighing or misinvoicing             of imports te avoid custems dutiea.
There is no reason, a priori, to expect all importers te do this.
         In this paper we model    an import secter composed of firms in a Cournot industry in

which legal traders can survive along with firms which smuggle through camouflaging as

long   as firms differ in their   excess cost   of smuggling and   have some market power. The

model is quasicompetitive      in the sense that increasing the number           of firms increases

imports and drives the domestic price in equilibrium down to the level that would prevail
under pure competition. The model allows the coexistence of camoufiagers and legal

traders, but in the limiting case of pure competition it can be shown te be equivalent te the
P-MI' type models. This has the advantage of allowing us                 te examine how market
structure, as well as enforcement, affect smuggling and welfare. The major results are:

(1)   that the price disparity that occurs in models where       smuggled   trade is camouflaged is
directly related to the degree of competition in the importing industry; (2) since this price

disparity is welfare improving, ceteris paribus, the welfare effect of smugglingin the model
is directly related to the degree of competition as well; and, (3) since the quantity imported

by    a camouflager exceeds that of a legal trader, ceteris pan bus, an increase in enforcement
may reduce welfare even when enforcement is costless. These results differ markedly
from welfare comparisonsarising from coexistence with BH-type smuggling.

         Sections II    —   VI are theoretical. Because the literature related to our work focuses

on smugglingacross national boundaries, the discussion in these sections will do so as well.

The model, however, also applies to smugglingacross state lines induced by differential tax

rates, and our empirical analysis will focus on such a case. In Section VII we show that
13.5. cigarette sales for 1975—82 are consistent with our model of camouflaged smuggling.


                                          H. Firm Behavior

         Consider an industry with N firms, indexed by i, who behave              as Cournot rivals.

Each firm imports and sells domestically a good for which            it pays a fixed world   price,   p.
We assume      that     the good is homogeneous and domestic production is zero, so          that each

firm faces the inverse demand function P(Q), where Q denotes the total quantity imported

by the     N   firms.       The government levies an ad valorem tariff, t, and provides                an
enforcement mechanism at level e in order to deter tariff.avoidance. Firm                i can,       if   it
chooses, attempt to smuggle a fraction           of q1,   the amount it imports. If it does, then the
probability of successfully smuggling a unit is s(A.,e), which we assume to be decreasing
and concave in both arguments and satisfy                 for all and e and s(O,e) = 1 for
                                                    s(O,e)e[O,1J
all e.

         However, there is an additionalcost to attempting to smuggle which is paid whether

the firm is successfulor not. This cost could be a real cost (from society's point of view)
such as the cost of special packaging or a payment to foreign suppliers to misinvoice, or it

could be    a transfer      such as a bribe to a customs official to misweigh   or to "look the other

way." In general, we would expect this excess cost to vary across firms.4               Those firms

whose managers have more experience are more likely to have established ties with

suppliers or officials and, hence, lower fees. Similarly, they may have better information

regarding the type of enforcement activity so that packaging effort, and therefore cost,

may differ. The same arguments would hold for managers with familial ties to suppliers
and/or officials.       To allow   for such differences among firms, we specify a firm specific
parameter, y, which with e determines the excess cost of attempting to smuggle. For

simplicity,   we assume the total excess cost of smugglingis given by                           Note that this

specific functional form     of total excess smugglingcost is not necessary for our results. The
analysis carries through for any excess cost function which is linear in Sq. and for one
which is convex in           as long     as   the second order conditions are appropriately modified.
We chose this form for expositional convenience.

       Each firm     is   assumed to choose            and      so    as     to maximize its expected profit.

Expectations are assumed to be rational, so that               1—
                                                                    a(S,e)
                                                                             is the true fraction of    which

is detected and confiscated by the governmentenforcementmechanism. For simplicity, we

assume that all goods confiscated are resold on the market5 and there are no fines, so
that expected profitto firm i is
(1)           EU(q,S) = [s(9,e)P(Q)_p*_#ye]Sq + [P(Q)— pt(l+t)](l—S.)q.

where q    = [q1            and S    =
                                         [S    5N     Given standard Cournot-Nashbehavior, the first

order conditions for an interior solution to this problem are


(2)                                =0
              P(Q)($4i+s_1)+P*t_7ie
                + 1_S][P(Q)+F(Q)q]+S(p*t_ye)_pt(1+t) =                           0


       Equation (3) has the usual interpretation that a firm will expand imports up to the

point where expected marginal revenue equals marginal cost (assuming the vertical
intercept of the demand function exceeds p*(1 +t)). Given that importation is optimal, it
follows from (2) and the aasumptions on s that a firm attempts to camouflage, S>O,                      if and
only if p*t>yle, which says that profit per unit successfully smuggled exceeds the per unit
cost of smuggling. Whenever p*t>yle, the optimal fraction smuggled                              is determined
uniquely by (2) for any nonnegative vector of imports q and can be written as

f.(q;p*,t,7.,e), whers                   =           > 0 for   all   n, Of/dp* > 0, Of/Ot > 0,
                                                                      ij     1
                            Of/8q1            OfId
       C   0,   and 8i18e   <   0. Notice firm i's choice of S depends on the actions of its rivals

only though market price, so that a given change in output by any firm (including i) results
                                                         .5




in the same change in         because it has the same effect on market price. In particular, an

increase in imports by any firm reduces price and induces each firm to increase the

fraction it attempts to smuggle. This occurs because the marginal gain of switching                      a legal
                                                                                                         —
unit of imports to an illegal unit. tp, is unaffected by F, but the confiscation loss,             (1        s)P,

declines with P.

      These results imply that when smuggling is optimal for firm i, its problem can be

viewed   as   choosing   a   level of imports to maximize (1) subject to                      f.(q;P*.t,.y.,e).

Expected profit can be written as
(4)         U(q)
                   = [s(f(q),eI)P(Q)_p* e](q)q+[P(Q)— p(l                         —f1(q))q,

in which case the necessary condition for an interior solution is

                                                  =
(5)         [s(f(q),e)f(q) + 1 —f(q)][P(Q)+P'(Q)q] f(q)(p* +y e) + (1 —f1(q))p(1+t).

Given the definition of      f(q)   (5) is equivalent to (2) and (3). We also assume             that     (4) is

strictly concave in q for any              =
                                               (q1 q1_      1,...,q) so a unique maximum exists.
The second implication of       flf./8q.   > 0 is that even though the world price and per unit

excess smuggling cost are fixed, the average cost               of importing is    declining in            This

result is important in determining several              comparative static results in Sections Ill-VT.

Moreover,   it prevents us from determining whether marginal cost is increasing in or not,
which explains why we explicitly assumed rI(q) was concave in

      Finally, we must impose some restrictions on the inverse demand function to insure
the existence and stability of an industry equilibrium. Assume that there exist real

numbers M and K such that P(0                  =   M   > 0 and P(Q) =    0   for all   Q   K>       0.     Also

assume P(Q)     < 0 and P'(Q)+P'(Q)q < 0 for all               q   [OK] and all i. The latter condition

insures that an increase in imports by any other firm reduces (shifts down) the marginal

revenue of firm i and hence the expected marginal revenue of i as well. This is sufficient
to insure the stability   of an equilibrium and           allows us to do comparative statics.          It also
insures that i's expected marginal revenue is decreasing in its own imports. Now we can
                                                      6


view the industry problem as          a game in which         each firm's strategy set ie [OK] and                its

payoff function is given by     (4)   if ptt >     e and by (4) evaluated at                     0   if p*t       e.
Industry equilibrium is then a Nash equilibrium, which is a vector of imports (q1
such that                 II(q,q_) for all            [0,K] and for all      i     1       N. Existence of        an
equilibrium follows immediately (see Theorem 7.1 in Friedman [1977]). The equilibrium

vector of imports simultaneously induces equilibrium fractions smuggled by each firm

                      HI. Coexistenceof Legal Trade and Smuggling

        Now suppose there are two types of firms, differentiated only by the parameter

Let N1 firms have          and N2 firms have        2 where         and   2 satisfy -y1e < pt C y2e for
given values of e, pt and t. Then type 1 firms (with y1) will camouflage and type 2 firms
(with       will trade legally whenever it is optimal for both to import. We know                         that an
equilibrium exists in this case. The interesting question is whether or not there exists                          an

equilibrium in which both types import.                That is, when         (if ever) is the equilibrium

characterized by (q1,q2) where          ii   =        >   0   for   i1       N1 and         ci   =
                                                                                                     q2
                                                                                                          >   0   for

j=l     N2?

Proposition1:             There exist locally stable equilibrium outcomes of this smuggling

                          game in whicb one group of firms uses legal trade to camouflage its

                          smugglingand the remaining firms trade legally.

        Proof of Proposition 1:        Given     1e C ptt C      'y2e,
                                                                         it need only be shown that there

exist conditions under which both types of firms import positive quantities. Under the

assumptions on expected profit,         a necessary and sufficient          condition for type 1 firms to

import positive      is

                  f(O)[s(f(O)e)M—pt Tie] + (1 —f(O))[M—pt(1 +t)]
                                                                                   >   0

where 2   is   an N-dimensionalzero vector.          Since f(q) is not a function of M, clearly M can

be chosen large enough to satisfy this inequality for any feasible and finite values of the
                                                     7



parameters of the model. Given that this holds, there exists a q0 such that each

camouflager's first order condition holds at             =        (O,K)   in the absence of any legal
traders (type 2 firms). A sufficient condition to insure that some type            2   firms also import

positive quantities is then P(N1q°) > p*(1+t). This last condition holds for a large class

of demand     functions.    For example, if demand is linear, then          a   sufficient condition for

P(N1q°) >     p*() is given by M > [N1p*(1+t)+p*t_y1e]/(N1+ 1).                    Hence, the result of

this proposition holds for all linear demand functions with vertical intercept M that is

"large enough," and therefore also holds for an open, dense set of demand functions around
each linear demand function for which the result holds. Given existence, local stability

follows from P'(Q)+P"(Q)q C 0 (which insures the composition                     of the best response
function   of a camouflager with that     of a legal trader is less than one in absolute value).

Q.E.D.
       The result in Proposition    1   is significant because it provides a new and empirically
plausible explanationfor the coexistence of legal trade and smuggling.             One group of firms

pays the tariff on all units imported while another distinct group uses its legal trade to
camouflage    its smuggling.    Two features of the model        are necessary to obtain this result.
One,   as noted    above, is to differentiate firms in such          a wsy that some may         find it

profitable to smuggle while others do not. Here we have taken the simple approach of

assuming that some firms have a lower excess smuggling cost than others. The other
feature    is allowing    the firms to have enough market power that those which operate

legally can survive. As can be seen from           the proof,   we accomplish this by assuming that

the number of camoufiagers (N           is small   enough relative to market demand. Since the

equilibrium price    if    only camouflaging firms imported would be above               p (1 +t),   it   is

possible for legal traders to operate profitably as well.
       This model is quasi-competitive in the sense that increasing the number of

camouflagers andlor legal traders increases total imports and drives equilibrium price
down to the level that would prevail under pure competition.
      Proposition2: An increase in the number of legal tradere,              or camouflagers, or both,

                         will increase equilibrium output and reduce equilibriumprice.

         f) be the fraction that each          camoufiager attempts to smuggle in equilibrium.

Because camouflagers are identical and                 =                           it follows from (2)
                                                                    for all i and J'

Q.E.D.

         Suppose we begiii in an equilibrium where all firms earn economic profit, or                    >

pt(1 +t). Then it         follows from (7)    that   free entry of legal traders will drive down

equilibrium price until economic profits from legal trade vanish, or
                                                                                             =   p (1 + t).
                                                                                                  *


However, camoufiagers will still earn positive profit.         It follows from (2),      (6), and (7)   that
                              =                               > 0, so, in fact, camouflagers break
s(i,e)P(c)_p*_yie                 (l—_ i)P(c)_p*(1+t)
even on each unit traded legally and profit on each unit smuggled. At the other extreme,

(6) implies that with free entry         of camouflaging firms         (i.e. those with lowest excess

smugglingcost,        7) equilibriumprice will fall until

(10)             1[s(1,e)P()_p*_.1e]+(1_1)[P()_p*(1+t)]
This requires s(i,e)P(Qc)_p*_ie > 0               > P(Q)_p*(1+t) so that pure legal traders                   (-y2

firms) are driven out      of the market.          is equilibrium output when all firms are type                 1


firms earning zero economic profit. This limiting case             is    the market structure studied by
Pitt [1981] and Martin and Panagariya [1984].

                                        IV.     Price Disparity
          As one might expect, there is     a price disparity implied            by this model, and it varies

both with the composition of the market and the degree of competition. The measure of

price disparity we analyze is the equilibriumprice when all                    N firms trade            P(),
                                                                                                  legally,

                                                                                                     P(). The

                                                                                             N.

                                                                                                   Proposition 3

summarizes the major results for this disparity (i.e. 1P =

Proposition 3:             The price disparity increases with (i)              an increase in the      fraction of

                           camouflagers in a given industry;            (ii)   an increase in the number         of

                           camouflagers if demand is linear or if N1 = N2 and demand is
                           concave quadratic; and (iii)        an equal increase             in the number of

                           camouflagers and legal traders if N1                =
                                                                                   N2 and demandis either
                           linearor concave quadratic.

Proof of Proposition 3:           (i) Suppose     N1   is   increased and N         is   held constant, so that

                                                       c12 ]     —
                                                                   (s1 + 1         @1)(1               q2)/F>    0

This can be shown to be positive for linear demand with any market composition and for

concave, quadratic demand where N1      = N2 =     N/2.

which is positive for linear and concave quadratic demand.

      Finally, it is worthwhile to note that assuming linear demand         is   not sufficient to
show 5?sPI5N2> 0. Q.E.D.

      The first statement in Proposition 3 holds because replacing a legal trader with a
camouflager increases    c' reducing        but does not change     P() for given N.      On the

other hand, suppose the number of camouflagers increases, so that the number of firms in

the industry also increases. Then from Proposition 2, both                 and    P() decline.
Proposition 3 shows that        declines more rapidly  (at least for linear demand or for N1
=                                              the price disparity increases. However, an
    N2 and concave quadratic demand); so
increase in the number of legal traders has     an ambiguous effect on the price disparity.
Nevertheless,under the conditions stated, an equal increase in the number of camoufiagers
and legal traders will cause an increase in the price disparity. Even if an increase in the

number of legal traders does reduce the price disparity, ceteris paribus,        a corresponding
increase in the number of camoufisgers will more than offset that effect and the price

disparity will increase.
      The intuition behind results     (ii) and (iii)     is straightforward. With entry, the

marginal revenue of a legal trader and the expected marginal revenue of a camoufiager
                                                        11



shift down. Both types of traders reduce imports, but camouflagers are better able to

protect themselves from entry because they can drive down average cost by smuggling a
higher fraction (i.e. 881/ON      > 0).

          Figure 1 shows how the results in Proposition                3   relate to the P-MP measure of price

disparity. AP is given by the vertical distance between                             and         The horizontal

axis measures N1, so that, depending on what is assumed about N2 (and therefore N), the

graph can represent results (i),          (ii),   or   (iii).    Recalling Proposition 2, notice         that   4A.P



converges to the P.MP price disparity for large enough                        N    That is,   P(4) declines       to
                                                    = a for
p*(1+t) while             declines to             so   that N1rN1. Hence the properties
                                                                A.P

of .2P in Proposition (3) are consistent with our observation that in the limit our market

structure    is   that of P-MP.   Notice that when N1                 C in Figure 1 the   industry is composed

entirely of camoufiagers; yet 1P          < a for N        C
                                                                 N;. That is, the number of firms is            still

small enough for each identical firm to make positive economic profit.
            Now consider empirical estimates of price disparity. Although AF is a natural

measure of price disparity, empirically observed prices are                         pt(l+t)   and the market
                                                                                                                For
(domestic) price, P. For      NN;, PDp*(1+t)_P correctly estimates P()—
N C N; p*(1+t)          does not represent P(4), so that the measure of price disparity used in

previous literature will underestimate             P.        However, the relation between                      and

p    (1   + t) can    be used to assess the             extent of smuggling activity.               As     N >
                                                                                                             < C,
                    + t). For N    C C, only low cost           firms smuggle, while for N     >   C all   firms in

the industry smuggle. This means that, independentof market structure, a positive value
of PD indicates that every firm is camouflaging.

            If PD is negative or     zero, inferences must be based on a combination of its value

and other evidence on smuggling. This is because the observed price may be either
or          ). A negative value of PD is consistent with either no smuggling (i.e. the market

price is    P(1)) or N    C C     and low cost firms conduct a portion of their trade illegally (i.e.

the market price is                 As is clear from the Figure, an estimated zero price disparity
                                               12


either indicates N   = C and firms camouflaging     or no camouflagingand N   = N;. Only for
positive estimates will it be clear that smuggling through camouflagingis occurring, and in
this case all firms are smuggling.


                                 VI. Competition    and Welfare
         The existence of a price disparity in the model leads to the possibility that smuggling

relative to legal trade can be welfare improving. As in Pitt, when the excess smuggling

cost is merely a transfer to the government,then smugglingimproves welfare via the price

disparity. The results of the last section indicate that this welfare improvement is
maximized when there is free entry of camoufiagers. If, on the other hand, there is     a real
excess smuggling cost, the welfare effect of smugglingdepends on the relative magnitudes
of the   excess cost and lower price due to camouflaging.    Here again, the welfare effect of

smuggling will depend on the degree of competition. While the price disparity is
maximizedwith free entry of camouflagers, free entry will drive up total excess smuggling

cost because entry leads to an increase in the equilibriumquantity firms try to smuggle.

The following propositioncharacterizes the impact of a change in the number of firms on

welfare.

Proposition 4:          An increase in the number of camouflagers will reduce welfare

                        whenever 'y1e91[1 + (N1Th1)(51J&N1)]      but an increase
                        in the number of legal traders will increase welfare if

                                 =
                        51/5N1       (Of1f8N1)(l/1)(8
         ProofofProposition 4: We assume demand comes from a utility function that can
be approximated by U =       U(Q)+ m, where m is consumption of a competitively produced

composite commodity, so that welfare is correctly measured by the standard surplus
measures. Hence, welfare is consumer surplus plus expected profits plus expected

government revenue from tariff collections and confiscations.          Expected profits plus
                                                   13



government revenue can be shown to be                                                   =

                       [P)
using the fact that 881/0N2       =                                               C 0 C

8W/ON2 > 0 if (N11I2)(8f/ON2)                  (P()—p)/-y1e.       Observing that 1(8f/8N2)          =
              this last inequality can be written as that in the statement of the proposition.

Q.E.D.
         An increase in the number of camoufiagers expands total imports at the margin,

where total excess cost increases through two effects. One          is   the additional excess cost of
the import increase, r1e61, and the other is the additionalcost from smuggling a higher

fraction of imports. (-y1e1N1/1)(81/8N1). If the sum of these excoeds the increase in
consumer surplus at the margin, then the subsequent loss in profits and government

revenue is large enough for welfare to decline. Because an increase in the number of legal

traders affects        in a fashion symmetric to that    of   an increase in camoufiagers, we can
state the condition for this to increase welfare in terms of
                                                             Sf/ON1. With an increase in
legal   traders, consumer surplus and governmentrevenue both increase, and the              condition

states a sufficient    condition for their increase to outweigh the reduction in profits.

                                             V.   Enforcement
        In a similar fashion, the        welfare effects of increasing enforcement will depend on

whether or not it increases real smuggling costs and on the elasticity of the fraction

smuggled by a camouflager.              An increase in enforcement will reduce both the fraction

smuggled by each camouflager and total imports, increasing price and reducing and

consumer surplus in equilibrium. Then             if y1   represents    a transfer to the government, an
increase in enforcementreduces welfare. If, however, y1 represents real resources devoted
to camouflaging, then        an increase in enforcement can improve welfare since it reduces the
total amount of imports smuggled, and so the total excess smuggling cost. Proposition 6

summarizes the results for this case.

        Proposition    5 summarizes the comparative statics results needed                        to prove

Proposition 6. Comparative statics results for changes in                  t and p* are also given.    The

                            increases      and    P().       An increase in      t increases    and reduces
                                but the effect on all other equilibrium values is ambiguous. All
                            effects of a change in   p are ambiguous.
Proposition 6:              An increase in the level of enforcement (excess smuggling cost of a

                            camouflager) reduces welfare if the equilibrium fraction smuggled by

                            a camouflager is      inelastic with respect to the level of enforcement

                            (excess smuggling cost).

statement of the proposition follows immediately under the convention of writing

elasticities as positive numbers.    Q.E.D.

        An increase in the level   of enforcementcauses each camouflager to reduce imports
since its expected marginal revenue shifts down and           its marginal   cost shifts up. This

raises price.and leads legal traders to expand imports, but the net effect is fewer total

imports, less smuggling, and a higher price. Welfare is reduced unless the resulting loss in
consumer surplus is offset by a reduction in total excess smuggling cost.          If the fraction
smuggled is inelastic with respect to enforcement, the welfare increase from lower total

excess smuggling cost. (due to the lower fraction smuggled)is not large enough to offset the

loss in consumer surplus. An increase in            shifts the camouflagers' marginal costs up,

causing them to reduce imports with the same effects on equilibrium values, and therefore
welfare, as a change in e.
        Finally, it is worth noting why we cannot obtain welfare results for changes in the
tariff and    world price.   Recalling Proposition      5,   an increase in the tariff causes

camouflagers to increase imports and legal traders to decrease imports. Legal traders
reduce imports because their marginal cost shifts up. Camouflagers'marginal cost shifts

up also, but to a lesser extent since they also increase the fraction they try to smuggle.

Increasing the fraction smuggled increases expected marginal revenue enough to outweigh
this effect, so each camouflager expands imports. The net effect on equilibrium total

imports, smuggling, and the price are uncertain. Although the effects of an increase in the
world price are very similar to those of an increase in the tariff, we cannot determine how

any equilibrium values change when p changes. The difference is that             an increase in t
increases camouflagers' marginal cost only through their legal imports, while an increase
in p' increases marginal cost through legal and illegal imports.

                                  VII. Empirical Analysis

          In this section we consider   the   empirical relevance   of this type of smuggling.
Pitt's original   model was developed to explain the observed price disparity for Indonesian

exports of rubber. Branson and Macedo [1987] examine the black market premium
related to Pitt-type smugglingin the Sudan. Norton [1988] developed a model similar to

Pitt's to explain   pig smuggling between Northern Ireland and the Republic      of Ireland.   All

of these studies assume perfect competition. In this section      we consider situations where

this assumption may not be warranted.

          An obvious example is where governments restrict entry through import licenses.

Smuggling is generally regarded     as prevalent in Indonesia, and recent data for Indonesia
show that of 5229 traded commodity classifications, 1484 were under license and only 296

of these were       subject to quotas (Pangestu, [1987]).         1360 of these items were

manufactures such as steel, textiles, machinery, pharmaceuticals, and plastics. A natural
question to ask is whether licensing is merely a technicality, or whether there are indeed
few firms in the market. In the case of polyester and rayon fibers, the government

recently liberalized the licensing procedure so that six state trading companies are allowed
to import fibers rather than the previous sole importer (Pangestu, p.32). The right to

import plastics is restricted to three firms (Pangestu, p. 34).
          Interstate cigarette smuggling in the U. S. is another likely candidate for our
model. Different cigarette taxes across states provide the incentive   for this smuggling, and
it has   been considered a major problem by state and local governments since the early

1970s. There is also evidence      that cigarette industry structure   is   neither collusive nor

perfectly competitive (Manchester [1973], Sumner [1981], Appelbaum [1982], and
Sullivan [1985]). Recalling that our model allows for         a variety of market outcomes
(both in terms of competition and degree of illegal      activity), it is a natural choice for

examiningdomestic trade of cigarettes.
                                                     17


         In Sections     A and B we Locus on the cigarette example. The primary reason is

that price data needed to examine the extent of smuggling are readily available for

cigarettes. We present evidence that camouflaged smuggling is widespread enough to be

statistically significant in a regression framework. Moreover, empirical estimates of price

disparity are consistentwith the view that some, but not all, firms in the market smuggle.

A.   Industry Smuggling Characteristics
         Cigarette smuggling practices include consumers crossing state lines for personal

consumption purchases, as well as smuggling of cigarettes by wholesalers and retailers for

resale in retail or vending outlets. While we account for casual smuggling in our empirical

estimates, our interest is primarily in the latter. The exact mechanism for commercial

(organized) smugglingvaries, but it generally involves distributors or retailers in high tax

states purchasing cigarettes from a wholesaler in a low tax state.         The state   tax in the low
tax state   is   paid, but the wholesaler   is   paid a premium not to affix any tax indicia to the
cigarettes. The distributor or retailer in the high tax state then uses           a counterfeit tax
stamp to evade the higher tax. Enforcement evidence suggests the bulk of these purchases
are made in North Carolina and some in Kentucky [ACIR, 1977 and 1985].

         There are a number of empirical studies of cigarette smuggling. The Advisory
Committee on Intergovernmental Relations [ACIR 1977, 1985] estimated the revenue loss

to high tax states from all forms of cigarette smuggling to be $390 million in 1975. A

demand equation for cigarettes was estimated using data from non-smuggling states and
used to predict cigarette consumption in smuggling states. Comparing the estimates with

legal sales (that is, tax paid cigarette sales) gave        a measure of the extent of    smuggling.

Since the ACIR's interest was in revenue loss regardless of the form           of smuggling, it did
not attempt to differentiate between casual and commercial smuggling. Other studies

finding significantsmugglingeffects are Manchester [1973], Baltagi and Levin [1986], and

Baltagi and Goel [1987]. These studies, like the ACIR study, do not provide evidence on
the extent of casual versus commercial smuggling.
                                                    18


           Like the ACIR, we examine how the presence of smugghng affects demand

estimation.8 But we differ by using data from smuggling as well as non-smuggling

states, and we account for smuggling with regressors expected to he sensitive to the
different forms of smuggling. To differentiate between the two forms of smuggling, we

rely on the fact that casual smuggling is predominantly consumers crossing into adjoining

low   tax states     to purchase cigarettes from retail outlets while commercial smuggling is

predominantly trucking of large quantities of cigarettes purchased from wholesalers in
North Carolina and, to a lesser extent, Kentucky.
           Before turning to our estimation strategy, several additional facts need to be

mentioned.       First, consumers who purchase commercially               smuggled cigarettes are

unaware, in general, that they are purchasing contraband goods. Second, the measure of

cigarette sales available on a state by state basis is the quantity of cigarettes for which the
iocai   state taxes have been paid. That is, actual quantity demanded in the ith state at
time t.   Q, is the sum of observablelegal or tax-paid cigarette sales, Lt and commercially
smuggled cigarettes, 'itS Cigarettes smuggled by consumers from adjoining                   states are
substitutes for locally available cigarettes, Q.

           Consider    a standard demand equation for cigarettes
                            =    +   431RP.t
                                               + $2I'C1 + ,@3t +     $4AVRP.t
                                                                                 + '35•t    1+

where i refers to the state,    t refers to the time     period, Q is tax paid cigarette sales, RP is

retail price, INC is income, and AVRP is the average retail price in neighboring states.

We include    a time trend to control for declining cigarette sales in response to advertised
health hazards of smoking. AVRP           is   the average price of cigarettes in neighboring states

and accounts for casual smuggling.             In the presence   of commercial   smuggling, we can

substitute            L + 'it into the above and rearrange to form

zero mean disturbance uncorrelated with the regressors.              But with commercial   smuggling,

the disturbance        is no longer a zero mean disturbance and can be expected to be related

to smuggling activity. That is, an appropriately specified equation for               Lt would either
include I.it and I.                             variables.
                  it—i or determinants of those
            To determine whether commercial smuggling exists we need to determine whether

uit   is   a classical disturbance uncorrelated with determinants of I.it or a non-classical

disturbance correlated with determinants of 'it' We proceed by regressing                  Lt   on the

demand variables plus the difference in tax rates between state                i   and North Carolina

(TAXDIF.). In the absence of smuggling the estimated coefficient of TAXDIF should not
be significantly different from zero; in the presence of smugglingthe estimated coefficient

should be significantly different from zero. It should be noted that the sign of TAXDIF is
indeterminant because of other excluded variables when smuggling occurs (enforcement,
etc.) and because of interaction of TAXDIF, the excluded variables, and the demand
variables.

            Instrumental variables estimation is used because of possible simultaneity due to
the presence of RP as a regressor in (12). As instrument for RP we use the predicted

value of RP in a regression of RP on the regressors in (12) as well as TAXDIF, a dummy

variable te reflect the enactment of the Federal Cigarette Contraband Act of 1978, the
state cigarette tax rate, the wholesale price plus the federal excise tax, and an index of the

wage rate of grocery store workers. Data are annual for the period 1975—82 for 29 states.
We exclude North Carolina and Kentucky because they are                    a source   for commercially

smuggled cigarettes, as well          as states with local cigarette taxes, states with more than       5

percent of sales on Indian reservations, and states with             at least 5 percent military. The
latter two sets of states are             excluded because cigarette sales on military and Indian

reservations are exempt from state taxes, hence a potential for intrastate smuggling
exists. Finally, we exclude Utah because of the high proportion of Mormons in that state.
                                                  20


A total of 232 observations are used. Tax paid sales and income            are per capita.   We use

both a linear and a log.log version of the model with the results given in Table 1.

          Retail price, lagged (legal) sales, and trend have expected signs and                  are
significant.   We find income insignificant, as do Ealtagi and Levin. While there                  is

anecdotal evidence that casual smuggling occurs and some authors have found it to be
                                                —
statistically important (though of small effect          see Baltagi   and Levin and Manchester),

we find   it to be statistically unimportant.    On   the other hand, the statistical significance of

TAXDIF indicates     that commercial smugglingis pervasive. Only if 'it is substantial would
TAXDJF be expected      te be   significant in an equation describing consumer behavior.


E. Empirical Price Disparity

          For some of the states in the sample, cigarettes are primarily smuggled in, while
for others there is no smugglingor cigarettes are smuggled out. In this section, we focus
on price disparity in     states where cigarettes are primarily          smuggled into the state.

Combined with our results on the importance of commercial smuggling, the observed price

disparity can be used to indicate whether all firms are smuggling.
          In Section IV we discussed the information contained in the sign        of observed price
disparity, PD = p*(l+t)         — P.   To give empirical content to the measure in the cigarette

case, several adjustments are made in calculating PD. Since the cigarette tax is per unit
rather than ad valorem, the first term in PD is replaced by p" + t.5 For the cigarette
case, pt is the wholesaleprice plus distribution costs and federal excise tax.
          Our measure of the cigarette price disparity for the ith in-smuggling        state at time
t is
(13)      PD.it   =WP t +FT+ST.it +11it —RP.it

where
                                                 21


            WP is the wholesale price at time t (equal for all states)
            FT is the federal excise tax (equal to $08 for all observations)
            ST is the state tax
            D is a measure of distribution cost, and
            RP is retail price.

            Because direct data   are unavailable, we construct a measure of distribution cost
based on observed markup in states with no in-smuggling. Observed markup for the jth

non-smuggling state is (RPJ — WP — FT — STJ) so that it includes factor costs and

profits. As is appropriate for a state with no smuggling, this measure implies a zero

observed price disparity in the jth State at time         t. Barring differences in factor costs    or

market structure across states, this markup would proxy distribution costs in the absence

of smuggling.     However, factor costs do differ across states, and to account for this we

weight the markup by an index of relative wage rates. Since the primary factor cost in

cigarette retailing is labor,1° we use wage rates of grocery store workers. In (13), then,
                      D.    =   (RP. — WPt   —
                                                 FT   —   ST. )/WI..
                       it         jt                        jt ijt
where
        WI is the ratio of wage rates in j to those in i.
            Ideally we would calculate markup using states not engaged in any form of

smuggling (in or out), but we cannot be certain which (if any) states fall in that catagory.
We initially choose North Carolina and Kentucky as the "base" states since               it is   known

that only out-smuggling occurs there. A second base group is composed of states for which
we have strong priors that no commercial smuggling occurs. States in this group have

state taxes within 10 cents per pack of the North Carolina tax (taxes are averages over

the period and stated in 1982 prices). In all exercises we exclude from considerationstates
with large American Indian and military populations          as well as Utah   and   states with local
taxes. 11
            In a 1975 survey    [ACIR, 1977], Six of the states in our sample indicated           that

smuggling by stamp counterfeiting was            a    serious problem.   We calculated the price

disparity in those states for each of the 8 years in our sample. Using the North Carolina
and Kentucky markup, the price disparity is positive in only 7 of the 48 cases. Using
                                                  22


average markup in our "perceived no-smuggling" states, the price disparity is positive in

only 16 cases.

        We also examine price disparity for states whose average tax rates were           at least   20

cents per pack above the NC. tax (seven states). This selection criterion does not
discriminate between commercial and casual smuggling, but it does capture states with the

greatest incentive   to smuggle (either commercially     or casually). Using the North Carolina-

Kentucky markup base, the price disparity is positive in one-third of the cases. For the
second markup base, the price disparity is positive in 48 percent       of the   cases.

           To summarize, we observe a negative price disparity in           the majority     of cases

examined.     In the context of       previous models of camouflaging, this          result would    be

inconsistent with the presence of smuggling.            But we know from enforcement and

statistical evidence that commercial smuggling is a prevalent phenomenon.                 Our model
allows the interpretation that some, but not all, firms in the industry smuggle.


                                    VIII. ConcludingRemarks
        BH is the only study prior to this one to examine the welfare effects of smuggling

with varying degrees of competition. This paper provides an analysis of smuggling and

market power when smugglingoccurs through camouflaging. The advantage of the model
is that it includes both the realistic type of smugglingmodelled by P-MP and BH's equally

realistic notion of different firms conducting the two types of trade (i.e. smuggling and

legal trade). We have shown that the coexistence of two types of firms is precluded if and
only   if there is free entry   of firms capable of camouflaging.   In particular,   if the smuggling

technology and enforcementeffort make camouflaging profitable for only a small number

of firms, then even in the long run we could observe some firms trading legally and others

camouflaging.

        Unlike BH, however, coexistence in this model can be welfare improving. Here, as

in P-MP. this      is due to    the price disparity implied by the first order conditions for

camouflagers. As one might expect, this disparity and therefore the welfare effects of
                                           23


smuggling are related to the degree of competition in the market. In BH's case of
coexistence (where smugglers do not camouflage), monopoly was preferred to perfect

competition (since with no price disparity "the fewer smugglers, the better" p. 184). Here

we obtain the more conventional result   that welfare   is   higher the more firms there are
whenever there is no real excess smuggling cost. When there is a real excess cost to

smuggling, the welfare effects depend on the     extent to      which increased competition

increases excess smuggling costs.

         Finally, we show that observed price disparity with camouflaging can be positive
or negative.   In previous models, camouflaged smuggling produced a positive disparity.

This followed because the analysis was restricted to perfect competition. In a more

general setting, camouflaging can occur with negative observed disparity when not all
firms smuggle. Our empirical evidence on commercial cigarette smuggling in the U.S.       is

consistent with this being the case.

       tThe text cites work directly related to ours. Studies of somewhat related illegal

activities are Ethier's [1986] analysis of illegal immigration and Grossman and Shapiro's

[1988] study of counterfeit product trade. The analysis of smugglinghas also been related
to currency convertibility issues by Macedo [1987]. For an interesting discussion and

analysis of smuggling in West Africa, see Stolper and Deardorff [1988]. For           a survey of
tax evasion issues, see Skinner and Slemrod [1985].
       2The price disparity in Pitt's certainty model can be derived from the firm's first

order conditions csee his equation (2a)) as well as the zero profit condition.

       3Norton [1988] develops a model for smuggling of agricultural goods. Firms in his

model decide the allocation of a given quantity between domestic and foreign illegal and

legal sales. Their desire to smuggle is based on their distance from the border.               In
principle,     this could lead to a variety   of market outcomes, but   he does not examthe the
market equilibrium.

       4Assumingdifferent excess costs is the easiest way to introduce heterogeneity into
this model. The desired result could be obtained       as well by assuming different probabilities
of success functions for the firms, but the analysis is much more cumbersome in this case.

       tWe abstract from issues related to why the tariff is imposed.          If the tariff were
imposed to  restrict consumption or to encourage production, resale of confiscated goods
would not be an ideal assumption. If, however, revenue maximization is the government's

goal, the resale assumption is not a problem.

       6Because we   are interested in camouflaging (such as underinvoicing), we do not
consider the possibility that = 1. Formally this can be ruled out by assuming s(1,e) = 0

for e >   0.

                                    allow tests

marketing. Both the cited studies and ours treat the market as the combined system of

manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers. Nonetheless, the studies of market power
                                                      27


presume that the major scope for exercise of monopoly power is                   at the manufacturing
level.    Although their methods differ, these studies tend to reject both the cartel and

perfect competition hypotheses. This          is   the case most appropriate for our model since we

specify an arbitrary number of non-colluding firms.

           Since data are for all cigarettes, both these studies and ours abstract from

product differentiation. Explicitly introducing product differentiation to our theoretical
model should produce similar results      as long        as the firms' choice variables   are quantities.
Alternatively, one could interpretthe model in terms of smuggling a particular brand.

         8For specific functional forms of demand, one could use (6) and (7) to solve for

and q2. With data on N1 and N2, one could directly estimate the legal sales equation

implied by our model.

         9For fixed   p, results in Sections II      —
                                                         VI are the same qualitatively with either      a
per unit or ad valorem tax.
         10lnitially we thought transportation cost would be an important cost and thus affect

smuggling incentives. Apparently,         it is a        minor cost. Input-output         data for 1977
[Department of Commerce, 1984] show that transportation cost accounted for .5 percent of
the value of tobacco products. More recently, an undisclosed cigarette company official told

us that in 1984 average transportation cost amounted to .6 cents per pack of cigarettes.
         t1States with military bases and Indian reservations are subject to another type of

smuggling which would bias the legal sales data. Utah is excluded because of the large
Mormon population. The state tax rate would not reflect the effective tax for states with
local taxes. An effective    tax rate could    be calculated using data on local sales and local      tax
rates.   Smuggling incentives are affected by these local tax rates, so that the local and rest

of state sales reflect the extent of smuggling.          Hence the effective   tax rate   so calculated is

endogenous.
