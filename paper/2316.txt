             Implicit Contracts, Labor Mobility and Unemployment




                                  ABSTRACT


         Firms' inability to monitor their employees' search effort forces

 a tradeoff between risk-bearing and incentive considerations when

 designing employment-related insurance. Since the provision of insurance

 against firm-specific shocks adversely affects workers' incentives to

 find better jobs, the optimal contract provides only partial insurance:

 it prescribes low (high) wages and under (over) employment to encourage

 workers to leave (stay) at low (high) productivity firms; and it employs

 quits and layoffs as alternative means of inducing separations at low

 productivity firms, with the mix depending upon the relative efficiency

 of the on- and off-the-job search technologies.

     Our analysis of implicit contracts with asymmetric search information

 establishes that any consistent explanation for worksharing, layoffs,

 severance pay, quits and unemployment must focus on questions of labor

 mobility.

       Wage rigidities have long played a central role in Keynesian

explanations of unemployment. Though a major aim of implicit contract

theory was to provide an explanation for these rigidities (Costas

Azariadis, 1975; Martin Baily, 1974), it has become increasingly apparent

in recent years that at least the simpler versions of this theory would

not do; though they explained real wage rigidities as a consequence of

risk-averse workers demand for insurance against variations in their

value of their marginal product, they could not explain unemployment.1

        To explain unemployment, one must explain, first, why reductions

in demand take the form of layoffs rather than reduced hours

(worksharing), and second, why those on layoff do not immediately secure

employment elsewhere. Traditional implicit contract theory, however, has

ignored both issues: it has assumed that reductions in labor demand take

the form of layoffs; and it has assumed that all separated workers are

immobile, due, say, to prohibitive mobility costs. Indeed, the latter

assumption is particularly important as it implies that (i) laid-off

workers are necessarily unemployed, (ii) quits are absent, (iii)

high-demand firms cannot possibly hire newly separated workers and (iv),

when optimally determined severance pay is provided, laid-off workers are

actually better-off than retained workers. In fact, of course,

worksharing, layoffs, quits and interfirin mobility are all prominent

features of modern labor markets, and the prediction that workers prefer

to be laid off is generally accepted as counterfactual.2

         We propose here a general theory of implicit contracts which

 resolves most of these difficulties. Our theory is based on three simple

 observationS first, the risk which individuals wish to be insured
against is not just a decrease in the value of the marginal product (VMP)

of the firm at which they are currently employed, and hence a decrease in

their wage, but rather, it is a decrease in this value together with the

failure to find an alternative job at which their VMP is high; second,

finding a job requires search, and search involves costs, though they are

generally not prohibitive; and third, wages and severance pay serve a

crucial role in this process, by influencing workers' search efforts, in

reallocating labor form uses where its VMP is low to those at which it is

high.

        We follow traditional contract theory in assuming that workers

are risk-averse and firms are risk-neutral. Firms thus provide

individuals with insurance. If labor mobility were costless and

instantaneous, no insurance would be required against relative shocks

(i.e. those which change the relative values of the marginal

productivities of labor in different uses) since each worker would move

immediately to the job where his VMP is highest. By contrast, if search

were costly but perfectly monitorable, firms would provide insurance

against relative shocks, but these insurance contracts would specify the

intensity of job search.

        In fact, not only is search an individually costly activity, but

it is also a private activity that is costly to monitor. Indeed, it is

frequently impossible to observe either search effort or the outcomes of

search. That is, it is difficult for the worker's current employer to

monitor outside wage offers or even to verify whether a laid-off worker

has been reemployed. In turn, because the employer is unable to observe




                                    2
search inputs and outcomes, the following two related moral hazard

problems arise.

        The first moral hazard problem results from the unobservability

of the best job offer, even when search effort is observable. If both

search effort and job offers were observable, the insurance contract

provided by the firm would: (a) specify the level of search effort; (b)

require an employed (laid-off) worker to move provided he found any job

with a wage in excess of his productivity at his current firm (in home

production);3 and (c) compensate the worker with the difference (possibly

negative) between his current wage and this alternative wage offer.

        When wage offers are not observable, however, this scheme cannot

be implemented. The firm can then only provide a fixed severance payment

to workers who quit or are laid off, and a given wage to workers who are

retained. In designing these payments, however, the following trade-off

between risk and efficiency is confronted: the more insurance a firm

provides against low-VMP draws, the more likely it is that workers will

refuse outside wage offers that exceed their current VMP, but are less

than their current wage, and hence the less efficient will be quit

behavior. In other words, more efficient quit behavior requires a

departure from complete insurance.4

        The second moral hazard problem results from the unobservability

of search effort or intensity. When search effort cannot be monitored

and hence cannot be specified contractually, a similar risk-efficiency

trade-off presents itself: the more insurance a firm provides against

low-VMP draws, the lower the worker's search effort, and hence the less

efficient will be quit behavior. Since it is privately (and socially)


                                      3
costly for individuals to remain where the value of their marginal

product is low, the optimal insurance contract will again provide

incomplete insurance.

        With private job-search information, the optimal implicit

contract will be shown to prescribe relatively low wages and

underemployment to encourage quits in bad times, and relatively high

wages and overemployment to discourage quits in good times.5 In this

setting, moreover, we observe that quits (induced by relatively low

wages) and layoffs are simply alternative means of creating separations

at low-VMP firms; whereas reduced insurance (lower wages for retained

workers) has the potential advantage of encouraging quits by the lowest

search cost workers, effectively discriminating among otherwise

indistinguishable workers, layoffs have the potential advantage of

forcing workers to use a different and likely more efficient off-the-job

search technology. As these two instruments are imperfect substitutes,

one expects to observe both (i.e. worksharing and quits as well as

layoffs) at individual firms.

        In a limiting (and we would argue unrealistic) version of our

model, in which there is no search, we obtain the standard counterfactual

results. We therefore contend that an analysis of the role of implicit

contracts in understanding unemployment must focus on questions of labor

mobility.6 Regrettably, the simplest model which can be constructed to

remedy the difficulties we have noted in the traditional framework must

be somewhat complex: it must incorporate endogenous search; it must

allow for the possibility of severance pay; and it must provide firms




                                    4
with a choice between layoffs and wage policy as means of encouraging the

movement of workers from low to high VMP firms.

        We begin in Section I with a partial equilibrium analysis of

firms' wages, severance pay and internal distortions when workers' search

efforts are private information. Section II then presents a

stripped-down general equilibrium model of worksharing, quits, layoffs

and unemployment when workers' search costs are private information.

Section III presents concluding remarks.



I.      The Model

        We develop a two-period model of a competitive economy which

is buffeted by firm-specific shocks. During the ex ante period when

there is still uncertainty, workers are free to join the firm whose

employment contract offers the highest level of expected utility. At the

beginning of the ex post period, after all random variables are realized,

a fraction of each firm's initial labor pooi is laid off as prescribed by

the contract. Subsequently, some retained workers and some laid-off

workers secure new employment elsewhere. Finally, production takes place

at the end of the ex post period. See Figure 1.

        While this formulation may initially appear restrictive, it will

become clear as we procede that this is not the only possible

 interpretation of our model (see footnotes 12 and 13), and that most of

 our qualitative results, for instance, concerning incomplete insurance,

 underemployment and the simultaneous use of layoffs and worksharing would

 remain valid under alternative sequencings as well, e.g. if the firm did




                                     5
not make its layoff decisions until after workers announced whether or

not they were quitting (see footnotes 14 and 28).

         The critical informational assumption of the model is that each

worker's ex post search effort and consequent job offers (if any) are

privately known only by that worker.7

         Firms are ex ante identical and risk-neutral, and labor is the

only variable input to production. The VMP of a worker who supplies

h units of labor is 9h, where 9 is the realization of a firm-specific

shock: there are two equiprobable values of        9L and   with 9L <
                                                                         9H

Workers have identical tastes and technical ability. As in the

traditional literature, they are assumed to have no consumption good

endowment and savings are not allowed.

         Firms offer employment contracts to attract employees during

the ex ante period, which are designed to maximize expected profits, and

workers choose among these contracts to maximize expected utility. A

typical contract will be denoted by C —                               Under
                                           ((wL,hL),r,s,(wH,h))   .



this contract employed workers are paid w for h units of labor when 9 =

9.;   a worker is laid off with probability l-r in the low-VMP state

and each laid-off worker is given the fixed non-negative severance

payment s.8

         The terms of employment offered by firms in the ex ante period

will depend on what alternative opportunities are available to workers in

the ex post period. We assume that there is a spot labor market

characterized by a wage distribution, but in which all jobs require the


same number of hours Ii > 0   .   Workers are of course concerned with the

highest wage they can expect to find, and this in turn depends on their

                                       6
search intensity and whether they are employed while searching. We let

F(z,e) and G(z,e) denote the distribution functions for highest wage

offers, given search intensity e ,          for   those workers who are employed

and unemployed, respectively; f and g are the corresponding density

functions. Additionally, F and C are assumed to satisfy:

             F(O,O) — C(O,O) —     1;
             Fe,Ce<   0   for z > 0.

In words, a worker cannot effortlessly receive an offer of employment,

and the probability that his best offer will exceed z is an increasing

function of his search intensity.

        Taking their employment status as given, workers choose the level

of search effort to maximize their expected utility. After substitution

of the optimal search effort, the resulting maximum expected utility

enjoyed by retained workers is simply a function of their wages and

hours, U(w,h) ; similarly, the maximum expected utility attained by

laid-off workers is a function only of their severance pay, V(s)

Thus, dropping the common multiplicative factor 1/2 ,                total   expected

utility from contract C     is1°

             W(C) —
                      rU(wL,hL)
                                  +   (l-r)V(s)      +
                                                         U(w11,h1)
Taking account of workers' optimal search and quit behavior, firms'

profits per retained employee are a function of the state 9 and of the

worker's wages and hours, ,r(w,h,9)          ,
                                                 whereas the cost per laid-off

worker is exactly the severance payment, $ .                Thus, total expected

profit per employee is given by

             Z(C) —
                      rw(wL,hL,9L)
                                        -
                                            (l-r)s   +

As workers are freely mobile in the cx ante market, competition among


                                            7
firms will drive expected profits to zero. Hence the equilibrium

contract is found by solving

(F)            max W(C) s.t. Z(C) — 0.

The remaining portions of this section basically describe and interpret

the first order conditions of this problem. Among the questions we ask

are: Under what conditions will the wage in the bad state be below that

in the good state, i.e. when will there be at least partial wage

flexibility? When will those who stay with the firm feel underemployed,

i.e. when will they wish to work additional hours at the going wage. And

finally, if there are layoffs, when will laid-off workers be worse-off

than retained workers?



l.A Derivation of Extressions for Expected Utility

        To answer these questions, we must first derive explicit

expressions for a worker's expected utility when he is retained and when

he is laid off. A worker's instantaneous utility funàtion is given by

a(w,h). When a worker is retained, his expected utility, u(w,h,e) ,          is
just the utility he obtains from his current job, a(w,h) , times the

probability he stays with his current employer (i.e. does not get a

better offer), plus the expected utility he gets if he quits, a(x,e),

times the probability of quitting, minus the disutility, (e,h) ,        of
searching for a better job at intensity e :11

         u(w,h,e) —     a(w,h)F(x,e) + o(x,e)(l-F(x,e))   -



where   x —   x(w,h)     is the wage offer which makes the individual

indifferent between quitting and staying, and is defined implicitly by

a(w,h) —   a(x,h),     F(x,e) is the probability of drawing a wage offer less


                                         8
than x given search intensity e, and the expected utility of a worker

who quits is


                              1°
               a(x,e) — ( J        a(z,h)f(z,e)dz)/(l-F(x,e)).


We assume that a is a strictly concave function satisfying a,>O and

        and that fi    is   an increasing convex function of e satisfying Ph>O

and (O,h) — 0.      The term (e,h) is meant to capture the cost (in

utility terms) of searching at intensity e when the present job demands
                    12,13
h units of labor.

          It follows analogously that the expected utility of a laid-off

worker who receives severance pay s and expends e on search is equal

to


               v(s,e) —     a(s,0)G(y,e)   +   J   a(z+s,h)g(z,e)dz -


where    y—y(s) is the lowest acceptable wage offer and is defined by

a(s,O) —   a(y+s,h).    In the absence of search, observe that u(w,h,0) —

a(w,h) and v(s,0) — a(s,O).
          Retained and laid-off workers' optimal on- and off-the-job search

intensities are respectively described by:

                e(w,h) — argmax u(w,h,e),

                e(s)    — argmax v(s,e).

It follows that their corresponding equilibrium utility levels are

U(w,h) —   u(w,h,e(w,h))     and V(s) —    v(s,e(s)),   and that firms' equilibrium

quit and profit functions per retained worker are, respectively,

                 q(w,h) —    l-F(x(w,h),e(w,h)),
               ,r(w,h,8) —   (1-q(w,h))(Oh-w).
                                               9
The quit rate is a function only of the wages and hours offered on the

job, and is equal to the probability of finding a higher utility job,

given the optimally chosen search effort, e(w,h) .    Similarly,   the

job-finding rate for laid-off workers, l-G(y(s),e(s)) ,   is   a function

only of the severance payment s •l4



I.B     Wazes and Production Efficiency

        In this section, we shall show how firms' attempts to encourage

mobility in the low-VMP state leads to incomplete insurance, and under

normal conditions, to underemployment in this state as well.

        From the first order conditions of problem (P), with respect

to wages and hours, we obtain



(la)          U(wL,hL) —wL,F1LOL)
              U(wH,hH) w(wH,wOH)
                                           i — L,H.
(ib)          Ub(wi,ht) —   whi,hi9i)
              U(w,hj)

The solution to (P) thus equates agents' marginal rates of substitution
between wages across states, and between wages and hours within each

state. Observe that these expressions measure the direct plus

incentives-related substitution possibilities among the terms of

employment   for workers and firms; and that the latter indirect effects




                                      10
take into account the adjustment of workers' optimal search efforts and

quit rates.

         Returning to the basic equations defining U and it, we can derive,

for i—L,H,

(2a)          U(w.,h.) —
                                                                 -
(2b)          Uh(wi,hi) —
                                                      -
(2c)          ,r(w.,h.,O.) —
                                                              AjQ(w1,hi),
(2d)          lrh(wi,hj,Oj) —   (lq(w,h))9                -



where

Notice
                        A. —
                            1     ii
                                 (9.h   -w.).
                                          3.

         that A and A.L are respectively equal to workers' implicit

insurance premium and indemnity.



Immobile Labor

         Workers are immobile when they simply choose to forgo search,

setting e(w,h)—O and hence q(w,h)—O. (This outcome is most likely when

workers face either a particularly skewed distribution of wage offers or

a high marginal disutility from search.) With an immobile workforce our

model generates the standard results of full insurance and production

efficiency; that is, substituting q(w1,h)—O into (2), (la,b)

respectively simplify to
                            —


               Uh(wi,hi)    —   ah(wi,hi)
                                             —
                                                 ei   ,              i — L,H.
               U(w.h)           a(wi,h)

As expected, the equilibrium contract equates workers' marginal utility

of income across states, and equates their marginal rate of substitution

and marginal product in each state; if either a is additively separable
                                           1].
or the supply of labor is inelastic (h.—h), we then get the well-known

rigid contract wage result, WL — wH.



Mobile Labor: Incomplete Insurance

        Suppose workers' equilibrium quit rates are nonzero in both

states. A higher contract wage causes searching workers to become more

selective in evaluating job offers. This reduces the expected return

to search, and so workers' optimal on-the-job search effort falls. Hence

the quit rate falls when the wage is raised, i.e. q(wh) < o.15

Thus, making use of the fact that AL < 0 < A.j ,   (la)   and (2a,c) give

(3)           wL,T) > (H,h})
That is, the marginal utility of income is higher in the low-VMP state

than in the high-VMP state, and therefore, the ottimal contract no longer

provides complete insurance when quits are sensitive to wages.

        Since firms are subsidizing their workers in the low-VMP state as

part of the insurance package, they would like to encourage as many as

possible to search and quit. The problem is that workers who have

searched unsuccessfully are indistinguishable from those who make no

attempt to search at all. Hence firms must lower the wage to provide

appropriate search incentives, even though this entails a departure from

full insurance. Conversely, when positive premia are collected in

htgh-VMP states, wages are raised to discourage quits.

        In particular, if the utility function a is separable, or labor

supply is inelastic, (3) gives w11 > WL In these circumstances, the
                                                                   16
model generates a positive correlation between wages and VMP's.




                                     12
Mobile Labor: Underemployment

        We now examine whether our model generates underemployment.

Unfortunately, it is not immediately clear in the present search context

how this term should be defined. In particular, is there underemployment

when

               Uh/U <    9


i.e. when the marginal rate of substitution between wages and hours is

less than the marginal rate of transformation, taking into account

induced search; or is there underemployment when

               ah/c <    9

i.e. when the MRS between wages and hours along the instantaneous utility

function is less than the MRT? Reversing these inequalities establishes

the corresponding definitions of overemployment that account for and

ignore induced search, respectively.

        From (2a,b), it is apparent that

                                -
               Uh/UW —   ah/a
and hence these two definitions of underemployment (and of

overemployment) coincide if h — 0      ,    i.e.   if increasing hours worked

does not affect the cost of searching (at any level of search effort).

Normally, however, we think of h as being positive (increasing hours

worked on the job makes search more costly), in which case,

               Uh/U> %'aw
Accordingly,   when there is underemployment under the first criterion

(taking into account induced search), there is underemployment under the

second criterion; and when there is overemployment under the second

criterion (using the instantaneous utility function), there is


                                       13
overemployment under the first criterion.

            Since it is much easier to establish results concerning the

relative magnitudes of                and 9      ,   we henceforth use the terms

under- and overemployment to describe situations where Uh/U < and >

8 ,     respectively;   and so production efficiency is said to result when the

two are equal. We begin by showing that so long as increasing hours

worked reduces quits, there will be underemployment in those states when

profits are negative and overemployment in those states when profits are

positive. (Analogous results concerning the relative magnitudes of

           and 9 follow straightforwardly, with some obvious caveats, and
czh/a

are omitted.)

            When quit rates are nonzero, (ib) and (2c,d) give

(4)
                  Uh(Wi,hi)
                  U(w. ,h.,)     (l+A.q(w. ,h)/(lq(w. ,h.)))
Earlier we noted that increasing wages reduces quit rates. Thus if, in

addition, increasing hours also reduces quit rates, so that                  < 0

then

(5)              Uh(wi,hj) >          as        A.
                                                         0
                  U (w.,h.) <                        <
                   W 1 1
That is, the equilibrium contract prescribes underemployment (to

encourage quits) in those states when workers are being subsidized, and

overemploytnent (to discourage quits) when profits are strictly positive.

            It is possible, however, that                can be positive, even for

well-behaved utility functions. On the one hand, an increase in hours

worked (at fixed wages) makes the job less attractive, and this increases

quit rates, just as an increase in wages (for fixed hours) makes the job

more attractive, and this reduces quit rates. On the other hand,

                                           14
however, if search is also time intensive, then a worker who works more

has less time to search, and this reduces quit rates.

          Returning to (5), observe that its derivation from (4) does not

rely upon (2a,b) but depends instead upon specific derivative properties

of the quit rate function. However, by taking advantage of the simple

utility functions introduced earlier, we can now derive an even stronger

result: there will be underemployment (overemloyment) in those states

where profits are negative (positive) whenever workers' compensated quit

derivative with respect to hours is negative. To see this, we consider a

perturbation to (w.h) which keeps workers' expected utility in state

i fixed and calculate the effect on firm profits. At the optimum

                          U1y'U
               dh U

and    substituting, we can obtain

(6a)             th(i,hi) —        -A (l.q) dh U
                                                  dq
                 U(w.,h.)
yielding the result that whenever the compensated quit derivative is

negative, underemployment occurs in those states where A < 0 and

overemployment occurs in those states where A. > 0 .               In   turn, it can be

          17
shown that

                     e

in our model for the compensated quit derivative to be negative is that

both Bh and Beh be positive. i.e. that increasing hours worked
increases both the total and marginal costs of search. (Since

conditions than are required for               <

          Finally, observe that when workers' labour supply decisions

                                                                               —
have no effect on their disutility from search, that is, h —              eh
0, then (2a,b) and (6) give
(7)                                  hi,hi) —           i — L,H.
                Uh(wi,hi)
                     wi 1
                 U (w. h.)           vi
                                    a (w h.)
                                          1

In    this case, a worker's optimal search effort and consequent quit

probability depend only upon the level of utility a(w,h), and so do not

respond to variations in w and h on a given indifference curve.

Therefore, for any given level of utility, and hence given incentive

effects, (7) is obviously a necessary condition for profit maximization.

           Three general properties of these results are noteworthy. First,

unlike most recent implicit contract models with asymmetric information,

the occurrence of under- versus overemployment in our model does not rely

upon whether firms are risk-averse or, with reference to either

u(w,h,e(w,h)) or a(w,h), whether leisure is a normal good, or finally,

whether a(w,h) has a specific functional form such as a — J4(w)           -
                                                                              7(h)   or

a —    ,.i(w-i(h)).'8"9        Whether there is under- or overemployment depends

instead only upon certain weak properties of the utility function

and upon the contractual availability of insurance for workers (AhO).

           Second, (5) and (6) also indicate that underemployment will
                                             16
occur only in states where workers are being subsidized, with the amount

of underemployment being proportional to the size of the subsidy; and

that overemployment will be reserved for profitable states, with the

amount of overemployment again responding to the level of profits. Thus,

as seems reasonable, underemployment occurs in bad times and

overeniployment in good times.   (By contrast, earlier models generated

either underemployment in all high-VMP states except the highest,2° or

overemployment in all j-VMP states except the lowest,21 and hence

predicted either underemployment in (most) good states or overemployment

in (most) bad states.)

        Finally, (3) and (7) demonstrate that even while employment

contracts which are designed to have incentive effects will certainly

limit risk-sharing, they need not also generate production

inefficiencies.



I.C     On Severance Pay

        Severance pay is oftentimes portrayed as the Achilles heel of

implicit contract theory. The original models largely ignored severance

pay, while later work introduced severance pay but obtained the

counterfactual result that workers prefer to be laid off rather than

retained22; that is, contracts which provide full insurance, equating

(expected) marginal utilities of income across all states, will result in

higher (expected) utilities among those on layoff, in which case we would

expect contracts to specify reverse seniority layoff clauses. In this

section we show, on the contrary, that under plausible conditions

concerning labor mobility and preferences, laid-off workers are indeed


                                      17
worse off than retained workers. Before presenting our results, we

review the standard ones.

       We begin by taking the layoff rate l-r as given. The first-order

conditions of problem (P) then yield

(8)
                                       —   V(s)
whenever the optimal severance payment s is strictly positive. (Later,

we identify cases where s—O.) Observe that when both on- and

off-the-job search occur, (1), (2) and (8) give

              WL,L > V(s)        > QW(wH,h& for AL < <
which is the obvious extension of our earlier partial insurance result.



Reverse Seniority

        There are two versions of the reverse seniority result. First,

suppose employed and laid-off workers are both immobile (don't search) so

that (8) becomes

(9)          0w(wLJL) —     a(s,O).
The optimal (insurance) contract equates the marginal utilities of income

of retained and laid-off workers. Differentiating       — constant, gives

                                                                  Therefore
          wh/aww and hence da/dh—a,
dw/dh — -a                                        for fixed a .
                   ,
                                  n -a a /a
                                     wwh  ww                 w
(9) implies that

             a(wL,hL) < (>) a(s,O)

when leisure is a normal (inferior) good; and hence immobile workers

prefer to be laid off when leisure is normal.

        Second, suppose employed workers are again immobile, and that

laid-off workers are now mobile but face uncertain job opportunities. To

simplify, suppose we have a separable utility function


                                      18
e(w,h)(w)--y(h). In this case, (8) again yields the result that

retained and laid-off workers' (expected) marginal utilities of income

are equal, i.e.


(10)          i.'(wL) —   '(s)C(y,e)   +        p'(s+z)g(z,e)dz
where e —   e(s).   It can be shown that (10) implies that IL(wL) will be

greater than (equal to, less than)


              p(s)G(y,e) +      (s+z)g(z,e)dz
as ( ) is     an increasing (constant, decreasing) absolute risk-aversion

utility function.23 Thus, whenever search entails zero disutility and

hours worked is not a variable, workers with decreasing absolute

risk-aversion utility functions will prefer layoffs with severance pay.



Costly Search

        Once we recognize, however, that search is costly, the

presumption that laid-off workers are better-off no longer obtains.

There are two reasons for this. First, if search is costly, and these

search costs do not enter the utility function additively with income,

then providing income insurance (by equating expected marginal utilities)

may not fully compensate for the costs and risks of search; in this event

we say that search is (partially) non-pecuniary. Secondly, retained

workers will, we have argued, have their hours reduced to encourage them

to search more; in particular, hours may be reduced below the "standard"

hours at alternative employment, in which case even with full income

insurance, their expected utility will be higher than those laid off.

        To see these results, first suppose every laid-off worker can


                                           19
effortlessly (with e—O) secure a new job which pays z for h; since

there are no incentive problems here, the optimal severance payment

will satisfy

(ha)           wL'1L — a(s+z,h).
It then follows that laid-off workers will be worse-off even though

leisure is normal whenever the spot job entails more work (h >   hL).   Now,

suppose this alternative job can be secured only by exerting some fixed

effort e > 0; assuming that e is not prohibitive, retained workers are

better-off when

(lib)          a(wL,hL) > Q(S+Z,h)
                                     -
                                         (e,O).
Thus, whenever search costs are in part nonpecuniary, it is clear that

(11) can be satisfied without having to impose either the

inferiority of leisure or h > hL.

        Thus, provided search costs are non-pecuniary (and accordingly,

severance payments cannot be used to compensate them), and provided there

are significant probabilities of being re-employed elsewhere at jobs

requiring at least as much labor as at their ex ante firms, then laid-off

workers will be worse-off than retained workers; and this will be true

even in the presence of decreasing absolute risk aversion. Moreover,

when preferences are nonseparable and workers search on the job as well,

it is clear that (8) says very little about the relative magnitudes of

U(wL,hL) andV(s).



I.D Severance Pa'y for Retained Workers

        Our results are not substantially altered if firms can provide

severance pay for retained workers who quit in bad states. Such

                                         20
severance pay would be used to encourage quits. However, so long as

reducing hours worked reduces the cost of search, firms will still wish

to reduce hours of retained workers in the face of a reduction in the

demand for their products; so long as reducing wages has some beneficial

effects in inducing search, they will not provide complete income

insurance to the retained workers; so long as search costs are not

completely additive with income, the severence pay will not fully

compensate for effort expended on search; and finally, so long as there

is imperfect information about the job offer which the individual

accepts, the distortions we described earlier with respect to quit
                                       24
behavior, (5) and (6a), will remain.


                            25
II. Layoffs and Worksharin2

        We now determine whether firms' layoff rates are ever positive.

Since workers in our model are technically identical, and as hours per

worker and the number of workers are perfect substitutes in production,

differential productivity and technological arguments for layoffs have

been ruled out.26 While these considerations are not unimportant, we set

them aside here to specifically study the impact of costly mobility on

layoffs. In particular, we will show that the availability of

alternative employment for laid-off workers introduces a natural

non-convexity into firms' optimization problems and, as a result,

worksharing will generally not dominate layoffs.

        We are going to proceed in two stages. First, we will construct

a model in which retained workers do not quit, and in which layoffs are

the only ex post source of mobility. Then, in Sections II.C and II.D, we


                                       21
will construct models with random search costs in which there are both

quits and layoffs.

        To simplify the remaining discussion, we henceforth assume that

workers' preferences satisfy (e,h)—e; with h° we know, from (7), that

long-term and spot employment will both involve efficient production

satisfying ah/aW9.


II.A Layoffs Only

       We begin by considering a situation in which there is no moral

hazard problem because search effort and outcomes are both observable,

and in which retained workers do not search. In this case, the optimal

employment contract fully insures retained workers (who don't quit), and

hence satisfies c(wL,hL)_c(wH,hH) and Qh(w,h)1aW(w,hl) — 9.

thus, with well-behaved utility functions, employees will work more in

high-productivity states.

        To easily demonstrate that worksharing and layoffs are not

mutually exclusive outcomes, it will be useful at this juncture to

specialize the model further by assuming that the utility function takes

on the special form a(w,h)—i(w-h2/2) .    We   shall refer to w-h2/2 as

the "net income" of a job, that is, the wage income net of labor costs.

Given ah/cO, we can inmiediately determine that workers will supply

h.—9. hours at firms where        Let y. —     9   ,   i — L,H,   denote the

output, 9h , of a worker in state i , so       that in equilibrium



        For simplicity, we also consider the special case of the search

process in which a worker either expends e to become fully informed of


                                   22
all employment opportunities, or forgoes search and remains uninformed

(and immobile). We assume that the requisite effort level e is fixed and

that it always pays an unemployed worker to search (i.e. 0 < e <



          Now, with firm-specific shocks and constant returns, there will

always be a group of high-VMP firms who are willing to hire workers on

spot contracts. Since all searching workers have perfect information,

the resulting ex post equilibrium must conform to the classical

zero-profit competitive outcome: hence all spot contracts must pay ZYH

for h =         units    of labor. Observe that a(z,h) —

          We   can show that, in equilibrium, retained workers do not search

(quit) while every laid-off worker searches. Therefore, retained and

laid-off workers' expected utilities are described, respectively, by:

                U(w.,h.) —
                                ,t(wy/2)           i—L,H,

                       V(s) —
                                Is(s+yH/2)e.
The equilibrium contract will therefore maximize expected utility

                W —                   +                            +
                       r/4(wLyL/2)        (lr)(p(s+yH/2)e)
subject   to the zero expected profit constraint

                 Z —
                       r(y-w)     -
                                      (l-r)s   +
                                                   (yw)     — 0.

It should be clear that employed workers will receive full insurance,

                                                   If, as we assume here, negative
that is, p'(wLyL/2) —           '(wHyH/2).
severance payments are not permitted, it can be shown that the

equilibrium value of s must be zero.27 (Negative values are examined

later below.)

          The model's remaining equilibrium properties are derived as

follows: Solving Z—s—O and WLYL/2 — WHYH/2                         gives


                                               23
                     w.-y./2 —
                                   (ryL+yH)/2(l+r)
                                                         —   6(r)
so that workers' expected utility W can be rewritten as

                     W(r,e) —     (l+r)s(6(r))   +

Observe     that W
                 rr
                    <         0    for 0    r    1 .         There are two corner solutions

to consider: if W — 0               at r — 0     no one is retained and if W — 0
                          r                                                                 r
at r —      1    ,   everyone is retained. To determine when these solutions
occur, we define the critical effort levels, e(yL) and el(yL) by the

first-order conditions

                     Wr(le(yL)) — 0 —       W(Oe1(y))
It can be shown that these effort levels are both decreasing functions of

      (and hence °L satisfying 'H'2                                    >            > 0   for      <

                                                     —
      and       e(y11) —   el(yH)
                                    — 0 for                         Thus, if e      e(y)
r —   1; if e           e1(y)     r —   0; and if el(yL) < e <             e(y)      0<r<l where

dr/de > 0 and dr/dOL>O. See Figure 2.

            The trade-off between risk-sharing considerations and search

costs is clear. When either search becomes less expensive or the low-VMP

insurance subsidy becomes larger (as eL falls), the balance tips

towards layoffs and search, and away from worksharing. For example, any

combination of e and               below (above) the shaded area in Figure 2

involves layoffs (worksharing) and no worksharing (layoffs). These

corner solutions are faniiliar: when workers are freely mobile (e—0),

one-period implicit contract models must replicate spot auctions; and

when workers are immobile (e>s(yH/2)), the concavity of                             ensures that

worksharing strictly dominates layoffs. For intermediate values however.

only some workers are retained to workshare in the low-VMP state while

the remainder are laid-off with zero severance pay and undertake search.

11.3 On Severance Pay (Again

       With constant returns in production and identical workers, one

might initially conjecture that the equilibrium employment contract will

treat all workers identically ex post, and hence that the optimal layoff

rate must be a corner solution, either zero or one. In fact, of course,

interior solutions satisfying 0 <               r   < 1   are indeed possible, as

demonstrated above. We begin this section by asking whether this result

is due to our earlier prohibition of negative severance pay.



Interior Solutions

        The analysis below considers the more general case in which

laid-off workers receive job offers with net income z/2, where z need

not equal H The equilibrium contract with unrestricted severence pay

is then derived as follows. Solve the zero-profit constraint, Z — 0

and the first-order conditions for full insurance, w-y/2 = s+z/2

(i=L,H) ,   to   obtain

                          — s-i-z/2 —                            —   p(r)
                                        (ry+y+(lr)z)/4
then, substituting these expressions into W , we get the expected

utility function

                 W(re) —   2(p(r))      -
                                            (l-r)e
Since W(r,e) is a strictly concave function of r , we can proceed as

before to verify that an interior solution will be optimal for some

values of tYL,z,e) .         For example, if z >

(12)             Wr —                       +   e

which shows that there always exists an open interval of effort levels

consistent with interior optima. Therefore, while negative severance pay


                                                    25
may pose enforcement problems, it certainly does not preclude interior

layoff solutions.

        The cost of laying off a worker to a firm is the severance

payment s plus the forgone profit YLWL .                   Since    wy/2 —    s +    z/2

this cost equals

                             —                  z/2
              s +
                                 (y-y/2)    -




Therefore, layoffs are profitable whenever the worker's net outside

income, z/2 , exceeds his competitive internal net income, i.e. his VMP

minus the disutility of work, LL'2 .                  In   turn, when layoffs are

profitable, increasing the layoff rate increases employed workers' net

income p(r) .       Therefore,   interior solutions are possible in this model

with complete insurance because, when z >                   , the   marginal benefit of

layoffs t'(p)(zyL)/2 is a positive but continuously decreasing

function of the layoff rate (due to risk aversion), while the marginal

search cost e takes on positive fixed values. More generally, interior

solutions are t,ossible with complete insurance whenever search involves

some non-pecuniary and hence uninsurable costs.

        Notice, however, when search is costless, e — 0                  and (12) predict

the corner solutions r — 1         when                > z/2    and r — 0 when

        <   z/2   ; in addition, when laid-off workers' utility is

alternatively represented by p(s+z/2-e) , so that all search costs are

pecuniary, interior equilibria are again ruled out as r — 1                   when

LL'2 > z/2        -e and r — 0 otherwise. Therefore, with complete
insurance and only pecuniary search costs, the equilibrium layoff rate

simply implements the standard "first best" allocation.




                                           26
Production Efficiency

          It has been widely thought that the absence of severance pay is

the only reason that layoffs are not at a productively efficient level.

Without severance pay, firms can only provide insurance by retaining and

subsidizing workers even when their VMP is higher elsewhere. We now show

that even with optimally chosen severance pay, the layoff rate will not

generally be productively efficient. There are two parts to the

argument: first, an efficient layoff policy requires complete insurance,

not just the availability of (negative) severance pay; and second, the

moral hazard problems described in Section I preclude complete insurance

so that (as with quit behavior) production inefficiencies will again

result.

          To see this, consider a set-up similar to Section I in which,

given e , a laid-off worker's best alternative option, yielding z/2

is a random draw from a nondegenerate distribution with c.d.f. G(z/2,e),

where C(.,O) — 1      .
                           Letting       s(z) denote the severance payment to

workers who draw z/2 ,          the   first-order condition for layoffs, at an

interior solution, yields (after some manipulation)

(13)              —
                      WL
                           -   E(s(z))   -
                                             Q

               Q —
                      [(wLyL/2)(Ep(s(z)+z/2).e)]/p'(WLYL2)
Hence the output gain from retaining an extra worker, his VMP, equals the

corresponding marginal cost of an extra employee, that is, the contract

wage minus the expected severance pay minus the expected (implicit)

insurance indemnity. There are three cases of interest.

          First, suppose search effort is fixed and firms can monitor the

outcomes of search, i.e. each laid-off worker's z/2             realization is


                                                 27
observable. In this case, the optimal severance payment s(z) satisfies

p'(wLyL/2) —   p'(s(z)+z/2)        for all z .         Therefore,    WLYL/2 equals
E(s(z))+E(z/2) ,    p(w-y/2)       equals Ep(s(z)+z/2) , so that Q-'              e/i'(p),
and hence

                       — E(z/2)      -
                                         e/p'(p)
In words, the net income from current employment equals the expected net

income from alternative employment minus the cost of search, and

therefore, the layoff rate is efficient when firms provide complete

insurance.

          Second, suppose search effort is fixed but firms cannot monitor

workers' job offers. In this case, s(z) is the payment to workers who

claim to draw z/2 , and the only incentive compatible payment schedule

is the fixed non-contingent payment, s(z) — s —                  E(s(z))   .   Since

E.i(s+z/2) is strictly less than p(s+E(z/2))

               Q   > (w-y/2)   -
                                    (s+E(z/2))     +   e/j'(p)
and so,

(14)                   < E(z/2)      -
                                         e/p'(p)
Therefore, when success in job search cannot be monitored, firms

overemploy workers in the low-VMP state, that is, retained workers' net

current income is strictly less than their expected net alternative

opportunity.

          While this distortion obviously also results when severance pay

is prohibited (s—O) ,    earlier         research had mistakenly focused on the

absence of severance pay per se, rather than the absence of complete

insurance, as the source of the problem. We therefore conclude that the

allocative impact of severance pay vis-a-vis layoff rates is minimal


                                             28
when, as seems plausible, workers' outside opportunities are uncertain

and unobservable: layoff rates are certainly higher when severance pay is

provided, but are still deficient relative to the productively efficient

solution.

         Finally, suppose search effort is variable but unobservable,

while search outcomes can be observed. In this case, the firm can

provide complete insurance in the spot market by offering severance pay

which satisfies p'(s(z)+z/2) —   constant, for all z .    However, because

search entails disutility, when s(z)+z/2 is constant, the optimal

search effort will be zero and hence workers remain immobile. To

overcome this moral hazard problem and encourage search, an alternative

schedule of payments will be offered which, at a minimum, involves

nonconstant s(z)+z/2 .    Therefore,   complete insurance though feasible is

not desirable, and overemployment, as in (14), results in the low-VMP

state.



II.C Layoffs With On-the-Job Search

         The model of section II.A was structured so that there was no

on-the-job search (and hence no quits). Thus, the model could not

accurately capture the trade-off between inducing voluntary separations

(through lower pay to retained employees) and involuntary separations

(through layoffs). To proceed in the simplest way, we extend the model

in Section II.A by assuming search costs are random; there is some

probability that search costs are low (here, for simplicity, assumed to

be zero), and some probability that search costs are high (here, for

simplicity, assumed to be sufficiently high that individuals would in


                                       29
fact never search); and neither the worker nor the firm know what their

search costs will be before the contract is signed (and indeed, before

the layoff decision is made). In particular suppose
                                     —
                         r Prob(e—O)
            on-the-job   I
                         1. Prob(ep(yH/2)) =

                        f
            off-the-job I
                             Prob(e—O) — q,

                             Prob(e=p(yH/2)) —   l-q.
We expect that p < q     as laid-off workers generally access a better

job-finding technology than retained workers. Given these extreme

distributions, it can be shown that firms will have no incentive to offer

contracts designed to discourage quits by highly mobile workers at high

productivity firms or encourage quits by immobile workers at low

productivity firms.

        From our earlier analysis, we expect the optimal severance

payment to be a decreasing function of q, which measures the degree of

mobility available to laid-off workers. Here we simplify by setting

s—O. The resulting equilibrium layoff-worksharing mix corresponding to

any 9L and combination of job-finding technologies is depicted in

Figure 3; all points to the left (right) of the 3-D wedge yield contracts

with layoffs (worksharing) and no vorksharing (layoffs). When

off-the-job search is relatively efficient (high q/p), layoffs become the

primary vehicle for inducing separations; and when on-the-job search is

relatively efficient, worksharing with quits becomes more attractive. In

fact, layoffs can occur only if off-the-job search is more efficient,

i.e. q>p.




                                       30
II.D Random Search Costs

        In Section II.C, the optimal layoff rate was determined by the

relative efficiency of workers' on- and off-the-job search technologies,

whereas wage-hours policy had no effect on quits. By contrast, our

earlier analysis in Section I ignored layoff rates and argued that by

lowering wages (and hence reducing the effective degree of insurance)

firms could induce quits and hence movement from low-productivity to

high-productivity firms. This section shows how the firm must balance

off simultaneously the effects of all of its terms of employment, that

is, of wages and hours, layoff rates, and severance pay.

        The model is the same as that of the previous section, except

that now there is a continuous distribution of search costs. The

consequence of this is that as the terms offered retained workers become

worse, more of the retained workers are induced to search. In

particular, we now suppose retained workers' requisite e's are drawn

from a distribution with continuous c.d.f. F(e), that unattached workers'

values are drawn from a distribution with continuous c.d.f. C(e), and

that F and G share the common support [O,u(yH/2)).

        Assuming that retained workers search to quit (rather than quit

to search) and substituting the efficient labor supplies h. —   9.,
agents' expected utilities are again described by W(C) and Z(C) as in

Section I, except that

                                                          p(s),    and

            ir(w.,h.,O.) —
                             (l-F(x1))(Y-w).
x is the difference in utility between what the worker gets at his job
and what he would get if he is successful in finding a new job; hence

search is profitable if and only if e < x •       Similarly,          is the

difference between the utility of a laid-off worker who searches and

finds a job (exclusive of search costs) and his utility if he does not

search; hence laid-off workers search if and only if their search costs

are less than       Thus, retained workers quit with probability F(x)
and laid-off workers seek employment with probability G(ç).

        In our earlier model, lowering wage WL encourages quits by

increasing search effort and hence increasing the likelihood that a

random outside offer will dominate wL; in the present model, lowering

   raises the niaxilnuni search effort level XL consistent with a

profitable move, and hence increases the likelihood that a randomly drawn

search cost will be less than XL.

        There are, as we have emphasized, two different ways for workers

to leave low-VMP firms, by quits or layoffs. The former has the

advantage of selecting workers with the lowest e values for search,

while the latter has the potential advantage of forcing workers to use a

relatively more efficient off-the-job search technology. To illustrate

these effects and the possibility of an interior layoff solution, we

                                       32
evaluate the derivative of the Lagrangian, L — W+AZ                   ,    where

                  —            -

                      - [(lF(xL))xL +              edF(e)]   +   [(1-G(r))r   + J0 edG(e)]

To compare search technologies, we now identify one technology as more

efficient than another whenever the former has a lower mean effort level.

        Thus, taking F( )      as       given, there exists a sequence of

increasingly efficient off-the-job search technologies such that, in the

limit, (s,G(ç)) approach (0,1), the 2nd and 3rd bracketed expressions in

(15) go to zero and 8L/8r becomes strictly negative (as s — 0                        implies

YLwL_O). On the other hand, taking G( )                 as   given, there exists a

sequence of increasingly efficient on-the-job search technologies such

that, in the limit, F() approaches one for all x > 0, the 1st and 4th

bracketed expressions in (15) go to zero and 8L/ôr becomes strictly

positive (as the f.o.c. A          V(s)     implies A

        It follows that preferences and search technologies can be found
such that the equilibrium quit rate, layoff rate and severance payment

are all non-zero at low-VMP firms. In these circumstances, the

equilibrium rate of unemployment is (l-r)(l-G(ç))/2 where (l-r)/2                          is


the workforce proportion on layoff and 1-G(ç) is the proportion of

unattached workers who draw search costs exceeding                     —

and who therefore have no incentive to search.28

        In the absence of cx        ante    employment contracts, the equilibrium

unemployment rate here would be zero as G(p(yH/2)) — 1.                       Therefore,

implicit contracts and asymmetric job-market information are necessary

                                             33
conditions for a positive equilibrium unemployment rate. In fact,

implicit contracts can only generate unemployment by explaining either

why laid-off workers are unwilling to search for jobs at high

productivity firms (or are unsuccessful), or why the latter firms are

unwilling to hire workers laid off elsewhere. We have pursued the former

approach.



II.E A Further Comparison Between Layoffs and Quits

        To induce search, one needs to impose some risk on some

individuals. This risk can take one of two forms: it can be a risk

imposed on a few individuals in the form of layoffs, or it can be a risk

imposed on all individuals in the form of lower wages to induce

on-the-job search. Neither form in general dominates the other.

        If firms are imperfectly informed concerning the search

abilities, costs, and quit propensities of different individuals, layoffs

will not discriminate between efficient and inefficient searchers. With

on-the-job search, those who have a comparative advantage in search will

do so. The firm may be able to induce all the separations it desires by

lowering the wage only slightly to induce those with very low search

costs to find employment elsewhere.

        (The assumption that the firm is completely uninformed about

comparative search costs is not, however, completely correct. Younger

workers, for instance, and those who have recently been searching (the

newly hired who already have accumulated considerable information about

the labor market) may have a relatively more efficient search technology;




                                      34
hence these are the workers which the firm should layoff. This is, of

course, consistent with observed patterns of layoffs.)

       On the other hand, those who leave the firm voluntarily may

be those who are the firm's most productive workers; that is, the firm

may not be able to discriminate between high and lo productivity workers

as well as other firms may, or alternatively, those with lower search

costs may also be significantly more productive. In either event, when

the firm lays off workers, it loses a cross-section of its labor force,

but when the firm lowers its wage, it loses its best workers. These

standard efficiency-wage arguments also rely upon incomplete information

and explain why firms may be reluctant to lower the wages of retained

workers (see Stiglitz, and Weiss).



III. Concludinz Remarks

        A complete theory of unemployment should answer the following

questions: How do we explain the degree of observed wage flexibility?29

How do we explain the form of unemployment, e.g. worksharing versus

layoffs? How do we explain which workers get laid off? How do we

explain the level of severance pay? Why does severance pay not fully

compensate laid-off workers? Why do workers prefer to be retained rather

than laid off? Why are some unattached workers unable or unwilling to

secure employment elsewhere?

        Existing implicit contract models, while they provide

explanations for some of these phenomena, fail to provide explanations

for others and, in some instances, yield counterfactual implications. We

have argued that costly search coupled with firms inability to monitor


                                     35
workers' search activities can provide insights into each of the

questions listed above; e.g. it can explain partial wage.

insurance, internal distortions in the form of underemployment at low-VMP

firms, layoffs and quits, sluggish interfirni mobility and equilibrium
                30
unemployment.

        In this paper we have presented a positive analysis of implicit

contracts with asymmetric search information. A normative analysis would

be straightforward. From the literature on equilibrium with incomplete

markets and imperfect information, it should be apparent that although

the equilibrium contracts described in this paper are "locally efficient"

(i.e. given the actions of all other firms in the economy, these

contracts maximize workers' expected utility subject to a zero-profit

constraint), the market equilibrium and the corresponding "natural rate"
                                                       31
are in fact generally not constrained Pareto efficient.

        By highlighting the implications of private search information,

this paper has resolved several of the outstanding conundrums in the

implicit contract literature and has also provided a unified treatment of

worksharing, layoffs, severance pay, quits and unemployment.   The reason

why it is necessary to formulate a model which incorporates all of these

features should be apparent: without doing so, one cannot be sure that

whatever results one obtains are simply not an artifact of the artificial

restrictions one has imposed, e.g. that there is no severance pay, no

on-the-job search, etc.

        Our model can be viewed as an extension of the standard theory to

take into account the fact that what is at risk is not being laid off,

but rather, being laid off and not rehired. As an extension of this


                                    36
earlier theory, however, some common issues remain: how., for instance,

are such contracts enforced? While these problems remain important,

Footnotes

 1. There are now a large number of surveys and critical reviews in this

     area including George Akerlof and Hajime Miyazaki (1980), Azariadis

     (1979), Azariadis and Stiglitz (1983), Oliver Hart (1983) and most

     recently Sherwin Rosen (1985).

 2. Though more recent developments in implicit contract theory,

     particularly those based on asymmetries of information (Azariadis, 1983;

     Sandford Grossman and Hart), have recognized the failure of the

     traditional versions to explain unemployment, they have failed to

     address the central problems raised above, and have faced some further

     difficulties as well. For example, not only do these new theories

     obtain unemployment only under restrictive conditions, but when they do,

     they obtain it for all states of nature except the very best. In

     addition, these new theories have also been criticized for their

     information assumptions, both that the contracts do not employ all the

     relevant and easily available information, and that they sometimes

     require the use of information (eg. restrictions on the sale of assets)

     which is not easily monitored. For a fuller discussion, see Stiglitz

     (1986).

 3. A first best (full information) socially optimal insurance contract

     would provide that he move whenever he finds a job with a productivity

     in excess of his current productivity.

 4   The same moral hazard problem is examined by Arnott and Stiglitz (1985)

     in their analysis of implicit contracts when unobservable non-pecuniary

     attributes are associated with different firms.
5. Note that asymmetric information plays a key role in our analysis, but

   that the particular source of informational asymmetry is different from

   that discussed, say, by Azariadis (1983) or Grossman and Hart (1981).

   In these papers workers cannot observe realizations of firms' revenue

   functions, which leads to an adverse selection problem. In the present

   paper, as in Jon Strand's, firms cannot observe workers' search efforts,

   which leads to a moral hazard problem. The Azariadis-

   Grossman-Hart kind of asymmetry can be introduced here without

    substantially altering our results.

6. Related papers which also highlight labor mobility include those by

   John Geanakoplos and Takatoshi Ito (1981) and Hosios (1985,1986); these

   papers develop simple general equilibrium mdoels of layoffs, hiring and

    unemployment in which the ex post job-finding probability is endogenous

    and, as here, laid-off workers job offers are private information.

7. We also assume that each firm's technology is observable by the firm and

    its workers but not by others. This gives risk-neutral firms an

    informational advantage over external agents, so that job-related

    insurance is provided to workers by employers rather than insurance

    companies.

8. Observe that asymmetric information has ruled out compensation

    conditional upon a worker's search effort or outside job offer.

    Severance pay for workers who quit is prohibited here only to simplify

    the discussion. See Section I.D.

9. This assumption could, of course, easily be removed at some increase in

    notational complexity. We again emphasize that we are concerned with

    constructing the simplest model illustrating the points at issue, rather

    than the most complete.
10. Workers are assumed to not quit to search, i.e., U(w.,h1)   V(O).     This

    constraint is assumed to be satisfied, and will be ignored in the

    subsequent discussion.

11. The additively separable structure and the imposition of     —    0

    simplify the analysis but are otherwise inessential.

12. More than one interpretation of the model is possible, and each involves

    a slightly different rationale for the dependency of the search

    disutility (e,h) on h .      For example, it is possible to think of

    each period being divided into two parts: a job-search period and a

    production period. Workers' current employers in this view are required

    to tell workers at the beginning of the job-search period whether or not

    they are assured a job with that employer during the production period;

    and so contract design will have to account for the effect of this

    announcement on workers' behavior during the initial search period.

         In the subsequent analysis, we shall argue that an increase in

    hours worked increases the cost of search for retained workers. The

    worker presumably has less time for search (or other non-work)

    activities. In the interpretation of the model just offered, however,

    with search preceeding production, it is the substitutability of leisure

    during the search and production sub-periods that results in the quit

    rate declining as hours worked increases. An alternative

    interpretation, in which search and production occur together during an

    initial sub-period, and where hours worked directly affects search

    disutility, is formalized in footnote 13.

       Under either interpretation, however, what is crucial is that workers

    believe that finns will not re-employ laid-off workers who are
    unsuccessful in finding alternative employment. This commitment is

    essential if the layoff announcement is to have the desired on-the-job

    search incentive effects and if the actual layoff is to have the desired

    off-the-job search incentive effects. Even if workers believe there is

    a probability, greater than zero but less than one, of the firm reneging

    on its commitment to not rehire laid-off workers, there will still

    remain an attenuated search incentive effect.

13. We now formulate a slightly different interpretation of the events we

    have in mind to show that whether search precedes or is concurrent with

    production is not critical here.

       Suppose the unit period is divided into 2 subperiods, of lengths A

    and 1-A , such that workers supply labour and search during the 1st

     subperiod and either quit of stay at the beginning of the 2nd subperiod,

     and therefore

      u(w,h,e) —
                          A                           A

     Then, defining F — A+(l-A)F                and       —   A   ,
                                                                      we get
                     A            A        A              A

      u(w,h,e)   — oF +       a(1-F)   -
                                               , where F(O,O) —         1


     That is, except for the ,A,,,             this   is identical to the expression for

     u(w,h,e) in the text, and hence our analysis of search and quits goes

     through in exactly the same way.

14. After firms' layoff decisions have been made, retained workers quit the

     pool of employed workers with probability                        1-F , and laid-off workers

     quit the pool of unemployed workers with probability                         1-C .   This
                                                                            Nevertheless, It should
     symmetrical structure simplifies the analysis.

     be noted that whether layoffs precede or follow quits on-the-job would

     play a somewhat more important role when there are small firms with
      diminishing returns technologies; then, because of the stochastic nature

      of quits, the firm would be uncertain about the number of employees

      during the production period, and, because of diminishing returns,

      variability in employment (in a given state) is costly.

        The order would also be of some importance if there were adverse

      selection effects. As we have emphasized, quits have the advantage of

      encouraging those with lower search costs to engage in more turnover.

      There are thus some efficiency gains to having quits precede layoffs.

      On the other hand, when quits precede layoffs, increasing the layoff

      rate has positive on-the-job search incentive effects; moreover, our

      argument for layoffs in Section II, on the grounds that off-the-job

      search is generally more efficient than on-the-job search, goes through

      independent of the order of quits and layoffs.

         Our central concern in this paper is to establish, under fairly

      general conditions, that optimal contracts will entail a mixture of

      quits and layoffs. This central result will remain valid regardless of

      the sequencing of quits and layoffs; making quits precede layoffs would

      require a 3-period analysis and would further complicate what is already

      an admittedly complex setup.

      q — l-F(x,e)   gives a — -(F x + F e )         where    Fx > 0 and F e > 0

      From the definition of x(w,h) , we        have x — c    (w,h)/a (x,h) > 0 ; and

       Ue —   a(w,h)F   (x,e) +


      and x — x(w,h), we have e — aw(w,h)Fe/uee              Assuming that the

      second-order condition u         < 0 is satisfied, we then have q, — -awB

      where B —   (F/a)     -
                                F2/u   > 0 .
16. Previous work has recognized that wages will likely be raised to

    discourage quits when profits are high or turnover is costly (e.g. Steve

    Salop (1979)), but fails to make the symmetrical argument when profits

    are low. Separability is obviously sufficient but not necessary for

     this correlation between real wages and VMP's.

17. Proceeding as in footnote 15, it can be shown that                        —

               Uhah+ h                        dv

                                into

                       U               dhU

     gives     (6b).

18. While the discussion is often couched in terms of moral hazard,

     c.f. Grossman and Hart, the question with which the earlier models with

     asymmetric information are concerned is the inability of at least one

     party to the implicit contract to distinguish among states of nature (an

     adverse selection issue); the question with which we are concerned is

     the inability of firms to monitor workers' search intensities (a moral

     hazard issue).

19. See Russell Cooper (1983), Hart, and Stiglitz for a description of the

     role of preferences in generating production inefficiencies.

20. See Azariadis (1983), and Grossman and Hart.

21. See V.V. Chari (1983), Cooper, and Jerry Green and Charles Kahn (1983).

22. See Rosen, and Stiglitz.
23. Whether the expected utility of income is greater or less for the

    laid-off (vs. retained) worker depends upon whether utility is a concave

    or convex function of marginal utility. Recognizing that s+z is a mean

    marginal utility preserving spread of WL ,             this          result follows as a

    corollary to Peter Diamond arid Stiglitz (1974). See also Harua Imai,

    Ceanakoplos and Ito (1981).

24. Suppose firms pay b to workers who quit. In this case, only those

    workers who receive an outside offer z             x-b will quit, where x =

    x(w,h)   is again defined by a(w,h) —         a(x,h)        .    As a result, u(w,h,e) is

    replaced by

      u(w,h,e,b) —    a(w,h)F(x-b,e)      + c,(x,e,b)(l-F(x-b,e)) -            (e,h)
      where c(x,e,b) —      f
                           J x -b
                                    cz(z+b,h)f(z,e)dz/(l-F(x-b,e))


     Hence the optimal search intensity and resulting quit rate are given by

     e(w,h,b) — argmax u(w,h,e,b) ,         q(w,h,b)   —   1-F(x-b,e(w,h,b)),
     where     > 0 .     Similarly,     the resulting utility and profit functions

     are given by

       U(w,h,b) —    u(w,h,e(w,h,b),b),
       ir(w,h,b) —   (l-q(w,h,b))(Gh-w)-q(W,h,b)b
     As U and Uh are again described by (2a,b), and as r                            and wh are

     again described by (2c,d) where A — Oh-w+b             ,       it   follows that our

     earlier results on wages and production inefficiencies go through

     exactly as before. See Ito (1986) and Charles Kahn (1985) for further

     results on quits and severance pay.

25. A more detailed exposition of the material in this section, including

     some omitted proofs, is contained in Arnott, Hosios and Stiglitz

     (1983). The model in subsection II.A. resembles Baily's (1977).
26. See Ken Chan and Yannis lonannides (1982), Mark Lowenstein (1983),

      Rosen, and Andrew Weiss (1980).

27. Since (yH/2)e >        t(0)   — 0      ,
                                               it turns out that every laid-off worker
      will search when s — 0       .   To verify that s — 0       ,   note that
                                                                          so that Z—0 and
      wLyL/'2wHyH/2 and                >
                                           L    imply        >
                                                                 YLWL
      s>0 give YHwH > 0.          Therefore, in equilibrium, the profit per

      employee at high-VMP firms with this implicit contract is greater than

      or equal to zero, while the profit per employee at firms with spot

      contracts is zero. Since the spot contract maximizes                  p(s+w-h2/2)

      subject to OHhw_O , and since the optimal implicit contract maximizes

                    subject to Oh1HWHt              for some t   >0   ,
                                                                          s > 0   implies
      I.L(wHhH/2)

      .(s+yH/2) >   (wHyH/2). It           follows that a non-positive s value is

      required to equate retained and laid-off workers' marginal utilities of

      income.

28.   It should be noted that allowing severance pay for retained workers who

      quit will effectively make the on-the-job search technology relatively

      more efficient than otherwise. Hence the optimal layoff rate will be

      lower, but generally still positive. Also, allowing quits to precede

      layoffs, to screen out low search cost workers, would have a similar

      effect on layoffs.

29. The earlier implicit contract models probably explained too much: they

       suggested that there would be guaranteed annual incomes (in the case of

       separable utility functions). In fact, as we do observe some wage and

       income flexibility, the question is, how do we explain the extent of

       this flexibility, not its complete absence.
30. The assumption of limited information concerning employment status

    following a layoff has, in fact, been implicit in the previous implicit

    contract literature. In those models, if workers' employment status

    could be monitored, all workers would prefer to be laid off, provided

    the probability of       getting a job was high enough (and provided

    leisure is a normal good). The "lucky" workers would be those who fail

    to obtain jobs, and who are thereby fully compensated, and so the

    smaller the likelihood of obtaining a job, the more would workers clamor

     to be those laid off.

31. The term constrained Pareto efficient is used to remind us that in

     evaluating the market solution, we must take into account the costs of

     acquiring information. Arnott and Stiglitz (1985) have shown that

     implicit contracts with job turnover are not constrained Pareto

     efficient because of the externality exerted by firms' wage/employment

     decisions, via their effect on workers' savings behavior, on other

     firms' profits; this is an example of the more general class of

     "seemingly unrelated events" externalities that result whenever there

     are moral hazard problems (see Arnott and Stiglitz, 1986).

        Two related problems should also be mentioned. Firstly, although we

     have not formally modelled the micro-structure of search, it is clear

     from the work of Peter Diamond (1982) and Dale Mortensen (1982) that

     were we to do so, a variety of search externalities would also arise;

     Hosios (1985) describes the resulting contractual inefficiencies when a

     Diamond-Mortensen matching model is used to characterize the ex post

     spot market. Secondly, with risk-averse individuals and more than one

     commodity, the market equilibrium with limited risk markets will not in
general be contrained Pareto efficient; building on work by David

Newbery and Stiglitz (1982), Hosios (1984) describes the welfare

economics of employment contracts when risk markets are incomplete.

Realization of labor productiyjy:

       ec {6L6H}           eL<eH.

Firms make their employment decisions:

       if S =          worker is retained with certainty;
                 eHI
       if e =          worker is retained with probability r and laid off with
                       probability l-r.

Workers make their search decisions:

       retained workers choose e(w.,h.)
                                  1   1
                                        when 8 =        8.;
           laid-off workers choose c(s).

                                    accept their best offer quit to work elsewhere;
           retained workers who<
                                    reject their best offer remain employed at their
                                    initial firm;
                                    accept their best offer become re-employed elsewhere;
           laid-off workers who(
                                    reject their best offer, or who receive no offers,
                                    remain unemployed.
