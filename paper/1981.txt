            A Time Series Analysis of Representative Agent Models of
                Consumption and Leisure Choice Under Uncertainty




                                    ABSTRACT


       This paper investigates empirically a model of aggregate consumption and

leisure decisions in which goods and leisure provide services over time. The

implied time non-separability of preferences introduces an endogenous source of

dynamics which affects both the co—movements in aggregate compensation and hours

worked and the cross-relations between prices and quantities. These cross-

relations are examined empirically using post-war monthly U.S. data on quan-

tities, real wages and the real return on the one—month Treasury bill. We find

substantial evidence against the overidentifying restrictions. The test results

suggest that the orthogonality conditions associated with the representative

consumer's intratemporal Euler equation underlie the failure of the model.

Additionally, the estimated values of key parameters differ significantly from

the values assumed in several studies of real business models. Several possible

reasons for these discrepancies are discussed.

 1.   INTRODUCTION

      The purpose of this paper is to investigate empirically a model which

relates aggregate consumption, aggregate hours worked, aggregate compensation

and interest rates. The model we consider has a representative consumer whose

indirect preferences defined over current and past acquisitions of consumption

goods and leisure choices are non-time—separable.       This non-separability

introduces an endogenous source of dynamics which is not present in the

studies of aggregate labor supply by Altonji (1982), Ashenfelter and Card

(1982) and Mankiw, Rotemberg and Summers (1985). Kydland and Prescott (1982)

and Kydland (1983) argue that non-time-separable utility is an important

ingredient in explaining the co-movements in aggregate compensation and hours

worked.    They do not, however, investigate empirically the cross-relations

between prices and quantities that are implied by their model.        It is these

cross relations which are the focal point of the empirical analysis in this

paper.

      Kennan (1985) has studied an equilibrium model of the aggregate labor

market in which preferences are not time separable and there is an

intertemporal technology for producing consumption goods.        He restricts

preferences and technology so that the resulting model implies a linear time

series representation for hours worked and wages. His model implies that the

interest rate on risk free (in units of consumption) securities is constant.

In contrast, our model is not a fully articulated equilibrium model but can

accommodate equilibrium laws of motion for labor supply, consumption, and real

wages that are not linear and allows for stochastic interest rates.

      The empirical methodology that we use is an extended version of the

nonlinear Euler equation methods suggested by Hansen and Singleton (1982).

This approach to studying the implications of the model is quite different
                                      2




from the approach used by Kydland and Prescott (1982) and Altug (1985). These

authors study the implications of their real business cycle models by

considering the implied equilibrium law of motion for quantity variables as

calculated from an approximate social planning problem.      In contrast, our

analysis examines only the cross-relations between prices and quantities that

are implied by our specifications of preferences of the representative

consumer and not by the technology for producing new goods.         Thus, our

analysis is a limited information one because we abstain from studying any

additional restrictions that might emerge from the specification of this

technology.

     A representative consumer framework is used in this study because it

provides an analytically tractable way of deducing implications of consumption

and leisure choice under uncertainty for the joint behavior of asset returns

and other aggregates. Representative agent models of aggregate labor supply

have been used by Lucas and Rapping (1969), Hall (1980), Kydland and Prescott

(1982), and Mankiw, Rotemberg and Summers (1985), among others. We recognize

that the assumptions commonly used to rationalize a representative agent model

in the presence of heterogeneous consumers (e.g., see Rubinstein (19714),

Brennan and Kraus (1978), and Eichenbaum, Hansen and Richard (1985)) are not

very compelling in the case of aggregate labor supply.      For instance, the

common assumption of complete securities markets implies that the implicit

price of leisure for all consumers be identical.          For the particular

specifications of preferences that we use, time invariant efficiency units

scaling could be introduced and still preserve the rationalization for a

representative consumer [see Muellbauer (1981) and Appendix A).         This,

however, introduces only a very limited amount of diversity in skills among

workers and still imposes restrictions which are not supported by the
                                         3



 rnicroeconomic evidence (e.g., see Satinger [1978]). Further, the assumption

 that consumers choose optimally to be at interior points in their respective

 commodity spaces rules out consumers moving in and out of the labor force over

 time.      Hence, the behavior of the fictitious representative agent confounds

movements of some consumers into and out of the labor force with movements in

hours worked by other consumers who are in the labor force. In fact there is

substantial evidence that much of the variation in aggregate hours worked can

be attributed to movements in and out of employment (e.g., see Coleman

[198)4]).      In spite of these well known criticisms of the representative

consumer paradigm, we still use it in this paper to help document its ability

or inability to explain the aggregate time series.

     The specifications of preferences considered are variations of the

specification suggested by Kydland and Prescott (1982). In interpreting their

specification of preferences, we introduce a hypothetical leisure service that

depends on linear combinations of current and past values of leisure time.

Kydland and Prescott assume that the representative agent has time separable

preferences defined over leisure service and the consumption of a nondurable

consumption good.      In our analysis, we modify the preference specification

used by Kydland and Prescott by introducing a consumption service that is a

linear combination of current and past values of consumption acquisitions.

Hence, our modification allows roi the possibility that both current

acquisitions of consumption goods and current period leisure time gives rise

to consumption and leisure services in current and future time periods.

Preferences of the representative agent are time separable over these

services. Hence, nonseparabilities over time in the preference specification

are most easily interpreted as emerging in the linear transformation of

current and past values of leisure time and new consumption goods into current

levels of leisure and consumption services.
        We use an empirical methodology in this paper that was suggested by

Hansen and Singleton (1982), Dunn and Singleton (1986), and Eichenbaum and

Hansen (1985).       Hansen and Singleton show how to exploit shock exclusion

restrictions from preferences to estimate and test representative consumer

models using generalized method of moments estimators. Although Hansen and

Singleton only consider models in which a representative agent has time-

separable preferences defined over a single consumption good, Eichenbaum and

Hansen (1985) and Dunn and Singleton (1986) show how their methodology can be

extended in a straightforward manner to apply to more general specifications

of'   preferences.   In addition to applying this methodology we illustrate how to

test whether a subset of relations are contaminated by measurement errors (in

this case, measurement errors in aggregate compensation).

       The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, the preferences of the

representative consumer are described and then, using this specification,

relations among consumption, hours worked, compensation, and asset returns are

deduced.     In section 3 we describe the data used in our empirical analysis.

In section L we show how to obtain estimates of preference parameters and test

the relations derived in section 2. The empirical results are presented and

discussed in section 5. Finally, concluding remarks are presented in section

6.




2.    Preferences of the Representative Consumer

       In this section we discuss the preferences of the representative
consumer.      Then, equilibrium relations among real wages, asset returns,

consumption and leisure are deduced from the first-order conditions of the

representative consumer's intertemporal optimum problem.
                                          5




        The representative consumer is assumed to have preferences defined over

the services provided by the acquisitions of consumption goods and leisure

time.     ccording1y, we introduce two hypothetical services that are linear

functions of current and past values of consumption and leisure respectively:




                    A(L)ct,                                                  (2.1)



                                                                             (2.2)




where c is the amount of' the consumption good purchased at date t and

denotes hours of leisure at date t) The polynomial in the lag operator A(L)

is given by



            A(L) =    1   + ciL



and B(L) is given by either




            B1(L)
                          1 +   L/(1—L)                                      (2.')




or




            B2(L)
                          1 +   bL.                                          (2.5)




The time t leisure and consumption decisions are constrained to be in an

exogenously specified information set         of the representative agent.

     Expression (2.1) and the assumed form of A(L) imply that the service flow

from consumption goods at date t,         c, depends linearly on consumption
                                           6




acquisitions at dates t and t-1                The coefficient     is assumed to be

nonnegative so that consumption acquisitions at time t contribute consumption

services (and not disservices) in the current and one future time period.

     In (2.2),         denotes a leisure service that depends linearly on current

and lagged values of leisure time. The case in which B(L)          B1(L) corresponds

to the leisure service specification suggested by Kydland and Prescott

(1982).   They assume that tS is greater than or equal to zero and that n is

between zero and one.        In contrast, we do not restrict the sign of tS    in    our

empirical analysis. Under this service technology, one unit of leisure time

at date t contributes                 units of leisure services at data t +           r.
Therefore, the sign of S determines whether leisure time today provides

leisure services or disservices in future time periods.           Leisure time today

augments leisure services in future time periods when                S   is positive,

diminishes leisure services in future time periods when          is negative, and has

no impact on leisure services in future time periods when cS is zero.                The

impact of current leisure time on future leisure services decays geometrically

as dictated by the parameter n.            Kydland (1983) provides an extensive

motivation for this service technology.

     When B(L) =    B2(L),   leisure time today provides leisure services today and

either leisure services or disservices one period in the future depending on

whether b is positive or negative.

     Following Kydland and Prescott (1982), the representative agent is
assumed to ranl alternative streams of consumption and leisure services using

the time and state separable utility function



          E                            ,                                     (2.6)
              t=o
                                                 7




where B and y are preference parameters between zero and one, e is a

preference parameter that is less than one, and E denotes the mathematical

expectation.          When e       is equal to zero, we interpret (2.6) to be the
logarithmic specification


                               *            *
                      B (ilogc +
           E
               t::O
                                    (l_)logz},                           (2.7)



which is separable across consumption and leisure services.          The marginal

utilities of services implied by (2.6) are



          MC          8t10_1_1)8                                         (2.8)



          ML          Bt(1_y)cY8g.(l_8_l .                               (2.9)


     The Joint specification of an intertemporal service technology and

preferences defined over services can be viewed as inducing an indirect set of

preferences defined over leisure time and consumption acquisitions.          More

precisely, letting MCt and MLt denote the indirect marginal utilities of

consumption acquisitions and leisure at time t, it follows from (2.1) and

(2.2) that 2




          MCt E[A(L)MclIt],                                             (2.10)

    The indirect marginal utilities depend in general on the current and

expected future direct marginal utilities because of the interteniporal service
                                                 8



 technologies. For instance, if 8(L) is equal to 81(L) and 6 * 0,                           then

continues to provide services in all future periods.                      Therefore, MLt depends
on the current and expected values of' all future direct marginal utilities of

leisure services.            Alternatively, if       6      0,     then the leisure service is

equal to leisure                      and MLt                      More generally, the indirect
                        (Zt                              MLt.
utility function is non—time-separable and MCt MC or MLt                                MLt, so long
as a 0 or 6 * 0         (b      0 when B(L)      32(L)).
        The first-order conditions of the representative agent choosing optimally

to allocate consumption and leisure over time imply that




            wtMCt     MLt,



where wt is the real wage. Substituting from (2.8) —                      (2.11)   and rearranging

terms gives




             E[wCA(BL_l){I[A(L)cIYe_l1B(L)I( lY)O


                 -
                                                                                   0.      (2.12)



Note that when A(L) and B(L) are the identity operators relation (2.12) holds

without taking conditional expectations.                   In this case, (2.12) implies an
exact      relation     among      current    wages,             consumption,      and    leisures:

 c/wtZt      y/(l—y).

        If the consumer can trade a one-period asset with a price of one unit of

ct and with a random payof,f of rt÷l units of ct+l at date t+1, then a second

necessary condition for utility maximization is that

Substituting from (2.8) and (2.10) gives

Expressions (2.12) and (2.1)4) are used in Section 14 to deduce a set of

estimation equations.

     The analysis so far has assumed a single consumer. It turns out that the

same implications can be obtained in an environment with many consumers who

have identical preferences but possibly heterogeneous initial endowments of

capital.   These implications can also be derived in an environment in which

consumers' marginal products of' labor are distinct as long as there is a time

invariant efficiency units transformation that makes consumers' labor

perfectly substitutable. In this latter case efficiency units are priced and

their relative price can be inferred from the aggregate compensation data

after correction by a time-invariant translation factor {see Appendix A].



3. Description of the Data and Analysis of Trends

     The formal justification of the econometric procedures described in

Section 4 and implemented in Section 5 rely on the assumption that the

variables entering the estimation equations are stationary (see Hansen
(1982)).   In fact, some of the time series considered exhibited pronounced

trends during the sample period.           Consequently, a stationary-inducing
transformation of the data is required. The choice of detrending procedctre is
                                      10




restricted in our context by the requirement that the transformed series

satisfy the stochastic Euler equations (2.12) and (2.111).   Therefore, after

briefly describing the data used in the empirical analysis, we discuss in

detail a model of nonstationarity that rationalizes the particular

transformation involved here. This transf'orrnation does not require a priori

or simultaneous estimation of parameters governing the nonstationarities.

     The monthly,    seasonally adjusted observations on aggregate real
consumption of nondurables and services were obtained from the Citibank

Economic Database.    The per capita consumption series was constructed by

dividing each observation of the aforementioned measure of aggregate real

consumption by the corresponding observation on the total adult (age sixteen

and over) population, published by the Bureau of the Census. The asset return

considered is the ex post real return on one-month Treasury bills.3 Nominal

returns reported in Ibbotson and Sinquefield (1979) were converted to ex post

real returns using the implicit price deflator for riondurables and services.

Nominal wages were measured by the seasonally adjusted averaged hourly
compensation for all employees on nonagricultural payrolls, obtained from the

Citibank Economic Database.   Real wages were constructed by dividing each

observation on nominal wages by the implicit price deflator associated with

our measure of consumption.

     We constructed a measure of hours worked, ht, by forming the ratio of

total hours worked by the civilian labor force and our measure of

population.   Like our compensation measure, this measure of hours averages

across members of the population who were and were not employed, a point to

which we shall return subsequently. The representative consumer was given a

time endowment of 112 hours a week and 4.25 weeks per month, which gives a

monthly time endowment (h0) of 476 hours. The leisure series (Z) was then
                                         11




 calculated by subtracting hours worked from the monthly time endowment. All

 data covered the period 1959:1 to 1978:12.

         For the equilibrium relations (2.12) and (2.1L) to be consistent with

 this data, certain relations among the respective growth rates of the series
must be satisfied.       The most desirable way to model nonstationarities in

consumption and hours worked is to specify technologies for capital

accumulation and the production of new consumption goods that include temporal

shifts in the productivity of labor and/or capital.               By combining such a

specification of technology with a preference specification, one could in

principle construct a stochastic growth model with the nonstationarities in

consumption and hours worked modeled endogenously.

       In our analysis, we assume that the following vector of ratios




             x (ct/ci, ,       wz/c,    r_l)                                 (3.1)



forms a strictly stationary stochastic process. Notice that the assumption
that       and wtLt/ct are stationary implies that Znwt and Znc have a common
trend.      This assumption is consistent with Altug's modification of the

Kydland—Prescott model in which there is a geometric trend in the
technology.     It is also consistent with Christiano's '(1986) growth model in

which the technology shock can have a random walk component with drift.1

       It is possible to derive relations from (2.12) and (2.1)4), respectively,

that involve only current, past and future values of xt. We illustrate this

point for the case in which B(L) =            = 1   + bL.   Let    =
                                     B2(L)


       H[Ct,cti,tt,tti ,a0J     {Y[ct÷aciJ'(°[L+bL1 ( 18},                  (3.2)

        HZ{Ct,Cti 'zt'_i .a]    {(l_Y)[ct+cti}[t+btti]Y1}.                (33)


The expressions given in (3.2) and (3.3) are in the information set at time

t. Therefore, (2.12) implies that




            E[H(xt,xti,xti,a0)IIt]     0,                                (3.4)

Even though      H(s)    and           depend on c,                and

separately, Hw(S) depends only on xt,xt_l, and xt+l, where xt is defined in

obtain

 Relations (3.4) and (3.6) are used in Section )4 to derive the estimation

 equations.



 4. Estimation and Inference

      Our approach to estimation and inference follows closely that of

Eichenbauxn and Hansen (1985) and Dunn and Singleton (1986).               These authors

show how to modify the analysis of Hansen and Singleton (1982) to allow for

multiple consumption goods and preferences which are not separable over time.

     First we consider the case in which 3(L)                       1 +   bL.   using the
                                                       B2(L)
notation from Section 3, consider the following two estimation equations:




          dt2 H(xt,xti,xti,ao)                                                   (4.1)




                  H(xt,xti,xt2,xti,o)


Relations (3.4) and (3.6) imply that the E[dt+211tJ            0.    Consequently, the

disturbance vector dt+2 is orthogonal to any random variables in                1 Such
random variables can be used as instruments in estimating the true parameter

vector.   Let Zt be an R-dimerisional vector of elements in I, where 2R is

greater than or equal to five. Using the components of Zt as instruments, the

2R—djniensional function




                  (l/T)                                                          (4.2)
                                  dt2(a)
                                      114




can be formed from the sample information.      Since the vector g(a) is a
consistent estimator of Ezt dt2(a) and the expectation Ezt            dt2(a) is
in general nonzero except at the point a                 we estimate °c     by the
                                                a43,


choice of a, say °T'       in an admissible parameter space that makes

close to zero in the sense of minimizing the quadratic form



                                                                          (14.3)




Here WT is a symmetric positive definite distance matrix that can depend on

sample information.

     Hansen (1982) shows that the choice of WT that minimizes the asymptotic

covariance matrix of GT depends on the autocovariance structure of the

disturbance vector dt+2.   Although this vector is serially correlated, it is

in the information st at time t+2. Hence the theory implies the restrictions



                                            0, for Iki     2
          E{(ztk dk2)(z d2)'}                                             (4.14)




It follows that the optimal estimator is obtained by choosing             to be a

consistent estimator of




         So k_lt dtk2)(zt dt2)'.                                          (4.5)



Hansen (1982) discusses a candidate estimator of S0.           In Appendix B, we

describe an alternative estimator that, unlike the estimator suggested by

Hansen, is constrained to be positive definite in finite samples.

    Recall from the discussion of (2.12) that if the induced preferences

defined over consumption acquisitions and leisure are time separable, then
                                        15




there is an exact relationship between hours worked, consumption acquisitions,

and wages.      In this case, the first component of dt+2 is actually in I and

hence is zero. An analogous observation applies to any specification of time

separable preferences that like ours exclude unobservable shocks to

preferences.     Hence, temporal nonseparabilities in preferences are necessary

in our analysis in order for one of the disturbances terms to be different

from zero.

     The estimation approach we use relies in an essential way on the

exclusion of unobservable shocks to preferences and the absence of measurement

errors.      The introduction of such unobservables does not lead to additive

error terms for the specification of preferences given in Section 2.

Accommodation of these unobservables seems to require explicit or numerical

solutions to the stochastic general equilibrium model while the approach

adopted here avoids the need for such solutions.

     The parameters of the model with B(L) = B1(L) can be estimated in a

similar, but not entirely, analogous fashion.         Two additional problems

emerge. The first problem is that for hypothetical values of the parameters,

the leisure service at any point in time depends on the entire infinite past

of the consumption of leisure time. For instance, in the first time period we

have that the leisure service is given by




          L!t=   1
                          nj   .
                                                                      (U.6)


Since we do not have observations on values of leisure time prior to time
period one, we approximate the infinite sum



                                                                      (14.7)
          j=o        i
                                          16




by the average of the consumption of leisure time in our sample divided by

(1-n) for each hypothetical value of n. Then, given an initial value of

leisure services, the remaining values of leisure services for our sample can

be calculated using the sample observations on leisure time consumption and

hypothetical values of n and 6.          In this manner we are able to calculate

values of                and         for hypothetical values of the preference
                  MC:          MLt
              6
parameters

     The second problem that occurs is that MLt as given by (2.11) now depends

on the current and expected infinite future of MLt.            However, following

Hotz, Kydland, and Sedlacek (1985), the relation




             wtMCt      MLt                                              (4.8)



also implies that




             E{(1_nL){w( 1_aL)MCt} (It}        E{[1+(6_n)L11MLIIt}


for B(L) =         A virtue of the expression in (14.9) is that it only depends
             B1(L).
                      *
on terms involving MC , MC
                           *        *        *       *
                      t    t+1 , MC
                                    t+2 , ML   and ML
                                             t        t+1

     Relation (14.9) can be used in deriving an expression analogous to (2.12)

by substituting in for MCt and MLt from (2.8) and (2.9). This expression

together with (2.114) then can be used to define two estimation equations with

disturbance terms arising from expectational errors. The stationary—inducing

transformation described in Section 3 can be modified appropriately to convert

these relations to relations among variables that are assumed to be components

of a strictly stationary stochastic process. Estimation then proceeds in the

same fashion as in the case in which B(L)
                                                62(L).

5. Empirical Results

        Estimates for the Kydland and Prescott specification of B(L) were

obtained using the following orthogonality conditions:


                     1                           1


            E(dit2) Vt      0 and E(d2t2) Vt              0,              (5.1)

                                                 Vt-i
where




                [(c_c1)/c1 ,(tt_Zt_i) t_i,(wt_wt_i)/wt_i ,rt_l].


Thus, fourteen orthogonality conditions were imposed.             The results are
displayed in Table 1.

     The estimates displayed under the heading "Wage 1" were obtained using

the data described in Section 3.           All of the parameter estimates are

economically meaningful except for ,        which is slightly larger than unity.
The latter finding is common to several recent empirical studies of

intertemporal Euler equations using treasury bill returns (see Singleton

(1986)).     The estimates of    0   and     y       imply that the representative
consumer's utility function is concave.       The estimate of 0      is about four

times its standard error suggesting that logarithmic separability (eO) is

empirically implausible.     We defer discussion of y until later in this
section.

     Next consider the parameters which govern the intertemporal aspects of

the service technologies.    In all cases the estimate of a is both positive

and large relative to its estimated standard error.7             This implies that

consumption good acquisitions today give rise to consumption services both
                                       18




today and one period in the future. The estimates of n and        S raise some

interesting quandries. The estimate of S is negative implying that current

leisure acquisitions give rise to future leisure disservices. The estimate of

5, however, is small relative to its estimated standard error. When       6   is

zero, i    ceases to be identified if the model is specified correctly. The

results in Table 1 indicate that n is estimated quite accurately even though

6 is estimated quite imprecisely.      The econometric equation obtained from

(14.9) is filtered forward by (1-nL). When 5 is zero this forward filter

should leave the population orthogonality conditions intact for any value of

r.   Our finding that n     is estimated accurately, while 6   is not, may just

reflect the fact that the model is fundamentally misspecified. The forward

filtering is exploited in allowing the orthogonality conditions to be

approximately satisfied when in fact this filtering should have little impact.

     We also studied a specification of the mapping from leisure to leisure

services that does not require forward filtering.      We estimated the model

using the parsimonious representation of 3(L) given by (2.5) and fourteen

orthogonality conditions.    The results are reported in the first column of

Table 2.   Notice that the estimated values of     0 are closer to zero than

those reported in Table 1.       Also, there is little evidence against the

hypothesis that preferences are logarithmically separable.        Perhaps more

importantly, the point estimates again imply that current leisure decisions

impact negatively upon future leisure services. Unlike the estimates of 6,

the estimates of b are large in absolute value relative to their standard

errors.

     The representative consumer always chooses positive values of Z.

Therefore, when b is negative, he always must choose enough leisure to offset

the negative impact of past leisure choices on the level of current leisure
                                          19




 services. For example, if 8(L)         B2(L) and b < 0, then it must be the case
 that




                > IbZ_1    for all t.




Thus, based on the estimates of' b reported in Table 2, the representative

consumer will always choose a value of'        that is greater than approximately

2/3 of             It follows that increases in hours worked will be accomplished

in a relatively gradual way,            while decreases in hours worked are
unrestricted 8

        The finding that current leisure decisions provide leisure disservices in

the future is inconsistent with the assumptions in Kydland and Prescott.

However, it is consistent with some of the empirical findings in Hotz, Kydland

and Sedlacek (1985) in a panel data analysis with            given by Bi(L)zt.
It is also consistent with Kennan's (1985) time series analysis of a model in

which          is given by B2(L)t.       Thus qualitatively similar properties of

the leisure technology have been obtained in studies using other data and

different identifying assumptions.

     For comparison, estimates were also obtained using the ratios of

aggregate total employee compensation from the National Income and Product

Accounts to our measure of' aggregate hours as the nominal wage rate. These

results are displayed in Tables 1 and 2 under the heading "Wage 2".          The

estimated parameters are similar to those obtained using "Wage 1".

     We now return to the discussion of y.          Kydland and Prescott (1982)

argue that y should be approximately 1/3.        Their rationale for this choice

is "motivated by the fact that households' allocation of time to rionmarket

activities is about twice as large as the allocation to market activities"
                                            20



[page 1352]. Since our estimates of         'y   are considerably smaller than 1/3, it

is of interest to understand why.           One rough set of calculations involves

abstracting from uncertainty as well as dynamics and conducting a steady state

analysis.       The steady state that we consider treats the growth rate of

consumption, leisure, and the valuation of leisure relative to consumption as

constants, but accommodates geometric growth in consumption and wages.

Letting [c/w9.] be the steady state ratio of consumption to the valuation of

leisure, it follows from (2.12) that



            y    [c/(w)]/(1 +   [c/(w)]).                                    (5.3)



Relation (5.3) is the standard relation between y and expenditure shares for

Cobb—Douglas preferences.

     Recall that relation (2.12) was also used to construct relation (3,14)

which is utilized in our econometric analysis.                 In fact one of the
orthogonality conditions which we imposed in our estimation procedure amounts

to scaling (2.12) in order to induce stationarity and then taking uncondi-

tional expectations (Edit+2       0).   This orthogonality condition imposes the

stochastic counterpart of the steady-state relation (5.3). Substituting time

averages of' consumption relative to the valuation of leisure for c/[wj in

(5.3) gives values of y         .13 and y        .16 for the "Wage 1" and "Wage 2"

measures of compensation, respectively. These values are quite similar to the

point estimates reported in columns 1 and 2 of Tables 1 and 2, respectively.

For our choice of total time endowment and measure of hours worked, the ratio

of average hours worked to leisure is about .20 which is considerably less

than one-half, the number assumed by Kydland and Prescott (1982).            We have

chosen to include all individuals age 16 and over in our sample when
                                      21




calculating leisure time.    Hence our sample includes unemployed adults, Of

course other choices of time endowments will alter this conclusion.        One

reason for the ambiguity in defining total time endowments is that the

representative consumer model confounds the behavior of employed and non-

employed individuals, and the total time endowment is obviously sensitive to

whether non-empLoyed adults are included in the sample.

     Formula (5.3) also suggest3 that the value of y will be sensitive to

the measure of' compensation.   One possible problem is that wages should be

measured in efficiency units.       Interpreting the model as applying to
efficiency units of labor in an environment where consumers have distinct

marginal products of labor complicates the relation between observed total

compensation and efficiency unit wages (see Appendix A).     A second possible

problem is that the measure of compensation used in obtaining the results

reported in columns 1 and 2 of Tables 1 and 2 are not corrected for taxes.

For the sake of comparison we also estimated the model using after-tax wages

and returns.   Our results are displayed in the last columns of Tables 1 and

2.   The time series on annual marginal tax rates was taken from Seater

(1985).   The annual rates were interpolated linearly to obtain monthly

rates. The adjustment for taxes lowers the average real wage. Equation (5.4)

implies that this should result in a larger value of y.      Furthermore, the

estimated values of y in Tables 1 and 2 are larger for the tax-adjusted data

than the corresponding estimates from the unadjusted data.   In fact, for the

specification B1(L), the estimates of' y are within one standard error of the

value of one-third which was imposed by Kydland and Prescott (1982).      The

estimates of y are less precise when tax adjustments are made, however.

     Our discussion of' the point estimates must be qualified by the fact that

the T statistics reported in Tables 1 and 2 are large relative to the degrees
                                       22




of freedom.    One possible reason for these large test statistics is that all

of the measures of compensation that we used are contaminated by measurement

error and do not reflect the correct measure of consumers' marginal value of

time. In order to explore this possibility we tested the null hypothesis that

the five orthogoriality conditions associated with the intraternporal Euler

equation (2.12) relating MLt, MCt and Wt hold,            conditional on the

orthogonality conditions associated with the intertemporal Euler equation

(2.114) being satisfied. We examined this null hypothesis using a statistical

test that is analogous to a likelihood ratio test.     A formula for the test

statistic is presented formally in Appendix C and its asymptotic properties

are discussed. In Tables 1 and 2 the value of this test statistic is denoted

by CT.     The values of' CT do suggest that the large r statistics are

indicative of the failure of the orthogonality conditions associated with the

Euler equation relating MLt, MCt and Wt to hold in the sample.

      To explore this possibility further, we re-estimated the parameters using

only the orthogonality conditions associated with the intertemporal relation

(2.14).   In conducting this exercise, it was necessary to fix the value of' y

and r in the model with B(L) = B1(L) and the value of y in the specification

of the model with B(L) = B2(L) in order to obtain convergence of the

minimization algorithm.   (Recall that y seems to be determined largely by

the intratemporal Euler equation). The results are displayed in Table 3 for

the second measure of wages (Wage 2).       Notice first that the probability

values of the T statistics are substantially smaller than the probability

values for the corresponding statistics in Tables 1 and 2. Second, with B(L)

=
    31(L) the point estimates are qualitatively similar to the corresponding
estimates reported in Table 1.       The primary difference is the loss of

precision when only the intertemporal Euler equation is used in the empirical
                                     23



analysis. On the other hand, for the model with B(L)      B2(L), the sign of b

changes form negative to positive when the intratemporal Euler equation is

omitted from the analysis.    For both models, the estimates of         remain

positive and are estimated precisely.     Taken together, the results obtained

when only the intertemporal Euler equation is used in the empirical analysis

provide less evidence against the hypothesis of intertemporal substitution of

leisure.



6.   Conclusion
     In this paper we estimate and test a representative consumer model which

relates per capita consumption, per capita hours worked, per capita
consumption and interest rates. The analysis focuses upon the cross—relations

between prices and quantities that are implied by the representative

consumer's non-time-separable preferences.        When both the inter and
intratemporal Euler equations of the representative consumer are utilized in

the estimation procedure, we find substantial evidence against the over-

identifying restrictions implied by the model.         The results from the

specification tests developed in the paper suggest that this can be attributed

to the failure of the orthogonality conditions associated with the
representative consumer's intratemporal Euler equation to hold in the sample.

                                         APPENDIX A

        In this appendix we consider the implications for our econometric

analysis of consumers having distinct marginal products of' labor. We consider

only the special case in which individual labor supply can be converted into

efficiency units that are comparable across consumers. Consumers are presumed

to be compensated for the quantities of efficiency units of labor they

supply. Muellbauer (1981) studies this problem in a single period context and

obtains necessary and sufficient conditions for aggregation. Here we allow

for multiple time periods but restrict our attention to the class of

preferences used in our empirical analysis.

        First, we introduce some notation.            Let ctJ denote the consumption of

person j at time t and                 denote the leisure of person j at time t.     We

assume that hours worked at time t by person j can be converted to efficiency

units by multiplying the hours worked by e, where e3 is a positive number not

indexed by time. Hence the efficiency units of leisure of person j at time t

are             Similarly, the efficiency units of leisure services are given by

           where
                         B(L)Lt.
        Suppose all J consumers have identical preferences given by (2.6). These

preferences could equivalently be expressed in terms of efficiency units of

leisure services.       The conversion tà efficiency units simply scales the

utility function.        Since preferences are homothetic, in a competitive

equilibrium with complete markets in consumption and leisure services,

 where      w3       is strictly positive and           [w1 +     + ... =    = 1.     The

 proportionality relations in (A.1) do not imply corresponding proportional

 relations for acquisitions of consumption goods or efficiency units of
 leisure.        It turns out, however, that an asymptotic result can be obtained

when A(L) and B(L) satisfy certain invertibility conditions.                     That is,
proportionality will be obtained for appropriately defined stochastic steady

states. Therefore, we strengthen (A.1) to be

                                  e2Z   +   ... + eZJ/J,

although we will not address formally the approximation involved.

        We define the efficiency units so that



(A.3)        (w1/e1 + w2/e2 +     ... + w/e)/J      =   1.


Then



(A.L)        (1/J)( +        + ... +         = (1/J)(e1z     +
                                                                 e2 + ... + e)
so that the average amount of leisure is equal to the average amount                  of
efficiency units of leisure.
                                               29




        Since consumers are compensated in terms of efficiency units, person j

receives we[h -                units   of the consumption good at time t where w is

the wage rate in terms of efficiency units and h is the total time

endowment. Average compensation w is then equal to



(A.5)
            wta w(h* -


where



(A.6)       h*     (e1 + e2 +   ... e)h/J.

Solving for w gives



                           -
(A.7)       w =   w/(h*

The efficiency wage w is equal to average compensation divided by the number

of efficiency units worked.            The parameter h* depends on both h and the

efficiency units correction. In the special case in which the e are one for

all j, h*      h as is assumed in our empirical analysis. Otherwise, it could be

treated as a free parameter to be estimated.                  This describes one possible

source of measurement error in our wage series that could in principle be
                                                                         *

APPENDIX B: Estimating the Asymptotic Covariance Matrices

        In this appendix we describe the procedure used to estimate the distance
matrix in our IV criterion function and the asymptotic covariance matrix of
         the minimizer of (4.3).

        Suppose the KxI vector of disturbances in the estimation equations is
observed by agents at date t+q and satisfies Etdt+q(co)                     0,   for some
finite integer q      1.        Also, let

                            T
                      1
                                z,    dt÷q ('

where Zt is an R x 1 vector of elements of It, and suppose that the estimator
of           is chosen from the admissible parameter space to minimize

Then Hansen (1982) shows under certain regularity conditions that the limiting
distribution of (P/TOT: T         1) is normal with mean vector zero and covariance
matrix (DóS5'Do).           To implement this estimator and conduct inference about
        requires consistent estimators of S0 and D0.                Here we describe such
estimators for the case of arbitrary q. The results can be applied to study
(4.2), for example, by setting q             2.

        Hansen supplies sufficient conditions to guarantee that if               : T   1}
                                                           a

                                                  then     °T : T 1}    converges in
probability to      D0.         Therefore,        in our empirical analysis we use
         a

DT i               as our estimator of P0.               Estimation of S0 is somewhat more
involved.     The matrix 5 is a covariance matrix and is therefore positive

semidefinite.          In this paper we impose the stronger requirement that it be
positive definite.   Hansen (1982) suggests estimating S by replacing the
population moments in (B.1) by their sample counterparts evaluated at
Although the resulting estimator converges almost surely to S0, it is not
constrained algorithmically to be positive definite in finite samples. There
have been several empirical applications in which this estimator has turned
out to be positive definite, but we encountered cases in which it was not
positive definite.BI For this reason we consider an alternative estimator of
S0 that is constrained to be positive definite in finite samples.B.2

        Specifically, we estimate the coefficients of a Wold decomposition of the
process      CUt+q z dt+q : -                <   t < +} and then use these coefficient
estimates in estimating the covariance matrix of the one-step-ahead linear
least squares forecast errors and S0.                             The zero restrictions on the
autocovariances imply that the Wold decomposition can be represented as


(B.3)       Ut    et   +
                           Biet.i    +   ... + Bqet_q

where et is the one-step ahead forecast error in forecasting                           dt from
                                                                                Zt_q
linear combinations of past values of        dt and B1, •.. Bq                     are RK x RK
                                      zt_q
dimensional matrices. The matrix S0 is related to the Ba's via the formula


(B.4)
            S0
                   (I +
                           B1

                                                          B   +   ... + B),
where       =
                 Eee1.      Once we obtain consistent estimators of B1,           ••    8q
                                                                                             and a
consistent estimator of                   that is constrained to be positive semidefinite
in finite samples, we can use formula (B.4) to obtain a consistent estimator
of       that will be positive semidefinite.3

        To estimate the moving average coefficients                                    we use a
procedure suggested by Durbin (1960) with some minor modifications. A virtue
of Durbin's procedure is that it provides estimators of the moving average
coefficients without resorting to numerical search procedures.   Numerical
search procedures become intractable in our application because of the large
number of elements in the B matrices that have to be estimated
simultaneously.
                                                                   32




        The first step of our modified Durbin procedure is to use the Yule—Walker
equations to obtain estimates of A1,A2,. . .,ANLAG                                                 in the finite order
autoregression


(B.5)        u = A1u1                   +       ... + ANLAGut NLAG              +


These estimates are then used to construct estimates                                                     of the one—step—
ahead forecast errors of the finite order vector autoregression. The sample
forecast errors                     : t=NLAG+1,...,T} are used subsequently as estimates of
the     forecast errors                           {e t=NLAG+1,...,T}                     in        (B..4).     Since    the
autoregressive representation of the process {u : -                                            <    t < +a)   has infinite
order when q is greater than zero, the choice of NLAG should be an increasing
function of sample size in order that sample forecast errors will converge to
the true forecast errors.B Recall that in our applications there is a
priori information that all but a finite number of the autocovariances are
zero.      Therefore the number of nonzero sample autocovariances used in
estimation of (B.5) does not need to increase with sample size even though
NLAG does.35

        The second step is to estimate the regression equation


                                                                       +            +
             zt_q          dt(CT) 1_1 +                                                 Vt,

where             is the vector disturbance term.                                   Let i,           ...,      denote   the

resulting estimators of B1,..                                    respectively, and let

APPENDIX C: Testing Subsets of Orthogonality Conditions

        In this appendix we consider the problem of' testing whether a subset of

the orthogonality conditions hold (see Appendix B for notation).                                                    More

particular disturbance.

      Throughout this discussion we shall assume that the matrices S0 and D0

can be consistently estimated by (ST : T?1} and {DT : T1), and that S0 is

nonsingular. Partitioning W0, S0, S0 and D0 in accord with the two sets

of orthogonality conditions, gives

The test which we consider exploits the fact that the sample orthogonality
 conditions (g(a) : T>1} converge in distribution to a normally distributed
 random vector       with mean        zero    and     covariance             matrix            where
                                                                                      V0,
 V0      S0 -   D0(DS0D0)1D      (see Hansen 1982).

        Gallant and Jorgenson (1979) have proposed a procedure for testing
nonlinear restrictions on the parameter vector using instrumental variable
estimators that is analogous to the likelihood ratio test. While they assumed
that disturbance        terms    were serially            independent and
                                                              conditionally
homoskedastic, their procedure is easily modified to apply to the inference
problem considered here for subsets of orthogonality conditions. To implement
this test, first one obtains an estimator (a2 : T?1} of
                                                  a0 by minimizing
the objective function g(a)'Sg(a) by choice of a.   This estimator
exploits all of the orthogonality conditions appropriate under the null
hypothesis. Next the estimator (alT : T1} of                             is formed using only the
first J1 orthogonality conditions that are presumed to hold under the
alternative hypotheses, and the weighting matrix (ST11—1
                                                     )   . Using both
estimators


                            —1                                 11   —1
(C.1)                                                     ,

            CT Tg(a2) 5T g(a2) - Tg1(a1) 5T

is then calculated. Under the null hypothesis the asymptotic distribution of'

 (CT: T1}       is chi square with J2 degrees of'             freedom.       To see this, factor
 S5 and (31)_1 as PP0 and        PP1, respectively. In proving Theorem
3.1, Hansen (1982) shows that (/TP0g(o0) :T1} and (1/TP1g1(a0) :
have limiting distributions under the null hypothesis that are normals with
zero means and covariance matrices    and I, respectively. These results,
together with Lema 4.1 in Hansen, imply that {/TPg(a2) : T1} has the
same limiting distribution as


                                                  : T1}         (IT NP0g(a0) :


and (ITP1g1(a1) : T?1} has the same limiting distribution as


(IT(IQ_                                 P1g1(a0) : T1}                   (IT MP1g1(a0) : T 2   1}.
                                      35



Thus, under the null hypothesis, CT has the same    asymptotic   distribution as
the statistic


(C.2)       Tg(a0)'P(N -        (P1   PMP1[IQ O]P1}P0g(o0).

Now the matrix in brackets in (C.2) is idempotent with rank equal to J2 and,
therefore, CT is distributed asymptotically as chi-square with J2 degrees of
freedom.

        To conclude the discussion, note that the test procedure is easily
modified to handle restrictions on parameters of the form,


(C.3)             =    0,

where f2 has J2 coordinates and where J2 is less than Q. We simply view (C.3)
as being a set of orthogonality conditions that we wish to test just as
above. Now, however, there is no randomness in the orthogonality conditions
that we wish to test so the S0 matrix has the partitioned form



                  S11       0
                   0
            so=    0        0

and is therefore singular. Subject to this modification, the analysis above
carries over immediately to testing restrictions on the unknown parameters.

1.   A more general specification of this technology would aliow c(t.) to
     also depend upon current and lagged values of Lt(ct).              However for
     reasons of empirical tractability, we consider the specifications given
     by (2.1) and (2.2).


2.   Relations (2.10) and (2.11) ignore any nonnegativity constraints on ct
     and


3.   We also considered the value-weighted average of returns on the Mew York
     Stock Exchange. The results of the empirical analysis were qualitatively
     the same as those reported in this paper.


IL   To obtain this result Christiano assumes preferences are logarithmically
     separable in consumption and leisure and time separable in consumption.


5.   Under   our      assumption     that   the         process    is   stationary,

      E                EZ/(1-n).      Thus our procedure amounts to replacing (1L7)
     wit the     sample estimate of its unconditional mean.


6.   It can be shown that neither the consistency of our estimators nor the
     relevant asymptotic distribution theory is affected by the fact that our
     measure of the initial condition is undoubtedly incorrect.


7.   Interestingly, Eichenbaum and Hansen (1985) and Dunn and Singleton (1986)
     in their analyses of purchases of nondurable and durable consumption
     goods also present evidence of intertemporal nonseparabilities in the
     mapping from nondurable consumption goods to nondurable consumption good
     services.


8.   There is a literature which models temporally nonseparable preferences
     defined over consumption goods as reflecting the presence of "habit-
     formation." Negative estimated values of b and         ó are consistent with
     this interpretation.          See Pollak (1970) for an overview of habit-
     formation models.

B.1 Brown and Maital (1981) and Hansen and Hodrick (1980, 1983) have used the
     estimator proposed by Hansen without encountering any problem.


B.2 A third alternative is to estimate S0 using procedures developed for
     estimating spectral density matrices. While this method gives rise to a
     positive definite estimate of S, it ignores the implication of the
     theory that all but a finite number of the autocovariances of
      {zd: - < t < +} are zero.     Under the alternative hypotheses
    considered in Section )4,      the zero restrictions in the autocovariance
    function may not hold.          In conducting tests with respect to these
    alternatives it is not clear for power considerations whether one should
    or should not impose these zero restrictions. Under the null hypothesis
    the asymptotic distribution of' the test statistics are likely to
    approximate more accurately their finite sample distributions if the zero
    restrictions are imposed.


B.3 As long as       is nonsingular, this approach will, in general, give rise
    to a nonsingular estimate of' S0 in finite samples.


B.LI When detB(z) has zeroes on the unit circle even an infinite order
    autoregressive representation will not exist.       In our discussion we are
    implicitly ruling our zeroes with unit moduli.


B.5 Durbin's (1960) procedure is designed to handle mixed autoregressive—
    moving average models which do not, in general, haveonly a finite number
    of nonzero autov-ariances.


B.6 Cumby, Huizinga and Obstfeld (1982) propose a related method for
    estimating S0.   They use a Yule-Walker equation to obtain estimates of
    the autoregressive parameters, inverts the autoregressive polynomial, and
    then uses the resulting first q moving average coefficient matrices to
    estimate B,.. . ,B   .   Durbin (1960) suggests a third step in the procedure
    described here that increases the asymptotic efficiency of B1,...
