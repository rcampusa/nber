                                         ABSTRACT

This research explores the origins of loss aversion and the variation in its prevalence across
regions, nations and ethnic group. It advances the hypothesis and establishes empirically that the
evolution of loss aversion in the course of human history can be traced to the adaptation of
humans to the asymmetric effects of climatic shocks on reproductive success during the epoch in
which subsistence consumption was a binding constraint. Exploiting regional variations in the
vulnerability to climatic shocks and their exogenous changes in the course of the Columbian
Exchange, the research establishes that consistent with the predictions of the theory, individuals
and ethnic groups that are originated in regions marked by greater climatic volatility have higher
predisposition towards loss-neutrality, while descendants of regions in which climatic conditions
tended to be spatially correlated, and thus shocks were aggregate in nature, are characterized by
greater intensity of loss aversion.

1       Introduction

The intriguing phenomenon of loss aversion has been central for the understanding of human behavior

in the past few decades. The predisposition of individuals to view asymmetrically losses and gains

has been documented in a wide range of experimental and empirical studies (Tversky and Kahneman,

1991; Kahneman et al., 1991; Benartzi and Thaler, 1995) and its remarkable implications has been

established in the economic, political and social arenas.1 Nevertheless, despite the importance of this

phenomenon for the understanding of human and social behavior, and conceivably in the exploration

of the roots of comparative economic development across globe, the origins of loss aversion and the

variation in its intensity across societies have remained largely obscured.

    This research explores the roots of loss aversion and the variation in its prevalence across regions,

nations, and ethnic groups. It advances the hypothesis and establishes empirically that the evolution

of loss aversion in the course of human history reflects the adaptation of humans to an ancestral

environment in which, in light of the existence of a binding subsistence consumption constraint, adverse

climatic shocks could have resulted in extinction, while favorable ones generated only temporary gains

in reproductive success.

    The study develops an evolutionary theory that captures the fundamental asymmetry that the

Malthusian environment has generated with respect to the attitude of individuals towards gains and

loses in productivity, and thus with respect to the evolution of loss aversion. In light of existing evi-

dence that resources per capita during the Malthusian era where in the proximity of the subsistence

consumption constraint, lineages who were subjected to significant adverse productivity shocks during

this period had become extinct, while those who had experienced transitory favorable climatic condi-

tions had a larger reproductive success only temporarily (Ashraf and Galor, 2011). Thus, in view of

the subsistence consumption constraint, individuals who were characterized by loss aversion had cho-

sen to engage in safe agricultural practices that secured their subsistence consumption and minimized

the risk of catastrophic realizations that would inevitably bring their dynasties to extinction. In con-

trast, individuals with greater propensity towards loss-neutrality may had favored riskier agricultural

practices that were associated with higher expected return as well as higher expected extinction.

    In a Malthusian environment in which climatic shocks are aggregate in nature, individuals who

were engaged in risky agricultural practices would have likely been affected by a catastrophic climatic

realization that could have brought them to extinction. Hence, in an environment that is largely

characterized by aggregate productivity shocks the trait of loss aversion, and the associated choice of

the safer production mode, would have been favored by the forces of natural selection and would have

dominated the population in the long run. Furthermore, in a Malthusian environment characterized

by greater climatic volatility, although the trait of loss aversion would have still maximize the sur-

vival probability of each dynasty, loss-neutral dynasties who had experienced a sequence of (unlikely)

realizations of favorable climatic conditions had a significantly higher reproductive success and have

ultimately dominated the population in the long run.

   The theory generates two fundamental testable predictions about the climatic origins of the ob-

served predisposition toward loss-aversion. It suggests that individuals, as well as societies, that are

originated in regions of the world in which climatic shocks tended to be spatially correlated, and thus

aggregate in nature, would be characterized by greater intensity of loss aversion. In contrast, descen-

dants of regions of the world that were characterized by greater climatic volatility will tend to exhibit

a higher degree of loss-neutrality.

   Exploiting variations in the degree of loss aversion among second generation migrants in Europe

and the US, as well as across precolonial ethnic groups, the research establishes that consistent with

the predictions of the theory, individuals and ethnic groups that are originated in regions in which

climatic conditions tended to be spatially correlated, and thus shocks were aggregate in nature, are

characterized by greater intensity of loss aversion, while descendants of regions characterized by greater

climatic volatility have higher propensity towards loss-neutrality.

   The empirical analysis is conducted at different layers that are designed to establish the robustness

of the findings in distinct samples and units of analysis. It exploits variation in preferences and

behavior across individuals and ethnic groups, based on the European Social Survey (ESS), General

Social Survey (GSS), World Value Survey (WVS), the Ethnographic Atlas (EA), and the Standard

Cross Cultural Sample (SCCS). In particular, the analysis explores: (i) variation in loss-aversion across

second-generation migrants in the US as well as Europe, accounting for time-invariant host country

fixed effects, potentially confounding geographical characteristics of the parental countries of origin,

as well as migrants’ individual characteristics such as, age, gender, income and eduction; (ii) variation

in loss-aversion across individuals within each country, accounting for a wide range of potentially



                                                    2
confounding geographical characteristics, regional fixed effects, as well as individual characteristics,

such as age, gender, income and eduction; (iii) variation in loss-aversion across precolonial ethnic

groups, accounting for potentially confounding regional fixed effects, geographical characteristics as

well as ethnographic characteristics such as the intensity of agriculture, settlement structure, the use

of the plow.

    In light of the predictions of the theory, the prevalence of loss aversion is linked to intertemporal cli-

matic volatility as well as special correlation in climatic conditions. A-priori one could have captured

these climatic characteristics using either temperature or precipitation. However, as established in

the empirical section, while productivity in the Malthusian era is significantly correlated with various

characteristics of temperature, it is orthogonal to the corresponding measures of precipitation. Thus

the proposed hypothesis is examined based on the impact of measures of intertemporal temperature

volatility, as well as spatial correlation in temperature on the intensity of loss aversion.2 In particu-

lar, following the methodology of Durante (2009), these measures are constructed based on monthly

temperatures over the period 1900-2000, using the 0.5◦ × 0.5◦ resolution of the Climatic Research

Unit (CRU). Moreover, the study establishes the robustness of the results for the use of temperature

volatility over the periods 500CE - 2000CE and 500CE - 1000CE.3

    Variations in the prevalence and the distribution of loss-aversion across individuals is captured

by a variety of newly introduced measures of the intensity of loss aversion. Exploiting the ESS,

GSS and the WVS, the degree of loss aversion is captured by individual’s ranking of potential job

characteristics. In particular, preference for job security over other characteristics such as salary and

promotion opportunities are used as a proxy for loss-aversion. Importantly, since conceivably a layoff

is typically only a transitory phenomenon, preferences for job security over higher salary do not simply

represent the trade-off between potential gains and loss of income, and thus risk aversion, but rather

the reluctance of individuals to lose something that is in their possession, and thus loss aversion.

    Differences in the prevalence and the distribution of loss-aversion across ethnic groups are captured

by two ethnographic characteristics reported by the EA and the SCCS. In particular, loss aversion is

captured by parental preferences for sleeping in closed proximity to their infants; an overly cautious

      Loss aversion is indeed affected by the various measures of temperature rather than by the corresponding measures
of precipitation.
    3
      Potential concerns about changes in climate over the course of human history that is relevant for the evolution of
loss aversion, appears are largely misplaced. As established in the empirical section, climatic volatility and temperature
spatial correlation over the past 100 year period are highly correlated with the corresponding climatic characteristics in
the past 2000 years.



                                                            3
behavior driven by the fear of losing a child during his sleep, despite the low probability that is

associated with this event. Alternatively, loss aversion is captured by the prevailing types of games

played by members of an ethnic group. In particular, loss-aversion among members of the ethnic

group, is captured by the prevalence of games that are predominantly strategy-based, rather than

those governed by chance.

   The first part of the empirical analysis explores the effect of intertemporal temperature volatility

and temperature spatial correlation on the preferences of second-generation migrants in Europe and

the US for job security versus salary and other characteristics, as reported by the ESS and the GSS.

In line with the predictions of the theory, the analysis establishes: (i) a statistically and economically

significant adverse effect of temperature volatility in the parental country of origin on the degree of

loss aversion among second-generation migrants, and (ii) a statistically and economically significant

positive effect of temperature spatial correlation in the parental country of origin on the degree of

loss aversion among second-generation migrants. Moreover, consistent with the proposed theory that

underlines the role of intergenerational transmission in the evolution of loss aversion, the estimated

effects of temperature volatility and spatial correlation in the parental country of origin (rather than

those in country of residence) on loss aversion, capture the culturally-embodied, intergenerationally-

transmitted effect, rather than the direct effect of geography. Furthermore, the findings are robust

to the inclusion of country-of-birth fixed-effects, and for accounting for the potentially confounding

effects of a wide range of geographical characteristics at the parental county of origin, the years elapsed

since the parental country transitioned to agriculture, and a range of individual characteristics, such

as age, gender, education and income.

   The results are further robust to a large number of placebo and robustness tests. In particular, the

analysis suggests that intertemporal temperature volatility and temperature spatial correlation have

no effect on the valuation of job characteristics that are orthogonal to the loss aversion (e.g., salary

vs. promotion). Moreover, while loss aversion may be correlated with other cultural dimensions (e.g.,

obedience, altruism, attitudes towards equality and preference for strong government), the climatic

conditions that governed the evolution of loss aversion, do not have an effect of the evolution of

these cultural traits as well as others (e.g., long term orientation, attitudes towards gender roles and

tradition). In particular, lending further credence to the hypothesis that the geographical origins of

loss aversion are distinct from those of risk aversion, temperature volatility and temperature spatial



                                                    4
correlation are not associated with the attitude toward risk aversion, and the propensity towards risk

aversion has no impact on the effect of the climatic characteristics on loss aversion.

   The second part of the empirical analysis focuses on the effect of temperature intertemporal volatil-

ity and spatial correlation on the variation in loss-aversion across individuals within each country, as

reported by the WVS. These results further support the proposed theory. They establish a statisti-

cally and economically significant negative association between temperature volatility and degree of

loss aversion among individuals, and a statistically and economically significant positive association be-

tween temperature spatial correlation and loss aversion, as captured by their preferences of job security

versus other characteristics. The findings are robust to the inclusion of country-of-birth fixed-effects,

and for accounting for the potentially confounding effects of a wide range of geographical character-

istics, as well as individual characteristics, such as age, gender, education and income. Importantly,

the results are unaffected qualitatively if one adjust the climatic variables for the ancestral compo-

sition of the contemporary population, reinforcing the hypothesized intergenerationally-transmitted

and culturally-embodied nature of the effect.

   The third part of the empirical analysis explores the effect idiosyncratic and aggregate components

of climatic shocks on the degree of loss aversion across precolonial ethnic groups. In particular,

it establishes a statistically and economically significant negative association between temperature

volatility and loss aversion and a statistically and economically significant positive association between

temperature spatial correlation and loss aversion, as reported by the EA. Moreover, placebo tests,

establishes that the this climatic conditions are not associated with a wide range of other ethnographic

characteristics, such as, sex taboos, political integration, inherited property rights, gender roles in

agriculture, attitude towards premarital sex and belief in the evil eye. Thus, in line with the proposed

theory, this evidence suggests that the hypothesized evolutionary process had matured already in the

precolonial period.

   Moreover, the ethnic level analysis permits the exploration of the effect climatic conditions on

degree of loss aversion, as captured by the observed human behavior. First the study explores the

association between climatic characteristics, and their hypothesized impact on loss aversion, and the

degree of diversification in the production of subsistence consumption. A-priori, one would have

expected, that in a more volatile environment the degree of diversification will be larger. Nevertheless,

the findings suggests that ethnic groups that are characterized by greater climatic volatility tend to



                                                    5
diversify less, reflecting the selection of loss-neutrality in a volatile environment, and thus production

choices that are based on higher rates of return rather than loss-avoidance. Second, the study examines

the association between climatic characteristics, and their hypothesized impact on loss aversion, and

the choices of crops that are potentially less vulnerable to climatic fluctuations. In particular, due to

the greater resistance of roots and tubers, in comparison to cereals, to climatic volatility, one would

have expected, a-priori, that roots and tubers would be adopted in a more volatile environment.

Nevertheless, the findings suggest that, among ethnic-groups that were situated in a regions with

greater temperature volatility, roots or tubers are less likely to be the dominating crops, reflecting the

selection of the trait of loss-neutrality in a volatile environment and thus choices that are based on

higher rates of return rather than loss-avoidance.

    The research represent that first attempt to shed light on the geographical origins of loss aversion

and the distribution of this trait across the globe. Moreover, it contributes to the understanding of the

evolution of preferences (e.g., Bisin and Verdier, 2001; Galor and Moav, 2002), and the biogeographical

roots of preferences (e.g., Alesina et al., 2013; Galor and Özak, 2016; Giuliano and Nunn, 2017) and

comparative economic development (e.g., Diamond, 1997; Ashraf and Galor, 2011, 2013; Spolaore and

Wacziarg, 2013; Mayshar et al., 2016).



2    An Evolutionary Theory of Loss Aversion

This section advances an evolutionary theory that captures the critical role of climatic forces in the

evolution of loss aversion in the course of human history. The theory suggests the contemporary

distribution of the intensity of loss aversion across individuals can be traced to the adaptation of their

ancestral populations to the climatic forces that affected their productivity during Malthusian era.4

    The model captures the fundamental asymmetry that the Malthusian environment has generated

with respect to the attitude of individuals towards gains and loses in productivity, and thus with

respect to the evolution of loss aversion. In light of existing evidence that resources per capita during

the Malthusian era where in the proximity of the subsistence consumption constraint, lineages of

individuals who were subjected to significant adverse transitory productivity shocks during this period

had become extinct, while lineages of individuals who had experience favorable climatic realization had
    4
      Chen et al. (2006) argue, based on evidence from capuchin monkey that loss aversion is an innate and evolutionary
ancient feature of human preference.




                                                          6
a larger reproductive success only temporarily (Ashraf and Galor, 2011; Vollrath, 2011; Dalgaard and

Strulik, 2015). Hence, in view of constraining effects of the subsistence consumption constraint during

the Malthusian epoch, individuals who were characterized by loss aversion would have chosen safe

agricultural practices that would assure their subsistence consumption while minimizing the risk for

catastrophic realizations that would inevitably make their dynasties extinct. In contrast, individuals

who had not assign asymmetric weight to gains and loses may had favored riskier agricultural practices

that were associated with higher expected return and higher risk of extinction.

   In a Malthusian environment characterized by aggregate productivity shocks, individuals who

were engaged in a risky agricultural practices would have eventually affected by catastrophic climatic

realization that would have become extinct. Hence, in an environment characterized by aggregate

productivity shocks the trait of loss aversion, and the associated choice of the safer production mode,

would have been favored by the forces of natural selection and would have dominated the population in

the long run. However, in a Malthusian environment characterized by idiosyncratic shocks, although

the trait of loss aversion would have still maximize the survival probability of each individual, some

dynasties of individuals, who had not assigned asymmetric weight to gains and loses, would have

experienced a long and (and very unlikely) realization of optimal climatic conditions. Hence, these

few loss-neutral dynasties would have generated a significantly higher reproductive success and would

have ultimately dominated the population in the long run.


2.1   The Basic Structure of the Model

Consider an overlapping-generations economy in a Malthusian stage of development. In every time

period the economy is populated by a continuum of two-period lived individuals who are identical

in all respects except for their degree of loss aversion. Loss Aversion is transmitted within each dy-

nasty with alteration. Individuals have access to two production modes. A safe mode that generates

subsistence consumption and a risky one that is associated with a higher consumption in a favorable

climatic state and consumption below subsistence (leading to extinction) in an adverse climatic state.

Individuals allocate their disposable income between consumption and fertility, while facing a subsis-

tence consumption constraint. Thus, in line with the one of the main characteristics of the Malthusian

epoch, richer individuals have higher reproductive success and the effect of loss aversion on the choice

of the production mode affect the composition of loss aversion in society.



                                                   7
2.2      Production

In every time period two production modes are feasible in the economy: a safe mode and a risky mode.

The safe mode of production is associated with hunting, gathering or the cultivation of crops that are

largely insensitive to climatic conditions (e.g., roots and tubers), while the risky mode of production

is associated with the cultivation of crops that generate higher expected yield but are more sensitive

to climatic conditions (e.g., cereal).
                                                                                                 s , is
     The yield generated by individual i of generation t using the the safe mode of production, yit

independent of the climatic conditions and is constant across individuals and generations.


                                                        s
                                                       yit = ȳ,                                                    (1)

where the yield under safe mode of production, ȳ, exceeds the subsistence consumption constraint (i.e.,

ȳ > c̃). In particular, in line with the dominating characteristics of the Malthusian epoch, this yield

permits each individual to satisfy the subsistence consumption constraint and their fertility rates are

at the replacement level. Hence, in the absence of technological progress, if all individual would choose

the safe mode of production, the economy will be in a Malthusian steady-state where consumption is

constant at the subsistence level and population is constant as well.

     In contrast, the yield generated by individual i of generation t using the the risky mode of produc-
       r , depend of the climatic conditions, τ , experienced in the geographical location of individual
tion, yit                                      it

where as depicted in Figure 1, y(τit ) is a symmetric, Strictly concave, hump-shaped function which

attains its maximum at τ ∗ .5 The optimal climatic conditions, τ ∗ , can be viewed as the ones to which

crops have adapted in the long-run and hence deviations from τ ∗ result in a lower yield.

     In particular, an individual i in period t will experience with probability p the optimal climatic

conditions, τ ∗ , whereas with probability (1 − p) the individual will experience either a positive or

negative deviation of magnitude ∆ from the optimal climatic conditions (e.g., sub-optimally low or

around τ ∗ .

Hence, an adverse climatic realization would not permit individual i who is engaged in the risky

production mode to satisfy the subsistence consumption constraint, i.e., y l < c̃. In contrast, a favorable

climatic realization would generate a yield that is higher than the one obtained under the safe mode

of production and would assure consumption above subsistence, i.e., y h > ȳ > c̃. Moreover, while the

high yield realization under the risky mode of production is independent of the of magnitude of the

deviation from the optimal climatic conditions, ∆, the low yield realization is negatively affected by

∆, (i.e., ∂y l /∂∆ < 0.)

    Climatic volatility is spatially correlated across individuals within a generation (while being inde-

pendent over time). In particular, a fraction µ ∈ [0, 1] of individuals experience an identical (aggregate)

realization of the climatic shock based on the distribution specified in (3), whereas a faction 1 − µ

experience idiosyncratic realizations based on the same distribution.6,7


2.3     Individuals

In every period t, a continuum I of two-period lived individuals is born. Individuals are ex-ante

identical in all respects except for their degree of loss aversion with respect to consumption. The

extant of loss aversion is heterogeneous within each generation and is transmitted intergenerationally,

from parent to child, without alteration. The initial distribution of loss aversion across types is uniform

over the existing range of the loss aversion parameter.

    In the first period of their life – childhood – individuals are passive economic agents and they

consume part of their parental resource. In the second period of their life - adulthood – individuals

are active economic agents. Based on their degree of loss aversion, they choose their desirable mode of

production, they produced, and optimally allocate the resulted yield between consumption and child

rearing.

    In light of the association between the degree of loss aversion and the choice of the production mode,

the nature of the climatic shocks (i.e, their degree of spatial correlation) determines individuals’ yield

and hence their reproductive success and consequently contributes to the evolution of loss aversion in

the population.


2.3.1      Preferences, Constraints, and Optimization

Individuals derive utility from consumption and fertility. The preferences of an adult individual i

in period t are represented by a utility function that reflect the asymmetric utility that individuals

attribute to gain and losses in consumption, with respect to a reference consumption level, c̃. In
    6
       This specification assures that the idiosyncratic and the aggregate dimensions of climatic volatility are orthogonal
to one another. Hence, it permits the examination of the impact of: (i) changes in cross-individual correlation of shocks
(i.e., µ), holding the distribution of the shocks from point of view of individual i unchanged; (ii) changes in the climatic
volatility parameter (i.e., ∆), holding the spatial correlation unchanged.
     7
       The structure of shocks in the model is similar the the structure of shocks in Robson (1996)’s theoretical exploration
of the implications of aggregate and idiosyncratic risk for the evolution of expected utility.

where (i) the subsistence consumption constraint, c̃, is the natural reference point of consumption for

each individual i;9 (ii)  > 0 is a positive parameter that is designed to assure that the level of utility

will be bounded from below;10 (iii) 1/θi ∈ [1, ∞) is the coefficient of loss aversion of individual i, where

θi is uniformly distributed across dynasties in period 0 , i.e.,11,12

    Consumption above subsistence, c̃, is considered by the individual to reflect a gain with respect to

the natural reference consumption level, whereas consumption below subsistence, c̃, is considered by

the individual to reflect a loss with respect to this natural reference consumption level. Hence, the

parameter θi ∈ (0; 1] is inversely related to the degree of the individual’s loss aversion with respect to

subsistence consumption. In particular, θi = 1 corresponds to the conventional ‘loss-neutral’ behavior,

while 0 < θi < 1 reflects loss aversion.

    An adult i in period t is subject two two constraints: A budget constraint and a subsistence

consumption constraint. Once the choice of the production mode is made and uncertainty is realized,
    8
     The use of a utility function, with differential level of constant relative risk aversion with respect to consumption
and fertility, would generate similar qualitative results, further highlighting that, as established in the Appendix, the
evolution of loss-aversion is independent of the evolution risk-aversion, and is not governed by the same climatic forces.
In particular, the utility function can take the form:

      The choice of c̃ as the reference point of the utility function is a natural one in light of the asymmetric effects of
climatic shocks on reproductive success around this point. Nevertheless, any reference point in the interval (yl ; ȳ] would
not affect the qualitative analysis.
   10
      This assumption assures that some individuals will be willing to choose the risky mode of production despite that
fact that an adverse climatic realization may bring their dynasty to extinction.
   11
      While the qualitative analysis is unaffected if non-uniform distributions is postulated, this assumption simplifies the
exposition considerably.
   12
      Under this assumption the coefficient of loss aversion, 1/θi , is bounded from below by 1, which corresponds to the
case of Loss Neutrality. Allowing for the presence of loss loving individuals in the initial population (i.e., θi > 1 will not
affect the qualitative predictions.

an adult i in period t allocates the resulting income, yit , between consumption and fertility.



                                                  cit + ρyit nit ≤ yit ,                                              (7)

where ρ > 0 is the time cost of raising a child. Moreover, the individual faces the subsistence con-

sumption constraint, below which individual can survive but is unable to reproduce.13,14



                                                 nit = 0 if cit < c̃.                                                 (8)

    Hence, an adult i in period t allocates the income yit , between consumption, cit , and fertility, nit ,

so as to maximize the utility function ui (cit , nit ).


                                           (cit , nit ) = argmax ui (cit , nit )

                                                  s.t. cit + ρyit nit = yit ;

    Given the properties of the utility function, a solution to the maximization problem exists and is

unique, and given the income realization, it is time independent. In particular, if yit ∈ [0; c̃], individuals

will be able to be engaged in reproduction (i.e., nit = 0) and will therefore consume their entire yield,

yit . However, if yit ∈ [c̃, y h ] then assuming that y h ≤ c̃/[(1 − γ)(1 + ρ)], the subsistence consumption

constraints binds and individuals will consume the subsistence consumption, c̃, and hence given their

budget constraint will devote the reaming income to raise (yit − c̃)/(ρyit ) children.15

       Alternatively, one can assume that if consumption is below subsistence, individuals do not survive and thus do not
reproduce. Similar structure of the relationship between subsistence consumption and fertility is used by Baudin et al.
(2015).
    14
       Differential subsistence levels for each production mode, based on the energy requirement associated with them,
would have no qualitative impact as long as the basic logical structure of the two production modes is maintained
(i.e., subsistence level associated with the safe mode does not exceed to the safe mode’s output (i.e., c̃s ≤ ȳ), and the
subsistence for the risky mode is between high and low realizations of risky production (i.e., yl < c̃r < yh ).)
    15
       As established empirically, this is a plausible assumption in the context of the Malthusian epoch.

    In particular, as follows from (9), individuals who are engaged in the safe mode of production

and generate an ȳ > c̃ would find it optimal to consume the subsistence level of consumption, and as

postulated earlier, would have precisely one child. Namely, the safe yield ȳ is assumed to be such that

ȳ = c̃/(1 − ρ), permitting fertility at the replacement level (i.e., n(ȳ) = (ȳ − c̃)/(ρȳ) = 1).16

    Accordingly, the fertility rate of individuals who are engaged in the risky mode of production and

obtain a favorable climatic realization that result in a level of income of y h > ȳ will be therefore above

replacement (i.e., n(y h ) = (y h − c̃)/(ρy h ) > 1).

    Consumption and the fertility are therefore a function of the individual’s income (i.e., cit = c(yit )

and nit = n(yit )), and hence conditional on the income realization, the consumption and the fertility

functions are identical across individuals and time.

    The indirect utility function of an adult i in period t, Vit , is therefore



                                            vit = ui (c(yit ), n(yit )) ≡ vi (yit ).                                    (12)


2.3.2      Choice of Production Mode

Individuals chose their desirable mode of production prior to the realization of the climatic conditions.

Their choice is designed to maximize their expected utility, conditional on the expected probability

distribution of the climatic shocks, and it may differ across individuals based on their degree of loss

aversion.

    As follows from (4),(5),(9), and (10),The expected utility urit , generated by adult i in period t who

                                                     usit = γ ln(1 + ) ≡ us .                                  (15)

Hence, the utility generated by individuals who choose the safe production mode is constant across

types and time.

    Assuming that the risky production mode is sufficient attractive so as to assure that at least loss-

neutral individuals prefers this mode of production (i.e., ur (1) > us ),17 then it follows from (14) and

(15) and the Intermediate Value Theorem that there exists a unique and time invariant level of the

parameter of loss neutrality, θ̂ ∈ (0; 1), such that ur (θ̂) = us .

    Hence, the relatively more loss averse individuals in society (i.e., i ∈ I A ≡ {i ∈ I|θi ∈ (0; θ̂])

would choose the safe mode of production, whereas the least loss averse individuals in society (i.e.,

i ∈ I B ≡ {i ∈ I|θi ∈ (θ̂; 1]} would choose the risky production mode. Hence, as depicted in Figure

2, since the initial distribution of θi is uniform, the sorting of individuals into the risky and the safe

modes of production will result in an average degree of loss neutrality of θ̂/2 among individuals who

selected the safe mode of production and an average degree of loss neutrality of (1 + θ̂)/2 among

individuals who selected the risky mode of production.

                      Figure 2: Sorting into the Safe and the Risky Production Modes

The figure depicts: (i) the Sorting into the safe and the risky production modes, based on the degree of loss-neutrality,
   θi ; (ii) the average degree of loss-neutrality is θ̂/2 among individuals who choose the safe mode production and
                                    (1 + θ̂)/2, among those who choose the risky mode.


    Furthermore, the cut-off level θ̂ is positively affected by the magnitude of the shocks ∆, (i.e.,

θ̂0 (∆) > 0).18 Namely, since the risky mode of production is less profitable in a more volatile envi-

ronment, the level of risk-neutrality that would make individual indifferent between the two modes of

production will be higher in a more volatile environment.
                                                                                                                      0
    Hence, as depicted in Figure 3, if the degree of climatic volatility increases from ∆ to ∆ , the

critical level of θ will increase from θ̂ to θˆ0 and the average degree of loss neutrality will increase

among the two groups: from θ̂/2 to θˆ0 /2 among individuals who choose the safe mode of production,

and from (1 + θ̂)/2 to (1 + θˆ0 )/2 among individuals who choose the risky mode of production.
   18
      Note that the effect of climatic volatility ∆ on the cut-off level of loss neutrality θ̂ is orthogonal to the degree of
spatial correlation in these shocks, µ, and therefore the idiosyncratic and aggregate component of climatic volatility have
an independent effect on long-run level of loss-aversion in population.

2.4    The Evolution of the Composition of Loss Aversion

The evolution of the composition of loss aversion is governed by the effect of loss aversion on the

differential reproductive success across individual. Since loss aversion is assumed to be transmitted

intergenerationally within each dynasty i without any alteration, if a greater propensity towards loss

aversion is associated with higher income, and thus higher reproductive success, then loss aversion will

become more prevalent in the population in the long-run.

    As established in (16), the threshold level of the parameter of loss aversion, θ̂, below which in-

dividuals are engaged in the safe production mode is constant and is time invariant. Moreover, as

established in (31), individuals whose θi ≤ θ̂ (i.e., members of group A) have identical fertility rate

(i.e., nit = 1 if θi ≤ θ̂), while the fertility rates of individuals whose θi > θ̂, (i.e., members of group

B) is identically distributed based upon the expression in I (20) and (21). Hence, the distribution of

loss aversion within each of the two groups has no effect on the aggregate fertility within each of the

groups.

    Nevertheless, differential fertility rates across the two groups affect the relative sizes of the two

groups, their representation of in the population, and thus the evolution of distribution of loss aversion

in the population as a whole.

    The total population in the economy in period t. Nt is decomposed into members of group A, NtA ,




                                                             17
and member of group B, NtA , i.e.,



                                                           NtA + NtB = Nt .                                                  (22)

   Hence, since that the initial distribution of types i is uniform over the entire feasible domain of θi ,

(i.e., since θi ∼ U (0, 1]), it follows that


                                                           N0A = θ̂N0 ;
                                                                                                                             (23)
                                                           N0B    = (1 − θ̂)N0 .

   Moreover, since this distribution remains intact over time due to the stationarity of θ̂, the evolution

of the size population of group A from period t − 1 to period t, is governed by the difference equation

                                                           "Z                        #
                                               NtA   =                                  A
                                                                                nit di Nt−1 .                                (24)
                                                             i∈{i|θi ≤θ̂}

Hence, as follows from (19), nit = 1, and the size of the population of group A in period t, noting (23),

   Similarly, the evolution of the size of the population of group B from period t − 1 to period t, is

governed by the difference equation

    The share of the less loss averse individuals in the population who choose the risky mode of

where as follows (25) and (27), ∂βt /∂∆ < 0.

    Given the uniform distribution of loss aversion in the population in time 0, and since this distri-

bution remains intact over time due to the stationarity of θ̂, , the average level of loss aversion in the

population in period t, θ̄t , is


                             θ̄t = βt E(θ|θ ∈ (θ̂; 1]) + (1 − βt )E(θ|θ ∈ (0; θ̂])
                                                                                                     (29)

where as follows from (28), ∂ θ̄t /∂∆ is ambiguous.

    The asymptotic share of the less loss averse individuals in the population who choose the risky

mode of production (i.e., limt→∞ βt ,) is determined by the relative long run reproductive success and

therefore by the asymptotic rate of population growth, nj , of each of group. Since Ntj = (nj )t N0j , if

population growth is constant at a rate nj ,


                                                       1
                                            n̄j = lim    logNtj ;   j = A, B,                        (30)
                                                   t→∞ t


Hence, as follows from (25), the asymptotic rate of population growth of the more loss averse group,

A, is



                                                         n̄A = 0.                                    (31)

reflecting the fact that population of this group is constant overtime.

    Similarly, the asymptotic rate of population growth of the less loss averse group, B, as follows from

(27), is

   Since n̄B (0) > n̄A = 0, as follows from the assumption that the mean return in the risky mode of

production is higher that in the safe mode of production (i.e., ur (1) > us ), it follows from (34) and

from the Intermediate Value Theorem, that there exists a unique µ̂ ∈ (0; 1) such that


                                     n̄B (µ) > n̄A = 0      f or µ < µ̂;

   In particular, as depicted in Figure 4, as long as the degree of correlation in the shocks is relatively

small (i.e., µ < µ̂), the share of relatively loss-neutral individuals (i.e., those who choose the risky mode

of production) in the population increases (panel a), reaching asymptotically a complete domination

(panel b). Moreover, since reproduction success within this group is independent of the degree of

loss-aversion, the average level of loss-neutrality in this group is not changing over time, remaining

constant at its initial level, (1 + θ̂)/2, and thus the asymptotic average level of loss-neutrality in

the population, θ̄, is just the average loss-neutrality among individuals who choose the risky mode

production, (1 + θ̂)/2.

    Moreover, as depicted in Figure 3, if the degree of climatic volatility increases from ∆ to ∆ , the

critical level of θ will increase from θ̂ to θˆ0 and the average degree of loss neutrality will increase among

the two groups: from θ̂/2 to θˆ0 /2 among individuals who choose the safe mode of production, and from

(1 + θ̂)/2 to (1 + θˆ0 )/2 among individuals who choose the risky mode of production. Hence, regardless

of the degree of correlation in the shocks, volatility will increase the degree of loss-neutrality in the

long-run. In particular, as depicted in Figure 6 (a) if the the degree of correlation in the shocks is

relatively small (i.e., µ < µ̂), the dominating type in the long-run are individuals who are engaged

in the risky mode of production and volatility will increase the average degree of loss-neutrality from

from (1 + θ̂)/2 to (1 + θˆ0 )/2 (panel a), whereas if the the degree of correlation in the shocks is relatively

large (i.e., µ > µ̂), the dominating type in the long-run are individuals who are engaged in the safe

mode of production, and yet again, volatility will increase the average degree of loss-neutrality from

θ̂/2 to θˆ0 /2 (panel b).


2.5     Testable Implications

In order to derive the testable implication of the theoretical model, suppose that each geographical

region, r, is populated by a continuum of groups of individuals. Suppose further that the spatial auto

correlations in climatic shocks differ across these groups and their geographical locations and is char-

acterized by a non-trivial distribution µr with cumulative distribution function Fµr (µ). In particular,

an increase in µ by dµ corresponds to the uniform shift of the entire distribution to the right, resulting

in a new distribution µ0r ≡ µr + dµ with a cumulative distribution function Fµ0r (µ) = Fµr (µ − dµ).

   The average θ̄ in the region r is therefore

                                           θ̂                     1 + θ̂                Fµ (µ̂ − dµ) + θ̂

where as follows from the fact that Fµr (µ) is non-decreasing, ∂ θ̄r /∂dµ ≤ 0.

   Hence, as follows from (38), (39), the testable predictions of the model are:

Proposition 2.1. If the economy is characterized by:

(i) a higher spatial correlation of climatic shocks, µ, the average level of loss aversion that will be

observed in the economy in the long run, [1/θ̄], will be higher.

(ii) a higher volatility of climatic shocks, ∆, the average level of loss aversion that will be observed in

the economy in the long run, [1/θ̄], will be lower.

   Thus, the theory suggests that individuals and societies that are originated in regions of the world

in which climatic shocks tended to be spatially correlated, and thus aggregate in nature, would be

characterized by greater intensity of loss aversion, while descendants of regions that were characterized

by idiosyncratic climatic shocks will tend to be more loss-neutral and to assign more symmetric weights

                                                                23
to gains and loses.


2.6   Interpretations of the Predictions of the Model

Consider a continuum of individuals that are positioned on the edge of an evolutionary cliff (i.e., a

subsistence consumption constraint). Suppose that these individuals span that entire spectrum of loss

aversion – from loss-neutrality to an infinite level of loss-aversion. Individuals who are sufficiently

loss-averse, would choose the safe mode of production in order to avert the likelihood of dropping from

the evolutionary cliff and the subsequent extinction of their dynasty. Their choice of the safe mode

of production would assure each of these individuals the subsistence level of consumption as well as

one surviving offspring. Hence each of these dynasties would survive indefinitely although the size of

group as a whole remain constant over time.

   In contrast, a continuum of (sufficiently) loss-neutral individuals, who are less concern about

dropping from the evolutionary cliff, and the subsequent extinction of their dynasty, would choose the

risky mode of production. As long as those individuals would experience independent (idiosyncratic)

climatic shocks, while a fraction 1-P of the group would become extinct in the initial period, with

probability one, a portion of the remaining fraction would experience a sufficiently long sequence

of mostly positive realizations that would permit each individual in the group to have more than

one surviving, and the asymptotic growth of their dynasty. Hence, the surviving dynasties among

these initial group of relatively loss-neutral individuals will increase in size over time, and in light

of lower (i.e., zero) growth rate of the loss-averse group, will dominate the population in the long-

run. Nevertheless, if the individuals would experience highly correlated shocks, the likelihood of a

sufficiently long sequence of realization is negligible and the dynasties of those relatively loss-neutral

individuals would drop from the evolutionary cliff and would become extinct in the long-run.

   Thus, as long as the climatic shocks are predominantly idiosyncratic, while the prudent strategy

of the safe mode of production would assure the survival of the dynasty and may appear optimal

from an individual viewpoint, nature will ultimately select the relatively loss-neutral individuals –

A significant fraction of the loss-neutral individuals would become extinct in the short run, but the

surviving fraction would experience higher reproductive success and would dominate the population

in the long-run.

2.7     Absence of Evolutionary Process if the Subsistence Constraint is not Binding

This subsection establishes that the presence of a reference point associated with a subsistence con-

sumption constraint is an essential feature for the evolution of loss aversion in the process of develop-

ment.

    If the subsistence consumption constraint is absent, or the level of income per capita in the economy

is large enough such that the constraint does not binding (e.g., y ≥ c̃/[(1 − γ)(1 + ρ)]), the optimal

level of consumption and fertility will be


                                          cit = (1 − γ)yit ≡ c(yit )
                                                                                                        (40)
                                          nit = γ/ρ ≡ n(yit )

    In particular, the fraction of time dedicated to childrearing is a constant, γ, independent of the

level of income, whereas a fraction 1 − γ of income is devoted to consumption. Hence, while variation

in income driven by the differential choices of the production modes would affect consumption, they

would have no effect on fertility and thus on reproductive success. The composition of loss aversion

will therefore remain intact overtime.



3     Empirical Strategy and Data

This section presents the empirical strategy developed to analyze the effect of the idiosyncratic and

aggregate components of temperature shocks on contemporary variations in the rate of loss aversion.

Moreover, it describes the global measures of temperature intertemporal volatility and spatial correla-

tion that are designed to capture the idiosyncratic and aggregate components of temperature shocks,

as well as a range of proxies for loss aversion, at the individual and ethnic group level.


3.1     Identification Strategy

The empirical analysis surmounts significant hurdles in the identification of the causal effect of climatic

conditions of the evolution of loss aversion. In particular, the research adopts an empirical strategy

that is designed to mitigate concerns about the potential role of reverse causality, as well as omitted

variables, in the observed association between climatic characteristics and loss aversion.

    First, since unlike soil characteristics, climatic characteristics are largely orthogonal to individuals’



                                                     25
preferences and thus choices, the focus on climatic (rather than soil) characteristics assures that the

association between climatic characteristics and loss aversion is not driven by reversed causality in the

identification. In particular, historical temperature patterns, for the most part, are determined by the

regional geographical conditions and are orthogonal to human interventions.

   Second, potential concerns about the role of omitted geographical, institutional, cultural, and hu-

man characteristics in the observed association between intertemporal climatic volatility and climatic

spatial correlation and loss aversion are mitigated by accounting for a large set of confounding char-

acteristics that might have determined loss aversion and are correlated with temperature volatility

and temperature spatial correlation. In particular the analysis accounts for: potentially confounding

effects of: geographical characteristics (e.g., absolute latitude, mean elevation, the level and diver-

sity of the stability of land for agriculture, distance to coast or navigable river, percentage of land

in the tropical, subtropical and temperate zones, level of precipitation, and landlocked societies), as

well as the time elapsed since of the neolithic revolution; (ii) regional fixed effects, capturing un-

observed time-invariant heterogeneity at the regional level; (iii) host country fixed effects, and thus

time-invariant country-of-birth specific factors, (e.g., geography, institutions, history, and culture);

for second-generation migrants; (iv) individual characteristics (e.g., age, gender, number of siblings,

religion, education level and income); (v) ethnographic characteristics (e.g., intensity of agriculture

and animal husbandry, settlement structure and plow use) characteristics.

   Third, the adoption of the epidemiological approach and the exploration of the determinants loss

aversion among second-generation migrants, permits the analysis to overcome two major concerns:

(i) it distinguishes between the effect of temperature volatility and spatial correlation in the parental

country of origin (rather than those in country of residence) on loss aversion, capturing the culturally-

embodied, intergenerationally-transmitted component of the effect of geography, rather than the direct

effect of geography; (ii) it accounts for time invariant unobserved heterogeneity in the host country

(e.g., geographical, cultural and institutional characteristics), and thus mitigating possible concerns

about the confounding effect of host country-specific characteristics.

   Fourth, the natural experiment associated with the Columbian Exchange introduces the opportu-

nity to exploit differential assignment of crops to indigenous populations across the globe and resulting

exogenous variation in the degree of crop-specific effective volatility, which makes it possible to shed

light on the contribution of the forces of cultural evolution to the origins of loss aversion, as opposed



                                                   26
to the sorting of more loss averse individuals into the less climatically volatile environments, mitigate

concerns about the confounding effects of unobservables geographical factors in the parental county of

origin and demonstrates the importance of evolutionary processes in the pre-1500 and the post-1500

period.

   Finally, the analysis explores variation in the rate of loss aversion across ethnic groups, and thus

captures the evolution of loss aversion in the precolonial era, establishes that some of the hypothesized

evolutionary process was completed in the past.


3.2   Dependent Variable: Proxies for Loss Aversion

Adequately capturing variation in the rate of loss aversion in itself poses a significant challenge due to

the absence of well-established convention over its proxies in the corresponding literature. To overcome

this problem novel measures of loss aversion at an individual and ethnic group levels, are introduced.

   Variations in the prevalence and the distribution of loss-aversion across individuals is captured

by a variety of newly introduced measures of the intensity of loss aversion. Exploiting the ESS,

GSS and the WVS, the degree of loss aversion is captured by individual’s ranking of potential job

characteristics. In particular, preference for job security over other characteristics such as salary and

promotion opportunities are used as a proxy for loss-aversion. Importantly, since conceivably a layoff

is typically only a transitory phenomenon, preferences for job security over higher salary does not

simply represents the trade-off between potential gains and loss of income, and thus risk aversion, but

rather the reluctance of individuals to lose something that is in their possession, and thus loss aversion.

Alternatively, If one views a job as a ‘gamble’ with ‘being employed’ as a reference point, the state

‘being fired’ would then represent a down-side of this gamble. From this point of view, preference for

job security over other characteristics or over salary would capture individual’s rate of loss aversion,

as it represents ones reluctance towards getting the down-side or ‘loosing’ the gamble.

   The global distribution of the proxy for loss aversion based on the WVS is depicted in Figure 7,

reflecting a lower degree of loss aversion in most countries in the upper part of Northern hemisphere

as well as among the decedents of these regions in the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. In

contrast, higher degree of loss aversion can be detected in Southern Europe and the decedents of these

regions in Latin America, as well as in Africa and South Asia.

   Proxies for the rate of loss aversion at an ethnic group level are constructed using several ethno-



                                                    27
            Figure 7: The Global Distribution of Loss Aversion as captured by the WVS


graphic characteristics, which supposedly capture revealed preference for cautiousness and are asso-

ciated with loss averse behavior. Differences in the prevalence and the distribution of loss-aversion

across ethnic groups are captured by two ethnographic characteristics reported by the EA and the

SCCS. In particular, loss aversion is captured by parental preferences for sleeping in closed proximity

to their infants; an overly cautious behavior driven by the fear of losing a child during his sleep,

despite the low probability that is associated with this event. Alternatively, loss aversion is captured

by the prevailing types of games played by members of an ethnic group. In particular, loss-aversion

among members of the ethnic group, is captured by the prevalence of games that are predominantly

strategy-based, rather than those governed by chance. The presence of a chance as the major element

in games is associated with a lower rate of cautiousness and thus loss neutral population, while strategy

based games would be more common among groups with more cautions and loss averse population.

In addition, the degree of diversification across productive activities is used to capture manifestation

of loss aversion in human behavior. Prevalence of high diversification of activities, as a strategy of

mitigating affects of adverse shocks, is a a consequence of higher degree of loss aversion among the



                                                   28
members of ethnic group. Alternatively, loss aversion could postulate itself through the choice of a

major crop for cultivation. In particular, the choice of roots or tubers, as opposed to cereals, would be

an indicator of a higher degree of loss aversion on an ethnic level, due to the greater relative resistance

of roots and tubers to the adverse effects of climatic shocks.


3.3    Independent Variable: Idiosyncratic and Aggregate Climatic Uncertainty

This section describes the measures the will be used to capture the impact of the idiosyncratic and

aggregate components of climatic shocks on loss aversion. In light of the predictions of the theory, the

prevalence of loss aversion is linked to intertemporal climatic volatility as well as special correlation in

climatic conditions. A-priori one could have captured these climatic characteristics using either tem-

perature or precipitation. However, as established in Table A1, while productivity in the Malthusian

era is significantly correlated with various characteristics of temperature, it is orthogonal to the cor-

responding measures of precipitation. Thus the proposed hypothesis is examined based on the impact

of measures of intertemporal temperature volatility, as well as spatial correlation in temperature on

the intensity of loss aversion.

    As noted in the empirical strategy section, measures of intertemporal temperature volatility and

temperature spatial correlation capture the distinction between the aggregate and the idiosyncratic

nature of the shocks. Indeed, stronger temperature spatial correlation reflects a higher likelihood that

neighboring regions would obtain similar realizations of temperature shock , capturing the aggregate

nature of the shocks. Similarly, keeping the temperature spatial correlation constant, the level of

temperature volatility corresponds to the variability of temperature shocks at a local level, capturing

the idiosyncratic component of the shock.

    Hence, following the methodology of Durante (2009), these measures are constructed based on

the monthly temperatures over the period 1900-2000, using the 0.5◦ × 0.5◦ resolution of the Climatic

Research Unit (CRU).19 In particular, intertemporal temperature volatility over the period 1900-

2000 is the average volatility in each month over this 100 year period, where the monthly volatility

is captured the variance in monthly temperature over this 100 year period. Similarly, temperature

spatial correlation is the correlation between the sequences of 1200 monthly temperature in a given
   19
      Potential concerns about changes in climate over the course of human history that is relevant for the evolution of
loss aversion, appears are largely misplaced. As reported in Table A10, climatic volatility and spatial correlation over
the past 100 year period are highly correlated with the corresponding climatic characteristics in the past 1500 years.




                                                          29
cell over the year 1900-2000, and the average of those sequences in its eight neighboring cells. Each of

these measures is first calculated at the grid cell level and then aggregated at the country and ethnic

group levels.

   The global distribution of these two climatic measures is depicted in Figures 8 and 9. The figure

suggests that higher intertemporal temperature volatility is observed in the upper part of the Northern

hemisphere and a lower one closer to the equator. Indeed, in line with the proposed theory of a negative

effect of climatic volatility on loss aversion, accounting for the post-1500 migration to the new world

as well as to Australia and New Zealand, individuals originated from the most volatile regions of

the world tend to be less loss averse (as depicted in Figure 7). Furthermore, consistent with the

proposed theory of a positive effect of temperature spatial correlation on loss aversion, indeed higher

intertemporal temperature volatility tends to be lower in the upper part of the northern hemisphere

where loss aversion is lower, and lower in proximity to the equator where loss aversion is higher.




                Figure 8: The Global Distribution of Intertemporal Temperature Volatility


   An alternative measure of temperature intertemporal volatility is employed in the analysis to

capture the effect of historical climatic shocks on the evolution of loss aversion. The measure of

historical temperature volatility is calculated using the paleoclimatic data reconstructed in Mann


                                                   30
                Figure 9: The Global Distribution of Temperature Spatial Correlation


et al. (2009) on a 5◦ × 5◦ resolution for a 1500-year period spanning from 500 to 2000. The measure

is constructed as volatility of annual temperature anomalies for each grid cell over the whole available

period, as well as for historical subsample of years between 500 and 1000. The measure is aggregated

from a grid-level to a level of country.

   To exploit the implications of the natural experiment associated with the Columbian Exchange

for the evolution of loss aversion a novel measure of an effective potential volatility is introduced. In

particular, for each type of crop, effective temperature volatility is calculated as an average of monthly

volatilities across four month prior to the beginning of crop-specific growth cycle – volatility during

the period when food scarcity is at its peak and climatic shocks may be particularly detrimental to the

effectiveness of storage of crops, productivity of the upcoming harvest and the hunting and gathering

of supplementary food sources. In addition, for each of the 0.5◦ × 0.5◦ grid cells corresponding to CRU

dataset the potential yield maximizing crop is identified for a period prior to 1500 (e.g., crops native

to the region) and for the period following the Columbian Exchange (e.g., any crop of the world) in a

manner similar to Galor and Özak (2016). Effective potential volatility prior and after the Columbian

Exchange is then identified as an effective crop-specific volatility for these crops. Hence, the change



                                                   31
in the degree of effective potential volatility due to the Columbian Exchange would be observed in a

case when a potentially superior crop was introduced to a particular grid cell and a growth cycle of

the new crop was different from the one corresponding to a previously yield-maximizing crop. The

variation in the change of effective potential volatility is ultimately used to identify the effect of a

“random assignment” of effective potential volatility on the evolution of loss aversion.

    As elaborated above, an alternative climatic dimension that could have been used to capture the

idiosyncratic and the aggregate components of climatic shocks is precipitation. However, shocks to

precipitation, unlike shocks to temperature appears orthogonal to productivity in the pre-industrial

era and are therefore tangential to the evolution of loss aversion. In particular, as established in Table

1, a cross-country analysis suggests that neither the mean level of precipitation nor precipitation

volatility have a statistically significant association with population density and urbanization level

in the year 1500, and thus in light of the Malthusian paradigm (Ashraf and Galor, 2011), have no

significant association with the level of technology and productivity in the year 1500. In contrast, the

level of temperature volatility has a strong statistically and economically significant effect on both

measures. Moreover, the qualitative results remains intact, if one accounts for the confounding effects

of additional geographical characteristics (e.g., absolute latitude, mean elevation, percentage of arable

land, mean land suitability, island and landlocked dummy, and distance to coast or river), the timing

of the neolithic revolution, and regional fixed effects. These results may reflect that view that while the

adverse effect of precipitation shocks can be potentially mitigated by irrigation and drainage systems,

the the adverse effects of temperature shock are harder to be mitigated by human intervention.



4    Empirical Analysis: Second Generation Migrants

This section analyzes the effect of intertemporal temperature volatility and temperature spatial cor-

relation on the second-generation migrants’ preferences of job security versus salary and other charac-

teristics in Europe and the United States. In particular, it analyses the effect of temperature volatility

and correlation on preferences of jobs security versus salary as reported in the European Social Sur-

vey (ESS), and on preferences of jobs security versus salary and other characteristics (short working

hours, promotion opportunities and job satisfaction) as reported in the General Social Survey (GSS).

The analysis of second-generation migrants accounts for time invariant unobserved heterogeneity in

the host country (e.g., geographical and institutional characteristics). Moreover, since temperature

4.1      Determinants of Loss Aversion among Second Generation Migrants in Europe

This subsection analyzes the effect of intertemporal temperature volatility and temperature spatial

correlation on the second-generation migrants’ preferences of job security versus salary in Europe, in

light of the conjectured positive association between loss aversion and preference for job security over

salary. The effect of temperature volatility and correlation on preferences of job security versus salary

is estimated via ordinary least squares (OLS) using the empirical model (41).

   Table 2 establishes the negative statistically and economically significant effect of temperature

volatility and positive significant effect of temperature spatial correlation on preferences of job secu-

rity versus salary as suggested by the theory. The estimated effect implies that increasing temperature

volatility in the parental country of origin by one standard deviation decreases the difference between

second-generation migrant’s valuation of job security and salary between 0.16 and 0.24 units20 , while

increasing temperature spatial correlation in the parental country of origin by one standard devia-

tion increases the difference between second-generation migrant’s valuation of job security and salary

between 0.034 and 0.059 units.
  20
       Each characteristic is evaluated by the scale from 1 to 5, so that their difference takes values from −4 to 4.

   The relationship between intertemporal temperature volatility and temperature spatial correlation

and preferences of job security versus salary, accounting for country of birth fixed effects, and therefore

for unobserved time-invariant omitted variables at the country of birth level, are established in column

(1). The estimated effect of temperature volatility is negative and statistically significant at the 1%

level, while estimated effect of temperature spatial correlation is positive and statistically significant

at the 10% level, implying economically significant effects suggested by the theory.

     Notes: Using OLS regressions, this table establishes that the preferred job characteristics of second generation migrants
     reflect loss aversion. In particular, their valuation of job security vs. salary is negatively affected by temperature
     volatility (idiosyncratic risk) and positively affected by temperature spatial correlation (aggregate uncertainty) in the
     parental country of origin. Additional geographical controls are gini index of land suitability , distance to coast or
     river, landlocked dummy, percentage of land in the tropical, subtropical and temperate zones and precipitation level.
     Individual controls include age, gender, number of siblings, religion, education level, and income. Sample excludes
     small island countries. All independent variables have been normalized by subtracting their mean and dividing by
     their standard deviation. Thus, all coefficients can be compared and show the effect of a one standard deviation in the
     independent variable. Heteroskedasticity robust standard error estimates clustered at the parental country of origin
     level are reported in parentheses; *** denotes statistical significance at the 1% level, ** at the 5% level, and * at the
     10% level, all for two-sided hypothesis tests.

                                                               35
raphy and country of birth heterogeneity strengthens estimated effects of temperature volatility and

spatial correlation on preferences of job security versus salary both in terms of absolute values and

significances. In particular, estimated effect of temperature spatial correlation becomes statistically

significant at the 5% level. Column (3) accounts for the whole set of confounding geographical char-

acteristics of the country of origins, which, apart from absolute latitude and mean elevation, includes

mean level and the gini index of land suitability, distance to coast or navigable river, landlocked

dummy, percentage of land in the tropical, subtropical and temperate zones and precipitation level.

Reassuringly, coefficient on temperature volatility remains statistically significant at the 1% level,

while coefficient on temperature spatial correlation becomes statistically significant at the 1% level as

well. The effects of other confounding geographical characteristics are less significant than the effects

of temperature volatility and correlation. In particular, most geographical characteristics have no

significant effect on preferences of job security versus salary.

   Column (4) considers the confounding effect of the advent of sedentary agriculture, as captured

by the years elapsed since the onset of the Neolithic Revolution, on the evolution of the loss aversion.

The effects of temperature volatility and spatial correlation remain statistically significant at the 1%

level. Additionally, the effect of the timing of transition to the Neolithic has no significant effect on

preferences of job security versus salary.

   Columns (5) and (6) sequentially account for the survey round fixed effects and second-generation

migrant’s individual characteristics (i.e., age, gender, number of siblings, religion, education level, and

income). The estimated effects of temperature volatility and spatial correlation on preferences of job

security versus salary continue to be statistically significant at the 1% level. It should be noted that

the coefficients on temperature volatility and spatial correlation are remarkably stable in terms of

absolute values across all specifications, especially in columns (2) – (6).


4.1.1   Loss Aversion vs. Risk Aversion

This subsection establishes that intertemporal temperature volatility and temperature spatial corre-

lation are not associated with the attitude toward risk aversion. Furthermore, While risk seeking, as

one would expect is associated with a reduced preference for job security, accounting for risk aver-

sion has no impact on the effect of climatic on loss aversion. Hence, the observed effects of climatic

characteristics on loss aversion operate directly, rather than through their influence on risk aversion.

 Notes: Using OLS regressions, columns (1) through (6) of the table establish that second generation migrants’ valuation of Adventure
 and Risk Seeking is neither affected by temperature volatility (idiosyncratic risk), nor by temperature spatial correlation (aggregate
 uncertainty) in the parental country of origin. Columns (7) and (8) establish that second generation migrants’ valuation of job
 security vs. salary is negatively affected by the degree of risk seeking and is still negatively affected by temperature volatility
 (idiosyncratic risk) and positively affected by temperature spatial correlation (aggregate uncertainty) in the parental country of
 origin.. Additional geographical controls are the gini index of land suitability, distance to coast or river, landlocked dummy,
 percentage of land in the tropical, subtropical and temperate zones and precipitation level. Individual controls include age, gender,
 number of siblings, religion, education level, and income. Sample excludes small island countries. All independent variables have
 been normalized by subtracting their mean and dividing by their standard deviation. Thus, all coefficients can be compared and
 show the effect of a one standard deviation in the independent variable. Heteroskedasticity robust standard error estimates clustered
 at the parental country of origin level are reported in parentheses; *** denotes statistical significance at the 1% level, ** at the 5%
 level, and * at the 10% level, all for two-sided hypothesis tests.



    As established in columns (1) – (6) of Table 3, individuals’ preference for adventure and risk

seeking are not significantly associated with intertemporal temperature volatility and temperature

spatial correlation.21 Moreover, as demonstrated in columns (7) and (8), the effect of intertemporal

                                                                 37
migrants in Europe for job security over salary, as estimated in Table 2, is unaffected by the highly

significant positive association between the rates of risk aversion and the rate of loss aversion, lending

credence to the hypothesis of that geographical origins of loss aversion are distinct from those of risk

aversion.


4.2    Determinants of Loss Aversion among Second Generation Migrants in the US

This subsection examines the effect of intertemporal temperature volatility and temperature spatial

correlation on the second-generation migrants’ preferences of job security versus salary and other

job characteristics in the US, in light of the conjectured positive association between loss aversion

and preference for job security over salary and other characteristics (short working hours, promotion

opportunities and job satisfaction). The effect of temperature volatility and correlation on preferences

of job security versus salary and other job characteristics is estimated via ordinary least squares (OLS)

using the model analogous to model (41).

    Table 4 establishes a negative statistically and economically significant effect of temperature volatil-

ity and positive significant effect of temperature spatial correlation on second-generation migrants’

preferences of job security versus salary and other characteristics. In particular, Columns (1) through

(5) establish the effect of temperature volatility and spatial correlation on preferences for job secu-

rity over all other characteristics22 , sequentially accounting for the confounding effects of unobserved

time-invariant omitted variables at the region of birth level, other geographical characteristics (mean

temperature, absolute latitude, mean elevation, mean level and the gini index of land suitability, dis-

tance to coast or river, landlocked dummy, percentage of land in the tropical, subtropical and temperate

zones and precipitation level), the advent of sedentary agriculture, as captured by the years elapsed

since the onset of the Neolithic Revolution, survey wave fixed effects and individual characteristics

of second generation migrant (age, gender, number of siblings, religion, education level, and income).

The estimated effects imply that increasing temperature volatility in the parental country of origin by

one standard deviation decreases the probability of job security having a higher ranking between 18

and 42 percentage points, while increasing temperature spatial correlation by one standard deviation

increases the probability of job security having a higher ranking between 13 and 17 percentage points.
   22
      The preferences for job security versus other characteristics are measured as the rank assigned to the job security
by the second-generation migrant based on the answers to the questions “. . . which one thing on this list (security, salary,
short working hours, promotion opportunities and job satisfaction) you would most/second most/. . . prefer in a job?”

 Notes: Using OLS regression, this table establishes that the preferred job characteristics of second generation migrants reflect loss
 aversion. In particular, their valuation of job security vs other characteristics (salary, short working hours, promotion opportunities
 and job satisfaction) and of job security vs. salary is negatively affected by temperature volatility (idiosyncratic risk) and positively
 affected by temperature spatial correlation (aggregate uncertainty) in the parental country of origin. Additional geographical
 controls are the gini index of land suitability , distance to coast or river, landlocked dummy, percentage of land in the tropical,
 subtropical and temperate zones and precipitation level. Individual controls include age, gender, number of siblings, religion,
 education level, and income. Sample excludes small island countries. All independent variables have been normalized by subtracting
 their mean and dividing by their standard deviation. Thus, all coefficients can be compared and show the effect of a one standard
 deviation in the independent variable. Heteroskedasticity robust standard error estimates clustered at the parental country of origin
 level are reported in parentheses; *** denotes statistical significance at the 1% level, ** at the 5% level, and * at the 10% level, all
 for two-sided hypothesis tests.



It should be noted that coefficients on the temperature volatility and spatial correlation are rather

stable across specifications and statistically significant at the 1% level in two final specifications.

    Columns (6) and (7) replicate columns (4) and (5) with preference for job security over salary23

being the explained variable. Estimated effects of temperature volatility and spatial correlation are

statistically significant at the 1% level and imply that increasing intertemporal temperature volatility

in the parental country of origin by one standard deviation decreases the difference in ranks of job
   23
      Preferences of job security versus salary are measured as the difference between the rankings of the two character-
istics, ranging from -4 to 4.



                                                                   39
security and salary between 0.52 and 0.62 units, while increasing temperature spatial correlation by one

standard deviation increases the difference in ranks of job security and salary between 0.24 and 0.28

units. Reassuringly, confounding geographical characteristics of parental country of origin are less

significant than the effects of temperature volatility and spatial correlation across all specifications

and explained variables. In particular, most geographical characteristics have no significant effect on

preferences of job security versus salary.


4.3     Robustness

4.3.1    Alternative Estimation Method: Ordered Probit

The results are robust to the use of an alternative estimation method, rather than OLS. In particular,

using Ordered Probit, one can estimates the probability of observing each rank of preference for

Job Security, conditional on intertemporal temperature volatility (idiosyncratic risk) as well as on

temperature spatial correlation (aggregate uncertainty). In line with the OLS estimates, as established

in Tables C.1 and C.2, and as interpreted and further discussed in Appendix A, larger temperature

spatial correlation increases significantly the probability that second generation migrants in Europe,

as well as in the US, will be more loss averse, whereas greater intertemporal temperature volatility

decreases the probability that a second generation migrants in Europe and the US will be loss averse.


4.3.2    Selection on Unobservables

This subsection examines the likelihood that omitted variables could alter the qualitative findings.

Table C.4 establishes that it is very improbable that omitted variables could have affected the quali-

tative results presented in Tables 2 and 4. In particular, as established in columns (2) and (4), (using

columns (1) and (3) as the baseline specifications), the estimated value of the coefficient on intertem-

poral temperature volatility and temperature spatial correlation, if unobservables where as correlated

as the observables (i.e., Oster’s β ∗ statistic), are very close to the estimated OLS coefficients. Fur-

thermore, since zero does not belong to the interval created by the estimated value on and Oster’s β ∗ ,

one can reject the hypothesis that the value of the coefficient is driven exclusively by unobservables.

In addition, the indexes AET (Altonji et al., 2005; Bellows and Miguel, 2009) and δ (Oster, 2014)

measure how strongly correlated unobservables would have to be in order to account for the full size of

the coefficient on temperature volatility and spatial correlation (v and c subscripts correspondingly),

4.3.3    Placebo Tests

This section performs a series of placebo tests, analyzing the effect of intertemporal temperature volatil-

ity and temperature spatial correlation on the second-generation migrants’ valuation of job character-

istics that are orthogonal to the loss aversion. Table 5 establishes that preferences of second-generation

migrants in the US for short working hours (Column 1), feeling of importance and accomplishment in


                                                                 41
a job (Column 2), and promotion opportunities (Column 3) are mostly unaffected by the intertempo-

ral temperature volatility and temperature spatial correlation in the parental country of origin.24 In

addition, the table indicates that the comparative valuations of second-generation migrants in Europe

to training opportunities vs ability to use own initiative in a job (Column 4), training opportunities

vs salary (Column 5), and salary vs ability to use own initiative (Column 6) are orthogonal to the

intertemporal temperature volatility and temperature spatial correlation in the parental country of

origin.

 Notes: Using OLS regression, this table establishes that other cultural values of second generation migrants in Europe (i.e., long term
 orientation, obedience, altruism, attitude towards equality, gender roles, preference for strong government and tradition) are neither
 affected by temperature volatility (idiosyncratic risk) nor by temperature spatial correlation (aggregate uncertainty) in the parental
 country of origin. Additional geographical controls are the gini index of land suitability, distance to coast or river, landlocked
 dummy, percentage of land in the tropical, subtropical and temperate zones and precipitation level. Individual controls include age,
 gender, number of siblings, religion, education level, and income. Sample excludes small island countries. All independent variables

      The marginally significant positive effect of temperature volatility on the rank of promotion opportunities in column
3 mechanically captures the negative effect on job security.

 Notes: Using OLS regression, this table establishes that other cultural values of second generation migrants in the US (i.e.,
 long term orientation, obedience, altruism, attitude towards equality and gender roles, and confidence in government) are
 neither affected by temperature volatility (idiosyncratic risk) nor by temperature spatial correlation (aggregate uncertainty)
 in the parental country of origin. Additional geographical controls are the gini index of land suitability, distance to coast
 or river, landlocked dummy, percentage of land in the tropical, subtropical and temperate zones and precipitation level.
 Individual controls include age, gender, education level, religion, income and the number of siblings. Sample excludes small
 island countries. All independent variables have been normalized by subtracting their mean and dividing by their standard
 deviation. Thus, all coefficients can be compared and show the effect of a one standard deviation in the independent variable.

4.3.4    Orthogonality of the Climatic Variables to Other Cultural Dimensions

This subsection establishes that the effects of intertemporal temperature volatility and temperature

spatial correlation on Loss Aversion does not capture their effects on a wide range of other cultural

characteristics.

   In particular, as established in Tables 6 and 7, intertemporal temperature volatility and tem-

perature spatial correlation in the parental country of origin do not affect long term orientation,

obedience, altruism, and attitudes towards equality, gender roles, government and tradition among


                                                                43
second-generation migrants in Europe and the US.

    In addition, Table 8 establishes that even though there is a certain degree of statistically significant

association between preference for job security over salary and some of the cultural dimensions (e.g.,

obedience, altruism, equality and preference for strong government) among second generation migrants

in Europe, the baseline results are not altered, when accounting for these effects.25

      Similar analysis is not possible for the US sample of second generation migrants, due to the small number of
respondents for which both the job security preference and other cultural dimensions are observed.

4.3.5   Natural Experiment: The Columbian Exchange

This section addresses a potential concern that the established result might be driven by the sorting

of loss averse individuals into the less climatically volatile environments, as opposed to the proposed

mechanism of cultural evolution. In order to overcome this hurdle, the natural experiment of the

Columbian exchange and corresponding exogenous variation in the change of effective crop-specific

temperature volatility are exploited. In particular, the analysis focuses on the measure of climatic

volatility that captures temperature variation before the beginning of the growth cycle of the crop

that maximizes potential yield prior to the year 1500, and explores the effect of the change in this

measure of effective volatility due to the potential change of the yield maximizing crop in the course

of the Columbian Exchange.

   Columns (2), (5) and (8) of Table 9 establish that the degree of loss aversion of second generation

migrants in Europe and the US, as captured by their preference for job security, is negatively and

significantly affected by the level of effective potential volatility of temperature prior to year 1500, as

well as its change due to the Columbian Exchange. Reassuringly the positive effect of temperature

spatial correlation on the preference for job security stays qualitatively and quantitatively unaltered,

compared to the corresponding baseline specification captured in the columns (1), (4) and (7). This

finding identifies the effect of a “random assignment” of effective potential volatility on the evolution

of loss aversion and suggests that sorting played an insignificant role in the determination of loss

aversion.

   The concern over the self-selection of loss averse individuals into locations with high spatial corre-

lation of climatic shocks is significantly less intense. For instance, as opposed to volatility, correlation

of temperature across space is non transparent to a casual observer. In addition, ceteris paribus, indi-

vidual’s wellbeing is unaffected by the correlation of climatic shocks across different locations. Nether

the less, similar empirical exercise can be performed with respect to the effective spatial correlation of

temperature and its change in the course of the Columbian exchange. As established, in columns (3),

(6) and (9) of Table 9, preference for loss aversion of second generation migrants is indeed positively

and significantly affected by the effective temperature spatial correlation prior to the year 1500, which

goes in line with the previous results and theoretical predictions. The change in the level of the effec-

tive temperature spatial correlation, however, has no statistically significant impact on the preference

for loss aversion. Such result could be a consequence of the lack of variation in the magnitudes of

      effective temperature spatial correlation changes across locations.

           In addition, the natural experiment associated with the Columbian Exchange, and the differential

      assignment of superior crops to different regions of the world, mitigates potential concerns about

      omitted variables. In particular, this natural experiment is based on the identifying assumption that,

      conditional on the pre-1500 distribution of effective potential volatility, the change in effective potential

      volatility resulting from the introduction of new crops is distributed randomly, independently of any

      other attributes of the grid. This lends further credit to the results established in section 4.3.2.

   Notes: Using OLS regressions, this table establishes that second generation migrants’ valuation of job security vs. salary
   negatively affected by historical temperature volatility (idiosyncratic risk) and positively affected by temperature spatial
   correlation (aggregate uncertainty) in the parental country of origin. Additional geographical controls are the gini index of
   land suitability, distance to coast or river, landlocked dummy, percentage of land in the tropical, subtropical and temperate
   zones and precipitation level. Individual controls include age, gender, number of siblings, religion, education level, and
   income. Sample excludes small island countries. All independent variables have been normalized by subtracting their mean
   and dividing by their standard deviation. Thus, all coefficients can be compared and show the effect of a one standard
   deviation in the independent variable. Heteroskedasticity robust standard error estimates clustered at the parental country
   of origin level are reported in parentheses; *** denotes statistical significance at the 1% level, ** at the 5% level, and * at
   the 10% level, all for two-sided hypothesis tests.



4.3.6    Historical Temperature Volatility

This subsection examines the effect of the historical temperature volatility on the second-generation

migrants’ level of loss aversion, as captured by their preference for job security. As established in

Table 10, second generation migrant’s valuation of job security, while being positively associated with

temperature spatial correlation as before, is negatively affected by the inter-temporal temperature

volatility calculated for longer time horizon. In particular, columns (1) through (3) document that

the degree of loss aversion of second generation migrants in the US is negatively affected by the

intertemporal temperature volatility between the years 500 CE and 2000 CE. In addition, columns

(4) through (6) establish negative and significant association between second-generation migrant’s

preference for job security and measure of idiosyncratic climatic volatility, which captures variation in



                                                                47
temperature in the past, between the years 500 CE and 1000 CE.


4.3.7   Robustness to the Density of Weather Stations

In light of the potential association between the density of weather stations and measurements of

temperature spatial correlation in a given region, one may be concerned about the possibility that

climatic conditions affected the loss aversion via non-evolutionary channels. In particular, variation

in temperature spatial correlation can be partially driven by the differences in the density of the

weather measuring stations, which, in turn, is affected by the contemporary economic and institutional

characteristics of a country, which may have direct effect on the observed rate of loss aversion.

   To address this problem base-line results are replicated taking into account the potential confound-

ing effect of the weather measuring stations’ density. In particular, columns (1) and (2) of Table C.6

replicate columns (5) and (6) of Table 2, while controlling for the density of the weather stations,

used to measure the climatic data at hand. Columns (3)-(6) replicate the same exercise for columns

(4)-(7) of Table 4. It is established that the observed level of loss aversion among second generation

migrants in Europe and the US is not directly affected by the density of weather measuring stations,

while the effect of temperature volatility and spatial correlation remains statistically significant and

quantitatively similar to the base-line results.


4.3.8   Insignificant Role of Preindustrial Development

In light of the adverse effect of climatic volatility on pre-industrial development, as capture by urban-

ization and population density in the year 1500 (Table 1), one may be concerned about the possibility

that climatic conditions affected the loss aversion via non-evolutionary channels. In particular, prein-

dustrial development and its potential effect on contemporary economic, institutional and cultural

characteristics may have directly affected the observed rate loss aversion rather than via the proposed

evolutionary channel.

   The chosen empirical framework, however, mitigates these concerns since the analysis is based on:

(i) individual level data, accounting in particular, for income and education, and (ii) second generation

migrant that are arguably operating within the same institutional and cultural environment. Moreover,

as reported in columns (1)-(3) of Table C.5 for the ESS, and (4)-(6) for the GSS, the effect of the

climatic variables on loss aversion is orthogonal to the potentially confounding effect of historical levels

4.3.9     Insignificant Role of Outliers

This subsection examines the potential importance of outliers in the established relationship between

intertemporal temperature volatility and temperature spatial correlation and the emergence of loss

aversion. As depicted in Figure C.1 outliers do not governed the observed relationship in the ESS,

whereas Figures C.2 suggests that outliers, associated with individuals from the Netherlands, may

affect the observed relationship in the GSS. Nevertheless, as established in Table C.7 the results

remain qualitatively intact if individuals from the Netherlands are excluded from the sample.



5        Individuals Level Analysis (WVS)

This section uses the World Values Survey (WVS) to analyze the effect of intertemporal temperature

volatility and spatial correlation on individuals’ preferences for job security over other characteristics

(salary, colleagues, job satisfaction), in light of the conjectured positive association between loss aver-

sion and preference for job security over salary and other characteristics. The effects of temperature

volatility and correlation are estimated using the linear probability model via the following empirical

specification:

Notes: Using OLS regression, this table establishes that individuals’ valuation of job security vs other job characteristics (i.e., salary, colleagues,
job satisfaction) is negatively affected by temperature volatility (idiosyncratic risk) and positively affected by temperature spatial correlation
(aggregate uncertainty) in the country of birth. Additional geographical controls are the gini index of land suitability, distance to coast or
river, landlocked dummy, percentage of land in the tropical, subtropical and temperate zones and precipitation level. Individual controls include
age, gender, religion, education level, and income. Sample excludes small island countries. All independent variables have been normalized by
subtracting their mean and dividing by their standard deviation. Thus, all coefficients can be compared and show the effect of a one standard
deviation in the independent variable. Heteroskedasticity robust clustered standard error estimates are reported in parentheses; clustering at
the region of interview and individual characteristics level; *** denotes statistical significance at the 1% level, ** at the 5% level, and * at the

         Table 11 establishes a negative statistically and economically significant effect of temperature

                                                                          50
of job security versus other characteristics. The result is robust to the inclusion of world bank regional

fixed effects (column 1), geographical controls (columns 2 and 3), wave fixed effects (column 4), the

number of years since transition to agriculture (column 5) and individual characteristics (column 6).

The estimated effects suggest that increasing intertemporal temperature volatility by one standard

deviation decreases the probability of preferring job security to other characteristics by between 6.3

and 3.1 percentage points, while one standard-deviation increase in temperature spatial correlation

increases this probability by between 1.3 and 2 percentage points.

   Moreover, result remains qualitatively the same after accounting for the ancestral composition of

the contemporary population (column 7). In particular, both effects remain significant at the 1% level

and imply that one standard-deviation increase in temperature volatility decreases the probability

of job security being the most preferred job characteristic by 2.3 percentage points, while increasing

temperature spatial correlation by one standard deviation increases it by 1 percentage point.


5.1     Robustness

5.1.1    Alternative Estimation Method: Probit

The results are robust to the use of an alternative estimation method, rather than OLS. In particular,

using Probit, one can estimates the probability of observing preference for Job Security vs other job

characteristics, conditional on intertemporal temperature volatility (idiosyncratic risk) as well as on

temperature spatial correlation (aggregate uncertainty). In line with the OLS estimates, as estab-

lished in Tables 11, larger temperature spatial correlation increases significantly the probability that

second generation migrants in Europe, as well as in the US, will be more loss averse, whereas greater

intertemporal temperature volatility decreases the probability that a second generation migrants in

Europe and the US will be loss averse.


5.1.2    Selection on Unobservables

This subsection examines the likelihood that omitted variables could alter the qualitative findings.

Table C.4 establishes that it is very improbable that omitted variables could have affected the qualita-

tive results presented in Tables 2 and 4. In particular, as established in Column (6), (using Columns

(5) as the baseline specifications), the estimated value of the coefficient on intertemporal temperature

volatility and temperature spatial correlation, if unobservables where as correlated as the observables


                                                   51
(i.e., Oster’s β ∗ statistic), are very close to the estimated OLS coefficients. Furthermore, since zero

does not belong to the interval created by the estimated value on and Oster’s β ∗ , one can reject the

hypothesis that the value of the coefficient is driven exclusively by unobservables. In addition, the in-

dexes AET (Altonji et al., 2005; Bellows and Miguel, 2009) and δ (Oster, 2014) measure how strongly

correlated unobservables would have to be in order to account for the full size of the coefficient on

temperature volatility and spatial correlation (v and c subscripts correspondingly), are mostly different

from the critical value of 1.


5.1.3        The Insignificant Role of Preindustrial Development

In light of the adverse effect of climatic volatility on pre-industrial development, as capture by urban-

ization and population density in the year 1500 (Table 1), one may be concerned about the possibility

that climatic conditions affected the loss aversion via non-evolutionary channels. In particular, prein-

dustrial development and its potential effect on contemporary economic, institutional and cultural

characteristics may have directly affected the observed rate loss aversion rather than via the proposed

evolutionary channel.

     The chosen empirical framework, however, mitigates these concerns since the analysis is based on

individual level data, accounting in particular, for income and education. Moreover, as reported in

columns (7)-(9) of Table C.5, the effect of the climatic variables on loss aversion is orthogonal to the

potentially confounding effect of historical levels of population density in 1500, urbanization in 1800,

and GDP per capita in 1913.28

     However, the chosen empirical framework mitigates these concerns since the analysis uses individual

introduced measures of the intensity of loss aversion and loss averse behavior. In particular, it an-

alyzes the effect of intertemporal temperature volatility and temperature spatial correlation on the

degree of cautiousness, as captured by the types of games played in the ethnic group as reported

by the Ethnographic Atlas (EA) and the sleeping proximity of parents to infant as reported by the

(SCCS). Analysis also focuses on the effect of intertemporal temperature volatility and temperature

spatial correlation on the manifestations of loss aversion in the observed behavior, reflected by the

diversification of activities across subsistence modes and the choice of crop, as documented by the EA.

The effect of climatic shocks structure on the measures of loss aversion on an ethnic group level is

estimated by an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) methodology using the following model

standard deviation, distance to coast or river and precipitation level), measured on the ethnic level of

group e, Eej is ethnographic characteristic j of group e (intensity of agriculture and animal husbandry,

settlement structure and plow use), δr is a set of regional fixed effects for Americas, Old World and

Africa, and e is the error term. The theory predicts negative effect of temperature volatility and

positive effect of temperature spatial correlation (i.e., β1vol < 0 and β1corr > 0).


6.1.1   Preference for Cautiousness

This section establishes that, in line with the theory, the degree of cautiousness, as captured by the

types of games played in the ethnic group and the sleeping proximity of parents to infant is negatively

and significantly affected by the degree of intertemporal temperature volatility and positively affected

by the spatial correlation of temperature shocks.

   Table 12 establishes a negative statistically and economically significant effect of temperature

volatility and positive significant effect of temperature spatial correlation on preference for cautiousness

 Note: Using OLS regression, this table establishes based on the Ethnographic Atlas and the SCCS that preferences for loss aversion is

at the ethnic group level. The result, based on the EA, is robust for the inclusion of ethnographic

controls (Column 2), additional geographical controls (Columns 3 and 4) and region fixed effects

(Column 5). These results are remarkably stable and remain significant on the 1%- and 5%-level

across specifications.

   In addition, a similar qualitative pattern emerges from the analysis of the impact of climatic char-

acteristic on preference for cautiousness in the SCCS. In particular, Column 6 establishes a negative

and highly significant association between temperature volatility and preference for cautiousness, as

captured by the sleeping proximity of parents to infant reported in SCCS, as well as a highly signif-

Reassuringly, the results are robust to the potentially confounding effect of the household’s dwelling

structure.


6.1.2    Loss Averse Behavior

This section explores the effect climatic volatility as well as spatial correlation in climatic shocks on the

degree of loss aversion at an ethnic level, as captured by the observed manifestations of loss aversion

in human behavior. In particular, it explores the effect of these climatic characteristics on: (i) the the

diversification in the sources of subsistence consumption, and (ii) choices of crops that are potentially

less vulnerable to climatic fluctuations.

    The association between climatic characteristics (and their hypothesized impact on loss aversion)

and the degree of diversification in the production of the subsistence consumption is explored in

Columns (1) and (2) of Table 13. A-priori one would have expected, that in a more volatile environ-

ment the degree of diversification will be larger. Nevertheless, the findings suggest that the degree of

diversification of productive activities at the ethnic group level is negatively associated with temper-

ature volatility and positively by its spatial correlation. Thus, ethnic groups that are characterized

by greater climatic volatility tend to be less diversified, reflecting the findings that in volatile environ-

ment, the trait of loss-neutrality is dominating, leading naturally to production choices that are based

on higher rates of return rather than loss-avoidance.

    The association between climatic characteristics (and their hypothesized impact on loss aversion)

and the choices of crops that are potentially less vulnerable to climatic fluctuations is explored in

Columns (3)-(5) of Table 13. Due to the greater resistance of roots and tubers in comparison to cereals,

to the adverse effects of climatic shocks, one would have expected, a-priori, that roots and tubers would

be adopted in a more volatile environment.30 Nevertheless, the findings suggest that ethnic-groups

that were situated in a regions with greater temperature volatility roots or tubers as less likely to be

the major crops, while those that are situated in regions with higher spatial correlation of temperature

shocks would adopt roots with higher probability.31 These findings reflect the hypothesized selection
   29
      While sleeping proximity of parents to infants may reflect convenient as well as the fear of loosing a child during
the night, the intricate negative association between climatic volatility and the positive one with spatial correlation is
highly unlikely to be related for preference leisure or convince.
   30
      Moreover, since volatility increases the risk appropriation by either the government or other individuals (Mayshar
et al., 2016) the adoption of these crops, ceteris paribus, would mitigate the risk of appropriation.
   31
      In particular, as established in column (5), the result remains highly statistically significant when the confounding

       Notes: Using OLS regression in column 1 – 2 and probit regression in column 3 – 5, this table establishes based on
       the Ethnographic Atlas that diversification of activities and choice of crop is negatively affected by the temperature
       volatility (idiosyncratic risk) and positively affected by the temperature spatial correlation (aggregate uncertainty)
       in the region. Column 1-2 focus on diversification of production activities based on v1 – v5 in the Ethnographic
       Atlas and columns 3 – 5 on choice of roots as a major crop (v29), as opposed to cereals. Additional geographical
       controls are land suitability gini, elevation range and precipitation level. Ethnographic controls include settlement
       structure and major crops for column 1 – 2 and intensity of agriculture, animal husbandry, settlement structure
       and plow use for column 3 – 5. Region fixed effects include dummy variables for Americas, Old World Europe and
       Africa. All independent variables have been normalized by subtracting their mean and dividing by their standard
       deviation. Thus, all coefficients can be compared and show the effect of a one standard deviation in the independent
       variable. Heteroskedasticity robust standard error estimates clustered at the parental country of origin level are
       reported in parentheses; *** denotes statistical significance at the 1% level, ** at the 5% level, and * at the 10%

of loss-neutrality in a volatile environment. leading naturally to production choices that are based on

higher rates of return rather than loss-avoidance.
effects of potential suitability for roots and cereals are accounted for.



                                                                56
   Hence, the focus on observed behavior, rather than preferences further establishes the highly

significant negative association between the degree of loss aversion and intertemporal temperature

volatility, as well as positive assassination with spatial correlation of temperature shocks.


6.2     Robustness

6.2.1    Selection on Unobservables

This subsection examines the likelihood that omitted variables could alter the qualitative findings.

Table C.4 establishes that it is very improbable that omitted variables could have affected the quali-

tative results presented in Tables 2 and 4. In particular, as established in column (8) , (using columns

(7) as the baseline specifications), the estimated value of the coefficient on intertemporal temperature

volatility and temperature spatial correlation, if unobservables where as correlated as the observables

(i.e., Oster’s β ∗ statistic), are very close to the estimated OLS coefficients. Furthermore, since zero

does not belong to the interval created by the estimated value on and Oster’s β ∗ , one can reject the

hypothesis that the value of the coefficient is driven exclusively by unobservables. In addition, the

indexes AET (Altonji et al., 2005; Bellows and Miguel, 2009) and δ (Oster, 2014) measure how strongly

correlated unobservables would have to be in order to account for the full size of the coefficient on

temperature volatility and spatial correlation (v and c subscripts correspondingly), are different from

the critical value of 1.


6.2.2    Placebo Tests

This section establishes that the relationship between intertemporal temperature volatility and spatial

correlation in temperature and the proposed proxies of loss aversion are unique to ethnographic charac-

teristics that reflect cautiousness about losses, rather than a broader spectrum of ethnographic traits.

A wide spectrum of placebo tests demonstrates that indeed intertemporal temperature volatility and

spatial correlation in temperature do not affect other cultural characteristics at the ethnic group level.

   In particular, as established in Table C.8, ethnographic characteristics such as sex taboos, group’s

political integration, inheritance property rights, gender roles in agriculture, attitude towards premar-

ital sex, and belief in the evil eye are affected neither by intertemporal temperature volatility nor by

the temperature spatial correlation, lending further credence to the proposed hypothesis.

7    Concluding Remarks

This research explores the origins of loss aversion and the variation in the prevalence of this important

traits across regions, nations, and ethnic groups. It advances the hypothesis and establishes empirically

that the evolution of loss aversion in the course of human history can be traced to the adaptation of

individuals to the asymmetric effects of climatic shocks on reproductive success during the Malthusian

epoch; an era in which adverse climatic conditions could have brought individuals to extinction.

    The study develops an evolutionary theory that captures the fundamental asymmetry that the

Malthusian environment has generated with respect to the attitude of individuals towards gains and

loses in productivity, and thus with respect to the evolution of loss aversion.

    Exploiting variations in the degree of loss aversion among second generation migrants in Europe

and the US, as well as across precolonial ethnic groups, the research establishes that consistent with

the predictions of the theory, individuals and ethnic groups that are originated in regions in which

climatic conditions tended to be spatially correlated, and thus shocks were aggregate in nature, are

characterized by greater intensity of loss aversion, while descendants of regions marked by climatic

volatility have greater propensity towards loss-neutrality.

Appendix (Supplementary Online Material)

A     Climatic Characteristics and the Evolution of Risk Aversion

This subsection establishes that the predictions of the theory are unique to the evolution of loss

aversion, rather than risk aversion.

    First, suppose that the reference point, associated with the subsistence consumption constraint is

either absent or not binding. In particular, suppose that the utility function is of the CRRA type:

                                                     1−σ i                  i
                                                      c c       (nit + )1−σn
                             ui (cit , nit ) = (1 − γ) it i + γ               ,                      (44)
                                                      1 − σc       1 − σni

where  ≥ 0, σci > 0, and σni > 0.

    As established in the subsection 2.7, in the absence of a binding subsistence consumption constraint,

variation in income driven by the differential choices of the production modes would have no effect on

fertility and thus on reproductive success. The composition of risk aversion would therefore remain

intact overtime and the long-run level of risk-aversion would be independent of climatic characteristics.

    Second, suppose that the subsistence consumption constraint is present and binding, but individ-

uals are loss-neutral (i.e., θi = 1). Namely, the subsistence consumption is not a reference point and

there is no kink in the utility function at the point, c̃. While the evolutionary forces that operate on

the distribution of risk-aversion around c̃ are qualitatively similar to those that governed the evolution

of loss-aversion, as some risk-neutral individuals gain an evolutionary advantage in the short-run and

departs from the subsistence level, risk-neutrality is no longer evolutionary optimal, and some pru-

dence may generate evolutionary advantage in the long-run, obscuring the link between the climatic

volatility and spatial correlation and the long-run level of risk-aversion. Moreover, the relative degree

of risk-aversion with respect to consumption and fertility would affect the evolutionary process and

would further obscured the link between climatic volatility and spatial correlation and the long-run

level of risk-aversion.

C      Robustness Checks

C.1     Alternative Estimation Method: Probit and Ordered Probit

This subsection establishes that the results obtained in sections 4 and 5 are robust to the use of an

alternative estimation method, rather than OLS. In particular, using Ordered Probit for the ESS and

GSS and Probit for the WVS, one can estimates the probability of observing the ranked preference

(in the ESS and GSS) or the preference for Job Security (in the WVS), conditional on intertemporal

temperature volatility (idiosyncratic risk) as well as on temperature spatial correlation (aggregate

uncertainty).

 Using Ordered Probit regression, this table establishes that the preferred job characteristics of second generation migrants reflect loss
 aversion. In particular, their valuation of job security vs other characteristics (salary, short working hours, promotion opportunities
 and job satisfaction) and of job security vs. salary is negatively affected by temperature volatility (idiosyncratic risk) and positively
 affected by temperature spatial correlation (aggregate uncertainty) in the parental country of origin. Additional geographical
 controls are land suitability gini, distance to coast or river, landlocked dummy, percentage of land in the tropical, subtropical and
 temperate zones and precipitation level. Individual controls include age, gender, number of siblings, religion, education level, and
 income. Sample excludes small island countries. All independent variables have been normalized by subtracting their mean and
 dividing by their standard deviation. Thus, all coefficients can be compared and show the effect of a one standard deviation in
 the independent variable. Heteroskedasticity robust standard error estimates clustered at the parental country of origin level are
 reported in parentheses; *** denotes statistical significance at the 1% level, ** at the 5% level, and * at the 10% level, all for
 two-sided hypothesis tests.



    In line with the predictions of the theory, as well as with the OLS estimates, as established in

Tables C.1, C.2, and 11 larger temperature spatial correlation increases significantly the probability

that: (i) second generation migrants in Europe, (ii) second generation migrants in the US, and (iii)

individuals in the WVS, will be more loss averse, whereas greater intertemporal temperature volatility

decreases the probability that individuals in these distinct samples will be loss averse.

C.2      Selection by Unobservables

This subsection examines the likelihood that omitted variables could alter the qualitative findings.

Table C.4 establishes that it is very improbable that omitted variables could have affected the quali-

tative results presented in Tables 2 and 4. In particular, as established in Column (2) and (4), (using

Columns (1) and (3) as the baseline specifications), the estimated value of the coefficient on intertem-

poral temperature volatility and temperature spatial correlation, if unobservables where as correlated

as the observables (i.e., Oster’s β ∗ statistic), are very close to the estimated OLS coefficients. Fur-



                                                                        64
thermore, since zero does not belong to the interval created by the estimated value on and Oster’s β ∗ ,

one can reject the hypothesis that the value of the coefficient is driven exclusively by unobservables.

In addition, the indexes AET (Altonji et al., 2005; Bellows and Miguel, 2009) and δ (Oster, 2014)

measure how strongly correlated unobservables would have to be in order to account for the full size of

the coefficient on temperature volatility and spatial correlation (v and c subscripts correspondingly),

are mostly different from the critical value of 1.

C.3      The Insignificant Role of Preindustrial Development

This subsection establishes that the effect of the climatic variables on loss aversion is orthogonal to the

potentially confounding effect of historical levels of population density, urbanization and income per

capita density. In particular, Table B.X demonstrates that, accounting for population density in 1500,



                                                                  65
urbanization in 1800, and GDP per capita in 1913, the effects of intertemporal climatic volatility and

temperature spatial correlation on loss aversion in the ESS (columns (1)-(3)), GSS (columns (4)-(6)),

and WVS (columns(7)-(9)) remain stable and mostly highly significant and qualitatively similar.

C.4     Robustness to the Density of Weather Stations

In light of the potential association between the density of weather stations and measurements of

temperature spatial correlation in a given region, one may be concerned about the possibility that

climatic conditions affected the loss aversion via non-evolutionary channels. In particular, variation

in temperature spatial correlation can be partially driven by the differences in the density of the

weather measuring stations, which, in turn, is affected by the contemporary economic and institutional

characteristics of a country, which may have direct effect on the observed rate of loss aversion.

     To address this problem base-line results are replicated taking into account the potential confound-

                                                                66
ing effect of the weather measuring stations’ density. In particular, columns (1) and (2) of Table C.6

replicate columns (5) and (6) of Table 2, while controlling for the density of the weather stations,

used to measure the climatic data at hand. Columns (3)-(6) replicate the same exercise for columns

(4)-(7) of Table 4. It is established that the observed level of loss aversion among second generation

migrants in Europe and the US is not directly affected by the density of weather measuring stations,

while the effect of temperature volatility and spatial correlation remains statistically significant and

quantitatively similar to the base-line results.

C.5    Insignificant outliers

This subsection examines the potential importance of outliers in the established relationship between

intertemporal temperature volatility and temperature spatial correlation and the emergence of loss

aversion. As depicted in Figures C.1 and C.2 outliers do not appear to govern the observed relationship

in the ESS and the GSS. In particular, as established in Table C.7 the results remain qualitatively

intact if individuals from the Netherlands, that constitute the isolated observation, that may affect

the significance of the association are removed the in Figure C.2, are excluded from the sample.

C.6     Placebo Tests: Ethnographic Atlas

This section establishes that the relationship between intertemporal temperature volatility and spatial

correlation in temperature and the proposed proxies of loss aversion are unique to ethnographic charac-

teristics that reflect cautiousness about losses, rather than a broader spectrum of ethnographic traits.

A wide spectrum of placebo tests demonstrates that indeed intertemporal temperature volatility and

spatial correlation in temperature do not affect other cultural characteristics at the ethnic group level.

   In particular, as established in Table C.8, ethnographic characteristics such as sex taboos, group’s

political integration, inheritance property rights, gender roles in agriculture, attitude towards premar-

ital sex, and belief in the evil eye are affected neither by intertemporal temperature volatility nor by

    Notes: Using OLS regression, this table establishes that the preferred job characteristics of second generation migrants
    reflect loss aversion. In particular, their valuation of job security vs all other characteristics (salary, short working
    hours, promotion opportunities and job satisfaction) and of job security vs. salary is negatively affected by temperature
    volatility (idiosyncratic risk) and positively affected by temperature spatial correlation (aggregate uncertainty) in the
    parental country of origin. Additional geographical controls are land suitability gini, distance to coast or river, land-
    locked dummy, percentage of land in the tropical, subtropical and temperate zones and precipitation level. Individual
    controls include age, gender, number of siblings, religion, education level, and income. Sample does not include the
    Netherlands in all columns, in columns (4) – (6) small island countries are also excluded. All independent variables
    have been normalized by subtracting their mean and dividing by their standard deviation. Thus, all coefficients can
    be compared and show the effect of a one standard deviation in the independent variable. Heteroskedasticity robust
    standard error estimates clustered at the parental country of origin level are reported in parentheses; *** denotes

      Based on the answer to the question “Would you please look at this card and tell me which one

      thing on this list you would most prefer in a job” taken from the core module of the General

      Social Survey. Coded 5 if “No danger of being fired” is the most preferred characteristic, 4 if

      it is the second most preferred, 3 – third most preferred, 2 – fourth most preferred, 1 – least

      preferred.


                                                                 71
• Preferred Job Characteristic: Security vs Salary (Second-generation analysis: GSS):

  Based on the answers to the question “Would you please look at this card and tell me which one

  thing on this list you would most prefer in a job?” taken from the core module of the General

  Social Survey. Computed as the difference between the ranks of characteristics “High Income”

  and “No danger of being fired”, normalizing the lowest value to 1 (i.e., JOBINC - JOBSEC +

  5).

• Preferred Job Characteristic: Security vs Salary (Second-generation analysis: ESS):

  Based on the answers to the question “For you personally, how important do you think each of

  the following would be if you were choosing a job? A secure job?/ A high income?” taken from

  the “Family work and well-being” module in the second and fifth rounds of the European Social

  Survey. Computed as the difference between the importance of characteristics “Secure job” and

  “High Income”, normalizing the lowest value to 1 (i.e., ipjbscr - ipjbhin + 5).

• Preferred Job Characteristic: Security vs Other (Individual-level analysis: WVS):

  Based on the answers to the question “Now I would like to ask you something about the things

  which would seem to you, personally, most important if you were looking for a job. Here are some

  of the things many people take into account in relation to their work. Regardless of whether

  you’re actually looking for a job, which one would you, personally, place first if you were looking

  for a job?” taken from the core module of the World Values Survey. Coded as 1 if “A safe job

  with no risk of closing down or unemployment” was an answer and coded 0 otherwise.

• Preferences for Cautiousness (Ethnic group-level: Ethnographic Atlas): Based on

  “Games” from Ethnographic Atlas (i.e., v35 1, v35 2, v35 3). Coded 2 if strategy element is

  present in the games, while the chance element is not (i.e., v35 3=2 and v35 2=1), coded 1 if

  both the strategy and chance elements are present or absent (i.e., v35 3=v35 2) and coded 0.5

  if only chance component is present (i.e., v35 3=1 and v35 2=2).

• Preferences for Cautiousness (Ethnic group-level: SCCS): Based on “Sleeping proximity

  of parents to infant” from SCCS (v23).

• Diversification (Ethnic group-level: Ethnographic Atlas): Constructed based on the

  composition of subsistence activities (e.g., hunting, gathering, agriculture and animal husbandry)



                                               72
    in food production. The measure is constructed as an inverse of Herfindahl-Hirschman index for

    the shares of each of the modes in total production.

  • Crop Choice: Roots vs Cereals (Ethnic group-level: Ethnographic Atlas): Based on

    the “Major Crop Type” characteristic from the Ethnographic Atlas (i.e., v29). Coded 1 if roots

    or tubers are the major cultivated crop (i.e., v29=4), coded 0 if the major crop is cereal (i.e, v29

    == 1).


D.1.2   Placebo Measures

  • Preferred Job Characteristic: Satisfaction vs Others (Second-generation analysis:

    GSS): Based on the answer to the question “Would you please look at this card and tell me

    which one thing on this list you would most prefer in a job?” taken from the core module of the

    General Social Survey. Coded 5 if “Work important and gives a feeling of accomplishment” is

    the most preferred characteristic, 4 if it is the second most preferred, 3 – third most important,

    2 – fourth most important, 1 – least important.

  • Preferred Job Characteristic: Hours vs Others (Second-generation analysis: GSS):

    Based on the answer to the question “Would you please look at this card and tell me which one

    thing on this list you would most prefer in a job?” taken from the core module of the General

    Social Survey. Coded 5 if “Workings hours are short, lots of free time” is the most preferred

    characteristic, 4 if it is the second most preferred, 3 – third most important, 2 – fourth most

    important, 1 – least important.

  • Preferred Job Characteristic: Promotion opportunities vs Others (Second-generation

    analysis: GSS): Based on the answer to the question “Would you please look at this card and

    tell me which one thing on this list you would most prefer in a job?” taken from the core mod-

    ule of the General Social Survey. Coded 5 if “Chances for advancement” is the most preferred

    characteristic, 4 if it is the second most preferred, 3 – third most important, 2 – fourth most

    important, 1 – least important.

  • Preferred Job Characteristic: Training opportunities vs Ability to use own initiative

    (Second-generation analysis: ESS): Based on the answers to the question “For you person-

    ally, how important do you think each of the following would be if you were choosing a job?

                                                 73
  Job offered good training opportunities?/ Job enabled you to use own initiative?” taken from

  the “Family work and well-being” module in the second and fifth rounds of the European Social

  Survey. Computed as the difference between the importance of characteristics “Job offered good

  training opportunities” and “Job enabled you to use own initiative” (i.e., ipjbtro - ipjbini).

• Preferred Job Characteristic: Salary vs Training opportunities (Second-generation

  analysis: ESS): Based on the answers to the question “For you personally, how important do

      at the grid cell level and then aggregated at the regional level.

  • Historic Temperature Volatility: Historic volatility of temperature constructed using pa-

      leoclimatic date on temperature anomalies reconstructed by Mann et al. (2009). Computed

      as intern-annual variance of temperature anomalies over the years 500 – 2000 and 500 – 1000.

      Measure is calculated at the grid cell level and then aggregated at the regional level.

  • Effective Temperature Volatility (pre-1500): Effective temperature volatility before the

      Columbia Exchange is calculated using v3.2 of the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) database as

      an average of inter-annual variances of temperature for four months prior to the beginning of

      growth cycle of the pre-Columbian, yield-maximizing crop, which is identified as an indigenous

      crop that maximizes potential caloric yield, using the methodology developed in Galor and Özak

      (2016). Measure is calculated at the grid cell level and then aggregated at the regional level.

      database as a difference between effective potential volatility (pre-1500) and effective potential

      volatility (post-1500). Where effective potential volatility (post-1500) is an average of inter-

      annual variances of temperature for four months prior to the beginning of growth cycle of the

      post-Columbian, yield-maximizing crop, which is identified as a crop that maximizes potential

      caloric yield, compared to any other crop, using the methodology developed in Galor and Özak

      (2016). Measure is calculated at the grid cell level and then aggregated at the regional level.

  • Effective Temperature Spatial Correlation (pre-1500): Effective temperature spatial cor-

      relation before the Columbia Exchange is calculated using v3.2 of the Climatic Research Unit

      (CRU) database as the correlation between monthly deviations of temperature in a given cell

      and its neighbors over four months prior to the beginning of growth cycle of the pre-Columbian,

      yield-maximizing crop, which is identified as an indigenous crop that maximizes potential caloric

      yield, using the methodology developed in Galor and Özak (2016). Measure is calculated at the

      grid cell level and then aggregated at the regional level.

  • Effective Temperature Spatial Correlation (change): Change in the effective tempera-

      ture spatial correlation due to the Columbia Exchange is calculated using v3.2 of the Climatic

      Research Unit (CRU) database as a difference between effective temperature spatial correlation

      (pre-1500) and effective temperature spatial correlation (post-1500). Where effective tempera-

      ture spatial correlation (post-1500) is correlation between monthly deviations of temperature in

      a given cell and its neighbors over four months prior to the beginning of growth cycle of the

      post-Columbian, yield-maximizing crop, which is identified as a crop that maximizes potential

      caloric yield, compared to any other crop, using the methodology developed in Galor and Özak

      (2016). Measure is calculated at the grid cell level and then aggregated at the regional level.

   32
       Hofstede and Hofstede (n.d., p.61) defines it as “Power distance can therefore be defined as the extent to which the
less powerful members of institutions and organizations within a country expect and accept that power is distributed
unequally. Institutions are the basic elements of society, such as the family, the school, and the community; organizations
are the places where people work.”
    33
       Hofstede and Hofstede (n.d., p.92) defines it as follows: “Individualism pertains to societies in which the ties between
individuals are loose: everyone is expected to look after him- or herself and his or her immediate family. Collectivism as
its opposite pertains to societies in which people from birth onward are integrated into strong, cohesive in-groups, which
throughout people’s lifetime continue to protect them in exchange for unquestioning loyalty.”
    34
       Hofstede and Hofstede (n.d., p.140) defines this dimension as Masculinity vs Femininity, since he found gender based
differences in the answers to the questions that defined this value.
    35
       According to Hofstede and Hofstede (n.d., p.191) “Uncertainty avoidance can therefore be defined as the extent to
which the members of a culture feel threatened by ambiguous or unknown situations.”

• Regional Data: For regions within a country, data is computed using GIS software to compute

  the area of each region’s polygon in the corresponding shape file of the Seamless Digital Chart

  of the World. Whenever possible, the same primary data sources as the ones used in the sources

  for the country level data is used. E.g. regional agricultural suitability is constructed using the

  data from Ramankutty et al. (2002).
