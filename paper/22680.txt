                                           ABSTRACT

Black women in current cohorts ages 50 to 72 years have lower employment than similar white
women, despite having had higher employment when they were middle-aged and younger.
Earlier cohorts of older black women also worked more than their white counterparts. Although
it is not surprising that white women’s employment should catch up to that of black women given
trends in increasing female labor force participation, it is surprising that it should surpass that of
black women. This chapter discusses factors that contribute to this differential change over time.
Changes in education, marital status, home-ownership, welfare, wealth, and cognition cannot
explain this trend, whereas changes in occupation, industry, health, and gross motor functioning
may explain some of the trend.

I.     Introduction

       Black women have had labor force participation and employment rates that exceed those

of white women, even at older ages. For example, 29 percent of black women ages 50 to 72

years old who were born in the 1910s were employed, compared with 26 percent of similar white

women. This pattern is eroding and, for most education groups, reversing over time. Although

more women of both races are working at older ages, white women are driving these changes

through their increased labor force participation. Remarkably, older white women’s participation

has not just caught up with black women’s; it has surpassed it.


       This change in relative employment is especially surprising given black women’s greater

attachment to the labor force throughout their lifecycle, with longer work histories and a greater

probability of full-time work. It is also surprising given older black women’s greater potential

need for income compared with white women. Older black women have fewer resources than do

white women in terms of wealth and other household income, and also have more demand on

these resources in the form of dependents at home who may need monetary support.


       Race differences in employment among older women are understudied in contrast to the

extensive literature on men (see Lang and Lehmann (2012) for an extensive literature review) or

even compared with the smaller literature on younger women or women as a whole. To provide

some perspective on this group, the oldest cohorts in this sample were born in the 1910s during

the Jim Crow era, while the youngest were born in the early 1960s after the landmark case that

overturned “separate but equal,” Brown vs the Board of Education (1954). Older women today

have lived through a number of society-wide changes during their lifetimes.           They have

experienced narrowing racial inequality during the Great Society programs and the later effects

of the erosion of many of those programs. They have seen large changes in (white) women’s

                                                2
labor force participation over time (Goldin 1990, 2006) and rapid changes in technology and

skills biased technical change (e.g., Goldin and Katz 2008).


        Figure 1 shows the difference in the probability of being employed by age for birth

cohorts from 1913 to 1968 for black women compared with white women. What is remarkable is

the mostly steady decline in black women’s employment in contrast to white women’s at older

ages and across cohorts. Figure 2 shows that black female employment initially increases across

cohorts at younger ages and then flattens out at all ages, particularly for older groups in recent

decades. In contrast, in Figure 3 white women show stronger increases in employment at older

ages across cohorts.2 Given black women’s rising educational attainment over this time period

(for example, the average number of years of education for a black 60 year old woman rose from

7.5 in 1970 to 12.7 in 2010 (author’s calculations from the Census/American Community

Survey)), one might have expected a larger increase in employment for black women than what

is shown in the cohort charts.


        Although reasons for changes in black women’s labor force participation are under-

explored, and the age component of these changes is even more neglected, a somewhat larger

literature looks at reasons for changes in the black/white female wage differential. This literature

was especially productive in the 1990s studying changes in the racial wage gap in the 1970s and

1980s (e.g., Anderson and Shapiro 1996, Blau and Beller 1992, Cunningham and Zalokar 1992,

Holzer 1998, among others). More recent papers update changes in wage differentials into the

2000s (Browne and Askew 2005, McHenry and McInerney 2014, Neal 2004, Pettit and Ewert


2
 Changes in all women’s lifecycle employment are explored by Goldin and Mitchell (forthcoming).
Goldin and Katz (this volume) show that labor force participation rates of the most recent cohorts in their
forties are smaller than those of previous cohorts, but conclude that women are likely to continue to work
even longer despite this decrease during mid-life.

                                                     3
2009). In general, these papers find that black women’s wages increased vis-à-vis white wages

from the 1960s to 1980, but the wage gap widened between 1980 and 2000.3 Wages and

employment capture different parts of the labor market experience and the relative status of black

women compared with white women differs across these two outcomes.


        Similar to some of the previous literature on wage differentials (e.g., Blau and Beller

1992, Bound and Dresser 1999, Bound et. al 1996, Brown and Warner 2008, Conrad 2005, Pettit

and Ewert 2009), this paper will begin by making comparisons between black and white women

as a whole. Cohort charts presenting employment outcomes by age show how employment

outcomes have been changing by race over time.4 I then explore potential reasons for the

difference in racial employment rates over time using a regression framework to which I add

controls for education, marital status, any child at home, home ownership, geography, and

changes in welfare and SSI using the Census/American Community Survey (ACS). None of

these factors explain this difference and controlling for education exacerbates this difference. I

then focus on women with high school education in order to subtract out the effects of increased

college-going among both groups of women and find similar results. Finally, I use ordinary least

squares regressions on the full education sample in the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS) to

explore the effects of wealth, occupation, industry, activities of daily living (ADL), gross motor

skills, depression, and cognition on the racial difference in employment over time and find that

changes in occupation, industry, ADL, and motor skills can help explain this change.


3
  An interesting aspect of much of this earlier literature is that for some of these samples, black women’s
wages have been temporarily higher than white women’s. Indeed, for the sample in this paper, black
women’s earnings are briefly higher than those of white women in their late 30s, early 40s for cohorts
born in the 1940s when limiting to the high school educated, but not when combining all education levels.

  Employment was chosen as the outcome of interest, but patterns are nearly the same at these ages using
“Not in the Labor Force” (NILF) as the outcome instead. NILF results are not presented in the interest of
brevity and are available from the author.

II.     Literature Review


This section explores potential reasons for differential changes in employment by race over time.


A. Demographics


        Lack of monetary resources and the need to provide for dependents may pull black

women into the labor force (Bound et al. 1996). Differences in marital status and spousal

income are important examples of differences in resources between black and white women,

although historically unmarried black women have had stronger labor force attachment than have

unmarried white women (Goldin 1977, 1990). In the 2011 ACS, 63 percent of white women

ages 50 to 72 are married but only 36 percent of similar black women are married. The

probability of being married decreases for both races by age and by cohort, but this decrease

across cohort is stronger for older black women than for older white women. Similarly, older

black women are more likely to have dependents still in the house than are older white women.

For example, in the 2011 ACS, 35 percent of black women ages 50 to 72 have any child at home

in contrast with 26 percent of white women.


        Changes in educational status over time stand out as a determining factor of the black-

white female wage gap in the wage literature (Anderson and Shapiro 1996, Conrad 2005,

McElroy 2005, McHenry and McInerney 2014, and Neal 2004).5 From a theoretical standpoint,

increasing education should increase labor force participation because education increases

productivity and thus demand for the worker and because investments in education are more

likely to be made by those who can pay them off in the longer term.



5
  Cunningham and Zalokar (1992) is an exception; they find little effect of education on black women’s
increased relative wages between 1960 and 1980.

                                                   5
       Geography is another demographic factor that may affect black and white employment

differently over time. Several authors (e.g., see Cunningham and Zalokar 1992, Kaplan et al.

2008 for literature reviews) note that racial convergence in wages and health differs by

geography, with the South converging later than other regions. It is not a priori clear how

geographical differences will affect changes in employment outcomes for women by race.


B. Monetary Resources


       Lack of retirement savings may encourage longer labor force participation. Using the

2010-2012 HRS, black women ages 50 to 75 have 21 percent of the total wealth of comparable

white women, with $121,000 in assets compared with $558,000, and have 14 percent of the total

non-housing wealth of white women, with $54,000 in assets compared with $373,000. Home

ownership is a form of forced retirement savings that may differ by race. Only 59 percent of

black women ages 50 to 72 in the 2011 ACS own a home compared with 82 percent of white

women.


       Changes in government assistance can affect the opportunity cost of work (Neal 2004).

Historically, lower wages for black women make employment less attractive, especially given

higher wage replacement rates from Social Security. Biggs and Springstead (2008) find that the

lowest quintile of earners has a >100 percent replacement rate, whereas the second quintile is

within the recommended 67 to 81 percent replacement rate (Munnell, Webb, and Delorme 2006).

Indeed, looking at Social Security replacement rates by race Bridges and Choudhury (2009) find

higher replacement rates for blacks than for whites, and particularly for black women. Social

Security generosity has been decreasing over time and across cohorts (Butrica et al. 2003/2004).

Moffitt (2015) notes that welfare spending has been increasing since a pause in the 1970s. This



                                               6
increase in spending has been shifting from poorer families to those with higher incomes and

from single-parent families to married parent families, both of which may increase white

women’s outside options compared to black women’s. On the other hand, Moffitt (2015) finds

an increase towards disability programs which may favor older black women (who are more

likely to be disabled) over older white women. Higher levels of government assistance mean that

retirement can occur on a smaller nest egg.


C. Occupation and Industrial changes


       In addition to factors that lead to an increase in the supply of older black women in the

labor force, the growth in the health care field may have increased the demand for older black

women given the prevalence of these women in health care fields in previous years, particularly

as nursing aides. Table 1 shows the most common occupations for middle aged women in the

1990 census and for older women in the 2009-2011 ACS. In 1990, the number one occupation

for black middle-aged women was that of nursing aide, while white women were more likely to

be employed in clerical positions. Differential demand for these fields would suggest that black

women would be more likely to be employed at older ages over time. On the other hand, the

decline in manufacturing jobs has differentially hurt black women employed in those positions

(Anderson and Shapiro 1996).


       Related to occupational demand are occupational differences in the physical demands of

jobs that can make women less able to do them as they age and potentially more prone to work-

related health problems. Using O*Net data, Rho (2010) finds large differences by race in the

physical demands for older women workers. In her paper, 38 percent of black women over the

age of 58 are in physically demanding jobs in contrast to 30 percent of white women.



                                               7
Interestingly, she finds that the probability of being in a physically demanding job increases with

age for black women over the age of 58 rather than decreases. This increase is consistent with a

more general decrease in physically demanding jobs over time noted in Johnson et al. (2007),

although there is little information on changes in jobs with physical demands by cohort.

Conversely, cognition and memory may be more important for desk jobs, which are more likely

to be held by older white women.


D. Health


       Poor health outcomes may lead to inability for women to work longer even if they need

or desire to do so. On average black women have worse health than white women, leading to

earlier retirement or disability. In the HRS, activities of daily living (ADL) provide a somewhat

objective measure that signals poor health (Adams et al. 2004), and black women report more

complications with ADL on a 1 to 5 scale. Using data from the 1992 HRS, Bound et al. (1996)

suggest that black women in their 40s and 50s would have greater attachment to the labor force

than would white women if it were not for health conditions that limit work ability. Similarly,

higher mortality rates mean that less wealth is needed to finance retirement, all else being equal.

Using the National Health Interview Survey Linked Mortality files from 1997-2004, Hummer

and Chinn (2011) find that black women have 14 percent higher mortality than do white women

at age 65. Although the racial gap in life expectancy at birth has been narrowing slowly but

steadily (Masters et al. 2014), most literature has found the adult black-white mortality gap to be

more constant (see Hummer and Chinn (2011) for a literature review).


III.   Data and Empirics




                                                8
       The primary dataset used in this paper is the US Census combined with the American

Community Survey (ACS).          Together, these provide basic labor market and demographic

statistics from 1970 to 2011 to trace cohorts over time (Ruggles et al. 2015). These changes are

explored using the cohort chart template available in the online appendix from (Goldin 2006),

and in telescoping regressions described in the next section. The census/ACS was chosen as the

main dataset because of its large sample size, the longevity of the repeated cross sections, and a

wide array of variables that are consistent across years. Results that can be replicated in the CPS

are similar with the exception that the effect of adding marital status on the variable of interest is

substantively smaller.


       The education variables used in these different datasets are not consistent with each other

or consistent across years in the same dataset. The variable for high school graduate used in this

chapter includes those who have earned a high school diploma but have not earned a bachelor’s

degree (~62 percent of the female black population ages 50 to 75 in the 2009-2011 ACS).

Researchers using the IPUMS ACS across time should be particularly aware of how the

definitions for “some college” change across census waves. Results are similar when those who

are known to have earned an associate’s degree are excluded (~7 percent of the black population

ages 50 to 75 in the 2009-2011 ACS) and when results are limited to high school graduates

known to have less than one year of college (~38 percent of the same population), although this

separating information is not available for all years. To get a measure of changing government

income options specific to this group, average income variables for welfare income and social

security income at the state*year level were created by collapsing the relevant income variables

for the universe of women ages 50 to 72.




                                                  9
        To explore the effects of these different factors on the change in the black/white

differential between the oldest and youngest cohorts, ordinary least squares regressions6 of the

following form are used:


        (1)                 =                +     ℎ           +               ℎ          +          +

                  +   +     +!+"


                          is a dichotomous variable determining whether or not the woman is

employed; it represents the employment share in the population.                          is a dichotomous

variable for whether a woman identifies as black.                  ℎ       is a vector of 10-year cohort

dummies ranging from women born in the 1910s to those born in the 1940s.                          Similarly,

              ℎ       is the interaction of these latter two variables. When running the regressions,

the omitted cohort will be women born in the 1910s and the variable of interest will be the

comparison of black women born in the 1940s to those born in the 1910s.7 In some regressions,

     is a vector of individual control variables including marital status, having a child at home, or

owning a home. For some regressions average dollars of welfare for black and white women

ages 50 to 72 at the state*year level are included. Finally,           age fixed effects are included in all

regressions to account for different age distributions within cohorts and            state fixed effects are

included in some regressions to test for differences by geography that do not vary across time,

and state*year fixed effects         are included to test for differences in geography that do vary

  Probit analysis provides similar results.

  For the Census/ACS results, the universe was limited so that all cohorts include the full ages 50 to 72
year age band. In this case, consistency in ages was preferred over breadth given the large sample. The
magnitude of the difference between the latest cohort and the earliest cohort is larger but the patterns are
the same when the 1900s cohort is used as the control and the 1950s cohort is included as the latest
cohort.

across time. Results are clustered on state. Results are reported for ordinary least squares

regression analysis for ease of interpretation.


        A second dataset, the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) provides detailed wealth and

health characteristics for women ages 50 to 72 from 1994-2012 (RAND 2016). This dataset is

discussed in more detail in the appendix to this book.


        Analysis for the HRS also uses equation (1), but uses a different universe because the

HRS does not extend as far back as the Census.           ℎ        is a vector of 10-year cohort dummies

ranging from women born in the 1920s to those born in the 1950s with the 1920s cohort as the

control.8 Education dummies include no high school, high school graduate or some college, and

bachelor’s or more. The non-housing wealth variable is inflated to 2014 dollars. The total

wealth variable that also includes housing wealth provides nearly identical results to the non-

housing wealth variable despite losing more than 5,000 observations.                 Longest occupation

dummies include 17 broad categories and longest industry dummies include 19 broad categories.

Health and cognition measures presented include a 0 to 5 scale for ADLs, a 0 to 5 scale for gross

motor skills, an indicator for feeling depressed, self-reported memory (1 to 5), immediate word

recall (0 to 10), delayed word recall (0 to 10), and an indicator that the respondent correctly

counts backwards from 20 on the first try.9 Other variables are defined as before. Results are




8
  This choice was made to provide the largest sample size possible and to make the results more
comparable across ages and time with the ACS/Census results. This choice creates a problem with
consistency across years because the earliest cohort and the latest cohort include different ages. An
alternative choice is to use consistent ages and fewer cohorts, which limits the age range to 55 to 62 and
uses cohorts born from the 1930s to the 1950s. The magnitudes for these comparisons are different but
the patterns are identical when making this choice, so it is omitted for brevity and is available from the
author.
9
  There are several other cognitive functioning measures in the HRS that provide nearly identical results
to this one. Counting backwards from 20 was chosen because it provided the least loss of observations.

presented.


IV.    Results

A. Census/ACS


       Table 2 provides results for equation (1) for the universe of all black and white women

aged 50 to 72 from cohorts born in the 1910s to those born in the 1940s. The variable of focus is

the first row, black*1940s cohort, and represents the change in the effect on employment of

being black for women in the 1940s cohort in comparison with the 1910s cohort controlling for

individual age dummies. A negative number means that the increase in employment between the

earliest and latest cohort in the sample is larger for white women than it is for black women.

What is of more interest than the original magnitude of this difference is the effect of control

variables on the coefficient of interest.       First, note that in all of these regressions the

black*cohort coefficients grow increasingly negative as the cohorts get younger, suggesting that

this difference is increasing across cohorts.


       Next, these telescoping regressions show the effect of adding controls to the regression

on the variable of interest, the coefficient of black*1940s cohort. When this coefficient becomes

more negative (decreases) after a control is added, that means that the control is differentially

helping black women (or hurting white women) across cohorts.             Conversely, when this

coefficient becomes less negative (increases), that means the control helps to explain some of the

difference between black and white employment outcomes in column (1).


       The coefficient of black*1940s cohort in column (1) provides the baseline black white

difference in employment across these two cohorts, in this case -0.080, suggesting that,


                                                 12
controlling for age fixed effects, the change in employment for older black women from the

1910s cohort to the 1940s cohort is worse than the change for older white women across the

same cohorts. Adding education controls to the regression, as in column (2), decreases the size of

the black*1940s cohort coefficient by 1.3 percentage points to -0.093. Including marital status

controls decreases the size of the coefficient an additional 1.1 percentage points to -0.104 in

column (3), which then becomes the new baseline for the remaining columns. Having a child at

home leaves this coefficient virtually unchanged in column (4). Owning a home has also very

little effect on the coefficient, which still rounds to -0.104 in column (5). Column (6) provides

geographical controls at the state level and shows a slight decrease of 0.2 percentage points from

column (3) to -0.1065. Controls for state*year income welfare and social security income in

column (7) have little effect on the coefficient which still rounds to -0.104. Finally, including

state*year fixed effects decreases the coefficient of interest in column (8) to -0.099, indicating

that although state level differences may not affect the racial difference in employment over

time, state level differences on the aggregate that vary over time may explain a small part of the

change.


       Taking these results together, factors that might help explain the increased black-white

employment gap include home ownership, changes in occupational and industrial demand

broadly, government transfer payments, and unexplained state*year variation. None of these

controls explains very much of the gap. On the other hand, education, marital status, generalized

state fixed effects, and controls for specific health and clerical occupations exacerbate the racial

cohort employment gap. Overall, these results support the idea that, as with changes in wage

differences, black-white educational differences between cohorts are especially important.




                                                13
       Although these educational differences are important, there are interesting changes even

within educational groups. For example, Figures 4 and 5 plot the black-white employment

difference across cohorts for ages 37 to 72 year old non-high school graduates and college

graduates respectively.   Positive numbers represent black women being more likely to be

employed than white women and negative numbers represent white women being more likely to

be employed than black women. The patterns across the two groups are widely different. For

the non-high school graduate group, black women work more than white women only in the

oldest cohorts and predominately at younger ages. Black college graduates are still more likely

to be employed than white college graduates at almost all ages. Though interesting, those

without a high school diploma represent less than 20 percent of older black women in 2009-2011

and those with a college degree or more represent only 18 percent of these women.


       To subtract out the effects of changes in educational attainment over the time period, the

remainder of this section focuses on the largest educational group, high school graduates. Not

only is this group a large group, but it is one likely to be negatively affected by skill biased

technical change (e.g., Goldin and Katz 2008), and increasing inequality (Autor 2014). The

same group is likely to be on the margin of government program use (Irving and Loveless 2015).

In this case, high school graduate is operationalized in this section as everyone with a high

school degree but not a bachelor’s degree. Results are similar looking at those with just a high

school degree and no additional schooling, although additional schooling without further degrees

is coded inconsistently across the census/ACS.


       Figure 6 shows an amplified version of the black-white employment differences shown in

Figure 1; the steady decline in black women’s employment compared with white women’s at

older ages and across cohorts is larger for high school graduates than for all women. Figure 7

                                                 14
shows that, like in Figure 2, black female employment initially increases across cohorts at

younger ages and then flattens out at all ages, particularly for older groups in recent decades.

The cohort lines are tighter, indicating less change across cohorts than for black women of all

education levels. Limiting to only those with exactly a high school diploma (figures available

from author) would show even closer lines. High school educated white women in Figure 8, on

the other hand, have more similar patterns to those for white women of all education levels as in

Figure 3. Again, white women catch up to and then surpass black women’s employment.             In

contrast, the employment of black women does not increase similarly.


       As before with Table 2, it is possible to again explore how different controls affect the

black*1940s cohort coefficient using equation (1), this time limiting the universe to high school

graduates in Table 3. The difference in employment outcomes for this group in comparison with

the 1910s cohort group is larger than it was for the entire sample, with a magnitude of -0.095 in

column (1) compared with -0.080 for the all education sample.


       Controlling for marital status again decreases the coefficient, this time by about 1.4

percentage points in column (2) to -0.109, which then becomes the base regression for the

remainder of the columns. Any child at home again has little effect in column (3). Owning a

home (column 4) offers only a slight increase (0.1 percentage points) to -0.108 from the

coefficient of black*1940s cohort in column (2).        State fixed effects slightly increase the

coefficient by less than 0.1 percentage points to -0.108 in column (5). State*year controls for

welfare and social security income increase the coefficient by less than 0.1 percentage points to -

0.108 in column (6). State*year fixed effects have a smaller effect on the coefficient for this

group, increasing the coefficient in column (2) by 0.8 percentage points to -0.100.



                                                15
         Taken as a whole, the results for the high school graduate and some college group are

very similar to the results for all women, which should not be surprising given that this education

group makes up the majority of the black women in recent samples.


B. HRS


         Table 4 provides results for equation (1) for the universe of all black and white women

aged 50 to 72 from cohorts born in the 1920s to those born in the 1950s. The variable of focus is

the first row, black*1950s cohort, and represents the change in the effect on employment of

being black for women in the 1950s cohort in comparison with the 1920s cohort controlling for

individual age dummies. For none of the regressions in Table 4 is the change between the

coefficient of black*1930s cohort significantly different from that of the omitted 1920s cohort,

but that may be because of the small sample size for the 1920s cohort in this set and because of

the smaller sample size of the HRS. For the most part, the coefficients of the black*cohort

interaction become more negative with increasing cohorts as they did with the Census/ACS

regressions.


         The coefficient of black*1950s cohort in column (1) provides the baseline black white

difference in employment across these two cohorts including controls for age, marital status, and

education, in this case -0.106, suggesting that the increase in employment from the 1920s cohort

to the 1950s cohort is larger for older white women than for older black women. Controlling for

non-housing wealth in column (2) does not change the coefficient. Adding indicators for the

longest occupation in column (3) decreases significance and increases magnitude to a marginal -

0.076.    Controls for longest industry in column (4) have a similar effect, increasing the




                                                16
magnitude to -0.082, though this result remains significant.10 Controlling for one measure of

health, difficulty with ADL, in column (5) also increases the coefficient, but only to -0.098.

Controlling specifically for difficulty with gross motor skills increases the coefficient to -0.074

in column (6). Controlling for depression decreases the coefficient of black*1950s cohort in

column (7) to -0.117, indicating that in the absence of changes in depression across the two

groups, black employment would be higher in comparison with white employment. Similarly,

including controls for memory and cognition also decreases the coefficient in column (8),

indicating that absent these changes, black women’s employment would also be higher.11

Column (9) is a kitchen sink regression that includes all of the controls in the table that increased

the coefficient of black*1950s cohort in one regression to see how much of the difference can be

explained by these variables. The coefficient drops to less than half of the original coefficient, at

-0.041, and loses even marginal statistical significance. It should be noted that column (9) is

only suggestive—the loss of significance and magnitude could also be caused by the drop in

observations, from more than 62,000 in column (1) to less than 49,000, and a by having a large

number of additional controls added.12


        The HRS has a wealth of variables measuring different aspects of health and cognition

that could be tested in addition to the ones presented here. Including self-reported health has no



10
   More than 13,000 observations are lost to “missing”, “not asked this wave”, and “other census code”.
The results in column (1) are nearly identical when limited to the universe in column (3) and are slightly
attenuated with a coefficient of -0.091 for black*1950s cohort when limited to the universe in column (4),
suggesting that sample selection is not a major cause of the decreased coefficients on black*1950s cohort.
11
   Nearly 7,000 observations are lost in column (8) to missing or proxy respondent. Limiting the
regression in column (1) to the universe in column (8) produces a coefficient of -0.099, which is larger
than the full-sample coefficient, making the decrease to -0.12 by the addition of controls even more
striking.
12
   Note that the additional controls still retain their own significance and have the predicted sign for their
direct effect on employment outcomes, suggesting that the regression results are not completely
attenuated.

                                                     17
effect on the coefficient of interest.13 Debt may be of special interest given that Lusardi and

Mitchell (this volume) find that debt is a reason for women working longer. However, there is

no effect on the coefficient of interest when it is included as a control, suggesting that its effects

are not differential by race over time. The inclusion of a scale for fine motor skills also has no

effect on the coefficient of interest. Other variables in the HRS that measure cognition have

similar results to counting backwards from 20. Results are also similar in column (8) if the

cognition variable is included in a separate regression from the memory variables, though with

these separate regressions the coefficient of interest is closer to -0.11 than to -0.12.


        Overall, factors that might help explain at least half of the increased black-white

employment gap include changes in occupation, industries, ADL, and gross motor skills. On the

other hand, controls for depression and cognition exacerbate the racial cohort employment gap.


V.      Discussion and conclusion


        Understanding the dynamics of labor force participation of older black women is

important from a policy perspective. Although labor market outcomes for young black workers

have been studied extensively, more research needs to be done on differential outcomes by age.

As people work longer this study becomes more important.


        Older black women have worse employment outcomes, worse health, and fewer

resources than comparable white women. Although increasing percentages of both black and

white women across cohorts acquire bachelor’s degrees or further education, black women’s

employment outcomes have stagnated while white women’s have increased continually across


13
  Self-reported health is not shown because, although this measure generally tracks with objective health
measures such as mortality rates (Adams et al. 2004, Heiss et al. 2009), it may suffer reverse causality
with employment.

                                                   18
cohorts, surpassing those of black women. The result is that each newer cohort sees a larger

relative difference between black and white employment across cohorts. The gap is even larger

when the sample is limited to high school educated women, which is the largest educational

subset of older black women, the most likely to be negatively affected by skill-biased technical

change and increasing inequality, and the most likely to be on the margin of government

program use.


       This decrease in relative employment is surprising because middle-aged black women

from these cohorts were more likely to work than similar white women, as were older black

women from earlier cohorts. The relative picture for younger cohorts is not much better.

Although the decline in outcomes such as relative employment or full-time wages seems to have

stopped, it has mostly stagnated and stabilized at negative levels for black women compared with

white women.


       This chapter has investigated different factors that may affect black women’s labor force

participation differentially compared with white women’s, to explain changes over age and

across cohorts for black women’s lower employment compared with white. Differences in home

ownership and government transfer payments account for at most a small part of the difference.

Differences in occupation, industry, ADLs, and gross motor skills explain a larger amount of the

difference. Other factors that could be expected to explain the gap such as education, marital

status, depression, and cognition, exacerbate the racial cohort employment gap.


       Not all potential explanations for changes in the black-white employment gap could be

tested in this framework. For example, even after controlling for levels of education, changes in

education over time could still have additional impacts on employment outcomes. On the one



                                               19
hand, quality of schooling for black women in these cohorts has increased over time, potentially

providing them with greater human capital (e.g., Carruthers and Wanamaker 2013, Conrad 2005,

Margo 1990). On the other hand, removal of educational barriers allowed more high-ability

black women to select into college and therefore out of the sample of high school graduates and

into the sample of college graduates, which could affect the results for the high school graduate

sample.


       The national decline in unionization (Mishel 2012) also has ambiguous predictions for

black women’s labor force participation in comparison with white. Although union jobs are

“better” jobs with higher wages and more benefits that make work more attractive, they also tend

to have structures that encourage people to retire at earlier ages. For example, a 1999 study

using the Employment Cost Index found that union workers were 22.5 percent more likely to

receive pension benefits (Pierce 1999). The census does not have information on unionization

and the CPS only has the variable easily available starting in 1990. Older black women in the

2014 CPS sample are about 2 ppt more likely to be in a union than similar white women (14

percent versus 12 percent).


          Discrimination is another factor that could change for black women by age and time.

Although a large amount of work has documented and explored discrimination against younger

black workers, we know very little about labor market discrimination against older black

workers. Numerous empirical studies demonstrate race discrimination against younger entry-

level workers, but much less work has been done exploring differential treatment of older

workers and applicants by race. Indeed, there is no developed theory of discrimination specific

to this age group. Given recent news reports about violence against black youth, we might

expect animus against black people to decrease with the age of the worker.             Statistical

                                               20
discrimination predictions could go in either direction based on whether positive or negative

stereotypes of older black women or older white women dominate. For example, black women’s

strong previous labor force participation could lead to positive stereotypes about human capital

and future labor force participation. In contrast, black women and white women are about

equally likely to be working conditional on poor health, but the higher incidence of self-reported

poor health among black women may increase negative employer stereotypes about the health of

black workers. A recent laboratory study (Lahey and Oxley 2016) suggests that hiring

discrimination against black women compared with white women changes by the age of the

worker, but much more work needs to be done in this area.


       As this book should make clear, working longer is important for the economy, the

solvency of government programs, and people’s well-being.          Black women have different

histories and outcomes on average than white women. It is important to take these differences

into consideration in policy analysis going forward.

Notes: Data are from the 1994-2012 HRS. Only black and white women age 50-72 are included in the universe. Results are from an ordinary
least squares reqgression using equation (1). Robust standard errors are in parentheses. Omitted cohort is women born 1922-1929 (1920-1921
are outside the age range). 1930s cohort includes women born 1930-1939, and so on. Education dummies include no high school, high school
graduate and some college, and bachelor's including post-bachelor's degrees. Marital status dummies include never married, partnered,
married, divorced, and widowed. Memory controls include self-reported37   memory, immediate word recall (1-10), and delayed word recall.
Counting backwards indicates that the participant was able to correctly count backwards from 20 on the first try.
