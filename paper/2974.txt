              PATENTS, APPROPRIATE TECHNOLOGY, AND NORTH- SOUTH TRADE


                                     ABSTRACT

    We consider the differential incentives of the North and the South to
provide   patent protection to innovating firms in the North. The two regions

are assumed to have a different distribution of preferences over the range of

exploitable technologies. Due to the scarcity of R&D resources, the two

regions are in potential competition with each other to encourage the

development of technologies most suited to their needs. This provides a

motive for the South to provide patent protection even when it constitutes a

small share of the world market and hence has strong free riding incentives

otherwise. A benevolent global planner will set equal rates of patent

protection only when it weights the welfare of the two regions equally. We

find that the comparative statics of the Nash equilibrium exhibit considerable

ambiguity. Numerical simulations in the benchmark case yield the following

results: (i) when the technological preferences of the two countries become

more similar, the level of patent protection provided by the South is reduced;

(ii) when the relative market size of the South is increased, the South

enhances its patent protection. In both cases, the level of Northern patents

is relatively insensitive.

I.   Introduction

      One of the contentious North-South issues under discussion in the current

round of GATT negotiations concerns the protection of intellectual property

rights (IPR5). The U.S., European Community, and Japan are in broad agreement

that the international trading system provides inadequate protection to IPRs,

and have put forth a number of proposals to tighten restrictions; poorer

countries, whose practices would be most immediately affected, oppose these

proposals on the grounds that they would increase the profits of monopolistic

foreign firms at the expense of domestic consumers.

      Under the present regime, IPRs are largely beyond the scope of the GATT, -

and fall under the jurisdiction of the World Intellectual Property

Organization (WIPO), a U.N. agency. It is WIPO that oversees the existing

international agreements on IPRs such as the Paris Convention (on patents) and

the Berne Convention (on copyrights). The Paris Convention requires member

states, under the national treatment principle, to apply identical criteria to

foreign and domestic firms, but does not prescribe specific levels of patent

protection. Most of the ninety-eight members of the Convention are in fact

developing countries. But the developed countries argue that the prevailing

practices in the South leave much to be desired. Among complaints voiced by

the former are: selective sectoral coverage in national legislation;

 inadequate remedies and sanctions in case of infringement of IPRs; procedural

 and administrative difficulties impeding access to courts; and arbitrariness

 and discrimination in the application of domestic statutes. Developing

 countries like Brazil and India in turn stress the possible exacerbation of

 monopolistic practices by Northern firms if patent protection were to become

 more stringent. Therefore, they resist GATT involvement in IPRs, and prefer

 to use WIPO, which lacks enforcement power, as the forum for discussion of
                                     -2-

such issues.1

     The basic economic issue that underlies the conflict of interest is easy

to see.2 Most patented products or processes that make it to Southern markets

are developed in the North. The North would therefore profit from tighter

patent procedures in the South, as this would protect Northern firms against

imitators in their export markets. According to the U.S. International Trade

Commission, U.S. firms lose around $8 billion annually from patent and

copyright infringements (cited in Baldwin, 1988). But by the same token, the

South would like to pay as little as possible for these innovations, which is

what lax patent protection achieves. To be sure, this in turn reduces the

incentives of Northern firms to invest in R&D. As long as the South is a

small part of the world market, however, the adverse effects of its policies

on global innovative activity are also small, and free riding on the North

makes eminently good sense. As a recent paper by Chin and Grossman (1988)

demonstrates, it may be in the South's interest to provide no patent

protection whatsoever.

     In this paper we analyze this conflict of interest by bringing into

consideration another feature of some importance. This new feature consists

of the possibility that the North and South may have differing technological

needs: the North would like to develop drugs against cancer and heart disease,

whereas the South benefits more from drugs against tropical diseases; labor is

cheap in the South but expensive in the North, so the North's labor-saving

innovations are less useful in the South. When R&D resources that can be

(1988), Benko (1988), Hamilton and Whalley (1988), pp. 28-29, and Kelly et al.
(1988), p. 39.

deployed in support of these innovations are limited, choices have to be made

as to which areas will receive greater emphasis. Now Southern patents may

have a role to play in promoting the development of technologies appropriate

to the South that would not have been developed in the absence of these

patents.3 This incentive now competes against the free-riding motive. As we

shall see, one implication is that a benevolent global planner who puts a

greater weight on the South's welfare than on the North's would no longer

necessarily prefer lower patent protection in the South. Another implication

of the potential competition for suitable technologies is that increased

patent protection in the South need not always be good for the North.

     The only other formal model devoted to IPRs in the North-South context

that we are aware of is the one by Chin and Crossman (1988). These authors

consider the competition between two firms, one each form the North and South.

The Northern firm can invest in process innovation, which the Southern firm

can copy costlessly when the South provides no patent protection. Our

framework differs from theirs in a number of respects. We allow for a

continuum of potential technologies, with a different distribution of

preferences over them in the two regions. This framework can be interpreted

in terms of product, as well as process, innovation. Second, our model has

free entry into the R&D sector, rather than duopolistic competition between

 two firms. Third, we allow gradations of patent protection, which is more




 3. This point was recognized early on by Vernon (1957, p. 12): ".. . there is
 a case to be made that inventors in the industrialized areas of the world may
 need some special incentive to concentrate their talents on products of
 special utility to the underdeveloped areas." The only empirical study on LDC
 patents appears to be the one by Deolalikar and Roller (1989), which analyzes
 the relationship between patenting and total factor productivity for Indian
 firms.

general than the simple binary choice (protection or no protection) analyzed

by Chin and Grossman. Finally, we assume that the Northern and Southern

markets are segmented, due to differential patent-law application in the two

regions. All of these features appear to be desirable ones. Their cost is

that, unlike Chin and Grossman, we do not get into the details of the

strategic interactions between Northern and Southern firms competing in

oligopolistic markets.



II. Preliminaries

     We allow for an unlimited spectrum of potential technologies, indexed by

the continuous variable 9 e (-co,   a'). The   range of discovered technologies,

characterized by a lower bound t and an upper bound 6, is endogenous and

denoted by [j, 7] .   We limit the analysis to uninterrupted ranges (i.e. no

"holes" are allowed in the range).

     Consumers are differentiated by taste, with each having a preferred

variety of technology.4 Consumers can therefore also be indexed by their

preferred 9. To keep things simple, we assume each consumer gets utility of 1

if his prefered technology is available, and 0 otherwise. Letting u(9) stand

for the utility of consumer with preferred technology B, we have:


             11
(1) u(9) â€”
             (   0 otherwise.


Northern consumers are distributed according to the continuous distribution




4. The use of the term "consumer" here is perfectly general, and applies
equally well to producers who are downstream users of technology. If we
interpret the set of technologies as pertaining to a particular economic
activity, 9 could measure the required capital-labor ratio, the level of
skilled labor needed, the expected life of the equipment, and so forth. Or, 9
could simply index different products.
                                     -5-

function B(9) with support (-,       Aggregate consumer welfare in the North
can then be written as a function of the range of discovered technologies:


                 fo
(2) un(L, )   â€” u(9)B(9)d9   â€”   B(9)d9,
                J-o              J
where we have used (1). For the moment, nothing specific need be assumed

about the shape of B(.). But it will help to think of B(.) as a single-

peaked, symmetric distribution such as the normal.

     Consumers in the South are parameterized in same manner, except that we

assume the distribution function for Southern consumers is centered on a mean

to the riht of that of the North. Further, the mass of Southern customers is

a fraction -y of those in North (<l), with y measuring the relative market

share of the two regions. This allows us to write the distribution function

      for the South as a simple transformation of that of the North.


   B5(9) â€” -yB(9 -    5).

Aggregate consumer welfare in the South is then given by




(3) U5(., ) â€” iI B(8-S)d9.


     We assume that all innovations take place in the North. This is not

terribly restrictive provided that the North has a sufficiently strong

comparative advantage in research and development or that the South can

appropriately discriminate between domestic and foreign firms in the

application of its patent laws. As both of these are realistic features of

 the current regime, we can concentrate on the decisions of Northern firms
                                           -6-

alone. We assume that there is an infinite supply of potential innovating

firms, with each existing firm identified by the technology it has developed.

There is a fixed cost c required to develop each technology; marginal costs of

production will not play an interesting role for innovating firms, so we will

ignore them. These fixed costs are treated parametrically by the firms, even

though an expansion of the range [i.,     9] tends to drive c up as the costs of
resources used in the innovation process are bid up. So we will write c â€”

c(9   -   fl, with c'>O   and c''>O. This "congestion" effect acts like an

externality, and will play an important role in the analysis. Its purpose is

to capture the reality that the resources used in R&D are not in perfectly

elastic supply.

          Consider the pricing strategy of a firm which has developed and patented

a certain technology. If patent protection were perfect, the firm could

capture the entire consumer surplus by charging a price of unity (technically,

unity minus epsilon). Since patent protection never provides for full

monopoly,5 it is preferable to work with a model in which the firm can capture

only a fraction of consumer surplus and has to charge a price lower than

unity. A simple way to link the patent laws to the pricing behavior of firms

is as follows. Suppose the innovator faces a large fringe of potential

imitators in the North, each of which can mimic the former by incurring unit

coats of a<l and no fixed coats. The parameter a can be thought of in part as

capturing the (expected) unit coats incurred by imitators if they are brought

to court and successfully prosecuted. In this sense, a parameterizes the

restrictiveness of the prevailing patent laws in the North, with higher a




5. In practice, even full patent rights are likely to confer only limited
protection against imitators and fail to internalize R&D spillovers. See
Dasgupta (1988) and .Jaffe (1986).
                                                 -7-

associated with more complete patent protection. The analogous role in the

South is played by the parameter .               Since the innovator's marginal Costs are

assumed zero (or, less restrictively, lower than the imitators), he will

always have the incentive to charge the limit-prices a [0, 1) and fi                [0, 1)

in the the two regions, respectively.6 Hence the market equilibrium is

similar to that with contestable markets: for each technology in the produced

range, the incumbent firm (the innovator) charges the price which equals the

unit cost of potential entrants. The costs of potential imitators are in turn

determined by the restrictiveness of prevailing patent laws.

     Total Northern profits can then be written as:



(4) fl(L 9) â€”    I [aZ(8) + flyB(9-S)Jde           -
                                                       [9 - 11cC.).
                J1

We assume that entry into n technologies, as opposed to already developed

ones, is free. Firms enter until revenues just cover fixed Costs. This

allows us to determine the range of existing technologies by imposing the

following zero-profit conditions.


(5) aE(1) +   yB(L-S)    -
                             c(9   -
                                       1) â€” 0,
(6) aB(9) + fl-yB(9-S)   -   c(    -
                                       1) â€” 0,

which must hold at the edges of the range (see Figure 1). Provided B(9) is

single-peaked and not truncated, (5) and (6) together determine the range [0,




6. Notice the implication that firms can charge different prices in different
regions. This requires that Southern imitators not be able to market their
output in the North. The justification is that patent restrictions apply to
all sales within a region, irrespective of whether they originate from home or
foreign firms. This is consistent with the Paris Convention. Further, in the
U.S., importation of a product that uses a domestically-patented process is
forbidden.
                                            -8-

9] of technologies which firms will find in their interest to develop. We

assume that S or y are small enough to ensure that the range of profitable

technologies is indeed a continuous one. Notice that as long as >O, the

presence of the South allows the North to exploit a wider range of

technologies, as fixed costs can be spread on a larger base. For the same

reason, Northern firms will always market their products in the South, even if

the degree of patent protection there is substantially lower than in their

home market.

     Social welfare in the North is the sum of consumer benefits and profits,

and can be stated as a function of the range of discovered technologies:




(7) W'(j, 7)   â€”
                   I    [(Â°) + fl7B(O-S)]dO   -
                                                  [9   -
                   Jo


The corresponding expression for the South is:




(8) W5(, 7)    â€” I (l-fl)B5(9)d9     â€”   ii (l-fl)B(9-S)dO.
                   ii                    J.

Note that fl75B(9-S)d9 represents the transfer of profits from the South to the

North and is therefore subtracted from Southern welfare.



III. Comiarative Statics for the Ranae of Technologies

     The policy instruments in this model are a and fl        which parameterize the

degree of patent protection provided in the two regions. They affect the

levels of welfare in the North and South through their influence on the range

of innovations, and, in the case of fi,       through the magnitude of the profit
 transfers from the South to the North. We start by analyzing the response of
                                                -9-

  and     to changes in exogenous parameters.

       We first note that equations (5) and (6) yield a relationship between

marginal benefits in the two regions:


(9) (B(L) -    8(i)]   â€”   7(fl/a)[B(9-S)   -
                                                B(L-S)J.

The expressions in the square brackets capture the difference between marginal

consumer benefits at the edges of the range for the two regions. Suppose that

the South did not exist (â€”O), that it did not provide any patent protection

(flâ€”O), or that its tastes were identical to the North's (Sâ€”0). Then (9) would

require equality between B(.) and 8(i). This equates the marginal consumer

benefits (in the North) at each end of the range. When the South enters the

picture, however, this equality need no longer hold; as we shall see, the

range of produced innovations becomes skewed away from Northern tastes and

towards Southern tastes. The larger is the Southern market (y), the taste

differential (S), and the relative level of Southern patent protection (fl/a),

the more pronounced this becomes.

        As a final preliminary, a note is warranted regarding the sign of the

partial derivative of the benefit function B(.), as this plays an important

role in the following analysis. With a symmetric, single-peaked distribution

function, B'(9) is positive or negative depending on which side of the mean 9

lies. We will henceforth assume that                  and (9-S) will always lie to the

right, and and (L-S) always to the left, of the mean of B(#).7 This ensures

that


        8'(9) < 0, B'(O-S) <     0,   8'() > 0, B'(-S) > 0.




7. This is in fact too restrictive for the results to be discussed below to
hold. A weaker condition will generally suffice.
                                           -10-




An interpretation of these conditions in economic terms is that the marginal

benefit from innovations Afl as the range of innovations becomes broader.

They will always hold for a distribution like the normal one, provided S is

not too large.

       (i) Effects of Increased Northern Patent Protection. We differentiate

(5)-(6) totally to perform comparative-statics analysis. Let the determinant

of the system be denoted by < 0 (see the appendix). Then the effect of

changes in a on the boundaries of the range of innovations can be determined

as follows:


(10) dL/da       (l/A)(-B()[aB'(9) Ã· yB'(7-S)] + [B(L) -         B(O)]c')     < 0.

                  (-)   (-)        (-)                      (01+)


As discussed above, B'() and B'(J-S) are both neeative. Moreover, we will

see that (B(.) - B()] > 0 (i.e. the range will be generally skewed to the

right). These ensure that an increase in patent protection in the North will

unambiguously reduce the lower bound, increasing the number of innovations on

the left of the distribution. These are the innovations which are not greatly

valued in the South.

       Some ambiguity exists, however, with the upper bound:


 (11) dO/da â€”    (l/)(-(9)[aB'(.)   +    7B'(-S)]   +   [B(.)   - B(O)Jc'),

                  (-)    (-)         (+)                        (Q/Ã·)


which is Dositive only if [B(e.)    - B(9)]c' is not too large. The

 interpretation is as follows. If the range of innovations is already too

 skewed to the right (i.e. towards Southern tastes) so that [B(9) - B(9)J >>

 0,   an increase in Northern patent protection may well lead to some of the

 innovations that are relatively more suitable to the South to drop out. This
                                            -11-

possibility is due to the crowding-out of existing products as the expansion

of the range of innovative activity increases costs incurred by all

incumbents. When this does not happen, an increase in a will generate more

innovation on the upper end of the range as well.

        Further, combining expressions (10) and (11), it can be seen that the

overall range of innovations unambiguously expands as a increases:


(12) dO/da -      dVda
           â€”
               (l/A)(B(9)[aB'(.)   + fryB'C-S)1 -   B(L)(aB'(J)   + piz'(e-S)])     >   0.



Therefore, patent protection in the North will increase innovative activity,

but may do so at the expense of some products which are particularly suited to

Southern requirements.

        (ii) Effects of Increased Southern Patent Protection. The effects of

patent protection in the South are similar to those discussed above, except

that they get moderated by the parameter .            Hence, an increase in fi

unambiguously increases the innovations that are more appropriate to Southern

needs (i.e. those on the right of the distribution):


 (13)     d8/d â€”    (-y/)(-B(9-S)[aB'(.)   + yB'(L-S)I + [B(L-S) -       B(9-S)]c')      > 0


The ambiguity now exists with respect to innovations near the lower end of the

 range:


 (14) dj/d â€”       (i/)(-B(L-S)[aB'(9)     + fl-yB' (9-S)] + [B(.-S) -   B(9-S)]c')

 which can be positive if the (negative) term [B(-S) -            B(-Sflc'    is

 sufficiently large in absolute value. Notice that (B(FS) -               B(7-S)]   is the

 difference between Southern marginal consumer benefits at the two ends of the

 innovation range. The likelihood that increased patent protection in the

 South will lead to some of the products favored in the North to drop Out
                                        -12-

increases with: (i) the degree to which existing innovations mirror Northern

requirements; (ii) the diffferences in tastes between the two regions; and

(iii) the magnitude of the cost increase as the range broadens.

     Once again, irrespective of whether some innovations drop out, the range

itself must broaden:


(15) dO/dfl -   dj/d
     â€” (1/d)(B(7-S)[cxB'(O) Ã· fryB'(j-S)] -    B(L-S)[aB'(l)   + frrB'(7-S)J > 0,


but the presence of the South skews the range to the right relative to the

mean of the B(9) distribution.

     (iii) Effects of Chanee in Relative Market Sizes. As far as the range of

innovations is concerned, the relative market-size parameter           enters the

model in much the same way that fi does: an increase in ,       just   as an increase

in , raises the weight placed by Northern firms on Southern tastes.

Therefore, the comparative-statics results are much the same. The range of

innovations broadens unambiguously (dud1 -      dj/dy   > 0), and more of the

potential innovations particularly suited to Southern tastes are developed

(dG/d1 > 0). Some of the innovations at the other end may drop out if the

ten fl[B(-S) -   B(9-Sflc'   is sufficiently negative.

     (iv) Effects of Chanee in Tastes. Taste differences between the two

regions are captured here by the parameter S; the larger is 5, the greater the

taste difference. We would expect that as S increases, the range of

innovations becomes progressively more skewed away from Northern tastes. This

is indeed the case, as both the lower and upper bound of the range

unambiguously move to the right (i.e., dUdS > 0 and dl/dS > 0). Further,

one can show that when -yfl<a, we must have dUdS C 1 and dO/dS < 1.

     What about the number of innovations, or the size of the range? The

comparative-statics yield:
                                       -13-



(16) dudS - dUdS â€”    (afry/)[B'(j)B'(9-S)    -
                                                  B'(i)B'(L-Sfl,
                         (-)         (-)                (-)



whose sign looks ambiguous at first sight. With a symmetric distribution,

however, more can be said. Remember that the range of innovations EL, ui

will generally be skewed to the right relative to the mean of B(9) (due to the

South's influence). This allows us to gauge the relative slopes along the

distribution as follows: IB'(L)I >   IB'()I   and IB'(G-S)I >      IB'(L-S)I.
Therefore the first term in the square brackets dominates and the sign of the

expression must be Dositive. An increase in taste differences between the

North and South widens the range of innovations that are developed.

     To conclude this section, there is reason to think that there will be

both cooperative and non-cooperative elements in any North-South bargain over

patent protection. To some extent, patent protection in the North and South

are substitutes for each other, as either increases the incentive of Northern

firms to engage in innovative activity. The closer is y to unity, the greater

impact Southern patent protection has on the profitability of Northern

innovation. But Northern and Southern patents are imrerfect substitutes for

each other. Everything else being the same, both regions would prefer to have

the range of innovations be as congruent with their tastes and requirements as

possible. Southern patent protection, for example, not only increases the

range of innovations, but also skews it away from Northern preferences. As we

shall see, this may provide a rationale for the South to provide protection

even when the incentives to free ride on Northern patents are strong.

     In the rest of the paper, the comparative-statics results developed here

will play an important role. We draw attention in particular to the

significance of the ambiguity in the signs of dO/do and duds. A sufficient

condition for the reaction curves of the two regions to slope down in a Nash
                                             -14-

equilibrium will be that dO/da        >0   and dUdfl <   0.    We will treat this as the

benchmark. But when dJ/da <         0 and/or dUd$ > 0,        increased patent protection

in one region leads to the elimination of innovations that are more highly

favored in the other region compared to the those that are being stimulated.

In such circumstances, one or both of the reaction curves can slope up and

much of the conventional wisdom be reversed.

     Since nany of the analytical expressions we derive below are of ambiguous

sign, we will fortify our discussion of the channels at work with a set of

numerical simulations. Our simulations assume that consumer preferences in

the North are distributed according to the standard normal distribution, and

that the cost function is given by c(7-) â€”          [exp(i-j)]/2000.        In our central

case, S â€”   1.2   and y â€”   0.3.   That is, Southern tastes are assumed to be

centered 1.2 standard deviations away from the mean of Northern tastes, and

the South is taken to represent a market 30 percent as big as the North.

(These values ensure that the reaction functions are both negatively sloped

around the Nash equilibrium.) We will also refer to an alternative case with

more extreme taste differences, where S â€” 2 and y â€”              0.12,   in which the

Northern reaction function will be positively sloped.



IV. Welfare Analysis

     Suppose a benevolent global dictator were to assign patent rights to the

two regions in accordance with a conventional social welfare function. Would

she impose           rates of patent protection?

     To begin with, let the global welfare function (W) be written as an

equally-weighted sum of welfare in the two regions:
                                                     -15-




(17) W(j, )    â€”
                        [8(9) + fryB(9-S))d9              -
                                                              [9   -
                                                                       9]c(.) +   I
                   Jj
               â€” B(O)d9 + I 78(9-S)dO                     -
                                                              [7 - j]c(.).
                   Jj                 JL

Since we have two independent instruments, a and ,                          to    control two targets, j

and 9, we might as well assume that we can exercise direct control over the

range of innovations. The first-order conditions with respect to j and 9,

respectively, are:


(18) 8(j) +    7B(j-S)    -   c   -
                                      [7-j]c'    â€” 0,

(19) 8(9) + yB(9-S)       -   c   -
                                      [7-j]c'    â€” 0,


Setting (18) and (19) equal to each other yields:


(20) [8(j) -    B(7)J/[B(9-S)          -
                                           B(j-S)]    â€”


Hence the smaller is y, the less off-center is the range of innovations

relative to Northern tastes. Putting (20) together with equation (9), we are

left with the equality y â€”            y(fl/a),   which requires a â€”            . Therefore,    when the

global welfare function is strictly utilitarian, global optimality does indeed

require eauai levels of patent protection in the two regions. Note that this

holds irrespective of the sizes or tastes of the two regions.

     The explanation is as follows. Since we are maximizing total benefits in

the North and the South, the relative size of the South, y, also represents

the relative weight we place on its welfare. But firms weight the two regions

according to their relative profitability, which is captured by the ratio

-y(/a). Firm behavior coincides with social optimality only when a

     We can say more about the properties of the optimal levels of patent

protection. Substituting for c(.) from (5) and (6), we can rewrite equations
                                       -16-

(18) and (19) as follÃ³ws:


(18') (1-a)B(O) + (l-fl)yB(#-S) â€”   [l-j]c'
(19') (l-a)B(O) + (1-$)iB(7-S) â€”    [J-LJc'.

When costs are not increasing in the range of innovations (c'â€”O), the right-

hand side is zero, implying a â€”     â€” 1.   With constant costs, there are no

distortions in the market, and firms should be allowed to capture the entire

consumer surplus. Patent protection is complete. But when congestion effects

are present (c'>O), firms confer a negative externality on each other. Each

additional firm that enters drives up the costs of incumbents, so that if

patent protection were complete, there would be too many firms. In this case,

since the right-hand side of (18') and (19') is positive, social optimality

requires a â€”   fi C 1. Patent protection will be incomplete.
     This is, of course, a rather different story from that commonly given as

to why governments provide less than full patent protection. The usual

explanation has to do with reducing the monopoly power of fins to which

protection has been granted and enabling innovations to be readily diffused

after a fixed number of years. But, formally, these explanations can be

reconciled with the present framework. We could presume for example that, due

to technological spillovers, the research costs of each firm are a decreasing

function of the quantity of publicly available technology. As a and fi

increase,   patents become more restrictive and fewer technologies remain in the

public domain. Therefore, costs of all firms possibly increase.8 This is




8. More specifically, two effects can be identified as a and fi are raised.
The first, which argues in favor of patents, is that more research is
undertaken. The second, which argues against patents, is that less of it
becomes available to all firms and costs are not sufficiently reduced. When
patent protection is nearly complete, a small decrease can have second-order
effects in terms of the first, but first-order effects in terms of the second.
                                                          -17-

quite similar to the effect that operates in the present model.

       Now suppose that the global dictator is egalitarian, and that she values

the poor South's welfare more than the North's. How would this change the

relationship between the optimal a and fi?

       Let   the relative weight attached to the South's welfare be denoted ,

with   >l. Global welfare can now be written as



(21)    W(j, 7)     â€”I
                          (7

                         JL
                                    + fryB(9-S)]d9            -   (7 - jjc(.)   +   I
                                                                                    17
                                                                                        -r(l-fl)B(8-S)d8



                         17                17
                    â€”         B(6)dO +   ''I       78(9-S)d9 -     (7 -
                        J.                J.


where â€¢ â€”         - (-l)fl).        Note that â€¢ > 1 as long as fi               < 1.      Therefore the only

difference with the earlier objective function is that now the gsa benefits

of the South--gross in the sense that profit transfers to the North are not

included--receives a weight larger than one (f).                           The analogue of (20) now is


(20') (B(.) -           B(7)]/(B(8-S)          -
                                                    B(L-S)]
             â€”      - [-(1-a)(s          + v)fB(O-S)d9] [B(7-S) -


where        â€” dfl/de > 0 and v â€” dfl/dL > 0 (see the appendix). Notice that since

7 and L are now treated directly as policy variables, the two derivatives

and v refer to the implied changes in fi needed to bring about the desired

adjustments in the boundaries. (They are                                  derivatives,     as a is being

endogenously adjusted as well.) Putting this together with (9) and

simplifying, we get:


(22)    fi   â€” a,   with




This would call for incomplete patent protection.
                                                 -18-

        (1 â€”   [l+a(l)]1{ + (l-)(p + w)fB(9-S)dO                 [B(7-S) -
                 (+)                 (-)   (+)          (+)                (+)


Notice that       >    l+a(-l),    so that the effect of the first term in the curly

brackets (i.e. )        is   to raise ,8 relative to a. This comes from the desire to

skew the innovation range towards Southern tastes. But as fi                     increases,   so do

profit transfers to the North, and this effect is captured by the long second

term in the curly brackets, which is negative and subtracts from .                       Whether      1)



on the whole is bigger or smaller than unity cannot be determined a priori.

But the closer are Southern preferences to Northern ones, the greater the

likelihood that 0 will be less than one, and that $                 will   fall short of a.
This can be seen from (22): [B(7-S) -            B(j-S)J      becomes smaller (and hence its

inverse larger) as S goes to zero (see [9J)â€¢9 As Northern and Southern

preferences become more alike, then, the free-riding motive of the South

exerts a growing influence. But when Southern preferences for technology

differ substantially from those of the North, the globally optimal fi                   could
well exceed a.

      While the theoretical possibilities are unconstrained, numerical

simulations with the specifications described above yield the result that as $

is   increased, the optimal level of Northern protection consistently rises

while Southern protection falls. These results are diplayed in Table 1. With

sufficiently large ,         the   global planner would allow the South to have a

complete free ride.




9. There is of course nothing here that would stop $ from turning negative.
A planner who values the South's welfare sufficiently will in this case try to
enrich that region by engineering reverse profit transfers from the North,
while raising a to offset the adverse incentives on Northern R&D. It may be
natural to think of fi as being bound below by 0.
                                          -19-

     Therefore, when the global planner places more weight on the welfare of

the South, there is no longer any reason to equate a and .            But, unlike what
may have been expected, there is no general reason to let the South provide

lower levels of patent protection either. The planner has to trade off the

free-riding benefits to the South against the losses arising from reduced

levels of investment in technologies that are particularly appropriate to poor

countries.



V. The Nash Equilibrium

      In the enviroment described above, patent protection in each block

affects welfare in the other block. The questions we pose next are: What

sort of patent laws emerge in the North and in the South if each region reacts

to the other region's patent laws by optimizing over the level of patent

protection in its own market? How is this equilibrium affected by the size

and the taste preferences of the South? And how does it compare with the

Pareto-optimal patent protection administered by a benevolent dictator? To

answer these questions, we first develop the players' reaction functions under

the assumption of Nash behavior.

     (i) The Northern reaction function. The Northern planner choses a to

maximize social welfare (7), taking fi     as    given. Optimally, the marginal cost

of protection is set equal to the marginal benefit. We differentiate (7) with

respect to a, rearrange using (5) and (6) and set equal to zero:


 (23) W â€” (l-a)[B(8)9a    -
                              B(L)1   -
                                          c'[O-L][9a-1    â€”
                                                              0,

where we have introduced the following notation:           â€” d9/da,      â€”   dJda,
etc. The second term of (23) represents the positive marginal cost of

 increased protection, an expression that is proportional to the size of the

 innovation range [9-j and to the positive effect of a on the range
                                      -20-

The first term represents the net marginal benefit that accrues on both sides

of the range, and it is only (1-a) times the marginal consumer surplus (the

term in brackets) because a proportion a of the increase in consumer surplus

is dissipated in research costs by the marginal innovating firms. (Remember

that zero-profit conditions hold at the edges of the range.) The marginal

gain in consumer surplus due to an expansion of the range of innovations is

composed of two effects: the lower range necessarily expands (to the left)

after an increase in a, thus increasing welfare. The upper range generally

also expands (to the right) as fins can spread their cost on a larger base.

But, as discussed in section III, because costs increase with the range of

innovations, it is possible that the upper range retracts (to the left).

      Let a* stand for the North's optimal patent. When costs are not rising

(c'â€”O), (23) is always positive for ccl, implying that a*_l. This would be

the case where there are no congestion effects in R&D. But with costs

increasing with the range of research activity, a*<1 since at aâ€”l, the

expression in (23) is negative. Moreover, when $â€”0, a* is strictly positive,

since at aâ€”0, .â€”9 and the second term of (23) is zero while the first is

positive.

       How does the North react to an increase in protection in the South? In

general, but not always, the North will reduce protection in response, due to

two considerations: (i) at the margin the positive effect of Northern

protection on own welfare is attenuated, and (ii) research costs are increased

 as a result of higher fi. The ambiguity noted above with respect to the signs

 of    and ifl' however, imply that effect (i) does not always obtain, such

 that a decrease in a is sometimes desirable. To see that, apply the

 implicit function theorem to (23) to get:


        *       -   n    n
 (24) da/dfl        Wap/Waa
                                       -21-

where the denominator W is negative by the second order condition. Hence,

the slope of the reaction function in (24) has the same sign as the numerator

W. In order to evaluate the sign of W, we drop the terms corresponding

to second derivatives of . and lO on the assumption that these are likely

to be of second-order importance. W is then given by:


(25) W â€” (l-a)[B'(8)9a9      -   B'(L)4] -
where the first term captures effect (i) and the second captures effect (ii)

mentioned above. Expression (25) is negative in general, and positive only

when     is negative and large and/or ip   is   positive and large.

       The interpretation is as follows. In general, as the range of

 innovations widens, the marginal benefit of innovation drops on both sides of

 the range, discouraging protection. In this case, both this effect and the

 rising R&D costs contribute to a lessening of Northern protection. But when

 tastes are very different and a and    are far apart, increased Southern

 protection can enhance marginal benefits of an increase in a.        This can occur

                                        and large, an increase in        shifts the
 in two types of situations: when

 range away from Northern preferences and increased Northern protection can

 increase marginal revenue by recapturing the valuable technologies       that would

 be lost otherwise. And when 9<O and large enough, a reduction in a hurts the

 North by leading to the substitution of too many less valuable       innovations on

 the upper side of the range. In these cases, the positive effect on marginal

 revenue can overtake the negative effect on marginal costs and it is possible

 that an increase in will be met with an increase in a as the North attempts




  10. In other words we assume              7aa afl 0. This is somewhat
  analogous to the assumption of linear demand curves in standard oligopoly
  theory. We maintain this assumption throughout the paper.
                                           -22-

to shift the range of technologies away from Southern preferences.

    The more general case is clearest when North-South tastes coincide (i.e

Sâ€”.O). In this case, it is possible to show (see the appendix) that the

Northern reaction function becomes linear in Southern protection and that it

is unambiguously downard sloping. In particular, we get:


(26) da*/d â€”     - 1/7   < 0   (at S-0).


     (ii) The Southern reaction function. Similarly, we can derive the first-

order condition for the Southern planner and the reaction function with

respect to Northern protection. The problem is quite similar to the Northern

problem, with the difference that the cost of increased protection is an

increased transfer to foreigners rather than an increased cost of research.

Differentiating (8) with respect to fi and setting to zero, we have (assuming

an interior solution for ):



(27) W â€” -r(l-.8)[B(9-S)9      -
                                   B(-S)A8J
                                              -
                                                  ii B(O-S)dO â€”   0
                                                  J.


The second term represents the marginal cost of increased protection in terms

of higher payments to the innovating foreign firms. If there were no

offsetting positive effect to Southern patent protection, fl'         would of course
be optimally set to its lowest possible level as the South would simply free

ride on Northern innovations. However, there are in general gains associated

with protection and they are represented by the first term in equation (27).

An increase in     increases the range of innovations and tilts it towards

Southern tastes.'1 Note that the first term gets smaller with $,          since   only




11. The degree to which it does that depends, of course, in part on the
relative size of the Southern market,   (see section III).
                                            -23-

(1-fl) of the consumer surplus is captured by the South. In particular, the

marginal benefit of protection is zero at flâ€”i and therefore, fl* is necessarily

smaller than 1. Finally, note that fl can be zero in general but that it is

certainly positive when aâ€”C.       (This is because      > 0, when a â€”    â€” 0.)

      The slope of the Southern reaction function is given by:


(28) dfl*/da     -
                          /W
which- -because the denominator is negative- -has the same sign as the

numerator. Ignoring again the second order terms in and 9,                is given

by:


(29) Wfl â€”     (lfl)[B'(S)709fl    -
                                       B'(L-S)     -
                                                       (B(7S)7a   -
                                                                      B(O-S)
which is negative when a>O and/or .Q.fl<O. However, (29) could be positive and

it might be in the interests of the the South to react to stiffer Northern

protection by increasing its own protection. This would occur when: (j)

increased Northern protection shifts the range of innovations sufficiently

away from Southern tastes (7a.(O and large); and when (ii) at the margin, a

reduction in Southern protection would add on too many innovations on the

less-valuable lower end of the range (Lp)'O and large). Both situations are

more likely to occur when North-South preferences are quite different. Again

it is possible to show that with similar tastes (Sâ€”C):


(30) dfl*/da â€”    - 'y   < 0   (at Sâ€”0).


(See the appendix.)

      (iii) Comvarative statics. When the Nash game described above is played,

several types of equilibria may emerge, with both reaction functions sloping
                                            -24-

down, one of the reaction functions sloping up, or even both reaction

functions sloping up. Here we will focus on small changes around equilibria

in which both reaction functions slope down, presumably the case that best

describes the current situation. Even in this case, however, a range of

different comparative statics results are possible.

        (ijia) The effect of taste differences. When North-South preferences get

closer, both regions react by altering their levels of protection. There are

several effects at play here and the global effect of a change in tastes

cannot be completely determined. In order to describe the channels through

which relative preferences affect the final outcome, use the implicit function

theorem on (23) and (27) to get:

       *         n        n
(31) 3m /Ã˜S â€” - WaS /

(32) 3fl*/35      -
                      W / W.
These determine the direction of shifts in the respective reaction functions.

In both eqations, the expressions have the same sign as their numerators since

the denominators are negative when the second-order conditions of the

maximization problems are satisfied. The numerators are respectively given by:


(33) W â€” (l-a)[B'(9)665            -
                                       B'(6)45]      -



 (34)    W lfl)[B'(9S)(95l)6 -
                 - i[B(S)9s    -
                                       B(9S)5   -
                                                    5B'(e.S)dO].

        Let us first consider the effects of taste differences on Southern

 optimal protection. As North-South preferences get closer (i.e. S decreases),

 the South is affected through two channels, both of which generally discourage

 patent protection. (i) First, for a given level of protection, what must be
                                      -25-

paid to the foreign innovators increases as S decreases. This marginal cost

effect ia captured by the second term in (34): since protection becomes in a

sense more expensive, there are incentives to decrease it. In effect, as the

South becomes more similar to the North, its tax base becomes larger because

the existing technologies- -which are biased towards Northern tastes- -now

produce a higher consumer surplusJ2 (ii) Second, the marginal benefit of

innovations at the ends of the range generally decrease. This is captured by

the positive sign of the first term in (34). To see why, first remember that

the range of innovations gets smaller, and that it shifts to the left by less

than the shift in Southern preferences because the reduction in research costs

associated with the smaller range forces the marginal firms (at the ends of

the range) to service thinner markets. As a result, marginal welfare gets

smaller at 7, and higher at L. Since in general the first effect dominates,

the Southern reaction function will tend to shift to the left as S is reduced.

     As tastes get closer, the North is also affected through two channels.

(i) First, the range of innovations necessarily shrinks, reducing the fixed

cost of innovation for all technologies. This effect--captured by the second

term in (33)--encourages the North to increase innovation in its most prefered

technologies and this is achieved with higher protection.   (ii) The other

effect- -represented by the first term in brackets- -captures the change in

marginal welfare at the ends of the innovation range, and on net exerts a

depressing effect on domestic patent protection: the lower end of the range




12. To illustrate that, imagine that India and Brazil have similar rates of
patent protection, but that Brazilian technological needs are closer to those
of the North than is the case for India. Then the above considerations state
that, given Northern influences on the existing range of technologies, a
representative consumer in Brazil would have a larger consumer surplus and
would be paying larger royalties to foreign firms.
                                       -26-


widens (. decreases) allowing the North to capture new technologies that are

less valuable at the margin. This reduces the need for patent protection as,

in effect, the marginal productivity of protection falls. On the other hand,

the upper end of the range retracts, increasing the marginal benefits at         l3
This effect tends to encourage increased protection, but it is in general

smaller than the depressing effect at the lower end of the innovation range

(unless e5 is much larger than ts In sum, both the marginal cost and the

marginal benefit of protection are reduced and the reaction of the North will

depend on the relative importance of these effects.

       Figure 2 illustrates the possible outcomes when S    increases)4 As North-

South preferences get further apart, the Southern reaction function shifts up

while the Northern reaction function can either increase or decrease. The new

 equilibrium is either at a point like B or C, with higher fi      but   ambiguous

 results in the North, or at a point like D with higher a but lower fi.         The

 only general conclusion that can be drawn when both reaction functions are

 downward sloping is that at least one of the two regions must increase its

 protection when S gets larger. (Conversely, either a or fi must fall when S

 gets smaller.) In our simulations we find that fi    is   generally increased while

 a is fairly insensitive (decreasing slightly at first, but then increasing) as

 S becomes larger (see Table 2). Table 2 also diplays the possibility that the

 South may choose higher levels of protection than the North if the taste

 differences become pronounced enough (and the Northern reaction function

 becomes positively sloped).

        (iiib) Changes in relative market size. A change in the relative size of




 13. Note that this effect goes the other way when          < 0.

 14.  This is drawn for the stable case where the South's reaction function is
 more steeply sloped than the North's.
                                                -27-

the Southern market also has ambiguous effects on the equilibrium strategies

when both reaction functions slope down. It is easy to verify that in that

case


  Ã¤a*/37       -W/W=            -          /   1W   < 0,

  8*/8,y â€” - W.y/W
                                    -                +
                                                         [B(-S)i    -   B(9-S)9p])/W < 0
       â€”
           fl((l-)[B'(L-S).p2           B'(8S)92]
In words, the reactions functions of both regions shift back when increases.

Hence, the level of patent protection must decline in at least one of the two

regions. This implies that, somewhat paradoxically, an increase in the size

of the South can lead to reduced protection in                      the North and the South.

From the North's perspective, as the Southern market enlarges, the range of

innovation widens beyond the most desirable level and it may make sense to

reduce (costly) protection. But the South may have been expected to always

increase , as the costs of free riding now apparently become larger. This is
not so because an increase in 1 also increases the benefits of free riding, as

 the profit transfers at the margin increase commensurately--see the South's

 first-order condition (27). Moreover, since -y and                     are substitutes for each

 other in determining the technology range, it may be rational for the South to

 use the extra leverage provided by the increase in its market                   size to reduce

 profit transfers to the North (via a reduction in ).

        Table 3 shows some simulation outcomes for the benchmark case. These are
 generally in line with conventional wisdom. As v                  is   reduced, the South

 progressively reduces fi, and eventually stops protection al,ogether.

           (iv) The inefficiency of the Nash eouilibrium. We end by demonstrating

 that the Nash equilibrium is inefficient from the global standpoint.                    This is
                                                           -28-

natural, given the spillovers involved. Protection in any one region profits

the other region (when reaction functions are downward sloping). Since

neither side takes into account these spillovers, there is likely to be too

little innovation. However, other possible effects go the other way: in

particular, with a and fi       different              enough, wasteful competition sets in, and

may lead to too much protection in both blocks.

      To illustrate the effects at work, we evaluate the marginal (equally-

weighted) welfare of our benevolent global dictator                                the Nash equilibrium.
Differentiating (17) with respect to a and then fi,                         we have:



(35) Wp â€” [B(7) +      B(9-S)     -        c    -
                                                    (7-Vc')p
            + [-8(9)     -
                             -yB(-S)        + c Ã· (O-9)c']9

(36) Wa =   [8(7) + B(7-S)         -       c    -
                                                    (7-j)c']ia
            +   [-8(j)   -
                             8(j-S)            + c +    (7-j)c').
To evaluate (36) at the Nash equilibrium, we plug in (23). Then, provided that

    0 (which is a sufficient but not necessary condition), the resulting

expression can be shown to be positive for all $<l, including fl'                            of   the Nash

equilibrium:


 (37) Wa â€” [aB(7) +      ,8(7-S)       -
                                               c)9a    -
                                                           [aB(j)   +   yB(j-S)   -
                                                                                      c1.
The expressions in the square brackets are positive from the zero-profit

conditions (5)-(6). Thus, the North is generally underpatented from a world

welfare point of view. The reason for that is simply that the Northern

 decision makers do not take into account the positive externality that

 innovations produce in the South. Note that when fl=l, (37) is equal to zero

 (using [5) and [6]). Only in this limiting case is the Northern patent optimal
                                       -29-

from a global point of view.

     But it may be possible for the North to be overpatented. This can occur

when a.<0 and large. In this case, there is wasteful competition in

protection as the North would be trying to shift the range of innovations

towards its most preferred technologies.

     The analysis is quite similar for the South. To evaluate (35) at the Nash

equilibrium, plug in (23) and (27), and rearrange to get:


(38) Wp â€”   (l-a)[B(9)ea   -
                               B()][(9/9) (/_)) + 1fB(9S)d9.
                                              -




which is generally positive (when >O and <O). Thus, in general, the South

is underprotected because it ignores the positive effect of protection on

Northern welfare. In particular, it is easy to verify that at Sâ€”O (38) is

unambiguously positive. However it is once again possible that the South wil1

be overprotected when 9>O and/or g.<O.



VI. Concludina Remarks

     While the model analyzed here is quite simple, it leads to a rich array

of comparative-statics results, some of which may appear counter-intuitive at

first sight. This is largely due to our emphasis on the dimension of

technological choice: some of the usual free-riding considerations have to be

qualified when we take into account the possibility that patent laws in the

two regions affect not only the quantity of innovation, but also its quality.

This becomes important when the two regions have differing technological

needs. On the other hand, when the two regions are identical in preferences,

the usual conclusions can be recovered.

     The analysis leads to several results, some of which can be listed as
                                     -30-

follows. First, an increase in patent protection in any of the two regions

leads to an increase in innovative activity, as well as a greater fit between

the available technologies and the preferences of the patenting region. By

implication, this skews the technology range away from the neEds of the other

region. Second, while a strictly utilitarian global welfare function would

assign identical rates of patent protection to the North and South, placing

greater weight on the welfare of the South necessitates differential

treatment. But it is not clear a orion whether the South ought to have a

lower or higher level of protection than the North. Third, when patent rules

are set in an uncoordinated manner, it is possible that a narrowing of the gap

between the technological preferences of the two regions will lead to lower

rates of patent protection in both the North and the South. Similarly, an

increase in the relative market size of the South can lead to a reduction in

patent protection in both regions.

     Theoretical possibilities aside, our numerical simulations yield results

in the benchmark case that are generally in line with intuition. In

particular, we find that: (i) a benevolent global planner which places greater

weight on the South's welfare would require a higher level of patent

protection in the North; (ii) in an uncoordinated equilibrium, a reduction in

taste differences between the two regions would reduce patent protection in

the South; and (-iii) an increase in the relative market size of the South,

again in the absence of coordination, would increase Southern patents. In the

 latter two cases, we find Northern patents to be generally insensitive to the

 changes mentioned.

                                                   APPENDIX

(a) We start by deriving the comparative statics properties of equations (5)

and (6), when the endogenous variables are 9 and .                       Total    differentiation

yields:


               aB'(O) + pz(e-s) + c'                  -c'     d
               c'      aB'(9) + y'(O-S) -               c'    dO


                     -B(j)da -   B(-S)d           -
                                                      flB(-S)dy   + yZ'(j-S)dS

                     -B(9)da -   7B(9-S)dfi       -
                                                      flB(9-S)d7 + iB'(9-S)dS

The determinant of the system, denoted by ii,                  is   negative.



(b) Consider next the alternative wherein a and fi                     are   treated as endogenous

targeted on specific 9 and ..                Notice     that da/d9, for example, is not simply

the inverse of d/da as different variables are being held constant in each

case; in the first case, fi            is   free to vary but j is parametric; in the latter,

L   adjusts    endogenously while fi         is   held fixed. The system now looks like:


       -B(s)        -7B(-S)       da                  [aB'(L) + yB'(.-S) Ã· c']d -      c'd
       -B() -78(9-S)              d$                  c'd + (aB'(9) + 7'(9-S) -


The determinant of the system is positive since B(9-S) > B(9) and 6(9) >

B(8-S). It can be shown therefore that ( + w)                         (dfl/d9 + d/d) is

unambiguously positive.



(c) The second-order conditions for the Northern and the Southern

maximization problems are respectively:


(Al) Wa â€”           (la)[B(9)O2        -
                                            B().2] - (9i)[c'            + c"(O-)J < 0.

(A2) W â€” y(l-fl)[B'(9-S)92 - B'(9-S)42]                       -
                                                                   27[B(7-S)7
                                                                                 -
                                         -32-




which is necessarily negative when              Otherwise, it is possible that (A2)

will be positive, implying that fl goes to the corner solution fl*_O.



(d) Using (10), (11), (13) and (14), it is easy to verify that when Sâ€”0:

               -;   8s
                         â€”           â€”      and B'(O) â€”   -'(L). Plugging
those relationships into (25), (29), (Al) and (A2), (24) reduces to (26),

and (28) becomes (30). In general, a Nash equilibrium does not exist in this

case, as both reaction functions have the same slope.
