Aging, Output Per Capita and Secular Stagnation

                                         ABSTRACT

This paper re-examines the relationship between population aging and economic growth. We
confirm previous research such as Cutler, Poterba, Sheiner, and Summers (1990) and Acemoglu
and Restrepo (2017) that show positive correlation between measures of population aging and
per-capita output growth. Our contribution is demonstrating that this relationship breaks down
when the adjustment of interest rates is inhibited by an effective lower bound on nominal rates as
took place during the Great Financial Crisis decade. Indeed, during the “secular stagnation
regime” of 2008-2015 that prevailed in a number of countries, aging had a negative impact on
living standards, consistent with the secular stagnation hypothesis.

    1. Introduction
Over the last few decades a considerable literature has emerged focusing on the role of
demographic change on growth. This is not surprising. An American woman reaching a
childbearing age in 1960 would expect 3.6 children; an identical woman would expect 1.9
children in 1990. Today this number stands at 1.8. Moreover, this is not only a US phenomenon,
but a worldwide one, and is tightly connected with growing pessimism about future potential
growth rates. At the same time life expectancy has increased considerably. The population is
aging.

Cutler, Poterba, Sheiner, and Summers (1990, hereafter CPSS) identify aging as having at least
three effects on output per capita. 1) It reduces the fraction of active workers in the population
thereby reducing output per capita, 2) it can increase capital per worker via capital deepening
potentially offsetting the first effect, and 3) it can induce a positive technical change due to a
relative labor force scarcity that triggers labor saving and technological innovation thus
increasing total factor productivity (TFP) that also may offset 1).

At the most basic intuitive level, and this is prevalent in the popular discussion, one might think
that the first force is of primary importance. Clearly, as the population ages, there are relatively
fewer members of the population that are part of the active workforce. Hence, holding other
factors of production fixed, and treating technology as exogenous, one should expect a decline in
GDP growth per capita of a gradually aging economy.

As suggested by CPSS, however, one can make a theoretical argument supporting the opposite
conclusion via 2) and 3), moreover CPSS present some empirical evidence in support of 2) and
3) being generally dominant. More recently, Acemoglu and Restrepo (2017, hereafter AR)
present additional empirical evidence suggesting that aging across countries is indeed NOT
associated with a decline in output growth per capita contrary to the popular perception. If
anything the opposite applies under variety of empirical specifications. The evidence AR
introduce is based upon a positive correlation between the increase of the ratio of old to young
people and per-capita output growth post 1990. Their explanation of this phenomenon is 3).

AR and CPSS 3) basic argument dates back at least to Habakkuk (1962). He argued that
incentives to innovate are strongest when labor is scarce relative to other factors of production,
suggesting that industrialization proceeded faster in America than in England in the 19th century
because attractive agricultural opportunities raised the price of labor in the US relative to in
England. Later Clarke and Summers (1980) amplified and qualified this argument while Romer
(1990) incorporated it into an endogenous growth model. AR provide an alternative model and
connect this force with increasing atomization starting in 1990.

AR interpret their empirical evidence as contradicting the so-called secular stagnation hypothesis
(see Summers (2013, 2014) or Eggertsson and Mehrotra (2014)) because the secular stagnation
hypothesis is often tied to aging as one explanatory force, while the secular stagnation itself is a
story about sub-par output growth. Here we revisit AR evidence and argue the opposite, i.e., we
argue that the AR empirical evidence support the secular stagnation hypothesis rather than
contradicting it.

Essentially, our argument boils down to two central points.

First, in order to explain that aging is correlated with higher output growth per capita one does
not need to assume that labor scarcity leads to improvement in TFP as in 3). Instead, as stressed
in CPSS, another natural explanation is that aging is coupled with capital deepening as in 2)
associated with lower full employment real interest rates. Interest rates have been continuously
declining since 1990 consistent with this explanation. Alone, we will see, this effect can
theoretically be strong enough to explain the patterns observed in the data, and we use cross
country empirical evidence to argue that this mechanism played an important role.

The second point, which is perhaps more interesting and novel to most readers, relates to the
connection of the underlying empirical evidence to the secular stagnation hypothesis. Implicit in
2) is the assumption that the real interest rate can flexibly adjust downwards so as to
accommodate capital deepening. The point of the secular stagnation hypothesis is that interest
rates cannot always adjust downwards, for example, due to the zero lower bound (ZLB) on
nominal interest rates. The main prediction of the secular stagnation hypothesis, thus, is that
those countries that were aging faster in 2008, and experiencing low inflation, should have had
larger “excessive savings”, on average, and thus experience a deeper recession post 2008 if they
hit the ZLB. We show that this prediction of the secular stagnation hypothesis is supported in
cross country data and is statistically significant. We elaborate on this result by considering
various estimation techniques beyond a basic regression.

The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 shows the key empirical result looking at raw cross
country correlations. The focus of this section is that aging has positive effect on output growth
per capita prior to 2008 and reverses sign in the period after for those countries that hit the ZLB.
The proposed mechanism operates via capital deepening and lower real interest rates. We show
supportive evidence that aging has in fact triggered more accumulation of capital prior to 2008
using cross country evidence on capital accumulation, consistent with our hypothesis. Similarly,
we show evidence that for countries that hit the ZLB the correlation switches sign, and aging
start having negative effect on capital accumulation. Section 3 shows that our results are robust
to introducing a variety of controls, such as regional dummies, and to implementing an IV
regression approach suggested by AR. Section 4 presents a minimalistic and stripped down
general equilibrium model that shows how the empirical findings can be interpreted in the
context of the secular stagnation hypothesis. The model features two stark “regimes”. The first
is a “neoclassical regime” in which the economy operates according to the standard neoclassical
logic and aging triggers capital deepening, i.e. real interest rate is able to flexibly adjust. The
other is a “Keynesian regime” in which the neoclassical adjustment is prevented by the ZLB,
predicting a reversal in the correlation between aging and output growth and capital deepening,
consistent with the cross country evidence we show in section 2 and 3. A key contribution of this
section is a minimalistic formalization of the secular stagnation hypothesis that is rich enough to
speak to the new evidence. Section 5 concludes.

In this section we show the key correlations before turning to various robustness checks and
controls. The data we use is GDP and capital stock per capita from Penn World Table. Aging
data is from the United Nations. Data on risk-free nominal interest rate was obtained from IMF
International Financial Statistics Database (IFS).
Figure 1A shows a scatterplot of 168 countries plotting change in aging against GDP growth.
The measure of aging is the change in the ratio of those above 65 to those between 20-65. The
measure of growth is the change in (log) GDP per capital from 1990-2015. The figure plots an
ordinary least square regression line. Table 1, column (1), shows that the slope is positive,
suggesting a weakly positive relationship between aging and growth, as documented in
Acemoglu and Restrepo (2017). We justify this aging measure, and consider alternatives, in the
next sub-section along with several robustness tests.

Figure 1B and 1C show the same correlation but splitting the sample in half, before and after
2008. It shows aging from 1990-2008 relative to output growth during this period in 1B and from
2008-2015 in 1C. In 2008 several countries hit the zero lower bound. Table 1, Panel A, column
(2) and (3) show respectively that the regression line becomes steeper in the period prior to 2008,
and switches sign post 2008. In contrast to Figure 1A the regressions are now statistically
significant.

Table 1, Panel A column (4), presents the same regression as in Figure 1C for those countries
that were constrained by the ZLB during 2008-2015 in comparison with those that were not
(column (5)). As the table makes clear, it is the ZLB countries that are driving the negative and
statistically significant slope reported in Figure 1C. We define countries as having been
constrained by the ZLB if the short-term nominal interest rate was below 1.5% at any point
during this period. We consider alternative cut-off criteria in the next section.
Figure 2: Short and long term interest rate since 1990

At the heart of the secular stagnation interpretation of this evidence is that aging triggers a
reduction in real interest rate, which in turn lead to a capital depending (the precise mechanism is
formalized in section 4). There is a growing literature that documents this mechanism in the
context of quantitative overlapping generation models (OLG), we present a stylized example in
section 4.2 The idea, then, is that the ZLB prevents this adjustment from happening. Consistent
with this view, Figure 2 shows that real interest rates have been falling throughout the industrial
world over this period, but this is also a period in which the countries in question have been
experiencing aging populations.3
The first part of our main hypothesis is that the reduction in the real interest rate, if
unconstrained, should lead to capital deepening. Table 1, Panel B shows that aging is indeed
associated with capital deepening during the sample period 1990-2015. The dependent variable
is now the change in capital per working age adult rather than output per capita. Since our
proposed mechanism works through lower real interest rate, the second part of the hypothesis
predicts a breakdown in 2008 once the ZLB became binding in a number of countries. We once
again split the sample between before 2008 and after. Again we see that this relationship is
driven by the period before 2008 (column (2)) rather than the latter period (column (3)) where
the coefficient on aging switches sign. As in our earlier exercise, the switch in sign is explained
by those countries that were at the ZLB (column (4) and (5)).

    3. Alternative Empirical Specifications, Controls and an IV Regression
We consider a variety of controls, and then move onto different measures of aging and also
contemplate different measure of the dependent variable, most of the latter robustness checks is
relegated to the Appendix. Statistical significance is strengthened under some specifications,
weakened in others. Of most interest to us is the fact that the correlation between aging and

Robbins (2017), Gagnon, Johannsen, and Lopez-Salido (2016).

 A simple regression of our aging variable to a proxy of real interest rate suggest that these variables are negatively
correlated across countries.
  output growth becomes negative at the ZLB, and that this result survives with variety of controls
  and different aging and/or other choices of the dependent/independent variables.

Notes: The table presents long-differences estimates of the impact of aging on GDP per capita in constant dollars from the Penn World Tables for
all countries (columns 1 to 5) and OECD countries (columns 6 to 8). Aging is defined as the change in the ratio of the population above 65 to the
population between 20 and 64. Columns 5 and 8 present IV estimates in which we instrument aging using the birthrate in 1960, 1965, …, 1980. The
bottom rows indicate additional controls included in the models but not reported: The population and age structure controls include the log of the
population and the initial value of our aging measure. We report standard errors robust to heteroscedasticity in parentheses.


  In Table 2, Panel A, we consider how the results are affected by introducing controls to the
  baseline regression. We follow AR closely in choice of controls. The first control (2) is an initial
  value for (log) GDP per capita in 1990 which makes the baseline regression 1990-2015
  statistically significant, a result that still carries through once we introduce controls for
  population and age structure in 1990 (column (3)). Column (4) includes a set of dummies for
  World Bank “regions” (Latin America, East Asia, South Asia, Africa, North Africa, Middle East,
  Central Asia, and Developing countries). Column (5) estimates the same relationship using
birthrates for the 1960, 1965, 1970, 1975 and 1980 as instrument for the demographic change
variable. Columns (6) - (8) reports the same regression for only 35 OECD countries. Overall,
Table A1, Panel A in the Appendix, is simply a verification of AR result for a variety of different
controls. The bottom-line is unchanged. Contrary to commonly held perception, aging is not
associated with lower growth for GDP. If anything, it is the other way around under various
specifications as stressed by AR.

Table 2, Panel B and C illustrate our new evidence already reported in the basic correlations. The
slope of the regression line changes in the latter half of the sample once we split the sample
between 1990-2008 and 2008-2015, i.e., once we distinguish between the two “regimes” of
neoclassical adjustment vs secular stagnation. This result also applies using the same controls as
in AR. The most relevant bottom line, perhaps, is the first line column (4) in Table 2, Panel C.
The negative correlation between aging and GDP growth in the period 2008-2015 is still there
once all AR suggested controls are added, and the result is statistically significant, even if the
coefficient goes down in absolute value. Moving to column (5) of Table 2, Panel C we use an
instrumental variables approach using as instrument the birthrate in 1960, 1965, …, 1980 as AR.
This approach still shows a switch in sign from statistically positive in Table A1, Panel B to a
negative point estimate in Table A1, Panel C (which in turn is not statistically significant). While
the main results are for all countries, we also report the OECD country subsample both with all
controls (7) and using the instrumental variables (8). The result for the OECD subsample is
consistent with the overall message under either specification in the period 2008-2015 when the
ZLB was an issue in large parts of the world. We see a more negative correlation between output
growth and aging as suggested by the secular stagnation hypothesis.

To explore robustness further we move to different measures of aging with results tabulated in
the Appendix. AR use workers over 50 relative to those 20-50. In our context we prefer a 65
cut-off because the main mechanisms we are looking for has to do with retirement and life
expectancy and how this changes the relative demand and supply for savings, as clarified further
in the model of the next section. AR theoretical mechanism, instead, has to do with the ratio of
older to younger workers and the implied effect on automation. Tables A1 replicates AR finding
using their preferred age cut-off. The correlation between aging and output growth per capita is
once again positive. Again, however, it is driven by the period 1990-2008, while the correlation
switches sign and becomes statistically significant splitting the sample into the two regimes.
Table A2 in the Appendix, shows that nothing changes when adding controls, using this
alternative age cutoff.

As a third measure of aging, that is perhaps a little more direct, we replace our previous measure
of aging with the change in labor input, defined as the change in the number of people 20-65
relative to all adults. Table A3 in the Appendix, reports the basic correlation. A drop-in labor
input measured this way actually increases output per capita over the sample period, but once
again it is driven by the capital deepening period 1990-2008. The sign is flipped post 2008. Table
A4 in the Appendix, adds same controls as we have previously done.

We also consider as a measure of output, not output per capita, but instead output per member of
the population above 20, which is a slightly more natural in the context of the model outlined in
the next section, since children are not making meaningful economic savings decisions. Here,
again, we use the labor input variable as an explanatory variable. Table A5 and A6 in the
Appendix, show that the results are stronger with this specification. Nevertheless, we stick to our
benchmark for the sake of comparison to the other literature and because the aging parameter in
our main specification maps directly into the model we outline below.

We consider two additional robustness checks on the baseline correlations. Table A7 in the
Appendix, considers evidence of secular stagnation outside of OECD. Out of the 168 countries in
our baseline sample 133 are not in the OECD. Of those 133 then 14 experienced what we define
as a secular stagnation, i.e. they were constrained by the ZLB. Table A7 shows that the same
basic results apply if we only consider non-OECD countries. The basic correlation between
aging and per-capita output growth is positive in the whole sample period but breaks down if we
split it into the two sub-periods. Moreover, the breakdown is driven by the ZLB countries.
Finally Table A8 in the Appendix considers if our results are sensitive to having picked 1.5% as
a benchmark for what we define as a country that is constrained by the ZLB, using as alternative
0.5%, 1.0%, and 2.0%. As shown in the Table 8 the number of countries that fit the criteria is
reduced from 42 to 37 and 34 respectively when reducing the cut-off point to 1% and 0.5%,
while it is increased to 53 when it is increased to 2%. The negative correlation (i.e. the reversal
from the positive baseline correlation) remains statistically significant when 1.0% is used as cut-
off but loses statistical significance once 0.5% is used as then the number of countries shrinks in
the ZLB sample. Meanwhile, statistical significance is maintained if the cut-off is increase to 2%
but the absolute value of the correlation goes down.

While some general caution in interpreting cross country evidence is in order, the significance of
the result is somewhat surprising, at least in the context of the secular stagnation hypothesis. The
genesis of the secular stagnation hypothesis has never been that aging is the only driving force
between imbalances between desired investment and saving. Instead, it has been proposed as one
of several candidates, including an increase in inequality, debt deleveraging, fall in relative price
of investment, fall in productivity to mention but a few candidates.4 In theory aging can correlate
with these other factors, complicating inference. We next turn to how the correlations we have
just reported can be interpreted more explicitly in the context of a simple general equilibrium
model of secular stagnation.

       4. A Minimalistic Model to Interpret the Empirical Results

4.A 1990-2008: Modeling Capital Deepening
We first consider a simple model that rationalizes Figure 1A, i.e., aging leading to a decline in
real interest rates and capital deepening that can be strong enough to explain an increase in GDP
per capita even when the labor input is decreasing. Consider an overlapping generation model
with two generations, young and old. The young earn labor income, the old do not. The young
                                                                                                   #
can invest in capital and sell in old age for retirement. A generation born at time t is of size 𝑁"
and has the utility function

where 𝑤" is the real wage rate, 𝑙 ̅ is a fixed labor endowment and 𝑘"1, is the capital saving of
the young that can be used for production in the next period, and 𝜏" is tax. The budget constraint
of the old is

         9
where 𝑅"1,   is the gross return on capital. For simplicity capital fully depreciates, even if this is
not essential. The growth rate of the population is 1 + 𝑔" and we denote the number of the old by
𝑁"2 . Defining an aging parameter as the ratio of old versus young at time t we get
                                              2               #

We further assume 𝜎 = 1, specializing in log utility, but comment on how different values of 𝜎
matter and illustrate the relevant algebra in the Web Appendix. The young satisfy a consumption
Euler Equation while the old consume all their income. Firms are perfectly competitive and have
constant return to scale Cobb-Douglas production function 𝑌" = 𝐾"? 𝐿,-?  "  , thus satisfying standard
neoclassical first order conditions. An equilibrium is now defined as when the demand and
supply of capital are equated as detailed in the Web Appendix. As the model is of exponential
                                                                                  FJ

                                                                       C
                                                                           ≡ 𝑙𝑜𝑔 GHIL   and 𝑅B"1,
                                                                                              9

𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑅"1,  etc. The central logic is most easily seen by studying a steady state, denoting it by
omitting time subscript, in which case we can write the demand and supply for capital as5

and

                                       𝛽                    ?     𝛼

that are plotted up in Figure 3A. The interpretation of the demand for savings is straight forward.
The demand for capital is higher the lower is 𝑅B 9 as shown in the figure, as capital becomes
relatively cheaper for firms. The aggregate supply of capital is also downward sloping, but with a
steeper slope.6 An increase in aging will shift out the supply of capital, thus increasing the supply
of capital available to any given young worker, and thus moving along the aggregate demand
curve, increasing the demand for capital at lower real interest rate, moving from point A to point

  The reason is that the young are earning more income, with the higher capital stock in the steady state, and thus
supplying more savings in equilibrium. The strength of this effect does depend on 𝜎 = 1 (which determines the
relative strength of the income and substitution effect). With high enough 𝜎 then the supply curve for capital can be
upward sloping, and thus the effect is not as strong, albeit with the same sign.
A’. Accordingly aging leads to a reduction in the real interest rate via a capital deepening, and a
higher capital labor ratio. The strength of this effect on the capital labor ratio depends on the
capital share in the economy, and more generally on 𝜎. Unambiguously, however, aging leads to
higher output per worker. Intuitively, aging means that there is more savings floating around in
form of capital per young worker entering the workforce due to the relative higher number of
older people whose savings is in form of productive capital, hence the higher output per worker.
What about output per capita? There are two offsetting forces at play. On the one hand output
per worker increases as already shown. On the other hand, labor force per capita decreases.
                                   TU                   TU
Denoting output per capital by 𝑦 and its log with 𝑦V , we can express the difference between
two steady states (denoting the second by ‘) as

                                         TU                              1 + 𝐴W
                                      𝑦VW − 𝑦V TU = 𝛼X𝑘BW − 𝑘B Y − log
                                                                         1+𝐴

where the first term is positive and reflects higher capital per worker in the new steady state,
while the second term reflects the reduction in labor input due to aging, which is negative.
Substituting the solution for 𝑘B derived from the equilibrium depicted in Figure 3A we obtain7

                                Kc
A is the measure of aging KL , so this condition is saying that the first effect is larger than the
                         ?       Kc
second as long as ,-? > Kc 1KL . We report a more general formula in the Appendix illustrating
that this condition is more likely to be satisfied the higher is 𝜎. A higher value of this parameter
will in general lead to further capital deepening.
The bottom-line, then, is that the empirical pattern observed in Figure 1, is predicted by a
standard neoclassical OLG model under various parameter configurations, even if one can think
of a parameter configuration in which it does not apply. We obtain a stronger prediction in the
next subsection at the ZLB in which case aging always has negative effects on output growth.
Here it can go either way.
The key observation, however, and regardless of which effect is dominating, is that the capital
deepening requires the real interest rate to decline and the intensity of this effect depends on 𝜎.
In dynastic or representative agent models the real interest rate is fixed at 𝛽 -, in steady state
while here it is pinned down by the relative supply and demand for capital which is governed,
among other things, by aging. In principle, there is nothing that says that the real interest rate has
to be positive (i.e. the gross rate 𝑅9 bigger than 1). This is precisely what the secular stagnation
literature is all about. It says that if the real interest rate needed to make investment equal to
savings is negative at full employment, and there are limits to which the interest rate can be
adjusted, for example due to the zero-lower bound, the economy will experience a recession.

4.B 2008-2016: Secular Stagnation


7
    The last equality sign is approximated around A’=A.
The fundamental mechanism that generates secular stagnation is that the real interest rate cannot
adjust to equate investment and savings at full employment. This is the sense in which it
describes “excessive savings”. In order to capture this idea, we need some reasons that prevent
the real interest rate to fall enough. The most straightforward way of doing so is to introduce the
zero-lower bound on the nominal interest rate, together with some additional assumptions we
clarify shortly.
The way monetary policy is typically introduced in this setting, and a tradition we follow, is to
assume that the government can issue paper currency and through that the central bank controls
the short-term nominal interest rate, 𝑖" , via open market operations in risk-free government short-
term bonds (see e.g. Woodford (2003)). The price of this bond satisfies on the Euler equation

                                          1                 1   -,
                                           # = (1 + 𝑖" )𝛽𝐸" 2 Π"1,
                                         𝐶"                𝐶"1,

                 gGHI
where Π"1, ≡            is inflation, and 𝑃" the price of the consumption goods in terms of money.
                  gG
Similarly, there is an arbitrage equation between the one period risk-free bond and the return on
capital given by
                                            1   -,
                                                            1 9

                                          𝐶"1,             𝐶"1,

Adding these two pricing equations does not change the model we have already stated absent
other assumption. It simply gives a theory of the price level once we add a more detailed
                                                                        9
description of monetary and fiscal policy8. The real interest rate 𝑅"1,     is the same as in the model
analyzed in the last section, and so is output per capita and capital.
A theory of stagnation arises from the assumption that inflation cannot adjust freely. This allows
monetary policy to directly affect the real interest rate, i.e. the return to capital, via the nominal
interest rate and may prevent investment from matching savings at full employment. Recall that
the reduction in the real interest rate was exactly the key mechanism by which capital deepening
took place in response to aging in the previous section. But why can inflation not adjust freely?
To illustrate the basic secular stagnation mechanism we impose that the nominal wage is fixed at
some 𝑊j to start with, a case in which the firms may not employ the entire labor endowment
and assume that labor is rationed equally across all workers.9
The major implication of fixing the nominal wage rate, relative to last section, is that output is
now demand determined. Below we consider a constant solution in which 𝑖 = 0, i.e. again, we
abstract from transition dynamics, which are not central to the point, and focus on a stable
secular stagnation equilibrium that can last for an arbitrary number of periods absent changes in
the forcing variables. Output is determined by writing aggregate spending as

                                                 𝑌 = 𝐶+𝐼+𝐺

  For expositional simplicity we assume that net government debt here is zero, the more general case is for example
treated in Eggertsson and Mehrotra (2014).
9
  More flexible specifications for wage setting see Eggertsson and Mehrotra (2014).
It simplifies things to assume log utility, i.e., 𝜎 = 1. The consumption of the young and old can
be derived to yield an aggregate consumption function

                               ,                     ,                         ,-?                  ,

We can use the first order condition of the representative firm with respect to capital to derive
the demand for investment, yielding an aggregate investment function

                                                                𝛼𝑌

                                                                𝑅9

At a superficial level the aggregate consumption function looks like an old fashion Keynesian
consumption function in which aggregate demand depends upon a fraction of aggregate income
net of the tax burden. Underlying it, however, is an intertemporal optimization problem, in which
the labor income of the young is a fixed proportion (1 − 𝛼) of total output10. Meanwhile the old
consume all their income which is entirely derived from capital and thus in proportion 𝛼 to total
output Y. The investment function also looks old Keynesian. If the interest rate declines, i.e. the
gross return on capital 𝑅9 , then the firms demand more capital for a given level of output Y.
Putting the pieces together, and dividing by the total population, we arrive at aggregate demand
in per capita terms given by

                                   pq
                                           1−𝛼        TU

where we have assumed that the budget is balanced in every period to substitute out for taxes.
What we have written here is simply the spending for each agent in the economy, for a given
level of production11. The consumer (young and old) will spend according to the first term, the
firm capital expenditures are captured by the second, and each derived from the respective
maximization problems of the underlying agents. Finally, government spending makes an
appearance where balanced budget has been imposed for simplicity. Observe that the steps we
have taken have not required us to make any assumptions, as of yet, about the wage setting12.
The assumption of nominal frictions gives this equation a new life because it implies that the real
interest rate cannot adjust to increase investment enough to match “desired savings”. To be more
specific, consider a secular stagnation equilibrium in which the nominal interest rate is zero,
prices constant, so that 𝑅9 = 1 yielding to

                                              1−𝛼      𝛼          𝛽

10
   This follows from the assumption of perfectly competitive firms and Cobb-Douglas production. This implies that
output is split between output and capital in fixed shares.
11
   It is important here, that we assume that government spending, and thus taxes, is a fixed fraction of full
employment output, see Web Appendix for details.
12
   The same equation applies in the model in the last section. If we replace each of the 𝑦′𝑠 with the flexible wage
output derived in last section, this equation yields an expression for the implied real interest rate at flexible wages.
which is plotted up in Figure 3B13.




Figure 3A: Aging and capital per worker                              Figure 3B: Aging and secular stagnation



Figure 3B plots aggregate demand, 𝑦 pq , using the latter equation as an aggregate demand
function of any given level of production 𝑦 TU . The amount of output demanded of consumption
by consumers, and of capital by firms, as we have just seen in last equation, can directly be
related to the aggregate production level. The 45-degree line, then, is the observation that in
equilibrium it must be the case that aggregate spending has to be equal to the production itself.
This gives an equilibrium at point A.

This gives us a simple way of seeing the effect of aging in a secular stagnation. We can see the
effect of aging by directly inspecting how it changes the AD demand function. An increase in
aging from A to A ‘makes the AD curve flatter, that is, there is now less demand for any given
income level (production per capita).
What is the logic for this result? The key term in our characterization is how aging affects
aggregate investment demand. We can express investment per capita, using the demand for
capital by the firms, as

                                                     𝐼   𝛼 𝑦 TU
                                                       =
                                                     𝑁 𝐴 𝑅9

Recall that before aggregate investment increased as A increased. This was because the increase
in A was more than offset by a decline of 𝑅9 . The firms responded to the decline in the interest
rate by demanding more capital which in turn led to capital deepening in equilibrium. This link is
now broken. The real interest rate is fixed, due to nominal rigidities and the ZLB, so there is no
offsetting effect on investment via the interest rate reduction. Accordingly, investment declines.
The result is a fall in aggregate production as shown at point A’ in Figure 3B. Observe that in a
secular stagnation, therefore, the effect of aging on output per capita is unambiguous, i.e., it must

decline. Doing a log-linear approximation as in last section we can show that aging has a
negative effect on output, given by the formula

                                   TU          TU
                                                           1           𝐴W

                                                        𝛽 1−𝛼          𝐴
                                                              𝐴 − 1
                                                       1+𝛽 𝛼

which is always negative, for the denominator is required to the positive for the secular
stagnation equilibrium to exist.14 This, then, explains the empirical patterns in Figures 1A-1C.
Importantly the effect of aging on output per capital is unambiguous. It is always negative in a
secular stagnation.

       5. Conclusion

There has been an increasing attention lately about the effect of aging on GDP per capita.
Researchers have noticed, however, a curious pattern. Looking over the last quarter of a century,
it looks that in the cross section those countries experiencing aging have had higher GDP growth
per capita relative to those with younger population. In this paper, we suggest that a natural
explanation for this is capital deepening associated with the worldwide fall in the real interest
rate during this period. A key prediction of this hypothesis, and the genesis of the secular
stagnation hypothesis, is that the positive correlation is predicted to break down for those
countries that hit the ZLB. The cross-country evidence we present is consistent with this
prediction.

Broadly speaking the empirical evidence and the model suggest very different effect of aging if
an economy finds itself in the regular neoclassical regime or in a secular stagnation. More
generally, this caveat applies to any force that tends to increase the relative propensity to save or
decrease the propensity to invest. Examples that may affect these margins include rise in
inequality, debt-deleveraging cycles, the global savings glut, an increase in life expectancy, a fall
in relative price of investment or lower productivity growth (see e.g. Summers (2014) and
Eggertsson et al (2017) for discussion). In a regular neoclassical regime interest rates flexibly
adjust to any changes in the desired capital-output ratio. In a secular stagnation regime, however,
savings virtues become a vice, and have negative effect on growth. Of course, this is reminiscent
of old Keynesian models, but both the data evidence and the model presented here highlight the
key role low interest rates play in determining if the beneficial neoclassical force of savings is at
play or the malignant one identified by Keynes.

It seems plausible that consideration related to excess savings at the ZLB will become
increasingly relevant in future recessions. Kiley and Roberts (2017), for example, estimate the
that the ZLB is likely to be a constraint 30-40 percent of the time going forward, and Summers
(2018) reaches similar conclusion. Their analysis depends critically on the assessment that the
long term neutral interest rate has declined permanently, a proposition that is consistent with the
assessment of financial markets as of writing. More generally the assumption that monetary
policy can stabilize the business cycle seems greatly attenuated going forward.

     Notes: The table presents long-differences estimates of the impact of aging on GDP per capita in constant dollars from the Penn World Tables for
     all countries (columns 1 to 5) and OECD countries (columns 6 to 8). Aging is defined as the change in the ratio of the population above 65 to the
     population between 20 and 64. Columns 5 and 8 present IV estimates in which we instrument aging using the birthrate in 1960, 1965, … , 1980.
     The bottom rows indicate additional controls included in the models but not reported: The population and age structure controls include the log of
     the population and the initial value of our aging measure. We report standard errors robust to heteroscedasticity in parentheses.

   Notes: The table presents long-differences estimates of the impact of aging on GDP per capita in constant dollars from the Penn World Tables for
   all countries (columns 1 to 5) and OECD countries (columns 6 to 8). Aging is defined as the change in the ratio of the population above 65 to the
   population between 20 and 64. Columns 5 and 8 present IV estimates in which we instrument aging using the birthrate in 1960, 1965, … , 1980.
   The bottom rows indicate additional controls included in the models but not reported: The population and age structure controls include the log of
   the population and the initial value of our aging measure. We report standard errors robust to heteroscedasticity in parentheses.

 Notes: The table presents long-differences estimates of the impact of aging on GDP per capita in constant dollars from the Penn World Tables for
 all countries (columns 1 to 5) and OECD countries (columns 6 to 8). Aging is defined as the change in the ratio of the population above 65 to the
 population between 20 and 64. Columns 5 and 8 present IV estimates in which we instrument aging using the birthrate in 1960, 1965, … , 1980.
 The bottom rows indicate additional controls included in the models but not reported: The population and age structure controls include the log of
 the population and the initial value of our aging measure. We report standard errors robust to heteroscedasticity in parentheses.
