Monetary Policy as Financial-Stability Regulation

JEL No. E58,G01

                                            ABSTRACT

This paper develops a model that speaks to the goals and methods of financial-stability policies. There
are three main points. First, from a normative perspective, the model defines the fundamental market
failure to be addressed, namely that unregulated private money creation can lead to an externality in
which intermediaries issue too much short-term debt and leave the system excessively vulnerable to
costly financial crises. Second, it shows how in a simple economy where commercial banks are the
only lenders, conventional monetary-policy tools such as open-market operations can be used to regulate
this externality, while in more advanced economies it may be helpful to supplement monetary policy
with other measures. Third, from a positive perspective, the model provides an account of how monetary
policy can influence bank lending and real activity, even in a world where prices adjust frictionlessly
and there are other transactions media besides bank-created money that are outside the control of the
central bank.

           I. Introduction

           The modern literature on monetary policy emphasizes the central bank’s role in

fostering price stability.1 Historically, however, a dominant concern for central bankers

has been not just price stability, but also financial stability. Goodhart (1988) argues that

the original motivation for creating central banks in many countries was to temper the

financial crises associated with unregulated “free banking” regimes:

        “In the nineteenth century, the advocates of free banking argued that the banking
system could be trusted to operate effectively without external constraints or
regulation….[But] experience suggested that competitive pressures in a milieu of limited
information (and, thence, contagion risks) would lead to procyclical fluctuations
punctuated by banking panics. It was this experience that led to the formation of
noncompetitive, non-profit maximizing Central Banks.” (p. 77).

A related emphasis on crisis mitigation is evident in Bagehot’s (1873) famous discussion

of the lender-of-last-resort function.2               And certainly, recent events have served to

underscore the importance of the central bank’s role in preserving financial stability.

           In this paper, I develop a model that speaks to the goals and methods of central-

bank financial-stability policies. The first step is to define the fundamental market failure

that needs to be addressed. I begin with an unregulated banking system in which banks

raise financing from households to invest in projects. Banks can raise this financing in

the form of either short-term or long-term debt. Households are risk-neutral with respect

to fluctuations in their consumption, but derive additional monetary services from

holding any claim that is entirely riskless—with the notion being that riskless claims are

easy to value and hence facilitate exchange among households. I show that banks can

manufacture some amount of riskless private “money” of this sort, thereby lowering their

 Tucker (2009) paraphrases Bagehot’s (1873) dictum as follows: “to avert panic, central banks should lend
early and freely (i.e., without limit) to solvent firms, against good collateral, and at ‘high rates’”.

financing costs. Moreover, they can do so in greater quantity by issuing short-term debt,

since it is harder for long-term bank debt to be made risk-free.

        The role for financial-stability policy arises because the private choices of

unregulated banks with respect to money creation are not in general socially optimal.

When banks issue cheaper short-term debt, they capture its social benefits, namely the

monetary services it generates for households.             However, they do not always fully

internalize its costs. In an adverse “financial crisis” state of the world, the only way for

banks to honor their short-term debts is by selling assets at fire-sale prices. I show that in

equilibrium, the potential for such fire sales may give rise to a negative externality. Thus

left to their own devices, unregulated banks may engage in excessive money creation,

and may leave the financial system overly vulnerable to costly crises.

        There are a variety of ways for a regulator to address this externality. One

possibility is the use of conventional monetary-policy tools, i.e. open-market operations.

To see how monetary policy might be of value, note that a crude approach to dealing with

the externality would be for the regulator to just impose a cap on each bank’s total money

creation. However, when the regulator is imperfectly informed about banks’ investment

opportunities, he will not know where to set the cap, since it is desirable for banks with

stronger investment opportunities to do more money creation.                   In this setting, the

regulator can do better with a flexible “cap-and-trade” system in which banks are granted

tradable permits, each of which allows them to do some amount of money creation.3 The

market price of the permits reveals information about banks’ investment opportunities to

the regulator, who can then adjust the cap accordingly—when the price of the permits

3
 Kashyap and Stein (2004) suggest using an analogous cap-and-trade approach to implement time-varying
bank capital requirements.



                                                  2
goes up, this suggests that banks in the aggregate have strong investment opportunities,

and so the regulator should loosen the cap by putting more permits into the system.

       All of this may sound a bit like science fiction; we don’t observe cap-and-trade

regulation of banks in the real world. However if banks’ short-term liabilities are subject

to reserve requirements, it turns out that monetary policy can be used as a mechanism for

implementing the cap-and-trade approach. When the central bank injects reserves into

the system, it effectively increases the number of permits for private money creation.

And the nominal interest rate, which captures the cost of holding reserves, functions as

the permit price. Thus open-market operations that adjust aggregate reserves in response

to changes in short-term nominal rates can be use to achieve the cap-and-trade solution.

       An interesting benchmark case is where reserve requirements apply to the money-

like liabilities of all lenders in the economy. This allows the central bank to precisely

control private money creation with monetary policy alone. While this case may roughly

capture the situation facing central banks at an earlier period in history, it is less realistic

as a description of modern advanced economies. Nowadays there are a range of short-

term financial-intermediary liabilities that are not subject to reserve requirements, and yet

may both: i) provide monetary services; and ii) create fire-sale externalities. For example,

Gorton and Metrick (2010), and Gorton (2010) argue that an important fraction of private

money creation now takes place entirely outside of the formal banking sector, via the

large volume of overnight repo finance in the “shadow banking” sector.

       In this richer environment, monetary policy as it is conventionally practiced is

generally not sufficient to rein in excessive money creation. Continuing with the above

example, it may in addition be necessary to regulate the volume of repo activity in the




                                               3
shadow-banking sector, either by expanding the reach of reserve requirements, or by

some other means. Thus the model helps to make clear the circumstances under which

monetary policy needs to be supplemented with other measures. Moreover, it suggests

that these other measures lie squarely in the central bank’s traditional domain, to the

extent that they are also targeted at the fundamental externality associated with excessive

private money creation. This is of interest in light of the ongoing debate over the

appropriate mix of central-bank tools for achieving financial stability.4

           In addition to its normative implications, the model is also relevant from a

positive perspective. It provides a coherent account of how monetary policy “works”—

i.e., of how open-market operations lead to changes in bank lending and output—in an

environment that is arguably more realistic on some key dimensions than that found in

other theories. In contrast to the usual model, all prices are perfectly flexible. Moreover,

I do not need to assume that the central bank has monopoly control over all forms of

transactions media used by households. My model is unchanged if, for example, one

introduces a set of non-reservable money-market-funds that provide the same monetary

services to households as bank-created money.5 Indeed, I consider the limiting case

where the interest-rate spread between money and bonds is fixed and unresponsive to

their relative supplies. Monetary policy works in this case not by changing real interest

rates, but through a pure quantity effect: a loosening of policy allows banks to finance

themselves with more of the cheaper money, which encourages them to do more lending.

    See, e.g. Adrian and Shin (2008), and Ashcraft, Garleanu and Pedersen (2010).
5
  To be clear on the distinction: my model assumes that the central bank acts as a regulator, controlling
those forms of private money creation that lead to negative externalities—in particular, short-term bank
debt that finances risky long-term assets. However, it does not require the central bank to control other,
more benign forms of money creation, e.g., money-market-fund accounts backed by Treasury bills.



                                                      4
        The ideas in this paper connect to several strands of previous work. First, the

basic model of fire sales that creates the rationale for policy intervention draws on

Shleifer and Vishny (1992, 1997).6 Second, the insight that banks create a valuable

transactions medium by issuing low-risk claims is formalized in Gorton and Pennacchi

(1990). Third, the notion that central bank reserves can be thought of as permits that

allow banks to do more of a particular kind of cheap financing appears in Stein’s (1998)

elaboration of the bank lending channel of monetary policy transmission.7

        And finally, in order to focus on the financial-stability consequences of monetary

policy, it helps to set aside its effects on price stability. I do so by appealing to the fiscal

theory of the price level, according to which the price level is determined not by the

monetary base, but by total outstanding nominal government liabilities—i.e., by the sum

of Treasury securities and the monetary base.8 This enables open-market operations that

change the mix of Treasuries and bank reserves (while keeping their sum constant) to

have real effects on bank investment and financing behavior, even in a world where all

prices are perfectly flexible. However, I also discuss how the model’s conclusions carry

over to an alternative New-Keynesian setting with sticky prices, where price stability is

governed by a version of the “Taylor rule” (Taylor, 1993, 1999).

        The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II develops the basic model

of private money creation by banks. Section III compares banks’ financing choices to the

social planner’s solution, and clarifies the conditions under which banks engage in

excessive money creation. It also shows that a cap-and-trade approach to regulation can

be useful when the social planner has imperfect information. Section IV demonstrates

how the cap-and-trade approach can be implemented with open-market operations.

Section V explores a number of other complementary policy tools; these include liquidity

regulation, deposit insurance and a lender-of-last-resort function, as well as regulation of

the shadow-banking sector. Section VI discusses how the model differs from other

accounts of the monetary transmission mechanism. Conclusions are in Section VII.



        II. A Model of Private Money Creation

        The model features three sets of actors: households, banks, and “patient

investors”. I begin by describing each of these groups, and then turn to the optimization

problem faced by the banks.

        A. Households

        There are three dates, 0, 1, and 2. At time 0, households have an initial

endowment of the one good in the economy. They can either consume this endowment at

time 0, or invest some of it in financial assets and consume the proceeds from investment

at time 2. They have linear preferences over consumption at these two dates. In addition

to consumption, households also derive utility from monetary services.                       The key

assumption is that monetary services can be provided by any privately-created claim on

time-2 consumption, so long as that claim is completely riskless.9 Thus the utility of a

representative household is given by:


9
 This assumption is meant to capture, in a reduced-form way, the spirit of Gorton and Pennacchi (1990),
and Dang, Gorton and Holmstrom (2009). These papers argue that information-insensitive securities are an


                                                   6
         U = C0 + β E (C2 ) + γ M ,                                                                   (1)

where M represents the household’s time-0 holdings of privately-created “money”.10 To

be clear on the notational convention, when a household has M units of money at time 0,

this means that it holds claims guaranteed to deliver M units of time-2 consumption.

         Given their linear form, household preferences pin down two real rates. The first

is the (gross) real return on risky “bonds” that pay off at time 2, given by R B = 1/ β .

The second is the (gross) real return on riskless “money”, given by R M = 1/ ( β + γ ) ,

where β + γ < 1 . The latter follows from the observation that a household is always

indifferent between having: i) β + γ units of time-0 consumption; or ii) a riskless claim

that promises one unit of time-2 consumption, since such a claim delivers β of utility

from expected future consumption, along with an additional γ of utility in monetary

services. The bottom line is that because riskless money offers households a convenience

yield that risky bonds do not, in equilibrium it must have a lower rate of return.

         The idea that money has a lower return in equilibrium than bonds is standard in

textbook models. But here, the return spread is fixed and independent of the quantities of

money and bonds, thanks to the linear preferences on the part of households. This feature

is not necessary for anything that follows, and is easily relaxed. However, it serves to

highlight a key novelty of my model: here changes in central bank policy work not by

altering the real rates on either type of claim, but rather by varying the proportions of

attractive medium of exchange, because they eliminate the potential for adverse selection between
transacting parties. Riskless securities are, by definition, information-insensitive.
10
   In a similar formulation, Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2010) put the stock of Treasury
securities directly into the representative agent’s utility function. As one rationale for doing so, they cite
the “surety” of Treasuries—i.e., the fact that Treasuries are riskless. Like I do, they posit that surety has an
extra value above and beyond that which is captured in a standard asset-pricing model. See also Sidrauski
(1967) for an early model with money in the utility function.


                                                       7
each that banks use. In other words, looser policy encourages banks to lend more by

enabling them to tilt their capital structure towards cheap money financing, thereby

lowering their weighted average cost of funds.

        B. Banks

        Households cannot invest their time-0 endowments directly in physical projects,

because they do not have the monitoring expertise to do so. This investment must be

undertaken by banks, who in turn issue financial claims—in the form of either riskless

money or risky bonds—to households. There is a continuum of such banks, with total

mass of one. Each bank faces the following investment opportunities. If an amount I is

invested at time 0, and the good state prevails, which happens with probability p, total

output at time 2 is given by the concave function f ( I ) > I . If instead the bad state

prevails, total expected output at time 2 is λ I ≤ I , and there is a positive probability that

output collapses all the way to zero. In particular, in the bad state, output is either λI/q

with probability q, or zero with probability (1 – q).

        At time 1, there is a public signal that reveals whether the good or bad state will

be realized at time 2. At time 1 it is also possible for a bank to sell any fraction of its

existing physical assets to a patient investor.11 If a fraction Δ of the assets are sold, total

proceeds to the bank are given by Δk λ I , where 0≤ k ≤ 1, and the remaining unsold assets

yield output at time 2 to the bank of (1 − Δ)λ I . Thus k is a measure of the discount to

expected value associated with a time-1 asset sale. A central feature of the model is that

k is endogenous, and depends on total asset sales by all banks in the economy. The

equilibrium determination of k will be discussed shortly.
11
  Since households only consume at time 0 and time 2, they do not consume the proceeds of any time-1
asset sales until time 2. One can think of them as simply sitting on these proceeds in the interim.



                                                 8
       Other than their access to investment opportunities, banks have no initial

endowments, and hence must raise the entire amount I externally. They can do so by

issuing either short-term (maturing at time 1) or long-term (maturing at time 2) debt

claims to households. Note that if they finance with long-term debt, no amount of this

debt can ever be riskless, since there is a positive probability of the assets yielding zero

output at time 2. By contrast, short-term debt can be made riskless, if not too much is

issued. This is because by forcing an asset sale upon seeing a bad signal at time 1, short-

term creditors can escape early with a sure value equal to the proceeds from the sale.

       These assumptions are starker than they need to be. In a more general model

where the lowest possible value of output at time 2 is greater than zero, banks can issue

some riskless long-term debt—so there is no longer a one-to-one mapping between debt

maturity and the ability for debt to be made risk-free. Nevertheless, it will always be the

case that banks can create a larger quantity of riskless claims by issuing short-maturity

debt; the early-escape intuition still holds. Since there is a fixed premium on riskless

claims, banks will continue to be tempted to issue short-term debt in this more general

version of the model, and all the qualitative results below will continue to apply.

       The model can also be extended so that monetary services are provided not only

by entirely riskless assets, but by any claims that are sufficiently low risk—i.e., by any

claims whose worst-case payoff is at least x cents on the dollar. What is critical is that

there still be a violation of the Modigliani-Miller (1958) conditions, so that as a bank

manufactures more of these low-risk money-like claims, it does not have to pay more for

its remaining long-term debt, which becomes riskier. This M-M violation is captured

here in the assumption that the return on non-monetary claims, R B , is a constant.




                                             9
        In any of these formulations, the key tradeoff is this: on the one hand, banks have

an incentive to issue some short-term debt, because more of this debt can be made low-

risk—and hence by virtue of its money-ness, represents a cheap form of finance.12 On

the other hand, what keeps short-term debt safe is the bank’s ability to sell assets in the

bad state. As will become clear below, these sales of existing assets can lead to social

costs that are not always fully internalized by individual banks when they pick their

capital structures. As a result, there may be excessive private money creation by banks.

        Suppose that a bank raises a fraction m of its total investment of I by issuing

short-term debt. If this short-term debt can be made riskless, it will carry a rate of return

of R M , and the bank will owe its short-term creditors a repayment of mIR M ≡ M . Can

it meet this promise in the bad state by selling assets if necessary? From above, if it sells

a fraction Δ of its assets, total proceeds are Δk λ I , so we require that:

                                    mR M
         Δk λ I = mIR M , or Δ =         .                                                        (2)
                                     kλ

        Since Δ ≤ 1 , there is an upper bound on private money creation given by:

                   kλ
         m max =      .                                                                           (3)
                   RM

Thus the potential for asset sales makes it possible for a bank to create riskless private

money, by issuing short-term debt—so long as the amount issued is not too large.

        Is it also the case that asset sales are an unavoidable consequence of money

creation? One might think that since holding on to assets is positive-NPV relative to

selling them at time 1, it might be possible for a bank to raise new funding at time 1 to


12
   Other theories of short-term financing include Flannery (1986), Diamond (1991), and Stein (2005), who
stress its signaling properties, and Diamond and Rajan (2001) who argue that short-term debt is a valuable
disciplining device, particularly for financial intermediaries.


                                                    10
pay off the departing short-term creditors, and thereby avoid forced sales. However, if

one assumes that any new funding must be subordinated to existing long-term debt, such

new funding may be blockaded by a severe debt overhang problem (Myers (1977)), given

the low value of the assets in the bad state relative to the total face amount of already-

issued debt.13 Thus under plausible circumstances, private money creation inevitably

leads to some amount of asset sales.14

         Before moving on, it is worth fleshing out an issue of interpretation about the

banks in the model. In the real world, banks do not invest in physical projects directly,

but rather lend to firms who in turn do the project selection. Abstracting away from this

extra layer of activity, as I do here, is tantamount to assuming that there are no

contracting frictions between operating firms and banks, i.e. that firms can costlessly

pledge all of their output to the banks. This then raises the question of whether it is

appropriate to interpret what I label “banks” as really being financial intermediaries, as

opposed to operating firms that borrow directly from households in the securities market.

         To create a meaningful distinction, suppose that any individual operating firm,

once funded, always has some probability of immediate (i.e., before time 1) idiosyncratic

failure, in which case it becomes public knowledge that its output will be zero in both the


13
  In particular, denoting the face value of the existing long-term debt by B, it must be that M + B > I, in
order for the bank to have raised I at time 0 by issuing money and bonds. If the bank now wants to raise an
amount M to pay off the short-term creditors in the bad state at time 1, it must do so by issuing new claims
that are junior to the existing long-term debt. But given that they are junior, the value of these claims in the
bad state is only q(λI/q – B). For q large enough (certainly for q > λ) the value of the new claims is
necessarily less than M, so refinancing the short-term debt is impossible.
14
   This line of argument leaves open the question of why the original long-term financing for the bank is in
the form of senior debt, as opposed to say equity, or some other junior security that allows for new
financing to come in on top of it. Following Hart and Moore (1995), it may be that this seniority of the
long-term debt represents a valuable pre-commitment in the more likely good state of the world. For
example, it may prevent managers from using assets in place as collateral for empire-building investments.
Thus, as in Hart and Moore, senior long-term debt is a double-edged sword: it serves to discipline wayward
managers in the good state, but forces underinvestment (here, in the form of asset sales) in the bad state.


                                                      11
good and bad states. This risk of failure makes it impossible for an operating firm to ever

issue riskless claims in any amount.               Banks, on the other hand, represent highly

diversified portfolios of such firm-level projects, and therefore their assets always have

positive expected value as of time 1, as assumed above. The diversification associated

with banks is thus a necessary condition for them to create riskless claims.15

         C. Patient Investors

         Patient investors (PIs) are another type of intermediary, and as such, any output

that they produce reverts to the household sector at time 2. As a group, PIs are endowed

with resources of W at time 1. For simplicity, I treat this endowment as exogenous for

now, but it can be endogenized by allowing the PIs to raise the W from the household

sector at time 0 by issuing risky long-term claims. In this case, the PIs choose an optimal

level of W at time 0 that equates the expected return on their time-1 investments to the

cost of capital R B .       Imposing this ex-ante breakeven condition does not affect the

qualitative results of the model, so I ignore it for the time being, and return to it later.

         What is crucial is that when time 1 rolls around and the state of the world is

realized, W is fixed. Thus while it is fine to think of PIs as having full access to financial

markets at time 0, they cannot go back and raise more at time 1 once they know the state

of the world. In other words, W is an unconditional war chest, with the same amount

available to PIs in the good and bad states.

         PIs can do one of two things with their resources at time 1. First, they can invest

in new, late-arriving real investment projects. Irrespective of the state of the world, an

   Thus, as in other models of intermediation, both pooling (i.e., diversification) and tranching (i.e., the
issuance of properly structured senior securities) have roles to play in creating low-risk claims. See, e.g.,
Gorton and Pennacchi (1990), DeMarzo and Duffie (1999), and DeMarzo (2005). Diamond (1984) also
emphasizes the importance of diversification to the process of intermediation.


                                                    12
investment of K in such new projects at time 1 yields expected gross output of g(K) at

time 2, where g( ) is a concave function. Alternatively, PIs can absorb assets being sold

by banks at time 1. In the good state, there are no asset sales, so the PIs invest all of W in

new projects, yielding g(W). In the bad state, banks have to sell enough assets to repay

short-term creditors the M they have promised them. Thus in equilibrium, PIs spend M

on asset purchases, and invest only (W – M) in new projects, yielding g(W – M). For the

PIs to be willing to allocate their endowment in this way, it must be that the marginal

return on new projects is the same as the marginal return from buying existing assets

from banks. This is what pins down the fire-sale discount k. In particular, we have that:

        1
          = g ′(W − M )                                                               (4)
        k

       Equation (4) makes clear the real costs of fire sales, and hence of short-term debt

financing by banks. The greater is M, and hence the more bank assets that the PIs have to

absorb in the bad state at time 1, the less they have left over for investment in new

projects. With scarce PI capital, the return on secondary-market arbitrage opportunities

(buying up fire-sold assets) also becomes the hurdle rate for new investment, a point

emphasized by Diamond and Rajan (2009a) and Shleifer and Vishny (2010).

       For expositional purposes, I am treating the PIs and the banks as two distinct

categories of intermediaries. This is not necessary; one could alternatively merge them

into a single entity that has investment opportunities at both time 0 and time 1, that issues

some short-term debt at time 0, and that also holds liquidity W in reserve at time 0. This

re-interpretation of the model is innocuous, subject to one caveat: it is crucial that the

merged entities behave not as autarkic islands, but rather as price-takers who can transact

in the asset market at time 1. Thus even if a bank satisfies most of its departing creditors


                                             13
by drawing down on its own stock of liquidity at time 1, it must continue to consider the

possibility of asset sales to another bank. This feature emerges naturally if we move

away from the knife-edge case where the scales of time-0 and time-1 investment are in

identical proportions across all banks. If so, those that have relatively bigger time-1 scale

will tend to stockpile more W relative to their short-term debts, and hence will be buyers

of assets from those who have bigger time-0 scale. My two-categories formulation can

be thought of as capturing an extreme case of this heterogeneity.

       D. The Bank’s Optimization Problem

       Let us now formulate the optimization problem for a bank that invests an amount

I and finances it with some fraction m ≤ m max of money. The bank’s expected net profits

at time 2 are given by:

        Π = { pf ( I ) + (1 − p )λ I − IR B } + mI ( R B − R M ) − (1 − p) zmIR M        (5)

                              (1 − k )
where I have defined z =               as the net rate of return on fire-sold assets. (Note that
                                 k

higher values of z correspond to larger fire-sale discounts, and z = 0 is the case where

there is no discount.)        The three terms in (5) are easily interpreted.           The first,

{ pf ( I ) + (1 − p)λ I − IR B } , is the NPV of investment assuming that it is entirely financed

at the higher bond-market rate—and hence that there is no need to ever sell assets. The

second term, mI ( R B − R M ) , is the financing cost savings associated with using a fraction

m of money in the capital structure. And the last term, (1 − p ) zmIR M , captures the

expected fire sale losses associated with this riskier short-term capital structure.

       Each bank picks m and I to maximize (5), subject to the collateral constraint that

              kλ
m ≤ m max =      . I assume that each bank treats the fire-sale discount k as a fixed
              RM


                                                   14
constant—i.e., they do not internalize the incremental impact of their choices on the fire-

sale outcome. By contrast, when I examine the social planner’s problem below, the key

difference will be that the planner takes into account the dependence of k on the capital

structure of the banks. The Lagrangian for the bank’s problem is thus:

                                                                                     kλ
LB = { pf ( I ) + (1 − p)λ I − IR B } + mI ( R B − R M ) − (1 − p) zmIR M − η (m −      )   (6)
                                                                                     RM

where η is the shadow value of the collateral constraint. Taking the first-order condition

with respect to m, we have:

        I {( R B − R M ) − (1 − p ) zR M } = η                                              (7)

        It follows that the collateral constraint binds, and the bank is at a corner, setting

m = m max , if ( R B − R M ) > (1 − p) zR M , i.e., if the equilibrium spread between bonds and

money is sufficiently large. Alternatively, if the spread is smaller in equilibrium (that is,

if ( R B − R M ) = (1 − p) zR M ), then the bank chooses an interior value of m, and η = 0 .

        The first-order condition with respect to I yields:

         pf ′( I ) + (1 − p )λ − R B + m( R B − R M ) − (1 − p ) zmR M = 0.                 (8)

        Using (7), we can re-write (8) as follows:

                                        −η m
         pf ′( I ) + (1 − p)λ − R B =                                                       (9)
                                         I

         There are two ways that (9) can be satisfied. First, the bank can be at an interior

solution with respect to m, in which case η = 0 , and therefore pf ′( I ) + (1 − p)λ = R B .

Alternatively, the bank can be at a corner with m = m max , and η > 0 , in which case it

follows that pf ′( I ) + (1 − p)λ < R B . This reasoning leads to the following proposition.




                                                   15
       Proposition 1: Define IB as the optimal level of investment for a bank that

finances itself exclusively in the long-term bond market: pf ′( I B ) + (1 − p)λ − R B = 0 .

The solution to the bank’s problem involves two regions. In the low-spread region (for

( R B − R M ) relatively small) the bank chooses m < m max and I*= IB. In the high-spread

region (for ( R B − R M ) relatively large) the bank chooses m = m max and I*> IB.



       The point to take away from the proposition is that in the low-spread region, a

bank’s investment and financing choices are decoupled, while in the high-spread region

they are interdependent. This is because when m < m max , a bank’s ability to tap low-cost

money financing is not constrained by the amount of investment it does. By contrast, in

the high-spread region in which m = m max , a bank faces a binding collateral constraint—it

can only issue more money if it increases the quantity of physical assets backing its debts.

This is what ties investment and financing decisions together. If money financing is

cheap enough that banks want to do a lot of it, and they begin to bump up against the

collateral constraint, they will be induced to invest more so as to loosen the constraint.



       III. Socially Excessive Money Creation: A Role for Regulation

       The next step in the analysis is to identify the circumstances in which the process

of private money creation described above involves an externality—i.e., when the level

of money creation chosen by banks exceeds that preferred by a benevolent social planner.

       A. The Social Planner’s Problem

       Given that all output of the banks and the PIs ultimately accrues to the household

sector, the social planner seeks to maximize the utility of a representative household, as


                                             16
given by equation (1).          It is easily shown that, disregarding constants, this utility,

expressed in units of time-2 consumption, is equivalent to:16

                                               (RB − RM )
         U = { pf ( I ) + (1 − p)λ I − IR B } + M         +
                                                  RM                                              (10)
         pg (W ) + (1 − p ){g (W − M ) + M } − WR B

        Comparing this to the bank’s expected profits in (5), we can see that the first two

terms coincide. The difference is in the latter three terms: the planner does not care about

expected fire sale losses per se, because these only represent a transfer from the banks to

the PIs. However, the planner does care about the net expected returns to investment by

the PIs, as captured by: pg (W ) + (1 − p){g (W − M ) + M } − WR B .

        The planner faces the same collateral constraint as the banks, namely that

              kλ
m ≤ m max =      . Denoting the shadow value of the constraint in this case by η P , and
              RM

recalling that M = mIR M , the Lagrangian for the planner’s problem is given by:

         LP = { pf ( I ) + (1 − p)λ I − IR B } + mI ( R B − R M ) +
                                                                            kλ                    (11)
         pg (W ) + (1 − p ){g (W − mIR M ) + mIR M } − WR B − η P (m −         )
                                                                            RM

         In taking the first-order conditions for this problem, it is important to note that,

unlike an individual bank, the planner recognizes the dependence of k on the average

                                                                                               1
behavior of all banks—he understands that, as per equation (4) k =                                      .
                                                                                        g ′(W − mIR M )

Using this fact, the first-order condition with respect to m can be written as:


16
   In particular, suppose households have a fixed time-0 endowment of Y, and that they invest I of this
endowment with the banks and W with the PIs at time 0. It follows that C0 = Y – I – W, and that C2 = f(I) +
g(W) with probability p, and C2 = λI + g(W – M) + M with probability (1 – p). The expression in (10) then
follows from also including the monetary services γM in the utility function, and multiplying time-0 values
by RB to put everything in common units of time-2 consumption.



                                                    17
                                                          g ′′(⋅)
        I {( R B − R M ) − (1 − p ) zR M } = η P (1 −               λI )                           (12)
                                                        ( g ′(⋅)) 2

Similarly, the first-order condition with respect to I can be expressed as:

                                                                                  g ′′(⋅)
        pf ′( I ) + (1 − p )λ − R B + m( R B − R M ) − (1 − p) zmR M = −η P                 λ m.   (13)
                                                                                ( g ′(⋅)) 2

       Comparing equations (7) and (12), and equations (8) and (13), we can see that the

bank’s private solution coincides exactly with the social planner’s solution in the low-

spread region where ( R B − R M ) = (1 − p ) zR M , and where the collateral constraint is non-

binding, i.e. where η = η P = 0 . In this case, equation (13) reduces to equation (8),

meaning that the planner chooses the same level of I as the bank.

       By contrast, in the high-spread region where the constraint binds, so that η P > 0 ,

                                                           g ′′(⋅)
the term on the right-hand side of (13), −η P                        λ m , describes the wedge between the
                                                         ( g ′(⋅)) 2

bank’s solution and the planner’s solution. Since g ′′(⋅) < 0 , this term is positive, which

implies that the marginal product of investment is higher in the social planner’s solution,

or alternatively that I is lower. In other words, in this region, the social planner would

like to restrain investment, and hence money creation, relative to the private outcome.

       The following proposition summarizes the analysis.



       Proposition 2: Denote the private and socially optimal values of investment I by

I* and I** respectively, and similarly for the private and socially optimal values of money

creation M. In the low-spread region, I* = I**, and M* = M**. In the high-spread region,

I* > I**, and M* > M**.




                                                        18
       Thus banks may create a socially excessive amount of money, but this happens

only if the spread between money and bonds ( R B − R M ) is high enough. If the spread is

so low that any individual bank choose an interior value of money creation m < m max ,

there is no divergence between private and social incentives.



       Example 1: Pick these functional forms and parameter values: f(I) = ψlog(I) + I,

g(K) = θlog(K), RB = 1.04; RM = 1.01; ψ = 3.5; θ = 150; λ = 1; W = 140; and p = 0.98.

For these values, the private optimum is in the high-spread region, and involves banks

choosing M*= 57.6 and I*=104.9 , with an associated rate of return on fire-sale assets of z

= 82.1% (k = 0.549). By contrast, in the social optimum, the planner chooses M**= 55.2

and I**= 97.7, leading to a rate of return on fire-sale assets of z = 77.0% (k = 0.565).



       Figure 1 expands on Example 1, keeping all of the other parameter values the

same as above, but allowing RM to vary between 1.00 and 1.035, thereby causing the

bond-money spread ( R B − R M ) to vary between 50 and 400 basis points. As can be seen,

for low values of the spread, the private and socially optimal values of M and I coincide.

But as the spread widens, these values diverge further and further from one another.

       B. Understanding the Nature of the Externality

       At first glance, it may not be clear why fire sales create a divergence between

private and socially optimal outcomes. After all, the price impact of liquidations is a

pecuniary externality, and pecuniary externalities by themselves need not lead to

violations of the standard welfare theorems. The result in Proposition 2 is a specific case

of the generic inefficiency result in economies with incomplete markets (Geanakoplos



                                             19
and Polemarchakis (1986), Greenwald and Stiglitz (1986)). Perhaps the closest analog is

Lorenzoni (2008), who also shows how there can be socially excessive borrowing in an

economy with financial frictions. In the current setting, the key friction is the presence of

a binding collateral constraint. This can be seen in the expression for the wedge between

the bank’s first-order condition and that of the planner; as noted above, this wedge is

                   g ′′(⋅)
given by: −η P               λ m . Thus when the collateral constraint does not bind, i.e. when
                 ( g ′(⋅)) 2

η P = 0 , there is no wedge, and the private and social solutions coincide. By contrast,

                                                                               g ′′(⋅)
when the collateral constraint binds, there is a wedge to the extent that                < 0 , i.e.,
                                                                             ( g ′(⋅)) 2

to the extent that an increase in the quantity of liquidations widens the fire-sale discount,

or equivalently, raises the marginal product of time-1 investment by the PIs.

       The intuition behind this result can be understood as follows. When the constraint

does not bind, equation (7) tells us that, in deciding how much money to create, each

bank trades off the lower financing cost ( R B − R M ) associated with money against the

potential for greater fire-sales discounts (1 − p ) zR M . But according to equation (12), this

is exactly the same tradeoff that the planner faces in attempting to balance the marginal

value of monetary services to households against the marginal cost of underinvestment by

the PIs. Hence in this case, everything is well-internalized.

       By contrast, when the constraint binds, and each bank is setting m = m max , an

incremental increase in money creation by any one bank has an added effect: by reducing

the equilibrium value of k, it effectively lowers the collateral value of all other bank’s

assets, thereby tightening their collateral constraints and impinging on their ability to

create money. Thus when any one bank creates an additional unit of money, and captures


                                              20
the private benefit for doing so, the social benefit is less than that one unit of money,

since other banks can no longer produce as much M for a given level of I.17

        The result that there is no externality in the low-spread region when m < m max is

dependent on the strong assumption that, when the PIs invest in real projects, they

capture all the social surplus associated with these projects. If one adds another financial

friction to the model, and makes this surplus only partially pledgeable, private money

creation is always socially excessive, irrespective of parameter values. In particular,

suppose that the social return to an investment project financed by a PI is still given by

g(K), but that only φg(K) can be pledged to the PI, with φ < 1. In this case, the

                                                                 1
equilibrium determination of k in (4) is altered so that           = ϕ g ′(W − M ) . That is, a given
                                                                 k

amount of underinvestment by the PIs is now associated with a smaller fire-sale discount.

Hence a bank’s aversion to fire sales no longer leads it to fully internalize the social costs

of underinvestment.

        This imperfect-pledgeability variant of the model is briefly explored in the

appendix. Since it is possible to make many of the key normative points that follow

without introducing imperfect pledgeability, there is a certain minimalist appeal to

focusing on the perfect-pledgeability limit of φ = 1, as I do in the remainder of the text.

However, if one is interested in generating more realistic comparative statics along some

dimensions, the augmented version of the model that allows for φ < 1 may be better

suited to doing so. For example, I show in the appendix that the perfect-pledgeability

version of the model yields the somewhat counter-intuitive implication that the central

17
  Think of two Banks A and B as factories that each have a technology for producing money out of
physical assets. When the collateral constraint binds, an incremental increase in money production by A is
equivalent to a form of pollution that gums up B’s production technology, since it reduces the amount of
money that B can manufacture out of a given stock of physical assets.


                                                   21
bank should lower nominal interest rates when the risk of a financial crisis is greater. If

instead we posit that φ < 1, this result can easily be reversed.

            C. A “Cap-and-Trade” Approach to Bank Liquidity Regulation

           The analysis thus far makes clear that in some cases banks will choose to create

more money than is socially optimal, thereby inflicting inefficiently high levels of fire

sales on the economy. This suggests a role for regulation. In the full-information case, in

which the regulator observes all the relevant parameters of the model, the social optimum

can be easily implemented with a cap on money creation: each bank can simply be

prohibited from issuing more short-term claims than the desired level of M**, which the

regulator can directly compute from equations (12) and (13).

           However, if the regulator is imperfectly informed, it becomes more challenging to

set the cap appropriately.18 Consider a situation in which banks know the productivity of

their investment opportunities—i.e., they know what the function f(I) looks like—but the

regulator does not. As can be seen from equation (13), the value of I**, and hence the

value of M**, depends on the marginal product of investment f ′( I ) . Intuitively, it

makes sense to allow banks to create more cheap money financing when they have better

investment opportunities. Thus without knowledge of the value of f ′( I ) , it is impossible

for the regulator to target the socially optimal level of money creation with a simple cap.

           One way for the regulator to generate the required information is through a

system of cap-and-trade. In particular, each bank can be granted permits that allow it to

issue some amount of money; by picking the aggregate quantity of permits, the regulator

can, as before, effectively target the total amount of money M in the economy.

     Weitzman (1974) is the seminal paper on regulation in the face of parameter uncertainty.



                                                      22
Moreover, if the permits can be traded among banks, their market-clearing price P(M)

(per unit of money creation allowed) will equal the shadow value of the M-constraint to

                   dΠ   1 d Π 19
the banks: P =        =       . And conditional on the regulator knowing the other

                                            dI

        It follows from this reasoning that the regulator can implement the M** solution

by making the permits tradable, and then targeting the appropriate price for these permits

by varying the available quantity. That is, the regulator adjusts the quantity of permits,

looking for a fixed point where the market-clearing price P(M) equals a target value

PT(M) that itself depends on the quantity of permits. To calculate this target value, recall

that, in the high-spread region when m = m max , the social optimum involves

dΠ          g ′′(⋅)                                                1 dI     −η P λ g ′′(⋅)
   = −η P             λ m , which would imply setting P T
                                                          ( M ) =         =       .          .
dI        ( g ′(⋅)) 2                                             mR M dM    R M ( g ′(⋅)) 2

Using equation (12), we can substitute for η P to obtain the following result:



         Proposition 3: A regulator who is imperfectly informed about the nature of bank

lending opportunities can implement the desired level of money M** with a system of

tradable permits for money creation. This involves adjusting the number of permits such

that their observed market-clearing price P(M) equals the following target price PT(M):

                                                         g ′′(⋅)
                                                    −λ I
                      (R − R )
                         B      M
                                                       ( g ′(⋅)) 2
         PT ( M ) = {          − (1 − p ) z}{                         }.                       (14)
                         RM                               g ′′(⋅)
                                              (1 − λ I              )
                                                        ( g ′(⋅)) 2

19
  Note that since the banks in the model are all identical, the volume of trade in the permits is zero.
Nevertheless, there is a unique equilibrium price, given by the common shadow value of the M-constraint.



                                                     23
        To be clear on the implementation, suppose the regulator picks an initial trial

value of M. At this value, the regulator can calculate the target price of permits PT(M)

from (14), based on his knowledge of M and the other observable parameters of the

model—as can be seen from (14), he does not need to know anything about the value of

f ′( I ) to evaluate PT(M). If the market price of permits P(M) turns out to be higher than

PT(M), the regulator increases M, and vice-versa. The optimum M** is that value of M

where the target price in (14) coincides with the market price.



        Example 2: Keep everything the same as in Example 1: f(I) = ψlog(I) + I, g(K) =

θlog(K), RB = 1.04; RM = 1.01; ψ = 3.5; θ = 150; λ = 1; W = 140; and p = 0.98. At the

social optimum of M** = 55.2, the price of permits is P = 0.0056. Now suppose there is

a positive productivity shock, and ψ rises to 4.0. If the cap is not adjusted, the price of

permits spikes to P = 0.0146. However, this price increase reveals the new value of ψ to

the regulator, who can increase the number of permits in the system, raising the quantity

of money in the system to its new optimal value of M** = 58.9. At this new optimum,

the price of permits is given by P = 0.0054.



        The example suggests that, in the face of productivity shocks, it is optimal for the

regulator to actively lean against incipient changes in the price of permits. When a

positive shock pushes the price of permits up, the regulator should increase the supply of

permits, thereby driving their price back down. In fact, optimality in this setting requires

the supply response to be sufficiently strong that the equilibrium price of permits actually

falls slightly as productivity rises.




                                               24
         D. Relationship to Pigouvian Taxation

         A handful of recent papers have suggested that a system of Pigouvian taxes might

be used to force banks to properly internalize any systemic externalities they create (e.g.,

Jeanne and Korinek (2010), Kocherlakota (2010), Perotti and Suarez (2010)). In the

current context, this would amount to imposing a tax τ on each unit of money created by

banks. A couple of points about such taxes are worth noting.

         First, in the full-information case where the planner observes everything needed

to compute the socially-optimal level of money creation M**, this outcome can be

achieved equally well either with a regulatory cap on money creation, or by picking the

correct value of the tax τ. Indeed, given full information, the regulator can implement

M** simply by setting τ = PT(M**), i.e., the target price of permits given by (14),

calculated at the desired value of M**. So Pigouvian taxes can be used, but in this setting

they don’t add any value relative to more conventional quantity-based regulation.

         Second, in the incomplete-information case where the planner does not know

enough to pick the right level of the cap, he also does not know enough to set the correct

value of the tax τ, since the optimal tax depends on M**. Thus an optimal system of

Pigouvian taxation still requires a mechanism to elicit the private information. So the

cap-and-trade design remains useful, for the same reasons as before. Indeed, one can

interpret the cap-and-trade approach as a “smart” system of Pigouvian taxation, since for

any individual bank the permit price is identical to the optimal tax on money creation.20



20
   This is not to say that cap-and-trade is the unique way of implementing the optimal scheme. An
alternative would be an iterative form of taxation: the regulator announces a trial value of the tax rate. He
then observes the quantity of M chosen by banks, and uses this to infer the productivity of their investment
opportunities. With this data, he can then set the optimal tax rate. Thus rather than setting quantities and
learning from market prices, the regulator sets prices (taxes) and learns from market-determined quantities.



                                                    25
         IV. Implementing the Cap-and-Trade Approach with Monetary Policy

         The cap-and-trade approach to bank regulation outlined above may seem alien—it

does not have any direct counterpart in the real world. However, I now argue that the

cap-and-trade approach can be implemented with something that looks very much like

conventional monetary policy—with open-market operations in which the central bank

adjusts the quantity of nominal reserves in the banking system. In this setting, reserves

play the role of permits for money creation, given the existence of a binding reserve

requirement. And the nominal interest rate corresponds to the price of the permits.

         In drawing this analogy, one wrinkle is that I have so far been working in an

entirely real economy. To introduce a central bank and a role for monetary policy, I need

to bring in a set of nominally-denominated government liabilities, and then pin down the

price level. To do so, I rely on the fiscal theory of the price level (Leeper (1991), Sims

(1994), Woodford (1995), Cochrane (1998)). In particular, the government is assumed to

issue two types of nominal liabilities: Treasury bills, and bank reserves. According to the

fiscal theory, the sum of these two nominal liabilities is what is relevant for determining

the price level. And given the sum, the composition of these liabilities is a real variable,

since only reserves can be used to satisfy reserve requirements. Thus holding fixed total

government liabilities, when there are more reserves, banks are able to create more

money, i.e. to finance a greater fraction of their operations with short-term debt. Hence

reserves correspond exactly to the concept of regulatory permits in the real model.21 By

contrast, if Treasury bills could also be used to satisfy reserve requirements, there would

be nothing special about reserves, and open-market operations would have no effect.


21
  Since the price level is pinned down by fiscal considerations, the goal of achieving price stability cannot
be the central bank’s job. Rather, the central bank is left with just the role of financial-stability regulator.


                                                      26
         To operationalize the fiscal theory, I assume that the government anticipates real

tax revenues of T at time 2, and that the value of T is exogenously fixed. At time 0, the

government has total nominal liabilities outstanding of l0, composed of Treasury bills b0,

and bank reserves r0. Thus l0 = b0 + r0. The time-0 price level Λ0, is then determined by

the requirement that the real value of the government’s obligations must equal the present

value of its future tax revenues:

         l0   T
            = M                                                                                    (15)
         Λ0 R

         Two points are worth noting here. First, the relevant real discount rate for the

government is R M , given that its obligations are riskless in this setting. In other words,

when households own Treasury bills, they derive the same monetary services from these

bills that they do from privately-created bank money, so the return on Treasury bills is

equal to R M . Second, in order to keep real tax revenues fixed at T as the composition of

government liabilities varies, I assume that the government rebates any seignorage

revenues derived from the issuance of non-interest bearing reserves in a lump-sum

fashion to the household sector.22

         Again, the key distinction between Treasury bills and bank reserves is that only

the latter can be used to satisfy reserve requirements. In particular, any bank wishing to

issue a dollar of short-term debt must hold ρ dollars of reserves, where ρ is the fractional

reserve requirement. Hence the net amount of short-term debt financing made possible



22
  Without this assumption, the composition of government liabilities would influence real tax revenues. In
particular, as the government issued more non-interest-bearing reserves and fewer interest-bearing bills, its
effective tax revenues would go up through a seignorage mechanism. The assumption can be loosely
motivated by the idea that the government has some kind of social compact with its citizens that prevent it
from letting total tax revenues—no matter how they are raised—go above T.



                                                    27
by one dollar of reserves is (1 – ρ)/ρ dollars.23 It follows that in real terms, the total

amount of M that can be created by the banking sector is now given by:

                (1 − ρ )r0 (1 − ρ )T r0
         M=               =                                                                      (16)
                   ρΛ 0      ρ R M l0

        This expression makes it clear that the ratio of r0 to l0—namely, the composition

of the government’s nominal liabilities—is a real variable, and is the means by which the

government can target total real money creation by banks. An open-market operation

that increases the supply of reserves relative to T-bills is isomorphic to an increase in the

regulatory limit on M in the all-real cap-and-trade version of the model.

        Moreover, as noted above, the analog to the price of permits is the current setting

is the nominal interest rate. This is because when banks want to create money, they are

forced to hold non-interest bearing reserves, and the nominal interest rate represents the

opportunity cost of doing so.

        Denoting the nominal interest rate by i, one can express the time-2 price level as:

                Λ 0 (1 + i )
         Λ2 =                .                                                                   (17)
                   RM

        Now suppose a bank wishes to increase its net issuance of real M by one unit at

                                                              dΠ
time 0, thereby increasing its real time-2 profits by            . To do so, it must increase net
                                                              dM

nominal M by Λ0 units, which requires it to hold ρΛ0/(1 – ρ) of nominal reserves. To

finance these reserve holdings, it must pay ρiΛ0/(1 – ρ) of nominal financing costs at time

2. The real time-2 value of these financing costs is therefore ρiΛ0/(1 – ρ)Λ2 or, using



23
  As an example, suppose ρ = .10. In this case, with one dollar of reserves, a bank is allowed to raise 10
dollars of short-term debt. But given that it must hold the reserves as an asset, only 9 of these dollars
represent net financing that is available to fund new loans.


                                                   28
equation (17), ρiRM/(1 – ρ)(1 + i). For a bank to be indifferent, it must be that these real

                     dΠ
costs are equal to      . Thus it follows that the nominal interest rate is given by:
                     dM

           i      (1 − ρ ) d Π
                =              .                                                        (18)
        (1 + i ) ρ R M dM



       Example 3: Keep everything the same as in Example 1: f(I) = ψlog(I) + I, g(K) =

θlog(K), RB = 1.04; RM = 1.01; ψ = 3.5; θ = 150; λ = 1; W = 140; and p = 0.98. At the

                                                   dΠ
social optimum of M** = 55.2, we had that             = 0.0056. With a reserve requirement
                                                   dM

of ρ = 0.10, if this optimum is implemented with monetary policy, the nominal interest

rate is given by i = 5.25%. (Since the nominal rate exceeds the riskless real rate of 1.0%,

the implied rate of inflation between time 0 and time 2 is 4.25%.) If we keep all else the

same but set RM = 1.02, the new optimum involves M** = 52.5, which is implemented

with a nominal rate of i = 1.81%. Intuitively, as the spread between money and bonds

shrinks, banks have a weaker desire to create private money. So the nominal interest rate,

which is equivalent to the value of a permit for money creation, falls as well.



       V. Other Policy Tools

       A. Liquidity Regulation

       I have thus far taken the time-0 liquidity stockpile W of the PIs to be exogenous.

This does not affect any of the conclusions in the foregoing analysis regarding the

socially optimal quantity of money, since these conclusions hold for any value of W such

that there is a scarcity of PI resources in the bad state at time 1. However, I now pose

two related questions about W. First, if the PIs are allowed to choose W optimally, what


                                              29
value will they pick? And second, if the social planner is allowed to choose W, will his

choice differ from that of the PIs? In other words, is there a case for regulation of

liquidity holdings, in addition to regulation of money creation?

       The privately-optimal choice of W, denoted by W*, is determined by the

following first-order condition:

        pg ′(W ) + (1 − p) g ′(W − M ) = R B                                                       (19)

The logic is straightforward. PIs raise W at time 0, paying a gross interest rate of R B .

With probability p, the good state ensues, and the marginal return on their investment is

g ′(W ) . With probability (1 – p), the bad state ensues, and the marginal return on

investment is g ′(W − M ) . One interesting feature of this solution is that the more

unlikely the bad state, the lower is the equilibrium value of W*, and hence the deeper is

the fire-sale discount when the bad state does in fact occur.

       To solve for the socially optimal value of W, denoted by W**, we can return to

the planner’s Lagrangian from equation (11), and take the first-order condition with

respect to W, which yields:

                                                       λ g ′′(⋅)
        pg ′(W ) + (1 − p) g ′(W − M ) = R B + η P                                                 (20)
                                                     R ( g ′(⋅)) 2
                                                       M



       Comparing (19) and (20), we can see that the private and social solutions once

again diverge only when η P > 0 , i.e., when the collateral constraint binds. Moreover,

                                                                       λ g ′′(⋅)
when this does happen, the additional term in (20), η P                              , is negative, meaning
                                                                     R ( g ′(⋅)) 2
                                                                       M



that the planner prefers a lower marginal product of W, or alternatively, a higher level of

W. Thus the optimal regulation takes the form of a floor on liquidity holdings by the PIs.




                                                30
         This result connects to Farhi, Golosov and Tsyvinski (2007), who also develop a

rationale for liquidity regulation. However, the mechanism in FGT is very different.

Following Diamond and Dybvig (1983), Jacklin (1987), Bhattacharya and Gale (1987),

and Allen and Gale (2004), they model banks as providers of insurance to consumers

with unpredictable liquidity needs. As this literature has shown, incentive-compatible

insurance can be frustrated by the existence of securities markets, since “late” consumers

may be tempted to mimic “early” consumers by withdrawing their money from the bank

prematurely, and reinvesting it at the market rate of interest. The insight of FGT is that

liquidity requirements can be used to depress the security-market rate, thereby reducing

the temptation for late consumers to withdraw early. By contrast, in my model, real rates

are pinned down by the linear preferences of households, and thus unaffected by liquidity

requirements. Instead, the rationale for a liquidity requirement reflects a wholly different

motivation, namely a desire to lessen the equilibrium fire-sale discount.

         While liquidity requirements arise naturally in my framework, there are a couple

of caveats. First, the liquidity requirements envisioned by the theory may be difficult to

enforce. To implement them efficiently, they have to be imposed on PIs at time 0, in

proportion to the scale of each PI’s time-1 investment opportunities.24 But a regulator

may not know at time 0 what the distribution of time-1 projects across PIs looks like. By

contrast, the monetary regulation described above does not face this enforcement

problem, since short-term debt issuance is contemporaneously observable, at time 0.

         Second, in the limited set of numerical experiments that I have tried, the planner’s

utility gain from imposing liquidity regulation turns out to be much smaller than that

24
   Alternatively, in the interpretation of the model where the banks and the PIs are merged into a single
entity, optimal liquidity regulation would involve requiring larger holdings of W by those entities with
larger-scale investment opportunities at time 1. Again, this information may be hard to ascertain at time 0.


                                                    31
from regulating the creation of private money. Combined with the enforcement problem

just above, this helps explain why the primary focus of the analysis in this paper has been

on the latter. The following example is illustrative of the magnitudes that arise.



       Example 4: Keep everything the same as in Example 1, except allow W to be

chosen endogenously: f(I) = ψlog(I) + I, g(K) = θlog(K), RB = 1.04; RM = 1.01; ψ = 3.5; θ

= 150; λ = 1; and p = 0.98. The PIs’ optimal choice of W is given by W* = 146.31,

whereas the social optimum is given by W** = 147.04. Compared to a benchmark case

with no regulation at all, the following regulatory configurations produce these increases

in the planner’s utility: i) regulation only of money creation: +0.0148; ii) regulation of

both money creation and liquidity: +0.0167; and iii) regulation of just liquidity: +0.0014.

Thus in this example, the benefit of liquidity regulation is approximately one-tenth that

which comes from regulating money creation.



         B. Deposit Insurance and Lender of Last Resort

        In the baseline version of the model, the only way for banks to pay off their short-

term creditors in the crisis state is by fire-selling their assets, and the only role for policy

is to control the amount of short-term debt that is created ex ante. An alternative approach

would be for the government to try to stem the amount of socially costly fire sales that

occur for a given amount of short-term bank debt. This could be done either with either

deposit insurance, or a lender-of-last resort policy.

        Unlike in the classic framework of Diamond and Dybvig (1983), such policies are

not costless to the government in equilibrium, because here, in the crisis state, there is a




                                              32
probability (1 – q) that the banks’ assets will turn out to be entirely worthless. So there is

always a chance that taxpayers will be left on the hook. If taxpayer-financed bailouts

create deadweight losses, the overall optimum set of policies may have the realistic

feature that: i) some fraction of banks’ money-like claims are insured by the government;

ii) the remainder are uninsured, and hence still subject to fire-sale risk; and iii) as before,

it makes sense for the regulator to control the total quantity of bank-created money.

       To see this explicitly, consider a case where the deadweight costs of taxation take

the following form: there is no cost to raising any amount less than L to pay for a bailout,

but it is infinitely costly to raise anything more than L.     It follows that the amount of

government-insured money that can be created, MI, is bounded by MI ≤ L, and it will in

fact always be optimal to set MI = L. Note too that if the government offers insurance on

some amount of bank deposits, it will have to put in place a rule to prevent banks from

selling all of their assets in a crisis state to satisfy the demands of uninsured depositors;

otherwise banks will create just as much uninsured money as before, and the deposit

insurer will always be left holding an empty shell in the crisis state. A simple version of

such a rule—which can effectively be thought of as a ban on fraudulent conveyance—is a

requirement that the fraction of assets sold in a crisis, Δ, not exceed the relative

proportion of uninsured deposits. Thus the requirement that goes along with insurance is

            MU
that Δ ≤            , where MU is the quantity of uninsured money created by the bank.
           MU + M I

       It follows that the total amount of money—insured plus uninsured—that can be

created must satisfy the same collateral constraint as before: M = M U + M I ≤ k λ I . The

only thing that is changed is the determination of the fire-sale discount k. Since insured




                                              33
depositors are protected and do not need to demand repayment at time 1, only uninsured

deposits give rise to fire sales. Thus k is now given by:

        1
          = g ′(W − M U ) = g ′(W − M + L)                                          (21)
        k

       In other words, the outcome in a world with limited deposit insurance is

equivalent to that in a world with no deposit insurance, but where the wealth of the PIs is

augmented from W to (W + L). A given amount of total money creation now causes less

fire-sale damage, and as a result, more money can be created in equilibrium.

       Equation (21) also makes clear the close connection between deposit insurance

and a lender-of-last-resort function. Given that the government can never put itself in a

position to lose more than L, an alternative to deposit insurance would be for it to leave

all deposits uninsured, but to commit to step in and invest L alongside the PIs in the event

of a fire sale. This would have exactly the same effect—it would reduce the fire-sale

discount per equation (21), and thereby allow for more total money creation.

       The bottom line is that one can add deposit insurance to the model in such a way

as to make it more realistic, without changing any of its qualitative properties. The

optimal policy mix will involve limited use of deposit insurance or equivalently, limited

use of a lender-of-last-resort function.     Banks will continue to issue uninsured money-

like claims alongside insured deposits, and hence will continue to create some degree of

fire-sale risk. Thus as before, there will continue to be a motive for regulating the

creation of these uninsured short-term claims.

       C. Regulating the Shadow Banking System

       The model also assumes that all private money is manufactured by commercial

banks that are subject to reserve requirements. Hence private money creation can be


                                               34
completely controlled by conventional open-market operations. While this may be an

adequate representation of an earlier period in history, it omits an important form of

money creation in the modern economy. As Gorton and Metrick (2010) and Gorton

(2010) emphasize, private money—in precisely the sense meant here—is also created by

the unregulated shadow banking system, via the large volume of repo finance that is

collateralized by securitized loan pools of one form or another.

       This observation suggests that commercial banks and shadow banks should be

regulated in a symmetric fashion. According to the logic of the model, the ideal way to

do this would be to broaden the reach of reserve requirements, so that the cap-and-trade

regime covers all the short-term liabilities of both commercial banks and shadow banks.

If, due to some political constraint outside the model, the liabilities of shadow banks

cannot be subjected to reserve requirements, an alternative approach might be to impose a

regime of “haircut” requirements on their investments. In particular, the central bank

could specify the maximum fraction of private money—that is, repo financing—that

could be issued against a given amount of collateralizable assets. Moreover, just as the

optimal quantity of bank-created money M** varies with economic conditions, optimal

haircuts would respond to these conditions as well. The appendix provides a brief

analysis of haircut regulation. It turns out that while such regulation is indeed useful, it is

strictly less efficient than direct control of the quantity of privately-created money via,

e.g., the sort of reserve-requirements-based mechanism outlined above.

       D. Government Debt Maturity

       As we have seen, the magnitude of the externality associated with private money

creation is related to the bond-money spread ( R B − R M ) : when the spread widens, the




                                              35
wedge between the social and private returns to money creation goes up. Thus an

alternative way to moderate the externality would be to compress the spread. In the

current version of the model this is impossible—given the assumption of linear

preferences, the spread is exogenously fixed and insensitive to asset supplies.

       However, if one changes the model so that the monetary services enjoyed by

households are a concave function of the supply of money—i.e., there is diminishing

marginal utility of money—then it becomes possible for the government to act on the

bond-money spread. For example, since short-term Treasury bills are riskless, they can

provide the same monetary services as short-term bank debt. Hence an increase in the

supply of Treasury bills will, in this modified setting, reduce the bond-money spread.

       One appeal of dealing with the externality in this fashion is that unlike some other

regulatory approaches, it does not invite evasion. For example, if the scope of reserve

requirements were broadened, private actors might try to get around limits on their ability

to use short-term debt by using various forms of hidden borrowing, e.g., by embedding

the borrowing in an opaque derivative contract. In contrast, when the relative cost of

short-term borrowing goes up—because the market has been saturated with riskless

short-term claims—the incentive to create private money is blunted.

       In Greenwood, Hanson and Stein (2010), we use this observation as the point of

departure for a normative theory of government debt maturity.          We argue that the

government should choose a shorter debt maturity—and in particular, should issue more

riskless T-bills—than it otherwise might, in an active effort to crowd out the short-term

debt of financial intermediaries. The argument is based on a principle of comparative

advantage. On the one hand, tilting its issuance towards short-term debt is not without




                                            36
cost for the government, since with stochastic interest rates this increases the variability

of future interest payments and ultimately disrupts efforts to smooth tax rates over time.

On the other hand, short-term government debt, unlike the short-term debt of financial

intermediaries, does not create fire-sale risk. To the extent that the fire-sale externality is

more costly to the economy at the margin than the disruption of tax smoothing, it can

make sense for the government to take on a bigger role in providing the short-term

riskless claims that the economy demands.25

         Of course, precisely because of tax-smoothing considerations, it will not generally

be optimal for the government to tilt so strongly towards short-maturity issuance as to

entirely eliminate the bond-money spread in equilibrium. Rather, optimal behavior by

the government on this dimension will typically involve leaving the spread only partially

compressed. So while government debt maturity may be one helpful tool in addressing

the problem of excessive private money creation, it is not a panacea, and it is unlikely to

eliminate the usefulness of the other tools discussed above.

         E. Interest on Reserves

         I have thus far assumed that the price level is determined outside the central bank,

by the fiscal-theory mechanism. While this is a convenient modeling device, it is not an

essential piece of the story. An alternative approach, in the New-Keynesian spirit, would

be to model prices as being anchored by the central bank’s adherence to a “Taylor rule”

(Taylor 1993, 1999) which dictates its path for the short-term nominal rate.



25
  To the extent that monetary services reflect an ability to transact between time 0 and 1 without threat of
adverse selection, the relevant notion of risk is short-horizon risk—i.e., the potential for loss between time
0 and time 1. While long-term Treasuries offer certain ultimate payoffs, they are not riskless over short
horizons if interest rates are stochastic. Hence they can create adverse-selection problems in trade if one
party to a transaction has a better ability to forecast changes in rates than the other.


                                                     37
       However, this raises a potential problem of there being more objectives than tools.

If the short-term nominal rate must satisfy a Taylor rule in order to maintain price

stability, how can it also satisfy equation (18), which specifies its optimal value from a

regulatory perspective? One way out of this box is via the payment of interest on

reserves (IOR), which many central banks around the world have been doing for years,

and which the U.S. Federal Reserve first took up in October of 2008. As Goodfriend

(2002) points out, with IOR, there are two distinct methods for raising short-term

nominal rates: either by increasing the interest paid on reserve balances, or by draining

reserves from the system, thereby increasing their scarcity value. These methods are not

equivalent, since only the latter scarcity-based approach increases the effective “reserves

tax” paid by banks, which has been the focus of the analysis above.

       Building on this observation, Kashyap and Stein (2011) argue that IOR allows the

central bank to simultaneously accomplish two goals: i) set the short-term nominal rate in

accordance with a Taylor rule; and ii) implement an optimal regulatory scheme of the sort

described in this paper. They note that in a regime with IOR, one can decompose the

nominal federal funds rate f as follows:

        f = rIOR + ySVR                                                             (22)

where rIOR is the level of interest paid on reserves, and the ySVR is the quantity-mediated

scarcity value of reserves. The latter term corresponds exactly to the variable i in

equation (18), as it reflects the opportunity cost to a bank of holding reserves.

       For example, suppose that an analysis of the sort suggested by (18) yields the

conclusion that, for regulatory purposes, the optimal value of i (or equivalently, of ySVR )

is 2.0%, while an application of the Taylor rule implies that the optimal value of f is



                                             38
5.0%. In this case, the central bank should set rIOR to 3.0%, and then adjust the quantity

of reserves in the system until f equilibrates at 5.0%.



         VI. A Distinctive Account of the Monetary Transmission Mechanism

         Much of the discussion above has focused on the normative implications of the

model.     But the model is also of interest as a positive account of the monetary

transmission mechanism. Three of its properties are particularly noteworthy in this

regard. First, monetary policy has real effects even though all prices are perfectly

flexible. Second, monetary policy works entirely through a quantitative effect on bank

lending. That is, the real rates on both money and bonds are fixed and independent of the

stance of policy; an easing of policy impacts bank lending only because it enables banks

to use more of the former, relatively cheaper, funding source. This is a pure version of

the bank lending channel, and as such helps to explain how monetary policy can have

important real effects even when it does not move long-term open-market interest rates

by much, or when firm investment is not very responsive to such open-market rates.

         Third, the model has the property that the central bank does not lose control of

monetary policy when other, non-reservable forms of money are introduced. Consider

what happens if there is, in addition to the risky production technology already in the

model, a safe storage technology. Claims to this technology are riskless, and hence

circulate as an alternative transactions medium alongside bank-created money, bearing

the same gross interest rate of R M . They are also not subject to reserve requirements.

(To be more concrete, one can interpret these claims as money-market-fund deposits

backed by Treasury bills.) Even if the volume of these claims is large, nothing in the



                                             39
model changes. All real rates are already pinned down by the linearity of household

preferences, and are therefore unaffected by the total quantity of money in circulation.

        The distinctive feature of the model in this regard is that the central bank’s ability

to influence real outcomes derives not from its control over the total quantity of

transactions-facilitating claims available to households, but rather from the fact that it is

the unique provider of permits that allow banks to issue short-term debt and hence

finance themselves more cheaply. Simply put, only central-bank-provided reserves can

be used to satisfy the reserve requirements that constrain short-term debt issuance by

banks. This “permits” aspect of monetary policy is also emphasized in Stein (1998),

though the model in that paper differs significantly on other dimensions.26



        VII. Conclusions

        The basic message of this paper can be summarized as follows. Banks and other

financial intermediaries like to fund themselves with short-term debt. With sufficient

collateral backing it, this short-term debt can be made into riskless money, which,

because of the transactions services it generates, represents a cheap source of finance for

banks. While society benefits from this private money creation, banks’ private incentives

lead them to overdo it, since they do not fully internalize the fire-sales costs that are a

byproduct of their maturity-transformation activities. The externality associated with

excessive private money creation provides the fundamental rationale for financial-

stability regulation, and arguably, for the existence of central banks.



26
   In Stein (1998), reserves are effectively permits that allow banks to access the deposit insurance fund.
Since banks face an adverse-selection problem in raising uninsured finance, an increase in the quantity of
reserves can move lending closer to the first-best level.


                                                    40
       In a sufficiently simple institutional environment, the externality can be addressed

with conventional monetary policy, complemented by either deposit insurance or a

lender-of-last-resort facility. Indeed, this is one interpretation of what central banks have

done for much of their history. In a more realistic modern-day setting, where a substantial

shadow-banking sector exists alongside traditional commercial banks, other tools, such as

expanded reserve requirements, or haircut regulation, may also be necessary. If so,

central banks should not be reluctant to deploy these tools—to the extent that they do so

in an effort to contain excessive private money creation, they can be said to be pursuing

one of their traditional core missions in a more comprehensive and effective manner.




                                             41
        Appendix

        A. A Variant of the Model With Imperfect Pledgeability

        As noted in the text, the result that there is no externality in the low-M region

when m < m max is dependent on the assumption that, when the PIs invest in real projects,

they capture all the social surplus associated with these projects. An alternative approach

is to assume that the social return to a project financed by a PI is still given by g(K), but

that only φg(K) can be pledged to the PI. In this case, the equilibrium determination of k

                            1
in (4) is altered so that     = ϕ g ′(W − M ) .
                            k

        Equation (7), the bank’s first-order condition with respect to m, still holds as

stated. If the collateral constraint is not binding, so that η = 0 , this condition reduces to:

        ( R B − R M ) − (1 − p) zR M = 0.                                       (A.1)

However, the planner’s first-order condition for m in (12) is now modified, since we can

                       1
no longer substitute     = g ′(W − M ) . Instead, if η P = 0 this condition can be written as:
                       k

        ( R B − R M ) − (1 − p ) zR M − (1 − p )(1 − ϕ ) g ′(W − M ) R M = 0    (A.2)

        Thus even in the low-spread region where m < m max and I = IB, there is now a

wedge of (1 − p )(1 − ϕ ) g ′(W − M ) R M         between the private and social first-order

conditions. This implies that the optimal price of permits will now be strictly positive in

this region. Alternatively, in the monetary-policy implementation of the optimum, the

nominal interest rate will now be strictly positive for all parameter values.

        Another noteworthy feature of this version of the model is that it implies different

comparative statics than the baseline model with respect to the ex ante probability of a

financial crisis, as captured by (1 – p). Here, if we are in the low-spread region, an


                                                   42
increase in (1 – p) increases the wedge, and hence raises the optimal value of the permit

price P, or equivalently, the nominal interest rate. By contrast, in the baseline model with

perfect pledgeability, equation (14) says that an increase in (1 – p) lowers the desired

permit price. Intuitively, the difference is that in the baseline version of the model, banks

do a better job of internalizing the social costs of fire sales. Indeed, when the risk of a

fire sale goes up, banks become sufficiently more cautious about using short-term debt

that they become better aligned with the social planner, which in turn implies that there is

less need to rein them in by raising permit prices/interest rates. However, with imperfect

pledgeability, there is an effect in the opposite direction, since banks tend to underweight

the social costs of fire sales even when the collateral constraint is not binding.

       B. Haircut Regulation

       To see the effects of haircut regulation most transparently, consider the imperfect-

pledgeability version of the model described just above. Suppose that we are in a

“shadow-banking” economy where all else is the same as before, with one exception: it is

impossible to regulate the absolute quantity of privately-created money M directly—say

because shadow banks cannot be subjected to reserve requirements—but it is possible to

impose a cap mcap < m max on the fraction of investment that is money-financed.

       It turns out that this form of haircut regulation, while useful, is a second-best

means of intervention as compared to controlling the aggregate quantity of money. This

is because the social costs of fire sales are a function of M, so this is the item that the

planner would ideally like to control. And trying to do this indirectly, by picking a value

of mcap , will now have the undesired side-effect of encouraging shadow banks to raise

their investment above the optimal level of I B . (I am assuming that we are in the low-



                                              43
spread region of the parameter space, so that absent haircut regulation, shadow banks

would choose I = I B .) Intuitively, haircut regulation always gives shadow banks the

option to create more cheap money financing at the margin, so long as they are willing to

raise the level of investment.

        This can be seen formally by considering the first-order condition with respect to

I for a shadow bank facing binding haircut regulation:

         dΠ
            = pf ′( I ) + (1 − p)λ − R B + mcap {( R B − R M ) − (1 − p) zR M } = 0       (A.3)
         dI

        It follows that it is impossible to use haircut regulation to implement the social

optimum described in (A.2). For if (A.2) is satisfied with I = IB, it must be that

( R B − R M ) − (1 − p ) zR M = (1 − p )(1 − ϕ ) g ′(W − M ) R M > 0 .   But then for (A.3) to be

satisfied, i.e., for the shadow bank to be optimizing given the haircut constraint, we

require pf ′( I ) + (1 − p)λ − R B < 0 , which means that I > IB.

         Private and Socially Optimal Outcomes Versus the Money-Bond Spread

The figure plots private and socially optimal values of money creation M and investment
I as a function of RM. Functional forms and parameter values are as follows: f(I) =
ψlog(I) + I; g(K) = θlog(K); RB = 1.04; ψ = 3.5; θ = 150; λ = 1; W = 140; and p = 0.98.
RM varies between 1.0 and 1.035.
