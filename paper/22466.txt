                                         ABSTRACT

Research on the geographical distribution of international portfolios has mainly focused on data
aggregated to the country level. We exploit newly-available data that disaggregates the holders
and issuers of international securities along sectoral lines. We find that patterns evident in the
aggregate data do not uniformly apply across the various holding and issuing sectors, such that a
full understanding of cross-border portfolio positions requires granular-level analysis.

1.       Introduction

The analysis of international financial linkages is a primary theme in international macroe-
conomic research. At the theoretical level, the extent and characteristics of international
financial integration influence macroeconomic outcomes and the cross-border risk distri-
bution. In similar vein, the capacity of policy officials to scan the horizon for emerging
macro-financial risks and calibrate policy interventions depends on an adequate under-
standing of international financial transmission mechanisms. Along both dimensions, a
solid platform of empirical evidence is necessary in order to help design useful models
and make effective policy decisions.
     Since 2001, the Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS) has been published
on a regular basis by the International Monetary Fund.1 Relative to aggregate inter-
national investment position data, the CPIS represented a significant improvement by
publishing the geographical composition of cross-border bond and equity holdings for
the reporting countries.2
     Building on the extensive gravity literature on international trade patterns and pre-
vious work on geographical patterns in international financial flows (Portes and Rey
2005), an empirical literature soon developed that studied the cross-country variation in
bilateral portfolio holdings (Lane and Milesi-Ferretti 2008, Coeurdacier and Martin 2009,
and Hale and Obstfeld 2016).3 In turn, these empirical patterns have also inspired new
theoretical models (Okawa and Van Wincoop 2012).
     However, this literature has just studied the aggregate bilateral data. This is restric-
tive, since the transmission of international financial shocks may depend on the identities

     1
       A trial survey was run in 1997 with a limited number of reporter countries. The CPIS was published
on an annual basis from 2001 until 2012; and has been published twice a year since 2013. The number of
reporters now stands at 78 (latest release). A sister survey on direct investment positions (the CDIS) has
been run since 2009.

       See Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2008) for an extensive discussion of the limitations of the dataset.

       The main focus has been on explaining cross-country variation in the levels of bilateral holdings. Gal-
styan and Lane (2013) explore the dynamic adjustment of bilateral holdings during the global financial
crisis.

of the issuers and holders of portfolio securities. Accordingly, the recent expansion of the
CPIS to provide sectoral information on the holders and issuers of portfolio securities is
welcome.4 This paper represents a first attempt to analyse these newly-available data.
    Previewing our results, we find important differences in the geographical patterns
of international portfolio allocation across these categories. In relation to both holders
and issuers of international securities, the data highlight the importance of gravity-type
factors in the cross-border distribution of portfolio securities. We also find that common
membership of the euro area is non-negligible for the holding sectors of both portfolio
debt and equity securities; while a similar pattern is present across all issuing sectors
for debt securities, we find no such correspondence across issuing sectors in relation to
equities.
    Our results highlight that patterns evident in the aggregate data do not uniformly
apply across all individual holding or issuing sectors. For instance, across holding sectors
in advanced countries, the distance effect is stronger for banks and households than for
other financial corporations and non-financial corporations. To take another example, in
relation to the portfolio debt issued by emerging economies, investors exhibit a stronger
distance effect vis-à-vis bonds issued by banks or sovereigns than vis-à-vis bonds issued
by non-financial corporates.
    The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the CPIS data. In
Section 3 we describe the empirical approach, while in Section 4 we report the economet-
ric results. Some conclusions are offered in Section 5.

      Ideally, a complete dataset that identifies the ultimate owner and ultimate issuer of each security would
be an “asset”. The expanded CPIS is confined to broad sectoral categories and is organised on a residency
basis rather than a nationality basis.

2.       The CPIS Data

2.1.     Data Availability

To analyse the bilateral distribution of holdings and issuances of portfolio assets, we
employ data from the Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS). Until recently,
the CPIS primarily reported aggregate bilateral holdings of bonds and equity. While the
availability of bilateral data was a step improvement relative to international investment
position data that only included aggregate foreign holdings, it was also clear that the ab-
sence of extensive sectoral and currency information on the composition of the bilateral
data severely limited the ability of analysts to make useful inferences.
     Since 2013, an expanded version of the CPIS reports the sectoral identities of the
issuers of portfolio securities (22 countries) and the holders of portfolio securities (67
countries). In addition, more countries (50 countries) now also report the currency com-
position of their international bond holdings, even if the currency breakdown is not
available on a bilateral basis. The sectoral categories of issuers are: central banks (CB),
deposit-taking corporations excluding central banks (BANKS), other financial corpora-
tions (OFC), general government (GG) and nonfinancial corporations (NFC). Similarly,
the sectoral categories of holders are: central banks (CB); deposit-taking corporations
excluding central bank (BANKS); other financial corporations (OFC); general govern-
ment (GG); nonfinancial corporations (NFC); households (HH), and non-profit institu-
tions serving households (NPISH). The OFC category is further broken down into sub-
sectors: insurance corporations and pension funds (ICPF), money market funds (MMF),
and others (OOFC). The currency composition is broken down between: dollars, euro,
yen, Swiss Francs, Sterling and a catch-all Other category.5




     5
     There are many zero observations in the CPIS data associated with trivial holdings or minor destina-
tions. In order to avoid skewed results, we eliminate this subset of data.

2.2.      Stylised Facts

Figures 1a-1c present the sectoral shares of total portfolio assets by holders for selected
years. We note several observations. First, there are differences across sectoral hold-
ings. The category of other financial corporations (which includes the various types of
investment firms) holds the lion’s share of total portfolio assets at 54 percent in 2004 and
64 percent in 2014. These are followed by banks, households and the general govern-
ment, respectively. Non-financial corporations, together with non-profit organisations
and central banks (labeled others) hold the smallest share of portfolio assets at less than
4 percent.
    Second, across sample periods, the holdings of banks have declined from 36 percent
in 2004 to 31 percent at the peak of the global financial crisis in 2008-2009 to around 20
percent in 2014. In contrast, the portfolio holdings of the general government sector has
steadily increased from 4.6 percent in 2004, to 5.8 percent in 2008 and about 8.3 percent
in 2014.
    In Figures 1d-1i, we split total portfolio assets into debt and equity holdings and
show a similar sectoral breakdown. Among the sectors, consistent with Figures 1a-1c,
other financial corporations hold the largest shares in both asset classes. While the other
financial corporations sector has maintained a relatively stable share of equity holdings,
its share in debt holdings has expanded from 47 percent in 2004 to 60 percent in 2014.
This increase has been matched by a steady decline in the bond holdings of banks from
44.3 percent in 2004 to 37.9 percent in 2008 and 27.2 percent in 2014. The second largest
holder of equity assets are governments, with the share increasing from 7 percent to 13
percent, while banks have experienced a twofold decline in their equity share from 2004
to 2008. As might be expected, banks hold far more bonds than equity, while the other
sectors hold larger proportions of equities.
    Figures 2a-2c show the breakdown of liability issuance by sectors for 2014.6 Across

    6
        The distribution for 2013 is very similar.
                                                                                                            5


the sectors, we observe roughly equal shares in total issuance by banks, other financial
corporations, non-financial corporations and general government.7 The split between
asset classes highlights that banks and the general government are the largest issuers
of debt liabilities while (not surprisingly) non-financial corporations dominate in the is-
suance of equity securities.8
    Tables 1 and 2 present some sectoral distributional patterns in the holding and is-
suance of cross-border securities across country groups for year 2014. Table 1 shows that
the country-level “all sectors” statistics obscure substantial variation across holding sec-
tors in terms of the portfolio allocations between advanced and emerging destinations.
In addition, Table 1 shows differences in portfolio allocations between investors in ad-
vanced economies and investors in emerging economies. In particular, the cross-border
portfolios of investors in advanced countries are dominated by the securities issued by
other advanced economies. In contrast, investors in emerging economies hold a signif-
icant share of their cross-border portfolios in other emerging economies. For instance,
households in emerging economies allocate 18 percent of their international portfolio
debt holdings to emerging countries, compared with only 6 percent of cross-border hold-
ings allocated to emerging countries by households in advanced countries. An exception
is that the cross-border portfolios held by governments in emerging economies are more
heavily concentrated in advanced economies than is the case for advanced-economy gov-
ernments. This is driven by the portfolio debt category and is consistent with emerging
governments holding advanced-economy bonds for reserve management reasons.
    Table 2 shows that the portfolio allocations of investors in advanced and emerg-
ing economies differ sharply across the various issuing sectors, especially in relation to
the portfolio securities issued by emerging economies. For instance, only 8 percent of
the cross-border public debt issued by emerging countries is held by investors in other
    7
       Of other financial corporations, “other” other financial corporations are the dominant issuers of port-
folio debt securities with a sectoral share of around 98 percent. These also dominate equity issuance, albeit
to a lesser extent, with a share of 71 percent. Mutual funds are the second largest issuers of equity with a
sectoral share of 23 percent.
     8
       The government sector has a near-zero share in equity issuance.

emerging economies, whereas investors in emerging economies hold significant fractions
of the cross-border debt and equity liabilities of non-financial corporates in emerging
economies at 25.1 percent and 27.0 percent respectively. In addition, the emerging-to-
emerging category is also substantial for the bonds issued by banks in emerging economies
at 29.5 percent.
    Figures 3a-3c describe the currency composition of international debt holdings. Among
the currencies, almost half of holdings are denominated in euro (EUR). This can be ex-
plained by the high level of cross-border financial trade among member countries of the
euro area (Lane 2006). Holdings in US dollar (USD) are in second place at around 30 per-
cent of total portfolio holdings. Debt denominated in Japanese yen (YEN) comes in third
and has been declining since 2004, while the shares of Swiss Franc (CHF) and Sterling
(GBP) have remained relatively small and stable. Another notable feature of the graph is
the substantial increase in the share of debt liabilities denominated in “other” currencies
from 6 percent in 2008 to 10.5 percent in 2014. This is consistent with the much-discussed
increase in the willingness of global investors to hold the local-currency bonds of emerg-
ing economies.
    Finally, we also highlight substantial variation in the currency shares of bond hold-
ings across advanced and emerging groups. The currency share of debt holdings for ad-
vanced countries is the highest for euro (49 percent) and dollars (30.4 percent), while the
highest shares are allocated to dollars (60 percent) and the “other” category (22 percent)
in emerging economies. As noted above, the high euro share for advanced economies re-
flects the high degree of cross-border bond investment among euro area countries, while
the predominance of US dollars in the portfolio debt assets of emerging economies is
consistent with the central role played by the dollar in the international financial envi-
ronment facing these countries.9

3.    Empirical Specification


Our objective is to investigate whether the bilateral variables that have been identified as
significant covariates of aggregate bilateral portfolio holdings exhibit different patterns
across the disaggregated categories of sectoral holders and issuers of portfolio securities.
     There are various reasons to expect differential patterns in cross-border portfolio al-
locations across holding sectors. First, the degree of professionalisation of portfolio se-
lection may vary across holding sectors, with the choices of institutional investors in the
OFC category systematically differing from the choices of households. Second, the port-
folio strategies of governments may be influenced by a wider range of factors than the
trade off between expected returns and risk (for example, portfolio composition may be
dominated by reserve management considerations). Third, differences in the severity
of informational frictions across sectors might have an asymmetric impact on the com-
position of portfolios. Similarly, the sectoral identity of the issuers of securities may be
important. For instance, the information frictions facing foreign investors may be quite
different for opaque issuers (such as banks) than for large non-financial corporates that
are easier to analyse.
     In examining the geographical distribution of positions, we follow the established
gravity literature by employing the following benchmark specification


                         ln(Akij,t ) = αki,t + αkj,t + g ij θ k + mij η k + ij,t        (1)


where ln(Akij,t ) is the log of the outstanding bilateral position by reporting country i in
destination country j at the end of year t, g ij is a row vector of gravity-type controls
while mij is a row vector of membership dummies with corresponding θ k and η k col-
umn vectors of coefficients. The index k captures the different categories of holders and
the different categories of issuers and the instrument in question (portfolio debt or port-
folio equity). The gravity variables we consider are the logarithms of bilateral distance
8


between capitals, bilateral imports and dummies for shared language, colonial histories
and legal origins.10
     The second set of controls, justifiable on grounds of either informational frictions
and/or political economy considerations, is captured by the membership vector which
includes dummies that take the value 1 if both source and destination countries are mem-
bers of the corresponding regional bloc (euro area, European Economic Association, and
Association of Southeast Asian Nations respectively) and 0 otherwise.11 The inclusion
of a euro area dummy captures the effect of a common currency, possibly with heteroge-
nous implications for portfolio allocations in relation to the different sectors of holders
and issuers.
     To control for local, partner and global time-varying factors, we run the regressions
with source and host country-time dummies.12 In the current specification, αki,t captures
variables affecting aggregate foreign portfolio holdings by source country i at time t,
while αkj,t controls for variables affecting the aggregate foreign portfolio liability position
of destination country j at time t. Effectively these time-varying host/source effects filter
common trends and valuation effects out of portfolio allocation, so that what remains is
the purely bilateral variation.13 Given the bilateral nature of the data, it is reasonable to
expect some heteroskedasticity at the country-pair level. To account for the impact of
non-spherical disturbances, we estimate equation (1) with OLS and correct the standard
errors.14
     Regarding the control variables, we take the level of bilateral imports from the IMF’s
Direction of Trade Statistics database. Data for distance, common language and colonial

    10
      Following the established literature, we interpret bilateral distance as capturing bilateral information
costs as well as trade costs such as communication difficulties in real time and the duration of flights between
countries (Aviat and Coeurdacier 2007, Daude and Fratzscher 2008, Lane and Milesi-Ferretti 2008, Martin
and Rey 2004, Portes and Rey 2005, Stein and Daude 2007).
   11
      If common membership of international institutions reduces informational frictions, we may expect
increased bilateral holdings.
   12
      Inclusion of these dummies makes country-specific variables, such as market size and capital controls,
redundant.

links are from the CEPII Distances database, while data on legal origins are from La Porta
el al (2008). Finally, information on the membership of various blocs is obtained from
www.ecb.int for the euro area, www.europa.eu for the European Economic Association,
and www.aseansec.org for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
     The sectoral data on the holders of portfolio securities are available for a longer pe-
riod (2001-2014) than the sectoral data on the issuers of portfolio securities (2013-2014).
We examine sub-samples of advanced and emerging markets as holders and issuers vis-
à-vis other countries as well.




4.     Results

4.1.   International Portfolios: Holding Sectors

Table 3 presents results for international portfolio debt patterns by the different hold-
ing sectors. We split the sample between advanced reporting countries in Panel A and
emerging reporting countries in Panel B. Table 3 confirms that most holding sectors ex-
hibit the basic gravity pattern by which international bond holdings are disproportion-
ately concentrated in neighbouring countries. Among advanced economies, the distance
effect is stronger for banks and households than for other financial corporations and
non-financial corporations; these differences are less apparent for investors in emerging
economies. The sectoral differences for advanced countries warrant further investigation
to understand why the bond portfolios of banks and households exhibit greater sensitiv-
ity to distance than the bond portfolios of other financial corporations and non-financial
corporations.
     It is striking that the distance effect is not significant for bond holdings of the gov-
ernment sector. This is perhaps not surprising to the extent that the bond holdings of
governments are mainly in the form of official reserves and may be concentrated in the
major reserve currencies rather than in neighbouring countries.
10


     For both advanced and emerging reporting countries, trade is consistently signifi-
cant as a covariate of bond holdings for the different holding sectors: this may reflect a
hedging motive by which investors guard against the risk of depreciation vis-à-vis major
import partners (Obstfeld and Rogoff 2001). The common legal origins dummy is also
typically significant for both groups, with the exception of the holdings of banks and
non-financial corporates in emerging economies. It is striking that a common language
is typically important for holding sectors in emerging economies but is not significant
for investors in advanced economies (with the exception of a significant but negative
coefficient for the bond holdings of advanced-country banks).
     In relation to common membership of institutional blocs (euro area, European Eco-
nomic Area, Association of Southeast Asian Nations), common membership of the euro
area is significantly positive across all holding sectors, with common membership of the
European Economic Area significantly positive for the holdings of non-financial corpora-
tions but significantly negative for banks and households. For the emerging group, com-
mon membership of the European Economic Area is significantly positive for other fi-
nancial corporations, banks and households, so that this institutional anchor seems more
important for these holding sectors in the emerging economies of Central and Eastern
Europe than for these holding sectors in the advanced economies. The ASEAN dummy
is significantly positive for banks but significantly negative for other financial corpora-
tions.
     In Table 4, we conduct a similar exercise in relation to international portfolio equity
holdings. Relative to the patterns for bond holdings in Table 3, Table 4 shares some simi-
larities but also exhibits some differences. For investors in both advanced and emerging
economies, the distance effect is negative and statistically significant. Among advanced
countries, banks, households and non-financial corporations exhibit the highest sensi-
tivity to distance. The government sector is least sensitive to distance, a finding that
is qualitatively similar to the distance-insensitivity of its bond holdings. There is less
                                                                                          11


sectoral variation in the distance coefficient in the sample of emerging markets.
   Trade is a positive and consistently significant covariate across both sample splits.
Furthermore, in the group of advanced countries, we observe disproportionately higher
holdings by banks of equities issued by trade partners. It is noteworthy that legal origins
matter for equity investors in advanced economies substantially more than for equity
investors in emerging economies, with households in the former group attaching the
highest weight to this variable. We also find that a common language is marginally more
important for holding sectors in emerging economies than advanced economies.
   Finally, the institutional variables appear to be more essential for the holding sectors
of advanced countries than emerging countries. In particular, cross-border holdings of
equity securities across all sectors show a significantly positive covariation with common
membership of the euro area. Among these sectors, the other financial corporations sec-
tor shows the least sensitivity to the membership dummy. In relation to the European
Economic Area, it is striking to observe a significantly negative coefficient in relation to
equity holdings for most sectors, with households in advanced countries exhibiting the
highest sensitivity (the EEA dummy is insignificant for the government sector). This pat-
tern is in stark contrast to the effect that EEA membership has on cross-border holdings
of debt securities.



4.2.   International Portfolios: Issuing Sectors

Panels A and B of Table 5 present results for portfolio debt regressions by the sector
of issuer for investors in advanced and emerging economies respectively. For advanced
economies, a striking pattern is that the distance variable is only significant for the bonds
issued by banks; distance is more generally significant for the bonds issued by the differ-
ent sectors in emerging economies, although considerably weaker for the bonds issued
by non-financial corporates relative to banks or sovereigns.
   In the sample of advanced reporting countries, trade is consistently positive and sig-
12


nificant as a covariate of the cross-border variation of debt liabilities, while trade mat-
ters only for the bonds issued by non-financial corporations in the sample of emerging
economies. Legal origin is also important for the bonds issued by governments and
non-financial corporations in emerging countries. This finding is consistent with the im-
portance of legal origins for the holding sectors of advanced countries, which, in turn,
hold 92 percent (for general government) and 75 percent (for non-financial corporations)
of debt liabilities issued by emerging countries.15
     In relation to the institutional variables, membership of the euro area is associated
with higher bilateral debt positions across most issuing sectors. Common membership of
the EEA is significantly positive for non-financial corporations, and marginally negative
for banks in advanced countries. In contrast, the EEA membership dummy is positive
and significant for the debt liabilities issued by sovereigns in emerging countries. The
implication is that investors from fellow EEA member countries are disproportionately
willing to hold the sovereign debt issued by governments in Central and Eastern Europe.
     Next, we shift our attention to equity-issuing sectors.16 In Panel A of Table 6, we
present results for the issuing sectors in advanced countries, while Panel B shows the
results for the issuing sectors in emerging countries. In stark contrast to the debt regres-
sions, distance is consistently negative and statistically significant across both samples.
While there is hardly any variation across sectors for the advanced and emerging groups,
there are important differences across the groups: equity-issuing sectors in emerging
economies seem to be disproportionately held by investors in neighbouring regions than
the corresponding sectors in advanced economies.
     Bilateral trade linkages and colonial links mostly matter to the issuing sectors of ad-
vanced countries, in particular vis-à-vis the shares issued by non-financial corporations
and banks. The common legal origin dummy is significant for both groups of coun-

       We do not include the government sector as an issuer of portfolio equity securities, since this category
is typically empty.

tries (with the exception of other financial corporations), with less apparent differences
both across sectors and across sample splits. It is striking, however, that in advanced
countries a common language is associated with a negative covariation pattern via-à-vis
the equity securities issued by banks, while the corresponding association is positive in
emerging economies. Turning to the institutional variables, the EEA dummy is positive
and statistically significant only for issuing banks in emerging economies: membership
to the European Economic Area has non-negligible implications for the funding sources
of banks in Central and Eastern Europe.



4.3.   Summary of Empirical Results

The main lessons from the gravity-type regressions reported in Tables 3-6 are as follows.
First, there is clear evidence that the elasticities of holdings to the various gravity vari-
ables differ across the various holding and issuing sectors. At a basic level, these find-
ings shows that there is clear value in having access to the disaggregated sectoral data,
in terms of understanding the composition of the investor base.
   Second, the general pattern of results is in line with our priors that gravity pat-
terns should be weaker for professional-type investors than for retail-type investors and
stronger for opaque-type issuing sectors than for more transparent-type issuing sectors.
For instance, Panel A of Table 3 shows that the elasticities of portfolio debt holdings vis-
à-vis distance and bilateral trade are lower for the professional-type investors included
in the OFC category (insurance companies, pension funds, hedge funds) than for the
household sector. Similarly, Panel A of Table 5 shows that the bonds issued by banks
in advanced economies are mainly held by investors in neighbouring countries, while
the distance term is not significant for the bonds issued by sovereigns and non-financial
corporates in advanced economies. This is intuitive, in view of the opaque nature of
bank balance sheets compared to the volumes of information available in relation to the
creditworthiness of sovereigns and large non-financial corporates.
14


     Third, we note that common membership of the euro area is associated with sig-
nificantly larger bilateral holdings across virtually all holding and issuing sectors, even
controlling for common membership of the European Economic Area.
     Fourth, Table 3 shows that the international bond portfolios of sovereign investors
are orthogonal to distance, for both advanced and emerging economies. This is consis-
tent with governments having quite different investment priorities compared to private-
sector investors. Most obviously, the international bond holdings of sovereigns relate to
reserve management considerations rather than to commercial criteria.
     Clearly, these findings are only a first step in exploiting the potential richness of the
expanded CPIS dataset. Much remains for future research.



5.    Conclusions

This paper has studied the newly-available disaggregated data from the Coordinated
Portfolio Investment Survey in order to explore whether geographical patterns in portfo-
lio holdings vary in systematic ways across different categories of investors and different
issuers of financial liabilities. The results in Table 3-6 reveal that that the patterns evident
in the aggregate bilateral data do not uniformly apply across the individual holding and
issuing sectors.
     While these results are intriguing, a greater level of understanding requires further
progress in the collection and distribution of granular cross-border financial data (Lane
2015). For instance, the CPIS organises the data on a residency basis, while information
on the nationalities of the holders and issuers of securities is critical for understanding
the distribution of financial risk (Acharya et al 2015, Adjiev et al 2015). To make further
progress, a major shift in the international financial data architecture is required.
