Effects of the Changing U.S. Age Distribution on Macroeconomic Equations


                               ABSTRACT


     The effects of the changing U.S. age distribution on various

macroeconomic equations are examined in this paper. The equations include

consumption, money demand, housing investment, and labor force participation

equations. Seven age groups are analyzed: 16-19, 20-24, 25-29, 30-39, 40-

54, 55-64, and 65+. There seems to be enough variance in the age

distribution data to allow reasonably precise estimates of the effects of a

number of age categories on the macro variables. The results show that,

other things being equal, age groups 30-39 and 40-54 consume less than

average, invest less in housing than average, and demand more money than

average. Age group 55-64 consumes more and demands more money. If these

estimates are right, they imply, other things being equal, that consumption

and housing investment will be negatively affected in the future as more and

more baby boomers enter the 30-54 age group. The demand for money will be

positively affected.

    If, as Easterlin argues, the average wage that an age group faces is

negatively affected by the percent of the population in that group, then the

labor force participation rate of a group should depend on the relative size

of the group. If the substitution effect dominates, people in a large group

should work less than average, and if the income effect dominates, they

should work more than average. The results indicate that the •substitution

effect dominates for women 25-54 and that the income effect dominates for

men 25-54.

I. Introduction

     A common assumption in empirical macroeconomics is that behavior can be

summarized in terms of a representative agent. To the extent that this

assumption is violated, aggregate equations are misspecified. If the income

and age distributions of the population are fairly constant across time, the

misspecification due to the representative agent assumption may be small and

not of much concern. A striking feature of the post-war U.S. society,

however, has been the baby boom of the late 1940's and the 1950's and the

subsequent falling off of the birth rate in the 1960's. This can be seen in

Figure 1, where the number of births by year is plotted for the period 1910-

1984. The number of births rose from 2.8 million in 1945 to 4.3 million in

1961 and then fell back to 3.1 million in 1974. The consequences of this

birth pattern for the percentage of middle age people in the working age

population can be seen in Figure 2, where the ratio of the population 30-54

to the population 16+ is plotted for the years 1952-1986. This ratio fell

from .47 in 1952 to .38 in 1976 as the baby boomers accounted for more and

more of the population 16+. The ratio has risen sharply since 1981 as the

baby boomers have begun to pass the age of 30. This rapidly changing age

distribution clearly casts doubt on the reasonableness of the representative

agent assumption.

     In this paper we use U.S. Census Bureau age distribution data to

examine the effects of the changing U.S. age distribution on several

macroeconometric relationships, including consumption, money demand, housing

investment, and labor force participation. Consumption equations are

considered first. The life cycle model of Ando and Modigliani (1963)

predicts that people in their prime working years consume a smaller fraction

of their income than do people younger and older. As will be seen, this can

be tested using the age distribution data)

     Demand for money equations are considered next. In the Baumol (1952)

and Tobin (1956) model of the demand for money, there is a positive

relationship between the transactions costs associated with obtaining money

and the optimal amount of money held by individuals. If the opportunity

cost of bank visits is higher for prime-age people, which seems likely, then

prime-age people will hold more money relative to their transactions than

will people younger and older. This hypothesis can also be tested using the

age distribution data.

     Housing investment is considered next. If housing consumption is

roughly proportional to the stock of housing, then the life cycle model

implies that the housing stock (and thus housing investment) relative to


     1As far as we know, no previous study has used the census population
data to examine the effects of age on consumption. A number of studies of
saving behavior have incorporated demographic factors using household survey
data rather than census population data. Examples are Lieberman and Wachtel
(1980) and Kane (1984). These studies have not provided reliable evidence
on how changes in the age structure of the population affect personal saving
behavior. In large part, the problem appears to be due to the limitations
inherent in the survey data employed in the tests. Kane, for example,
reports that "Survey respondents often provide erroneous information that is
inconsistent ... these problems make it difficult to determine whether
variability from survey to survey is due to actual changes in behavior or
due to measurement difficulties." (p. 316)
     Blinder (1975) and Stoker (1986) have tested for the effect of the
income distribution on saving behavior and report no systematic
relationship. They voice suspicion, however, that their results do not stem
from the lack of a relationship, but rather from the relative stability of
the U.S. income distribution since World War II. The advantage of the age
distribution data used in this study is that there is considerable variation
in the data over the sample period. There may thus be a good chance of
picking up the effects of the changing age distribution on coefficients in
macroeconometric equations if the effects are actually there.

income should vary with age.     Prime-age people should consume less housing

relative to their income than do older and younger people.

     Finally, labor force participation equations are examined. Easterlin

(1987) and Berger (1985) argue that larger cohorts on average face a lower

wage rate because there are more people their own age to compete with. If

this is the case, then the size of the cohort should affect the labor force

participation of individuals in the cohort. They will work less if the

substitution effect dominates, and they will work more if the income effect

dominates.



II. Consumption and Money Demand

The Methodology

     Divide the population into J age groups. Let Dl be 1 if individual i

is in age group 1 in period t and 0 otherwise; let D21 be 1 if individual i

is in age group 2 in period t and 0 otherwise; and so on through

Consider the following equation:

                                                              i =
(1) Cit              + +         + ... +
                                                                    1,...,N
                                               aDJ1 + 3t      t =   1,. . ,T
                                                                       .




where        is the dependent variable (say consumption or money demand of

individual i in period t),       is a 1 x k vector of explanatory variables

not including the constant,     is a k x 1 vector of coefficients, and U. is

the error term. The constant term in the equation is 'y +            for an

individual in age group j in period t.            is the number of people in the

population in period t.

     Equation (1) is restrictive because it assumes that         is the same

across all individuals, but it is less restrictive than a typical
                                               4

macroeconomic equation, which also assumes that the constant term is the

same across individuals. Given Z1, C is allowed to vary across age

groups in equation (1). It would, of course, be useful to test whether some

of the /3 coefficients vary across age groups. This is not in general

possible, however, since most macroeconomic variables are not disaggregated

by age groups, as would be necessary to test for age-sensitive /3's. For

example, suppose that one of the variables in Z is                    the income of

individual i, and let its coefficient be j9. Assume that l varies across

                 =             + ...   + /3ijNj, which introduces variables like
age groups:          /3llNlt
       into the equation. The sum of this variable across i is the income

of individuals in age group 1, for which data are not generally available.

One is thus restricted to assuming that age-group differences are reflected

in different constant terms in equation (1).

     To aggregate equation (1) across individuals, let N.t be the number of

people in age group j in period t; let C equal the sum of C, where i runs

from 1 through N; let Z be the 1 x k vector whose elements are the sums of

the corresponding elements in Zft. where i runs from 1 through N; and let

1J equal the sum of U1, where i runs from 1 through Nt. Given this

notation, summing equation (1) for a given t from 1 though Nt yields:


(2) Ct =      Z8     +        + aiN1 ... + ajNj +         ,   t=   1,... ,T

It will be useful to rewrite equation (2) in per capita terms. Let c              =
       let    z be the vector           with each element divided by N; let u =

       and let           =             which is the proportion of people in age group
                             N.t/Nt,
j in the population at time t. Dividing equation (2) by Nt yields


(3) c=z/3+y+czip1 ...                  +tp+u         ,   tl,...,T
                                        5




      A test of whether the age distribution matters is simply a test of

whether the a. coefficients in equation (3) are different from zero.2       If

the coefficients are zero, one is back to a standard macroeconomic equation.

Otherwise, given z, c varies as the age distribution varies. Since the
sum   of    across j is one and there is a constant in the equation, a

restriction on the       coefficients mist be imposed for estimation. The
                     a
obvious restriction is that       a. = 0, and this was imposed in the
                               j=l j
estimation work reported in this paper.



The Data

      The age distribution data are from the U.S. Bureau of the Census,

Current Population Reports, Series P-25. The data from the census surveys,

which are taken every ten years, are updated yearly using data provided by

the National Center for Health Statistics, the Department of Defense, and

the Immigration and Naturalization Service. The data are estimates of the

total population of the United States, including armed forces overseas, in

each of 86 age groups. Age group 1 consists of individuals less than 1 year

old, age group 2 consists of individuals between 1 and 2 years of age, and

so on through age group 86, which consists of individuals 85 years old and

over. The published data are annual (July 1 of each year), and we have

constructed quarterly data by linearly interpolating between the yearly



     2Stoker (1986) characterizes this test, that all proportion
coefficients are zero, as a test of microeconomic linearity or homogeneity
(that all marginal reactions of individual agents are identical). He shows
that individual differences or more general behavioral nonlinearities will
coincide with the presence of distributional effects in macroeconomic
equations.

points .

     We    have considered seven age groups in this study: 16-19, 20-24, 25-

29, 30-39, 40-54, 55-64, and 65+. The "total" population,          is taken to

be the population 16+. In terms of the above notation, we have created

seven        variables (j    l•• .,7), where the seven variables suni to one for

a given t.

     The consumption and money demand equations are taken from the Fair

(1984) model. For present purposes the equations are estimated for the

period 1954 I - 1987          The estimation technique is two stage least

squares, with account sometimes taken of serial correlation of the error

term. The first stage regressors for each equation are reported in Fair

(1984).



Results for Consuntion

        The results for three categories of consumption --   service,   nondurable,

and durable - -   are   presented in Table 1. The possible set of explanatory

variables for each consumption category consists of the real value of wealth

(A), the after-tax nominal wage rate (W), the price level (P), the after-tax

interest rate (R), after-tax nonlabor income (YN), a labor constraint

variable (Q), and the lagged dependent variable. The theory behind the

consumption equations is that households choose consumption and labor supply

to maximize a multiperiod utility function. The variables that affect this


     3The quarterly data for the 86 age groups from 1952 through 1986 are
available on diskette from the authors upon request.

     4The sample period for durable consumption ended in 1986 IV. The data
for 1987 I were preliminary, and the observation for durable consumption for
this quarter seemed extreme. Given the preliminary nature of the data, it
seemed best to ignore this observation in the estimation work.

decision are the initial value of A and the current and expected future

values of W, P, R, and YN. The current or lagged values of W, P, R, and YN

and the lagged dependent variable are meant in part to be proxying for the

unobserved expected future values.

     The labor constraint variable Q is designed to pick up possible

constraints on the household sector in how much it can work during a period

at the current set of wage rates. Let       denote the amount that the

household sector would choose to consume in period t if it could work as

much as it likes at the current set of wage rates.    Let C denote the

observed amount of consumption. If households as a group are not

constrained, then C =        otherwise one would expect C to be less than C.
                        C;
The labor constraint variable is a function of labor market tightness. It

is zero or close to zero when labor markets are tight, and its gets more and

more negative as labor markets get looser and looser. The postulated

equation for C is then


(4) Ct —    C   +        ,   r   > 0.


This specification thus introduces      into the equation along with the

variables that affect C.

     Q is constructed as follows. First, the ratio of the total number of

hours worked in the economy to the total population 16+ (JJ) is plotted for

the 1952 I - 1987 I period. Another variable (JJP) is constructed from peak

to peak interpolations of the JJ series. Q is then taken to be 1 -   JJP/JJ.
Q is thus a nonlinear function of the number of hours worked in the economy.

When there is a lot of slack in the economy and JJ is considerably smaller

than JJP, a one unit increase in JJ has more of an effect on Q than it does
                                      8

when .11 is close to JJP. In other words, Q is more affected by the number

of hours worked in slack times than in tight times.

     Note that labor income is not an explanatory variable in the

consumption equations. If households jointly determine consumption and

labor supply and are not constrained in their labor supply choice, labor

income is simply a byproduct of this decision, given the wage rate. It is

not appropriate in this case to include labor income, which is the labor

supply times the wage rate, as an explanatory variable in the consumption

equations. If, on the other hand, households are constrained in their labor

supply, then labor supply is no longer a decision variable, and it is

appropriate to consider labor income as a determinant of consumption. In

the present specification, Q and W are jointly highly correlated with labor

income in slack times, but less so in tight times. The specification is

thus like the Keynesian story in low employment periods, but it differs from

this story more and more as the economy comes closer and closer to full

employment.

     As a final point about the equations, not all the potential explanatory

variables had coefficient estimates that were significant and/or of the

right sign in all the equations. If after some experimentation with lagged

values a variable always had a coefficient estimate of the wrong sign, it

was dropped from the equation. The equations reported in Table 1 are the

"final" estimated equations.

     Consider first the results for the consumption of services in Table 1.

Column (1) presents the results without the age variables, and column (2)
                                      9

presents the results with the age variables.5 (The age variables were

always taken to be exogenous in the estimation work.) The age variables as

a group are significant at the 5 percent level according to the chi-square

test.6 The key question regarding the signs of the age variables is whether

the coefficient estimates are negative for people 30-39 and 40-54, i.e.,

whether, other things being equal, people in their prime working years

consume less than do those younger and older. This is the case in Table 1.

Also, there is a large positive coefficient for people 55-64, which is as

expected.

     The results for the consumption of nondurables in columns (3) and (4)

also show that the age variables are significant at the 5 percent level and

that the estimates are negative for people 30-39 and 40-54 and positive for

people 55-64. The results are even stronger for the consumption of durables

in columns (5) and (6), where the age variables are significant at the 1


     5The population variable POP in Table 1 that is used to put the
equations in per capita terms differs slightly from the population variable
N that is used to construct the p. variables. POP is constructed from
monthly data from the Bureau of Lbor Statistics, and N is constructed from
yearly data from the Current Population Reports. N is used in the
construction of the    variables so that they will sum to one across j.
                    p
     6The1chi-square test is a follows. The 2SLS objective function is
u'Z(Z'Z) Z'u = S, where u is a Txl vector of error terms and Z is a TxK
vector of first stage regressors. u is a function of the coefficients and
the endogenous and predetermined variables in the equation. When the
equation is estimated under the assumption of first order serial correlation
of the error terms, u is a nonlinear function of the coefficients if the
serial correlation coefficient is counted as a structural coefficient, which
is the treatment here. Now, assume that there are r restrictions on the *
coefficients. (In the present case there are 6 zero restrictions. Let S
be the value of S when the restrictions are not impoed, and let S be the
value of S when the restrictions are imposed. Let & be the estimate of the

variance of the error term in the unrestricted case. Then (S
                                                            **     * 2.
                                                               - S )/& is

asymptotically distributed as chi-square with r degrees of freedom. A
general proof of this is in Andrews and Fair (1987).

percent level. The sign pattern of the age variables is the same for all

three categories of consumption except for the 16-19 and 25-29 groups.

      The overall results for consumption are thus quite strong. Even though

seven age categories are used (six unrestricted coefficient estimates) ,   the
expected signs for the main age categories are obtained. The age variables

as a group are always significant at the 5 percent level, and even some of

the individual estimates are significant.

      As a final test of the effects of the age variables on consumption, the

demand for imports equation in the Fair model was estimated with the age

variables added. Since imports include more than consumption items, the

import results are probably less reliable than the other consumption

results. The results are presented in Table 2. The age variables are

significant at the 1 percent level, and the signs for the 30-39 and 40-54

groups are negative as expected. The addition of the age variables did,

however, make the domestic price variable highly insignificant (and of the

wrong sign), which indicates some collinearity problems.



Results for Money Demand

       A typical demand for money model begins by postulating that the long-
                                             *
run   desired level of real money balances (Mt/Pt) is a function of real

income        and a short-term interest rate (Re):

       *
(5)   Mt/Pt
                a +         + yRt

An adjustment equation is then postulated, where the adjustment may either

be in real terms (M/P adjusting to M/P) or in nominal terms (Mt

adjustment to M). The results in Fair (1987) strongly support the nominal

     The results of estimating the demand for money equations are presented

in Table 3. The first set of results concerns the demand for money (demand

deposits and currency) of the household sector. The equation estimated in

column (1) is the same as equation (7) except that it is in per capita

terms.7 The equation estimated in column (2) has the age variables added.

The age variables are significant at the 1 percent level, and some of the

individual coefficient estimates are quite significant. The coefficient

estimates are positive for the 30-39 and 40-54 groups and negative for the

55-64 and 65+, which is as expected. The estimates indicate that people in

their prime working years demand more money relative to their transactions

than otherwise because the opportunity cost of their time is higher. The

other noticeable result is that the addition of the age variables has

considerably lessened the size of the coefficient of the lagged dependent

variable (the estimate of 1-A).

     The second set of results in Table 3 concerns the demand for currency.

Sectors other than the household sector demand currency, and so the results


     7when there are lagged values in per capita equations, the issue always
arises as to whether the lagged values should be divided by the current
population value or the relevant lagged population value. In practice this
turns out to make little difference. In the present case the relevant
lagged population values have been used. Note also that the error term in
the per capita version of equation (7) is       POP ). For purposes of the
estimation work this error term has been assumes to%e homoscedastic.

III. Housinz Investment

       The following model in Fair (1984) lies behind the housing investment

equation. Let KH' denote the desired stock of housing. If housing

consumption is proportional to the housing stock, then the factors discussed

in Section II that affect consumption, including the age variables, also
               **
affect    KH

          **
(8)    KH


where the arguments in f are A, W, P, R, YN, and the age variables. Two

types of lagged adjustment are then postulated. The first is an adjustment

of the housing stock to its desired value:


(9) KH* -
                 1<1l
                                (** -

The physical depreciation of the housing stock is assumed to be proportional

to the size of the stock, with depreciation rate S. Gross investment in
                                                      *
housing (IH) is thus equal to KR -            Given KR from (9), desired
                                          (1-6)1<111.
gross investment is thus

            * =         *
(10)     111        1<1-1   -
                                (l6)KRl
The second type of adjustment is an adjustment of gross investment to its
                                                     13

desired value:


(11)    III -         =   .y(IH*   -
                1H1                    1111).

Combining (8)-(l1) yields


(12) IH =
                (l--y)1H1 +   -y(S-A)KH    1
                                                +   -yAf(...)

This treatment thus adds the lagged dependent variable and the lagged stock

of housing to the housing investment equation, both of which seem to be

important explanatory variables in practice.

       According to (12), the age variables affect housing investment to the

extent that they are arguments in f, i.e., to the extent that they affect

housing consumption. One problem with this is that the age variables may

affect the adjustment parameters A and -y.                  In particular, adjustment may be

faster for the young than for the old.8 Unfortunately, as discussed above,

sufficient data are not available to allow parameters other than the

constant term to be a function of the age variables, and so it must be

assumed that A and -y do not vary by age. The housing results are thus

likely to be less reliable than the consumption results in Table 1.

       The results of estimating equation (12) are presented in Table 4.

Adding the age variables to the equation makes a considerable difference.

The original equation was estimated under the assumption of third order

serial correlation of the error term, and adding the age variables made all


     8Hanushek and Quigley (1979) hypothesize that households' consumption
of housing in any given period will deviate significantly from their desired
level due to the substantial transactions and search costs associated with
the housing market. They find (based upon reinterview data gathered on low-
income renter households) that young households initially consuming •too
little" housing close the gap between actual and desired consumption more
rapidly than do older households who are consuming "too much" housing.

three estimates of the serial correlation coefficients small and

insignificant. The age variables as a group are highly significant, and a

number of the individual estimates are significant. The coefficient

estimate of the lagged dependent variable went up considerably, as did the

absolute value of the coefficient estimate of the housing stock variable.

The signs for the age groups 30-34 and 40-54 are negative as expected:

prime-age households consume less housing, other things being equal,

relative to the old and the young. The signs for the age groups 25-29 and

55-64 are also negative, however, which is contrary to the consumption

results in Table 1. The signs for age groups 20-24 and 65+ are positive, as

expected, and the size of the coefficient on the latter age group is quite
         9
large.

     The results for the housing investment equation thus seeni quite good.

The fit of the equation is considerably improved by the addition of the age

variables, and serial correlation of the error terms is eliminated.

However, the negative coefficient estimates for age groups 25-29 and 54-65

are not necessarily as expected, which may mean that some of the estimates

are spurious or that something else is going on aside from life cycle

considerations.



IV. Labor Force Participation Equations

     In most macroeconometric models, including the Fair model, labor force



     9Russell (1982) points out that older people have been major
contributors to housing trends because of the rising rate of household (as
opposed to individual) incidence in that age group. The decision not to
disband existing households when a spouse retires or dies means that older
people continue to occupy the existing housing stock, which requires
younger households to buy new rather than existing houses.
                                              15

participation equations are disaggregated by age and sex. A typical

equation is of the form


(13) Lt =       Z   + Ut   ,
                               t   1, ..   . ,T    ,   s = m, f.


where L is the ratio of the number of individuals of sex s in age group j

in the labor force to the total population of people of sex s in age group

j. The variables in Z include variables like the real wage and variables

that are designed to pick up possible "discouraged worker effects."

       Although the left-hand-side variables in equations like (13) are

disaggregated by age and sex, the right-hand-side variables are typically

not age-sex specific. The aggregate real wage is used in place of the more

appropriate but unobserved real wage of the particular age-sex group. The

implicit assumption in this treatment is that the real wage relevant to age

group j (say W) is proportional to the aggregate wage (We):                     =

The Easterlin hypothesis suggests that                  varies across time and is a

negative function of the percent of people in age group j in the total

population. For baby boomers, Berger (1985) finds that                   is low relative

to the      for other age cohorts because there are so many baby boomers

competing with each other.

       A way to test the Easterlin hypothesis is to postulate that the ratio

of W. to W is a function of p.
    Jt    t


(14)            =      +

where      is negative. Assume that in equation (13)                  is the appropriate

explanatory wage variable, so that                     is one of the terms in the

equation. Substituting (14) into (13) then results in the terms                       and
                                        16

          in the equation. Since       is negative, one expects the

coefficients of W and         to be of opposite signs. If the substitution

effect dominates,      is positive, and so one expects the coefficient of

to be positive and the coefficient of        to be negative. The opposite is

true if the income effect dominates.

     The Easterlin hypothesis actually consists of two parts. The first is

that there is not perfect substitution across age groups in the labor market

and so the more people there are in the age group the smaller is the average

wage for that group. In the present case this is represented by equation

(14). The second part, termed the relative income hypothesis, says that

young peoples' consumption aspirations are shaped by their parents' living

standards. In the face of unfavorable labor market conditions a large

cohort will adjust demographic and economic behavior in order to maintain

its consumption aspirations. The baby boom generation, Easterlin argues,

delayed marriage and children and increased labor participation of young

women1° in response to lower average wages.11 In other words, Easterlin is

postulating that the income effect dominates for women. Therefore, the


     10Easterlin notes that since most young men (in the family forming
ages) are already committed to the labor force, increased labor force
participation will come primarily from young women, but possibly also via
moonlighting by the men.

     An alternative sociological explanation for the increased labor
participation (and drop in fertility) of women, as discussed for example in
Perry (1977), is based not on the economic incentives brought about by the
decline in the relative earnings of the baby boom generation, but on the
changing attitudes about the role of women in society brought about by the
"women' s movement."
    Johnson and Skinner (1986) find support for the hypothesis that future
divorce probabilities increase current labor supply for married women. They
conclude that the rise in the frequency of divorce since 1960 may account
for one-third of the unexplained increase in women's post war labor force
participation.
                                      17

coefficient of        in the equation explaining the participation of women

in age group j should be positive: women baby boomers should work more.

     For sake of the present discussion, "prime age" will be defined to be

ages 25-54. The results of estimating labor force participation equations

for prime age men and prime age women are presented in Table 5. The first

set of results is for prime age men. Column (1) contains the results for

the equation without the addition of the       term. Labor force

participation is a function of the after-tax nominal wage (W), the price

level (P), the labor constraint variable (Q), and the lagged dependent

variable. The labor constraint variable is meant to pick up discouraged

worker effects (discouraged in the disequilibrium sense of not being able to

find a job at the current set of wage rates, not discouraged in the sense

that the current set of wage rates is low). The lagged dependent variable

is meant to pick up expectational and partial adjustment effects. The

coefficient estimate for W is negative and the coefficient estimate for P is

positive, which means that the real wage has a negative effect on

participation. The estimates thus indicate that the income effect

dominates. When the variable pW is added in column (2), its coefficient

estimate is positive and significant, which is as expected when the income

effect dominates. In column (3) the time trend is added to see if the wage

and price variables may be erroneously picking up general trend effects.

The results are little affected by the addition of the time trend.

     The second set of results in Table 5 is for prime age women. The

results without the       variable are in column (4). The nominal wage rate

has a positive coefficient estimate and the price level has a negative

coefficient estimate, which means that the real wage has a positive effect

on participation. Contrary to the case for men, the estimates indicate that

the substitution effect dominates for women. When the variable          is

added in column (5), its coefficient estimate is negative and significant,

which is as expected when the substitution effect dominates. In column (6)

the time trend is added, but as was the case for men, the results are little

affected by the addition of the time trend.

     To summarize, the results in Table 5 show that the age variable when

multiplied by the aggregate wage is significant. The coefficient estimates

of W and        are also of opposite signs, as expected from equation (13),

The results thus provide support for the part of the Easterlin hypothesis

embodied in equation (13). They do not, however, support Easterlin's

hypothesis that the income effect dominates for women. The income effect

dominates for men, but the substitution effect dominates for women.12

     It is fairly clear from examining the data why the income effect

dominates for men. The after-tax real wage generally grew from the

beginning of the data set (1952) to about 1974, after which it flattened

out. The participation rate of prime age men fell slightly from 1952 to

1967, fell at a faster rate from 1967 to about 1976, and then flattened out

after that. The estimates thus attribute the fall in the participation rate

to the rise in the real wage and the flattening out of the participation


     12Wachter (1977) regresses labor force participation by fourteen
different age-sex groups on the proportion of the population aged 16-34 in
the population 16+, the unemployment rate, a time trend, and lagged labor
force participation. He finds that the young-worker variable (16-34) has
significantly negative coefficient estimates for men 25-64 and women 45-65+
over the period 1949-76. However, because the regressions do not include
the wage rate, it is not possible to interpret the results in terms of
income and substitution effects. Further, it is somewhat unclear as to the
expected effects of one age group's relative size on other age groups' labor
force participation, which makes the regressions difficult to interpret.

rate to the flattening out of the real wage. This thus seems to be the

income effect at work. The participation rate of prime age women, on the

other hand, has risen fairly steadily over the entire 1952-1987 period, and

the estimates are attributing at least some of this rise to the rise in the

real wage before 1974. This thus seems to be the substitution effect at

work.



V. Conclusion

        The results in this paper are to some extent rather striking. The

changing age distribution of the U.S. population seems to have a highly

significant effect on consumption (including imports), money demand

(including currency demand), housing investment, and labor force

participation.     There seems to be enough variance in the age distribution

data to allow reasonably precise estimates of the effects of a number of age

categories on the macro variables. The results show that, other things

being equal, age groups 30-39 and 40-54 consume less (including less

housing) than average and demand more money (including currency) than

average. Age group 55-64 consumes more (although not more housing) demands

less money. The results also show that the labor force participation rate

of both men and women 25-54 is affected by the percent of people of this age

in the population 16+. For men the income effect dominates and the effect

is positive, and for women the substitution effect dominates and the effect

is negative.

        Since the use of the age distribution data in the manner done in this

study has not been tried before, the results must be interpreted with some

caution. Adding six new explanatory variables to any macroeconometric
                                     20

equation is risky, since collinearity problems may lead to very imprecise

and possibly ridiculous results. The results may also be sensitive to the

specification of the equations in the Fair model, and results using other

macroeconomic equations would be of interest in future work.

     If it turns out that the estimates obtained here are roughly right,

they have important consequences for the future course of the economy. They

say that consumption and housing investment will be negatively affected in

the future, other things being equal, as more and more baby boomers enter

the 30-54 age group. According to the estimates, people in this age group

consume less than average and invest in less housing than average. This

movement, on the other hand, will have a positive effect on the demand for

money, other things being equal, since people in this age group demand more

money than average.

     Finally, note that if the estimated age effects in this paper are not

spurious, they could lead to a considerable increase in forecasting

accuracy. Beginning, say, at age 16, the age proportion variables can be

very accurately forecast for many years ahead. The age proportion variables

are thus easily forecasted exogenous variables that seem to have

considerable explanatory power, a forecaster's dream.
