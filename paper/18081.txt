        How can we allow patent examiners to effectively distinguish between patentable and
unpatentable inventions, without slowing the process to a crawl or wasting a bunch of money?
This essay reviews the recent literature and considers a number of proposals and their
limitations. It concludes that the system can be improved, but that we are unlikely to solve the
problem of bad patents altogether. The focus in reform discussions should be on understanding
and changing applicant and examiner incentives rather than simply spending money.

     I.    The Problem of Bad Patents

    The Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) finds itself caught in a vise. On the one hand, it has
been issuing a large number of dubious patents over the past twenty years, particularly in the
software and electronic commerce space. It issues many more patents than its counterparts in
Europe and Japan;1 roughly three‐fourths of applicants ultimately get one or more patents, a
higher percentage than in other countries.2 Complaints about those bad patents are legion,3
and indeed when they make it to litigation they are quite often held invalid.4 Even the ones that
turn out to be valid are often impossible to understand; in the information technology
industries, there is no lawsuit filed in which the parties don’t fight over the meaning of patent
claim terms.5

   The natural reaction is to say that the PTO needs to do more than it does to make sure it is
awarding patents only to those who deserve them. In fact, however, only some – not all – of
these bad patents have significant social costs. Most patents don’t matter. They claim
technologies that ultimately failed in the marketplace. They protect a firm from competitors
who for other reasons failed to materialize. They were acquired merely to signal investors that

the relevant firm has intellectual assets. Or they were lottery tickets filed on the speculation
that a given industry or invention would take off. Those patents will never be licensed, never be
asserted in negotiation or litigation, and thus spending additional resources to examine them
would yield few benefits.

    Some bad patents, however, are more pernicious. They award legal rights that are far
broader than what their relevant inventors actually invented, and they do so with respect to
technologies that turn out to be economically significant. Many Internet patents fall into this
category. Rarely a month goes by that some unknown patent holder does not surface and claim
to be the true inventor of eBay or the first to come up with now‐familiar concepts like
hyperlinking and e‐commerce. While some such Internet patents may be valid—someone did
invent those things, after all—more often the people asserting the patents actually invented
something much more modest. But they persuaded the Patent Office to give them rights that
are broader than what they actually invented, imposing an implicit tax on consumers and
thwarting truly innovative companies who do or would pioneer those fields.6

   Compounding the problem, bad patents are too hard to overturn. Courts require a
defendant to provide “clear and convincing evidence” to invalidate an issued patent.7 In
essence, courts presume that the Patent Office has already done a good job of screening out
bad patents. Given what we know about patents in force today, that is almost certainly a bad
assumption.

        The problem, then, is not that the Patent Office issues a large number of bad patents.
Rather, it is that the Patent Office issues a small but worrisome number of economically
significant bad patents and those patents enjoy a strong, but undeserved, presumption of
validity.8

    The conclusion one might draw from this is that Patent Office should focus its examination
resources on important patents and pay little attention to the rest. In fact, however, the problem of
fixing the PTO is more complex, as we will see in the next Part.

   How, then, can we fix the PTO, allowing examiners to effectively distinguish between
patentable and unpatentable inventions, without slowing the process to a crawl or wasting a
bunch of money?

        A.      What Won’t Work

       First, some things that likely won’t work. These unsuccessful solutions fall into two
general categories: (1) those that throw money at the problem, and (2) those that try to change
examiner behavior without changing the structure of the examination process or the incentives
examiners face.

Preventing fee diversion. The PTO is funded through user fees imposed on applicants and
owners of issued patents. For much of the last twenty years, some of that fee revenue (typically
1020 percent of it) has been diverted by Congress to general federal revenue. It is a
commonplace among patent lawyers that the way to solve the PTO’s problems is to stop fee
diversion, “fully funding” the PTO.

        The America Invents Act walks a middle ground, preventing diversion of PTO fees to the
general federal revenue, but requiring Congress to approve a budget for the PTO every year;
revenue taken in but not appropriated is put in a “lockbox” and can only be held for later PTO
spending.9 That won’t satisfy those who wanted to end fee diversion as a means of increasing
PTO funding, and it won’t enable the PTO to predict years in advance what its budget is likely to
be, but it will at least make fee diversion more difficult.

        Stopping fee diversion will avoid taxing innovators in particular to raise general revenue,
as we have done in the past. But stopping fee diversion is hardly a panacea. In the last several
years, the PTO has been fully funded—that is, Congress didn’t divert fees. Nonetheless, the
application backlog grew. The addition of 10 to 20 percent of operating revenue wasn’t enough
even to enable the PTO to hold steady. It is naïve to assume that a modest increase in revenue
can fix the problems that beset the PTO, particularly if that additional funding is not
accompanied by any change in examiner incentives.

Fee‐setting authority. In recent years the PTO’s efforts have shifted to seeking permission from
Congress to set their own fees.10 Until 2011 fees for patent applications were set by statute.11
The America Invents Act for the first time gives the PTO the power to set fees. Those fees must

    The issue is bound up with the larger question of the role of the PTO as a full‐fledged administrative
agency with rulemaking authority. For discussion of that issue, see, e.g., Benjamin, Stuart Minor, and
Arti K. Rai. 2008. “Fixing Innovation Policy: A Structural Perspective.” George Washington Law Review
77:1; Thomas, John R. 2002. “The Responsibility of the Rulemaker: Comparative Approaches to Patent

be set at a level that recoups costs,12 though that appears to be a general rather than a specific
requirement; the PTO can, for instance, charge substantial maintenance fees for existing
patents even though maintaining a patent once granted costs the PTO nothing. The new fee‐
setting authority will allow the PTO to (presumably) raise fees on applicants and patentees,
using the money to pay for a more intensive examination.

       Giving the PTO the authority to set its own fees might or might not be a good idea,
depending on the relative incentives the PTO and Congress have to set fees rationally. The PTO
is probably the better decision‐maker; certainly PTO‐set fees offer more flexibility than would a
requirement to pass a new law every time fees need to change. But fee‐setting authority
shouldn’t be viewed as a way to solve the problem of bad patents merely by enabling
examiners to do more work. As noted above, it is not clear we should spend more money to
weed out bad patents. Most of that money will be wasted on applications that are of no
consequence to anyone. And because of the structure of the examination system, it might not
even succeed in weeding out bad patent applications.

        Even if it did, however, the current fee structure makes patent quality self‐limiting. The
PTO is paid by applicants to process their applications at each stage. But those payments are
not enough even to sustain the limited examination that now occurs. The difference is made up
by patent “maintenance fees”—periodic payments made by the owners of issued patents to
keep those patents in force. Because the PTO’s ability to examine new applications is
dependent on revenue from previously granted ones, the PTO faces a problem: the more bad
applications it rejects, the fewer patents will pay maintenance fees, and the less money it will
have to conduct a detailed examination. The PTO ran into this problem in the late 2000s,
when—as a result of a lowered grant rate coupled with companies abandoning patents during
the recession—it found itself in a financial crisis. The broader lesson should be clear (and
troubling): the current system for funding the PTO works only if the PTO continues to issue
patents on a large percentage of the applications it receives.13

        The PTO might begin to address this problem by changing the way it collects fees. At
one extreme, it could abandon maintenance fees altogether, and pay for enhanced
examination through higher application fees.14 That solves the self‐limiting problem, but it
raises the cost to startups seeking patents at an early stage of development, which doesn’t
seem ideal. Alternatively, the PTO could simply raise the maintenance fees significantly, to
perhaps ten times their current rate.15 Doing so might make the weeding out of bad patents

revenue neutral, though as more bad applications are rejected the tax on those who actually
obtained patents would have to increase further to compensate. And as the PTO raises its
maintenance fees, fewer people will choose to maintain their patents. Depending on the
elasticity of demand, paying for examination out of higher maintenance fees may or may not
work.

        Some have suggested raising maintenance fees for a different reason—to prevent
patent lawsuits by trolls who buy up patents in order to enforce them. But that is unlikely to
work. According to a 2009 American Intellectual Property Law Association (AIPLA) report, the
median cost of taking a major patent case to trial is $5 million per side in attorney’s fees.16 A
maintenance fee of $40,000$50,000—ten times the current fee—may weed out more patents
that aren’t being used, but it is unlikely to deter someone considering spending perhaps 100
times that much to litigate a patent.17 And the patents that aren’t being used aren’t really the
problem. Raising maintenance fees – or making them progressively higher toward the end of a
patent life – would, however, weed out patents that sit on a shelf now but might be sold in the
future to a troll that will assert them against product companies. In that sense it might reduce
the number of troll lawsuits. And that might be enough; Brian Love has shown that most troll
suits are filed in the last three years of a patent’s life.18

        Fee‐setting authority may enable the PTO to manage other aspects of patent practice
more effectively as well. For instance, fees proposed in February 2012 set very high fees for
filing RCEs. That may do what the office has so far been unable to do: reduce the incidence of
continuation practice. (More on this below).

        Fee changes, then, offer some promise to improve certain aspects of patent practice.
But the effects of using the tool are surprisingly complex, and it is not obvious the PTO can (or
will have the incentive to) use that authority to fundamentally restructure the examination
system.

    Rejecting bad patents. Maybe the solution to the problem of bad patents is simply for the
PTO to reject more dubious applications. If the same examiners simply applied a higher
standard, on this view, fewer bad patents would slip through the PTO.

    Leaving aside the question of whether the PTO has the power to change the substantive
standards for patent examination (more on that later),19 it is not clear that we can or should

     Theoretically the PTO merely applies the law set by Congress and the courts; it does not receive
deference to its interpretations of that law. For an argument that the PTO nonetheless has a significant
effect on substantive patent standards, generally in the direction of expanding patent rights, see Melissa

weed out all bad applications at the PTO. The vast majority of patents are never litigated or
licensed; spending a lot of money to ensure their validity would be wasted.20 And mistaken
rejections impose costs as well; the goal should be to increase accuracy, not simply to trade off
type I with type II errors.

    The structure of the patent prosecution process makes it very difficult for the PTO to do so.
As Sean Seymore has pointed out, the current law presumes that applications are patentable,
not unpatentable.21 Patent examiners can never finally reject a patent application; applicants
dissatisfied with the outcome can come back an unlimited number of times to try again through
various mechanisms.22 Efforts beginning in 2006 to change that rule upset patent lawyers a
great deal, and were ultimately abandoned.23 And because of the inability of the PTO to finally
reject applications, when the PTO started making it harder to get patents several years ago, the
result was to create an enormous backlog of patent applications as examiners would reject
applications and applicants would try again (and again, and again) to get a patent. That backlog
in turn created its own set of problems, delaying the issuance of good patents and reducing
certainty for both applicants and third parties.

    Some have suggested that those delays—and the use of continuation applications more
generally—are the result of oddities in the system for evaluating and rewarding patent
examiners. The so‐called “count” system gave credit to examiners for certain acts; patent
lawyers often complain that examiners “make” them file continuations in order to boost their
counts. Whether or not that was true, however, it doesn’t appear to be behind the growth of
continuation applications. The PTO changed the count system in 2009 to try to address this
problem. And it has been issuing record numbers of patents in recent years. But preliminary
data from Dennis Crouch suggests that the number of continuation applications is still on the
rise, up 27 percent from 2009 to 2010,24 and the number of related Requests for Continued
Examination reached record levels in 2011 – 53% of all applications – despite these efforts.25
The data suggests that the use of continuations is largely applicant‐ rather than examiner
driven.

    The ability of applicants to file an unlimited number of continuation applications – and their
willingness to do so – makes it difficult for examiners to simply reject bad applications.
Applicants view a rejection as simply a negotiating position that invites a counteroffer, not as a
judgment that their application is in fact unpatentable. And because they can continue making
counteroffers, increasing the number of rejections simply prolongs the application process.

   In short, as long as the structure of the patent prosecution process remains unchanged, we
cannot expect to solve the problem simply by having examiners reject more patents.

Retaining patent examiners. Another problem commonly cited by patent lawyers is the high
rate of turnover at the PTO. Being an examiner is not an easy job, and it doesn’t pay all that
well. Not surprisingly, examiners often leave relatively quickly for jobs in engineering, jobs in
law firms, or to go to law school. Indeed, one recent study found the median examiner had
been at the PTO for just over three years.26 The high rate of turnover means that the PTO needs
to hire more than 1,000 examiners a year just to keep even with attrition. In recent years the
PTO has found it virtually impossible to grow the examining corps. And of course those new
examiners must be trained. Perhaps the solution to the PTO’s problems, then, is to find ways to
keep those examiners from leaving.

        There may well be benefits to reducing examiner attrition. But the evidence suggests
that weeding out bad patents is not among them. One recent study shows that junior patent
examiners are a lot more zealous in weeding out bad patents than senior examiners. The longer
examiners spend in the PTO, the less searching they do, the fewer references they cite, the
more likely they are to grant patents, and the more likely they are to grant patents on
applications that their counterparts in other countries have rejected.27 The effects are quite
large and statistically significant; the key data is reported in the Appendix (Table 1). The reason
is not precisely clear, but may have to do with increased workloads on senior examiners, or
with acculturation into a corps whose ethos is to grant rather than deny patents. Either way, it
is the most junior examiners who are most likely to reject applications. Therefore, keeping
examiners around longer may hurt rather than help the cause of weeding out bad patents.

Outsourcing search. Reacting both to workload and to a sense that examiners don’t find the
most important prior art, a number of initiatives both within and outside the PTO have tried to
relieve examiners of the burden of searching for prior art. They have variously proposed to
require the applicants to do their own search for prior art,28 to invite the public to review
applications and submit prior art,29 or to share the burden of searching with patent examiners

in other countries.30 Work‐sharing programs among patent offices are quite common, and the
PTO is aggressively expanding them.31 These initiatives seem promising because they outsource
a function examiners don’t seem particularly good at—finding the most relevant information on
the ground—to others who are positioned to do it better.

        But recent empirical evidence suggests that outsourcing might not work. Cotropia et al.
studied the behavior of patent examiners in responding to applications, and found that they
rely almost exclusively on art they find for themselves, not art submitted by applicants. And
that doesn’t appear to reflect either applicants drafting around the art they found or the
weakness of that art; U.S. examiners did not rely even on art that was submitted because it was
found important by a foreign patent examiner during examination of a counterpart
application.32 The effects are extremely large and statistically significant; key data is reported in
the Appendix (Table 2). The effect cannot be explained by applicant behavior, and seems to be
a result of examiner decisions to focus attention on art they found for themselves rather than
applicant‐submitted art. If examiners are psychologically primed to rely principally on things
they find for themselves, it won’t help to have others provide them with the best art. And it
might even hurt, causing examiners not to focus on the best prior art. More generally, the
implication of this evidence is that we need to pay attention not only to legal rules, but also to
examiner behavior and reward systems.

        B.      What Might Work

        The problems with the PTO are deep rooted. Increased funding won’t solve the problem
of bad patents, and a variety of other commonly suggested fixes for the PTO are unlikely to
solve the problem, and indeed could even make it worse.

      Other proposals have a greater chance of addressing the problem of bad patents,
though they come with their own uncertainties.

Second pair of eyes. Shortly after the Federal Circuit held business methods patentable in 1998,
the PTO was inundated with business method patent applications. Most of those applications
went to Class 705, which refers to the collection of patent examiners who focus on business
methods. Indeed, by 2001, Class 705 had the largest application volume. In response to this
flood, the PTO initiated a specific “quality control” measure in this class in March 2000: the
“second pair of eyes” review (SPER), under which applications are subjected to mandatory
assessment by more than one examiner before being allowed.33 Requiring two examiners to

agree seems to have had a dramatic effect: a 2009 study found that class 705 has the lowest
grant rate among high volume classes.34 One possible explanation for the low grant rate in this
class is that the second pair of eyes was working, and that the grant rate reflects better rigor
during examinations, rather than application volume. [That’s not the only possible explanation;
there might have been more low‐quality applications in class 705 than in other classes].

    The fact that SPER leads to more rejections in Class 705 doesn’t mean it is an unalloyed
success, however. Allison and Hunter demonstrate that its adoption in Class 705 led applicants
to try to characterize their business method patents in ways that got them out of Class 705. It is
possible that the applications that were not so characterized were systematically weaker (or
their lawyers systematically less skilled) than the ones that avoided Class 705. The differences
Lemley and Sampat found were so striking, however—a 16.1 percent grant rate in Class 705,
compared with 72 percent on average—that it seems unlikely this can explain the full
difference.

   Allison and Hunter’s objection is significant. But it applies only to a class‐specific use of SPER,
and wouldn’t condemn a broader application of the policy to all art units. Nonetheless, there
are reasons to think carefully before expanding SPER to all patent applications. Doing so would
roughly double the cost of patent prosecution across the board. It would also delay the
prosecution process further; Class 705 applications are among the slowest to be processed.
Further, at least as currently configured, SPER is asymmetric—it requires a second hurdle
before allowing patents but not before rejecting applications.35 As a result, it is likely to weed
out bad patents, but also to catch some good ones within the net of rejected applications, given
the inherent tradeoff between type 1 and type 2 errors under uncertainty. Given the PTO’s
historic bias towards granting dubious patents, perhaps that is a risk worth taking, but it is still a
social cost we should avoid if we can. And if SPER or some other review process is to be
adopted, it would seem logical to apply it evenhandedly to grants and rejections.

    The most logical use of SPER or an equivalent mechanism would be in conjunction with one
of the mechanisms I discuss below that help to identify important patent applications. It may
not be desirable to raise the cost to applicants across the board, for reasons I have discussed.
But if we have reason to believe that a particular application is particularly important, it may
justify more serious scrutiny.

   Interestingly, the PTO recently shut down the SPER program in business methods. Too much
success, it seems, carries its own risks.

   There is a similar problem with the PTO’s quality review mechanism, which reviews a random subset
of grants. Examiners could be punished for mistaken grants if caught in the quality control process, but
were not punished for mistaken rejections, which were never reviewed (Katznelson 2010). Effective
October 1, 2010, the PTO changed its quality evaluation system to be more evenhanded, a clear
improvement.

Changing examiner incentives. Recent empirical evidence suggests that much of the problem
with patent examination revolves around examiner incentives and human resource policies.36
Examiners do less well at policing bad patents the longer they stay at the PTO. The problem
could be their distance from the technology, or a tenure effect, or their increased workload. In
any case, changes in training, workload, or promotion rules could affect those incentives.
Similarly, examiners pay attention to their own searches, and not prior art submitted by others.
The problem could be overconfidence bias, or simply triage. Either way, human resource
policies could be brought to bear, training examiners to search better, or giving them more
time, or finding other ways to eliminate bias. And it seems obvious—though likely politically
infeasible —that the rules should not treat allowances differently than rejections.37

         These ideas are worth exploring further. Patent reform efforts to date have not focused
sufficient attention on examiner behavior and incentives. But implementation may be politically
difficult, both because the powerful examiners’ union resists changes to the way examiners are
evaluated and because patent prosecutors are likely to resist changes that make it harder for
them to obtain patents. And some of the possible explanations point in different directions:
should we give examiners more time to search, or less, for example? The answer may depend
on whether we think the examiner bias towards their own search results can be reversed or
should instead be accommodated.

Tiered review. The problem with the PTO is not precisely that it issues a large number of bad
patents. Rather, it is that the PTO issues a small but worrisome number of economically
significant bad patents and those patents enjoy a strong, but undeserved, presumption of
validity. This suggests that the Patent Office should focus its examination resources on
important patents and pay little attention to the rest. But it is difficult for the government to
know ahead of time which patents are likely to be important.

        There are two groups, however, that have better information about the likely
technological and commercial value of inventions: patent applicants and competitors. To
harness information in the hands of patent applicants, we could give applicants the option of
earning a presumption of validity by paying for a thorough examination of their inventions. Put
differently, applicants should be allowed to “gold plate” their patents by paying for the kind of
searching review that would merit a strong presumption of validity.38 An applicant who chooses
not to pay could still get a patent. That patent, however, would be subject to serious—maybe
even de novo—review in the event of litigation. Most likely, applicants would pay for serious
review with respect to their most important patents but conserve resources on their more

speculative entries.39 That would allow the Patent Office to focus its resources on those self‐
selected patents, thus benefiting from the signal given by the applicant’s own self‐interested
choice. The Obama campaign proposed this sort of tiered review, and the PTO has recently
implemented a scaled‐down version, in which applicants can choose the speed but not the
intensity of review.40 Adoption has been significant but modest; neither those who feared that
everyone would use the system nor those who feared no one would seem to be correct.
Rather, it appears to be performing its intended function of distinguishing some urgent
applications from the rest of the pack.

        Tiered review is only as good as the examination process that creates it, however, and if
“gold‐plated” patents are too easy to obtain, the point of the system will be lost. If they are too
hard to obtain or too expensive, by contrast, no one will use the system. In either event the
signaling benefits will be lost. Further, tiered review can at best be only a partial solution,
because applicants do not always have accurate information about the future value of their
applications. These are real objections, but they do not undermine the value of some sort of
targeting in the use of PTO examination resources.

Oppositions and adversarial evaluations. Competitors also have useful information about which
patents worry them and which do not. A post‐grant opposition system seeks to harness that
information. Post‐grant opposition is a process by which parties other than the applicant have
the opportunity to request and fund a thorough examination of a recently issued patent. A
patent that survives collateral attack should earn a presumption of validity similar to the one
available through tiered review. The core difference is that the post‐grant opposition is
triggered by competitors—presumably competitors looking to invalidate a patent that
threatens their industry.

        Like tiered review, post‐grant opposition is attractive because it harnesses private
information; this time, information in the hands of competitors. It thus helps the PTO to
identify patents that warrant serious review, and it also makes that review less expensive by
creating a mechanism by which competitors can share critical information directly with the
PTO.41 A post‐grant opposition system is part of the new America Invents Act,42 but it won’t
begin to apply for another several years,43 and the new system will be unavailable to many
competitors because of the short time limits for filing an opposition.44

   Unfortunately, that proposal came with a bias against foreign applications that makes little sense as
an economic matter, and may also render it suspect under U.S. treaty obligations.

    Post‐grant opposition is available only for patents granted on applications filed after April 16, 2013.
Because the average time to grant is close to four years, it will likely be the latter part of this decade
before many patents are eligible for post‐grant opposition.
44
    For example, the fact that a post‐grant opposition must be filed within nine months after a patent is
granted, America Invents Act §__, __ Stat. __ (2011), means that neither troll patents nor

        The success of post‐grant opposition depends on the willingness of third parties with
good information about the validity of a patent to challenge that patent in a public forum,
rather than settling privately. Some commentators are skeptical; pointing out that invalidating
patents is a public good that the challenger would share with every other competitor.45 But the
evidence from operation of similar systems in Europe is encouraging.46

        Patent law has other mechanisms that could be used to achieve the same goal. Some
issued patents are returned to the PTO after issuance and are reevaluated through an
adversarial process known as inter partes reexamination. This is an evaluation to which some
deference is appropriate, though today the law gives complete deference to that determination
by preventing a party challenging a patent in reexamination from raising many validity issues in
court. Even traditional ex parte reexamination, while not truly adversarial, allows the filer to
submit an initial explanation of the reasons for reexamination, and the result has been that in
recent years patents fare worse in reexamination than applications do in initial examination.

        The biggest risk with post‐grant opposition and related systems is giving challengers too
many bites at the apple, allowing them to inundate patentees with an endless set of challenges.
One way to address that problem is to place some limits on the number and perhaps the timing
of challenges, and to imbue patents that survive those challenges with a strong presumption of
validity. The America Invents Act does just that, effectively requiring parties to choose one of
these mechanisms to the exclusion of others.

    III.    Living With Imperfection

    Reforms such as those I discussed in the last section could make the prosecution process
more efficient and help to weed out bad patents at an acceptable cost. But none of them will
solve the problem of bad patents, or even come especially close to doing so. Part of the process
of patent reform must involve acknowledging the inherent imperfections in the patent
examination process, and adapting to those imperfections.




pharmaceutical patents are likely to be challenged, since in neither case are competitors likely to know
the patent is important shortly after it issues. See Love, supra (troll patents become important only at
the end of their patent life).

   In particular, we will continue to rely on litigation for the foreseeable future as a primary
means for weeding out bad patents. Litigation elicits information from both patentees and
competitors through the adversarial process, which is far superior to even the best‐intentioned
government bureaucracy as a mechanism for finding truth.47 More important, litigation is
focused on the very few patents (12 percent) that turn out to be important and about which
parties cannot agree in a business transaction.

    Litigation can be abused, and examples of patent litigation abuse have been rampant in the
last two decades. But a variety of reforms have started to bring that problem under control,
and the courts have the means to continue that process.48

    Part of the process must include a realistic recognition of the shortcomings of the patent
prosecution system. There are various ways the law might achieve such a recognition. Courts
could modulate the presumption of validity for issued patents. A presumption like that
embraced by the current “clear and convincing” standard must be earned, and under current
rules patent applicants do not earn it. We could replace that high hurdle with a more
appropriate level of deference. And the presumption ought to reflect the realities of patent
practice. The current presumption is so wooden that courts today assume a patent is valid even
against evidence that the patent examiner never saw, much less considered, a rule that makes
no sense.49 While the Supreme Court rejected application of the lower “preponderance of the
evidence” presumption,50 the one currently given trademarks and copyrights, it encouraged
courts to explain to juries that they should give less deference to the PTO with respect to prior
art that was not before the PTO.51 And recent evidence suggests that such an instruction may
be surprisingly effective in limiting the presumption of validity.52 So too is the growing
treatment of patent validity in the courts as a question of law, not fact. For legal questions are
not subject to the presumption of validity.

    The presumption of validity should be dynamic, not static. Improvements to the patent
prosecution process might justify a stronger presumption. In particular, surviving more
extensive scrutiny, whether by opting into tiered review, being subject to an opposition
proceeding, or perhaps even getting approval from two examiners rather than one, might
justify a stronger presumption. A dynamic presumption will allow the courts to play their
proper role as the guardians of the public interest while encouraging applicants and the PTO to
shoulder their burden as well.
