                                             ABSTRACT

        Oswald hypothesizes that regions and countries with high homeownership rates will
experience higher natural rates of unemployment and that rising homeownership in OECD countries
since the 1960s provides a key explanation for the rise in the natural rate of unemployment over the
same time period. Recent tests of the Oswald thesis have found the opposite. This study differs from
earlier ones both by considering different states of ownership (degrees of leverage) and types of
tenancy (private, public, and rent-free) and by examining data from Australia, rather than the U.S.
        We demonstrate that the recent anti-Oswald results are the result of (1) highly leveraged owners
having a greater incentive to remain employed and to become reemployed more rapidly that outright
owners and (2) those paying below-market rents having a lower incentive to avoid unemployment or
become reemployed than those paying market rents. The only positive Oswald result is that females
who are outright owners have significantly slower exits from unemployment. Overall, homeownership
does not increase unemployment.
        Finally, in line with expectations but in contrast to some earlier studies, our results indicate a
significant impact of the predicted replacement ratio (unemployment benefits to wage if reemployed)
on unemployment behavior. Persons with a higher predicted ratio are significantly more likely to
become unemployed, and unemployed females with a higher predicted replacement ratio have longer
unemployment spells than those with lower predicted ratios.

1. Introduction

Andrew Oswald (1996, 1997) has argued forcefully, based upon analysis of time series and cross-

section data for OECD countries and regions within selected OECD countries, that homeownership

causes unemployment. He concludes that if the rate of homeownership rises by five percentage

points, unemployment will rise by one percentage point, an effect so large that it would place

homeownership at the center of explanations for the rise in the natural rate of unemployment since

the 1960s in OECD countries. Oswald (1996, p.2) suggests ‘[M]ass unemployment exists because

of a secular change that has happened in all but a few Western housing markets – the rise of

homeownership and the decline of private renting’.1

        Two straight-forward rationales have been offered for the Oswald result. First, homeowners

face higher selling and buying costs compared to renters when they consider a move to a new

location to accept a job offer. As a result, homeowners may be more likely to become unemployed

(may be less willing to accept job transfers to or job opportunities in distant locations) and may

remain unemployed longer (have a greater reluctance to search in distant locations requiring a

move). Second, homeowners may, through their voting power in local government, enforce

restrictive planning and land development laws depressing employment options and thus

increasing unemployment.

        Oswald’s claim about the size and direction of the relationship between unemployment and

homeownership has attracted the attention of both housing and labor economists. A number of

studies have mimicked Oswald’s aggregate regional analysis, analyzing data from different regions

and adding additional covariates. Nickell and Layard (1999) add covariates in an analysis of the

original OECD country data. Green and Hendershott (2001) and Partridge and Rickman (1997)



1
  The rise in secular unemployment since the 1960s has been far more prominent in Western Europe than in the U.S. a
fact that has prompted considerable debate among labor and macroeconomists (see Nickell, 1998).

                                                                                                              3
both analyze US state data, adjusting for age composition and other factors, and Pehkonen (1997)

examines Finnish data. All of these studies find confirmation of Oswald’s result, with the

magnitude of the response ranging from a one to two percentage point increase in the

unemployment rate for a ten percentage point increase in the homeownership rate.

         Three studies have tested the Oswald thesis using US micro datasets.2 Goss and Phillips

(1997) examine the impact of housing equity levels on the duration of unemployment using the

1986 Panel Study of Income Dynamics and find that homeownership reduces the duration of

unemployment as compared with other tenures with the effect stronger for mortgagees as

compared with outright owners.3 Coulson and Fisher (2002) find that homeowners have

significantly lower probabilities of being unemployed and typically earn significantly higher wages

than renters. They also find that homeownership exerts a significant negative influence upon the

length of the unemployment spell. Green and Hendershott (2002) examined the duration of

unemployment of roughly 2500 Americans who became unemployed during the 1985-92 period.

In a two-component analysis, they first estimate a probit explaining homeownership and then relate

the duration of unemployment to predicted homeownership. Rather than Oswald’s predicted

positive relationship, they, too, find a negative relationship.

         How can we rationalize these seemingly counter intuitive results? While the logic of

Oswald’s argument seems impeccable if we are comparing outright owners and private renters,

some owners are highly leveraged and some renters occupy public housing or live rent-free with

relatives. Homeowners with weak housing equity positions may require quick re-employment to

using micro-panel data from the Netherlands.
3
  Goss and Phillips’ (1997) study was published shortly after Oswald’s (working) paper was released and undertaken in
ignorance of it. Nevertheless, the authors’ tests do in practice represent tests of the Oswald thesis.

                                                                                                               4
enable them to continue making their mortgage payments.4 Thus they may specify lower

reservation wages than equivalently qualified renters, leading to the greater possibility of shorter

durations of unemployment (Goss and Phillips, 1997).

        The presence of public housing with tenants paying long-term below-market rents and of

free-renters also confounds the analysis. Hendershott and Hu (1982) showed that significantly

leveraged owners with below-market financing rates should be reluctant to move if that requires

giving up their below-market financing (see Quigley, 1987, for empirical support). Similarly,

public housing tenants and free-renters should be reluctant to give up their below-market rents. A

large literature has found UK public tenants to be less mobile between regions and to experience

higher levels of unemployment (Engleman, 1977; Bover, Muellbauer, and Murphy, 1989; Hughes

and McCormick, 1981, 1985, 1987; McCormick, 1983; Minford, Ashton, and Peel, 1988).

        The present study employs an Australian micro dataset that is particularly strong both on

the labor market position of the respondents and their housing status. This allows more refined

tests of more sophisticated versions of the Oswald thesis in a different country setting. We also

employ the predicted ratio of unemployment benefits to wages if employed as an explanatory

variable in the analyses, a variable missing from earlier analyses. We provide strong evidence that

our counter-Oswald results are due to the behavior of leveraged owners and public housing tenants.

In fact, when we compare outright owners (rather than leveraged owners) with private renters

(rather that public renters), we find strong evidence, particularly for females that renters are slower

to become reemployed than owners. More specifically, female outright owners and public housing

occupants are equally less likely to exit unemployment as rapidly as private renters and owners

with mortgages.



4
 Moreover, homeowners with large mortgages can be subject to negative equity problems resulting in significant
housing lock-in effects (see Archer, Ling and McGill, 1996, Caplin, Freeman and Tracy, 1997 and Henley, 1998).

                                                                                                             5
       Four tests are employed to deduce the impact of homeownership, public housing and

leverage on unemployment. The first two tests focus solely on the relationship between the

aggregate housing tenure type ‘homeownership’ and unemployment. First, we estimate a probit

explaining the probability of being unemployed using (actual or predicted) homeownership as a

determinant (the choice between the two options being made on a prior test for exogeneity of

homeownership). Second we estimate a hazard equation explaining the factors influencing duration

of a spell of unemployment. Our final two tests move beyond this broad specification to consider,

in turn, the role of leverage in influencing the incidence and duration of unemployment of

homeowners and the impact of multiple housing tenures (outright owners, mortgages, public

renters, private renters and free renters on unemployment outcomes).

       The remainder of the paper contains four sections. In Section 2, we present the models to

be estimated. These include probits for being unemployed and a hazard for the duration of

unemployment. Section 3 elaborates on the data used in the study. The data used in this study are

drawn from the pooling of four consecutive Australian cross-section surveys from the mid to late

1990s (the 1994-97 Surveys of Income and Housing Costs, SIHC). These data provide rich

housing, labor market and income data and importantly include a tracking of the respondent’s labor

force position over an eight-month period. The latter feature injects a longitudinal module into the

data and is used in our unemployment spell analysis. Section 4 provides our results on

unemployment and the duration of unemployment. We briefly summarize and look toward future

work in Section 5.



2. The Models

Homeownership can correlate with the probability of becoming unemployed or the duration of

unemployment either because homeownership really matters or because it is correlated with other


                                                                                                6
unobservable factors that help determine both tenure choice and the probability or duration of

unemployment. For example, the user cost of a household with a long expected holding period is

lower than that of one with a shorter expected length of stay due to the longer amortization of up-

front stamp duties (taxes) and back-out brokerage fees. One reason for long expected lengths of

stay is a greater desire to retain proximity to family members and friends. If such owners become

unemployed, they will tend to remain unemployed longer than renters who become unemployed,

but it is due to their wish to remain proximate to family rather than being caused by their tenure

status.

          There is, therefore, no guarantee that homeownership is an exogenous determinant of

unemployment and we need to directly test for exogeneity in the homeownership effect on both the

probability of unemployment and its duration. Our test is a simple extended regression test in

which actual homeownership and a prediction error term (the difference between actual

homeownership and predicted homeownership) are entered in relevant preliminary models.

Because the null hypothesis of a zero coefficient on the error term is rejected, we use predicted

homeownership in our final equation (i.e., an unemployment probit, and an unemployment spell

hazard model).

          The probability of being a homeowner is expressed as:



Probit:          Oi = P (β1 Yi + β2 Ji + µi )                                                 (1)



where i, represents the decision-making unit and Oi indicates tenure choice, taking a value 1 if the

unit is a home owner and 0 otherwise. Explanatory variables include real income (Y) and a matrix

(J) of demographic identifiers (importantly age ranges, but also country of birth, race, gender,

marital status), human capital variables (education outcomes) and location dummies (divided into


                                                                                                    7
capital city and rest of the state dummies). As elsewhere, house prices and rents in Australia differ

markedly across geographic location and thus geographic locators provide proxies for housing cost

determinants of tenure choice.

        While otherwise unremarkable, one feature of our tenure choice model needs to be

emphasized. We assume that the tenure choice decision-making unit is the ‘income unit’ rather

than the ‘household’, the common approach in most tenure choice models. The income unit (a unit

of analysis used in social policy analyses in the Australian context) is defined as one person or a

group of related persons who reside within a single residential dwelling whose command over

income is assumed to be common.5 The household comprises all persons in a given dwelling.

        In most cases, households and income units are one and the same entity. A single person,

living alone, is both an income unit and a household; so too the couple with or without dependent

children, in which case income is aggregated and where it is inappropriate to combine the attributes

of the couple (e.g., age) we simply take the attributes of the head (the person with the highest

income) of the couple (thus the predicted ownership of head and spouse will be equal). Households

and income units are different (and the predicted probabilities of ownership will differ) when

unrelated people live together in the same dwelling or when children grow up but remain in the

family home even when they are no longer (notionally) dependent on their parents. The former are

assumed to split the rent unless the data indicate otherwise; the latter are assumed to be living rent

free. Each unrelated person in a household is making an independent housing tenure decision as is

the young adult still living at home.

  Following the practice of the Australian Bureau of Statistics’ (ABS) —the data manager of the survey data used in
this study— income sharing is assumed to take place between married (registered or de facto) couples and between
parents and dependent children (see ABS, 1999, p. 16). The ABS defines dependent children ‘as all persons aged under
15 years and persons aged 15-24 years who are full-time students, live with a parent or guardian and do not have a
spouse or offspring of their own living with them’ (see ABS, 1999, p. 15).

                                                                                                              8
Probability of Being Unemployed

         The probability of an individual being unemployed is expressed as



Probit          Ui = P (γ1 O*i + γ 2Ri + γ3´ St + γ4´ θt + µi)                                 (2)



where O*i is predicted/actual homeownership, Ri is the predicted replacement ratio, S is a matrix of

socio-demographic determinants of unemployment and θt is a matrix of quarterly time dummies

that account for time-related shocks (recall that our data are pooled cross-section). To determine

whether or not predicted or actual homeownership should be used for estimation purposes, we

include in a preliminary model actual homeownership and the prediction error term. The latter term

is equal to the actual housing tenure state (1 for the home owner and 0 for the non-home owner)

less the predicted probability of being a homeowner (from the tenure choice probit model —

equation 1). For the homeowner, the term is positive and increases as the predicted probability of

being a renter rises (1 – Ôi ). For the non-home owner, the term is negative and in this case the

absolute value increases as the error rises (0 – Ôi ).

         A key economic determinant of the probability of being unemployed is the predicted

replacement ratio of the individual. This ratio is measured as the weekly unemployment benefit an

individual is predicted to receive relative to their predicted weekly wage. The higher the

replacement ratio, the lower is the opportunity cost of being unemployed (the smaller is the relative

loss in wages) and consequently the higher the expected probability of being unemployed.

Estimates of expected earnings are based on a standard human capital OLS regression (estimated




                                                                                                     9
separately for women and men), which includes age categories to proxy for potential labor force

experience and educational qualifications.6

         As opposed to Coulson and Fisher (2002) and Green and Hendershott (2002), we have

measures of unemployment benefits in the data and use these estimates to predict an

unemployment benefit to all persons, which accounts for non-wage income and the socio-

demographic determinants that enter the administrative rules that apply to unemployment benefits

in Australia. All other things being equal, unemployment benefits are higher for those over age 21,

those with more children and those with lower wealth and private income. Income and assets tests

reduce the level of the benefit until the payment drops to zero. A rental subsidy applies to

unemployed private renters. This is unlike the contributory U.S. unemployment insurance benefit

system where benefits are positively related to past earnings. Another crucial difference between

the two systems is that in the U.S. there is benefit exhaustion whereas in Australia there is no direct

benefit exhaustion but an emphasis on the unemployment benefit recipient complying with job

search and work-for-benefit guidelines as the spell of unemployment lengthens. The vector θt

includes quarterly time dummies that will be used to capture shocks in real economic activity that

affect the time path of unemployment.

         The probit model of unemployment is based on the individual unit of analysis and includes

all persons in the labor force. We delete persons aged 65 and over and dependent children aged 15-

24. The probit model is then estimated separately for men and for women. The inverse Mills ratios

(φ/Φ) from these equations will be used in the unemployment duration hazard functions to correct

for sample selection bias.

 Our results are not reported in this paper. Educational qualifications exert their anticipated strong positive impact on
wages, as does potential labor market experience (age classifications).

                                                                                                                    10
II.        Duration of Unemployment

           Under Oswald’s thesis, homeownership leads to higher unemployment. Given the key

transmission mechanism through which homeownership is expected to lead to higher

unemployment — the relative immobility of homeowners — we would expect longer durations of

unemployment as well. In this section, we model the duration of unemployment using a hazard

analysis. But before discussing our hazard model, we make clear how we measure spells of

unemployment; an obvious requirement but one that is not always met in studies of

unemployment.

           Two questions need to be answered regarding spells of unemployment. First, when does a

spell of unemployment begin and end? Second, how do we deal with the missing information

problem evident in all data sets when spells of unemployment begin prior to the opening of a data

set’s window or end after that window is closed?7 The latter problem is one of censorship bias that

cannot be overcome but can be ameliorated through sound statistical techniques, while the former

is an issue in the meaning and characterization of unemployment spells themselves.

The population divides itself into three states: employed, unemployed and not in the labor force (or

NILF). This means that a spell of unemployment can begin as a result either of an individual

entering unemployment from the state of employment (full time, FtE, or part time, PtE) or from the

NILF labor force position. A person who enters unemployment from employment is a job loser.

Some data sets can distinguish between voluntary job quits and involuntary retrenchments but the

SIHC cannot. Likewise, an individual can exit from unemployment to the NILF state or to

employment. An exit to employment can be further broken down to an exit to part-time

employment or an exit to full-time employment (over 35 hours per week of employment). There

are good grounds for placing emphasis on the last of these transitions (that to full-time


7
    A dataset’s window refers to the period of direct reporting of (by) a respondent’s actions and outcomes.

                                                                                                               11
employment) because it represents, for most unemployed people, the best possible labor market

transition.

        An exit to the NILF state, on the other hand, can be difficult to interpret. For some, the

transition from unemployment to the NILF category represents the least desired transition as it

reflects a discouraged job seeker effect (i.e., the individual is losing the desire and attachment to

work to continue the search process). An exit to the NILF state could, however, represent a period

of retooling through full-time education and training or a decision to undertake full-time care for

dependent children or aged parents. Each of these transitions may be the most desired transition.

        Transitions from and to unemployment are illustrated in Figure 1a. The right and left

censoring of unemployment spells is illustrated in Figure 1b. A spell may begin before the data

window of the relevant data set and is referred to as a left-censored spell. Only retrospective

questions put to respondents would ever enable researchers to determine the beginning of the spell

(and that does not occur with the dataset used in the present circumstance). The origin of spells is,

however, known when it begins after the start of a survey’s data window (i.e., a non-left-censored

spell). When a spell of unemployment has not ended prior to the end of a survey’s data window the

spell is right censored. We do not know when such spells will end.

from unemployment), spells ending in employment (FtE and PtE transitions from unemployment)

and spells ending in full-time employment. We also add a permutation to this third model in which

the individual was employed in the first month of the data window, thereby focusing solely on job

loss transitions.

         We adopt a hazard model of the following general form



Hazard                  Hi = H (η1 O*i + η 2Ri + η3´ St + η4´ θt + η5 λi + µi)                (3)



where H is the hazard function, where O*i is predicted/actual homeownership, Ri is the predicted

replacement ratio, S is a matrix of socio-demographic determinants of unemployment and θt is a

matrix of quarterly time dummies that account for time-related shocks, λi is the inverse Mills ratio

from the unemployment probit.



                                                                                               13
         The hazard function gives the probability that an individual leaves a particular state at a

particular point in time conditional on being in that state prior to that point. In the present context,

the hazard function gives the probability of exiting unemployment at a given point in time, given

that individual had been unemployed up to that point. We shall utilize Cox’s proportional hazards

model, where we model the hazard function using the following functional form:



         h (t, X) = h (t,0) exp(b’X)                                                                          (4)



where h (t,0) is the baseline hazard rate. The baseline hazard rate reflects the influence of spell

duration on the hazard rate and is independent of the set of determinants. Correspondingly, the

second component of the hazard function exp(b’X) is independent of time but is dependent on the

set of regression coefficients and the associated X determinants. The assumed constancy of hazards

over time is the basis for the ‘proportional hazards’ model label.

III.     Housing Tenure and Leverage

         We distinguish between five housing tenure states: (1) outright owners, (2) owners with

mortgages, (3) private market renters (the default category in the regressions), (4) public renters

and (5) free renters.8 The latter category includes young people who still reside with their parents

(and are not defined as dependent children) in a rent-free state. We estimate unemployment

incidence and unemployment duration models incorporating these differentiated tenure positions.

Our models use both actual tenure states as dummy variables and predicted tenure states utilizing

the results of a multinomial logit model of tenure choice. The omitted tenure category is the private

rental category (tenants paying market rents).


8
  We note that the research on public housing fails to compare public housing with homelessness and with charity-
based housing. It could be argued that this group, typically absent from major datasets (including our own), is as
relevant a comparison tenure for public housing as are private renters and owners.

                                                                                                                14
         Just as missing variables threatens to confound the impact of observed ownership on

unemployment duration, so, too, with observed public housing. Bover, Muellbauer, and Murphy

(1989) point out that public housing typically represents ‘housing of last resort’. They suggest that

it would be natural to expect that a number of unobservable (in most datasets) characteristics such

as low motivation, low ability, bad luck, poor health are likely to be correlated with public housing.

This means that part of the regional mobility and unemployment differentials found between

housing tenures may be due to unobserved heterogeneity effects as compared to housing tenure

effects per se.

         We extend the Oswald framework in one last important respect. Among homeowners, we

anticipate that the degree of leverage affects labor market behavior. Those with high leverage will

typically have greater out of pocket housing costs than private renters occupying an equivalent

dwelling, while those with low leverage will have lower costs.9 The greater are housing expenses,

the greater the pressure on the homeowner to return to work. To test this hypothesis, we repeat the

above probability of unemployment and duration of unemployment estimations on homeowners

only (and then on owners with mortgages only), using their leverage (and predicted leverage) as an

explanatory variable. We expect that the greater the leverage, the greater the probability and/or the

duration of unemployment.



3. The Data

The dataset used in this study is the Australian Survey of Income and Housing Costs (SIHC)

Confidentialised Unit Record Files for the four consecutive years 1994-97 years. Roughly 13,500

persons in private resident dwellings are surveyed in each of the four years leading to a sample of


9
 The mortgage rate being paid includes a premium to cover expected inflation. Rents do not need to include such a
premium because landlords should expect to receive capital gains to compensate for inflation. In a zero inflation world,
out of pocket costs of owners using extreme leverage still need not exceed those of renters.

                                                                                                                15
56,370 individual respondents in the pooled 1994-1997 SIHC. These annual surveys were

conducted broadly under the same sampling conditions and in a period of stable economic growth

in Australia. We have inflated nominal values in each of the SIHC data sets to their 1997

equivalents using the Consumer Price Index values for Australia in the relevant years.

        The sampling frame of the SIHC is all those aged 15 and over living in private residences.

Excluded are those people resident in non-private residences (e.g., hotels, boarding schools,

boarding houses and institutions), the homeless, those living in remote areas of the Northern

Territory, and members of permanent defense forces. We delete from the data all income units

whose head is aged 65 and over and dependent children over 15 (full-time students aged 15 to 24

who themselves do not have spouses or dependent children of their own). Just over eight percent of

the respondents in the labor force are unemployed.

        The SIHC data set is cross-sectional. However, respondents to the SIHC are drawn from

Australia’s Monthly Population Survey (MPS), which tracks an individual’s labor force outcomes

during an eight- month window. The MPS labor force data for each individual is linked by the

ABS to the rich SIHC questionnaire containing housing-related questions (housing tenure,

dwelling structure and location, estimated house value, housing loans and repayments, housing

costs, and year of purchase), labor market questions (e.g., wages, labor force position), socio-

demographic information (e.g., age, education, country of birth, family type) and detailed income

data.

        An overview of housing and labor force variables of the SIHC data for our modeling

purposes is contained in Tables 1 and 2. Owners comprise 51.2 per cent of income units after

taking into account the exclusion of those aged 65 and dependent children. While not displayed in

Tables 1 and 2, homeownership rises with age and education level. Around half of owner-occupier

income units are outright owners and the other half owners with mortgages. The mean loan-to-


                                                                                                   16
value ratio for owners with mortgages is 0.43; around 12 per cent of owners with mortgages have

loan-to-value ratios exceeding 80 percent. Private renters comprise close to one-third of income

units in the sample while public renters represent five per cent of all income units. Income units

neither owning nor paying rent to a landlord comprise a relatively large 11 per cent of all income

units (the rent-free category).

        The unemployment rate for female homeowners stands at 3.9 per cent while that for male

owners is 4.1 per cent. For both women and men the unemployment rate for owners with

mortgages is lower than that for outright owners. In the case of males, the difference is relatively

large; outright owners having almost twice the unemployment rate of leveraged owners. Private

renters exhibit unemployment rates four times those of homeowners. The unemployment rate for

female public renters is twice that of private renters, while for males the ratio of unemployed to

employed is closer to three to one. Those in rent-free accommodation exhibit unemployment rates

similar to those in the private rental category.

        An important economic determinant of unemployment outcomes in our models is the

predicted replacement ratio (the ratio of unemployment benefits to earnings). We use actual weekly

earnings and benefits to model predicted weekly earnings and benefits and so the predicted

replacement ratio. The replacement ratio is imputed to both employed and unemployed persons in

our sample. Weekly earnings for women are two-thirds the earnings for men (much of this is a

lower hours effect). Because unemployment benefits are roughly equal for women and men, it is

not surprising that predicted replacement ratios are higher for women than men. Ratios are also

higher for unemployed persons than employed persons. The distributional results presented in

Table 2 indicate that the vast majority of persons are predicted to face replacement ratios lower

than 0.5.




                                                                                                17
4. Results

I.     Probability of Unemployment

We begin with tests of the simple owner-versus-renter hypothesis analogous to tests of Coulson

and Fisher (2002) and Hendershott and Green (2002) to determine if the results for Australia are

similar to those for the U.S. Table 3 reports separate results for males and females on the effect of

homeownership on unemployment after controlling for the range of confounding influences.

Model 1 presents probit model results for the case in which we treat homeownership as an

exogenous variable (actual homeownership) while model 2 includes both actual homeownership

and the homeownership error term to test for exogeneity in homeownership. Because the error term

is significant, homeownership is treated as an endogenous variable and we include predicted

homeownership in our final unemployment probit model (Model 3). (The coefficient on predicted

homeownership is roughly three times that in model 1.) Our predicted homeownership variable is

derived from a tenure choice probit model whose results are reported in Appendix Table 1. These

results reveal a positive relationship between homeownership on the one hand and age, (income

unit) income, and education on the other hand. Those born outside Australia tend to have lower

rates of homeownership (all other things being equal). Couple income units have higher rates of

homeownership than singles and homeownership rates rise with the presence of dependent

children.

       As is evident in Table 3, predicted ownership has a large negative effect on the probability

of unemployment for both women and men, indicating that the probability of unemployment falls

as the predicted probability of homeownership rises. The same is true, we note in passing, for our

model 1 results, which treated homeownership as an exogenous variable. This runs counter to the

Oswald thesis. The precise quantitative impact of a particular variable on the probability of

unemployment is gauged by utilizing the marginal effect (DF/dx column) estimates, which give the


                                                                                                18
impact of a marginal change in the independent variable on the probability of being unemployed.

When the variable is a zero-one dummy, the marginal effect is the impact of going from 0 to 1.

(All marginal effect calculations are at the means of variables.) For males, the relevant marginal

effect on predicted ownership is -0.235, while for females the relevant marginal effect value is -

0.192. In other words, a one percentage point increase in the predicted probability of being a home

owner (say from 0.59 to 0.60) decreases the probability of a male being unemployed by 0.235

percentage points (i.e., a drop of 0.00235 in the predicted probability of being unemployed; the

mean probability is 0.065 or 6.5 per cent). A one percentage point increase in the predicted

probability of a female being a home owner decreases the probability of female being unemployed

by 0.192 per cent.

        To provide some context to these marginal effect values, consider the impact of the

predicted replacement ratio on the probability of being unemployed. For males, a one percentage

point increase in the ratio of predicted benefits to predicted wages (say from 0.27 to 0.28) increases

the probability of a male being unemployed by 0.213 percentage points (i.e., an increase of

0.00213 in the predicted probability of being unemployed). This marginal effect is approximately

of the same magnitude as that of the predicted probability of homeownership. Hence,

homeownership and the replacement ratio have roughly similar economic effects on the probability

of unemployment. In the case of women, the replacement ratio marginal effect is less than half that

for males though still significant (the marginal effect is 0.095 for women as compared with 0.213

for men). In addition to homeownership and replacement ratio effects, our results show that the

probability of being unemployed is related to income unit type effects, geographical location

effects and country of birth effects.

        In Table 4, we have repeated the above estimations replacing homeownership with the full

range of housing tenure states (the omitted tenure category is private renters). The alternative


                                                                                                   19
endogenous model replaces actual housing tenure states with predicted housing tenure states.

Predictions of the appropriate housing tenure state are based on the results from a multinomial logit

model (see Appendix Table 2). An income unit (and, therefore all relevant persons in that income

unit) is allocated to that housing tenure state whose predicted probability value from the

multinomial logit model is the highest among all the predicted values. So, for example, if the

predicted probability for outright ownership was 0.52 and the predicted probabilities for each of

the remaining housing tenures were below this value, the income unit would be assigned to the

outright ownership tenure category. Before presenting our results we note that on the basis of this

allocation method, the two housing tenure categories with the lowest proportion of income units;

namely, public renters and the other rental (rent-free) category are even more under-represented in

terms of the distribution of predicted tenure states, giving us quite small samples in these two

tenures. The housing tenure variables in Table 4 are all dummy variables and so the stated

marginal effects refer to the impact on unemployment of the discrete 0 to 1 jump (from private

renting to the housing tenure in question).

       For males, outright homeownership reduces the probability of unemployment by about half

as much as does ownership with a mortgage, although both effects are significant. The marginal

effect for male owners with a mortgage is -0.073. Hence, male owners with mortgages are 7.3 per

cent less likely than private renters to be unemployed. In stark contrast, the probability of being

unemployed rises sharply for public renters with the stated marginal effect for men being 0.148.

The other rental category (the rent free category) also displays a marginally higher unemployment

propensity than private renters.

       Similar tenure effects are found among women. Both female outright owners and female

owners with mortgages display significantly lower probabilities of being unemployed than private

renters. The marginal effect for female owners with a mortgage is -0.066 and -0.051 for female


                                                                                                   20
outright owners. These estimates are roughly comparable to the male marginal effects although the

difference between the two effects is much smaller in the case of females. Female public renters

have a significantly higher probability of being unemployed as compared with female private

renters, but the public renter effect is much smaller than in the case of men.

       Generally our results using predicted housing tenure confirm those found using actual

housing tenure states. There is, however, one important difference. We find significant public

housing impacts in the case of actual tenure but when we move to predicted public housing we find

no significant effect. The under-prediction of public housing together with the relatively small

sample of predicted public renters may lie behind this result.

       In Table 5 we restrict ourselves to homeowners only and consider the role of leverage by

entering the actual and predicted loan-to-value ratio as a continuous variable in models for all

homeowners and for owners with a mortgage. Predicted loan-to-value ratios are based on an OLS

model including income, age, education, and other socio-demographic variables (see Appendix

Table 3). For males, both the actual and predicted loan-to-value ratios have significant negative

effects on the probability of unemployment among all homeowners. The marginal effect for men

(actual leverage) is -0.013, which means that a one percentage point increase in the loan-to-value

ratio (e.g., from 0.49 to 0.50), reduces the probability of being unemployed by 0.013 points. When

we move to owners with mortgages alone we find no significant leverage effect. What this

suggests is that those holding mortgages behave differently than those without mortgages

controlling for observable forces but that when one mortgagee is compared to another, those men

with higher leverage ratios do not exhibit a lower probability of unemployment. There is only one

significant leverage effect in the case of women: actual leverage among female mortgagees is

opposite to that for men and counter to the arguments on leverage we have presented. Higher

actual leverage increases the probability of unemployment.


                                                                                                   21
II.      The Duration of Unemployment

We have defined the completion of a spell of unemployment in three different ways with the exit to

full-time employment the most stringent and meaningful definition of a spell ending. For this latter

spell ending type we also undertake an additional analysis where we restrict spells to workers who

we know were employed at the beginning of the 8-month window. While this definition of a spell

limits spells to workers whom we know lost jobs in the relevant period, it comes at some cost as it

squeezes the maximum dimensions of the data window (by one month) over which we can view

the progress of the spell. It also reduces the number of potential spells.

         We begin with a descriptive picture of spell duration by presenting unemployment spell

survival curves by housing tenure type for males and females. The survival curve plots the

cumulative proportion of those who remain in unemployment (i.e., they ‘survive’ in the state of

unemployment) at different monthly points. The first set of survival curves presented in figure 2

(figures 2a to 2f) refer to spells that have no restriction placed on them in terms of when the spell

begins but are distinguished according to each of the three spell ending types (NILF +

employment, employment, and full-time employment). The final set of survival curves (figures 2g

and 2h), refer to unemployment spells of job losers.

         There are three striking features of the survival curves presented in figure 2. The first is the

steepness of the survival curve in the first two or so months of the 8-month window. This early

steepness indicates that most spells of unemployment end quickly.10 After a short period, the

hazard rate drops off rapidly and so the cumulative survival curve flattens out. The second striking

feature is the prominent role played by housing tenure. At one end of the survival curve spectrum

lie the survival curves for owners with a mortgage, which typically reveal more rapid early exit


10
  The caveat here is that figures 2a to 2g include left censored spells and so the rapid decline includes unemployment
spells beginning before the data window ending in the first month as well as fresh spells beginning in the data window
ending rapidly.

                                                                                                                22
from the unemployment spell than the other housing tenures. At the other end of the spectrum lie

the survival curves for public renters, which almost always reveal relatively slow exit from

unemployment. In between these two boundaries typically lie the survival curves of the remaining

three tenure categories: owners without mortgages, private renters and the other tenure (rent-free)

category.

       The third key feature of the survival curves displayed in figure 2 is the shift as we move

between the various definitions of when an unemployment spell ends and when a spell begins, with

these shifts displaying a strong gender connection. For instance, when we utilize the broadest

definition of an unemployment spell end, that of any exit from unemployment, the cumulative

survival curve for women is very steep suggesting rapid exit from unemployment. But, relative to

men, the survival curves for women become relatively flat as we move to stricter employment-

related definitions of spell endings. Why the difference? Because women, much more than men,

make the unemployment to out of the labor force transition and this transition is ignored in the case

of the employment-related spell ending types. (We ignore the transition to the NILF category in the

employment-related definitions of a spell exit so that the spell of unemployment continues until an

employment-related transit occurs.)

       Moreover, for men, the largest gap between the survival curves for owners with mortgages

and public renters occurs in the case of exit to full-time employment (refer to figures 2e and 2g).

This pattern does not hold for women. Women in the private rental and other rental categories

display more rapid exit from unemployment (to full-time employment) than owners with

mortgages (see figures 2f and 2h). This is evidence in favor of the Oswald thesis.

       The survival curves displayed in figures 2a to 2h do not control for confounding factors.

We, therefore, move to formal modeling of unemployment spells. Our results are presented in

Tables 4 and 5 with the sequencing of models following that of the unemployment probits. For


                                                                                                 23
space reasons, we only report the estimated coefficients of the key variables of interest (housing

variables and the replacement ratio) and include hazard ratios for ready interpretation. For

continuous variables, the hazard ratio gives the percentage increase (if the ratio is greater than one;

decrease if less than one) in the hazard rate for a unit increase in the covariate. If the variable is

dichotomous, the hazard ratio gives the risk of exit relative to the default. A hazard ratio greater

than one indicates that unemployed people with the designated characteristic exit the

unemployment state more quickly than the indicated alternative state. If the hazard ratio is less than

one, unemployed people with the given characteristic have a greater chance of ‘survival’ in

unemployment than the default category with the degree of lower risk given by the hazard ratio

value.

         Table 6 presents hazard model estimates of the impact of homeownership and the predicted

replacement ratio on the spell of unemployment.11 The ‘risk’ of a female homeowner exiting the

unemployment spell into employment is insignificantly different from that for female non-

homeowners (see Model B, C and D results in Table 6). Notice, however, in terms of the Model A

results, that the risk of a female homeowner exiting an unemployment spell altogether, regardless

of the type of exit specified, is significantly higher than that of the non-homeowner; female

homeowners have a 12.9 per cent higher risk. That is, female homeowners have a higher

propensity to exit the labor force during a spell of unemployment than do female non-homeowners,

confirming the relationship evident in the survival curves.

         The ‘risk’ of a male homeowner undertaking the transition to full-time employment is

significantly higher than for male non-homeowners (see Table 6 Model C). The hazard ratio for

men for this model is 1.222, which means that male homeowners have a 22.2 percent higher ‘risk’

11
  In the duration analysis, we restrict attention to models using actual homeownership, actual housing tenure and actual
leverage given space limitations and focus on the impact of the different spell endings. We note, however, that in
preliminary analyses (not reported), we included both actual homeownership and the homeownership error term in our
Table 6 hazard models but found that the home ownership error term was insignificant across the various models.

                                                                                                                24
of exiting unemployment within the eight-month window than do male renters (of all rental types);

a result that strongly contradicts the Oswald thesis. One interesting feature of the results from other

models presented in Table 6 is the fall in the male homeowner relative risk of exiting

unemployment as a less strict definition of a spell end is utilized. In the case of a definition of a

spell ending when a male unemployed person obtains full-time employment, the relative risk for

males is 1.222 while for more inclusive exits the relative risk drops below 1.13. We attempted to

estimate a hazard model on the basis of job loser spells and a full-time employment exit definition

of a spell but that model did not produce meaningful results.

        Table 7 reports hazard model results utilizing all five housing tenure categories and, for

homeowners, the loan-to-value ratio. These results are analogous to those in Tables 4 and 5. The

same basic models are estimated, with outright owner, an owner with a mortgage, public housing,

and other (rent-free) tenure categories (private renting is the dropped category) in the housing

tenure models and the loan-to-value ratio as a continuous variable in a model restricted to

homeowners.

        As can be seen from the Table 7 Model C results for men, public renters are likely to exit

employment far less rapidly than private renters (hazard ratio of 0.515 – 48.5 per cent lower risk).

On the other hand, owners with mortgages are likely to exit unemployment to employment and

especially to full-time employment far more quickly than are private renters (hazard ratios of 1.199

and 1.444). There is no significant impact for outright owners (no Oswald effect).

        To test the role of leverage in influencing the exit from unemployment behavior of

homeowners we restrict the sample to homeowners and include the loan-to-value ratio as an

explanatory variable (the LVR sub-model in Table 7). We find that an increase in the loan-to-value

ratio significantly increases the ‘risk’ of an exit from unemployment to employment and especially

full-time employment for male homeowners. We conjecture that these results are due to the


                                                                                                   25
potential loss of one’s own home owing to an inability to make mortgage payments while

unemployed.

           The effects are weakened considerably when we move to the most inclusive exit (Model

A), including exit to out of the labor force. When we move to the restricted model of job loser

spells of unemployment (Model D) the results on male public renters and outright owners remain.

While the coefficient on the owner with mortgage variable is not significant, the loan-to-value ratio

exerts its strong effect on increasing the hazard of exit from unemployment among homeowners.

           Turning to the case of unemployment spells among women, we find that female private

renters and owners with mortgages are indistinguishable in terms of the full-employment exit

hazard model results (Model C). However, both female outright owners (hazard ratio 0.586) and

public owners (hazard ratio 0.575) have a sharply lower risk of exit from unemployment than the

private rental group. The Oswald effect holds with a vengeance for outright female owners. This

effect carries through to the more stringent Model D results, which restrict the sample of

unemployment spells to job loser spells, but the public renter effect does not. Finally, a higher

replacement ratio significantly slows female exits to full time unemployment.12



5. Summary

This paper represents another test of the Oswald hypothesis that higher homeownership causes higher

unemployment. The key explanation offered by Oswald for this outcome is that homeowners who lose their

job face high housing-related transaction costs if they take the option of moving to another region to obtain

employment. There is obvious truth in this. However, it is also true that a range of housing-related channels

link housing and labor markets. One of these is that homeowners with large mortgages might be more

willing to accept wage cuts and/or ratchet up work effort (productivity) in order to remain employed or to

     Male exits are slowed, but not significantly. However, the coefficient is significant for the homeowners-only model.

                                                                                                                  26
exit unemployment quicker than renters (or owners without large mortgages) because of the requirement to

meet mortgage repayments to save their house. This housing-labor link suggests that we should expect

significant differences within the homeowner group in terms of labor market behavior.

        Likewise, Oswald’s thesis ignores the role of public housing and rent-free housing. Public renters

and rent-free ‘renters’ may be ‘locked in’ to their present abodes and face high costs of their own (but of a

different nature to those experienced by homeowners) if they consider accepting a job offer particularly

when it involves a move to another locality. Transaction costs are not the key driver as in the case of

homeowners; rather the key to the poor labor market outcome is the potential loss of secure low-rent

tenancies that are, in the main, location-specific. What this implies is that unless account is taken of

homeowner leverage and multiple rental categories, we are unlikely to obtain an accurate and

comprehensive overview of how housing affects the labor market.

        Our analysis of the probability of being unemployed and of the duration of unemployment spells is

based on the pooling of four consecutive annual surveys of the SIHC during the mid-1990s all conducted

broadly under the same sampling conditions and in a period of stable economic growth in Australia. In the

duration analysis we distinguish carefully between the labor force states that a person may exit to (the

competing risks they face). We therefore, distinguish between an exit from unemployment to employment

(and then make the further part-time versus full-time employment distinction) and from unemployment to

out of the labor force.

        A variety of estimations are performed. In terms of the probability of being unemployed, in no case

do we find evidence in support of the Oswald hypothesis that owners have worse employment outcomes

that private renters, and in most cases we find evidence of the opposite – higher homeownership causes

lower unemployment. Further, owners have significantly quicker exits from unemployment than do private

renters, male to full time employment and females out of the labor force. More importantly, however, we

show that the key to the counter Oswald results for males is that owners with mortgages display the lower

probability of being unemployed and experience higher relative risks of exit from a spell of unemployment.




                                                                                                           27
In fact, outright owners, especially females, have significantly slower exits from unemployment, especially

to full time employment. This is the only support we find for the Oswald hypothesis.

         Just as the degree of leverage affects homeowners’ probability of becoming unemployed and their

duration if unemployed, the type of renter status affects renters’ probabilities and durations. Both public

housing tenants and those living rent-free are more likely than private renters to become unemployed, and

public renters who become unemployed have longer durations than do private or rent-free renters.

         Finally, our results indicate a significant impact of the predicted replacement ratio (unemployment

benefits to wage if reemployed) on unemployment behavior. Persons with a higher predicted ratio are

significantly more likely to become unemployed and unemployed females with higher predicted ratio have

longer unemployment spells than do those with lower predicted ratios. Unemployed males with high

replacement ratios have longer unemployment spells but significantly so only in the homeowners-only

model.
