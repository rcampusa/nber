                                         ABSTRACT

While economists have posited that health investments increase earnings, isolating the causal
effect of health is challenging due both to reverse causality and unobserved heterogeneity. We
examine the labor market effects of a randomized controlled trial, the Multiple Risk Factor
Intervention Trial (MRFIT), which monitored nearly 13,000 men for over six years. We find that
this intervention, which provided a bundle of treatments to reduce coronary heart disease
mortality, increased earnings and family income. We find few differences in estimated gains by
baseline health and occupation characteristics. Reductions in serious illnesses and work-limiting
disabilities likely contributed to the observed gains.

1    Introduction

Economists have long recognized a strong connection between health and economic outcomes.

Measures of health, both self-reported and objectively measured, are positively associated with

human capital, earnings, income, and wealth. The direction of causality in these relationships is

unclear. Better health can lead to higher productivity, less working time lost to illness, and lower

mortality, which further incentivizes human capital investment. Higher productivity and financial

resources can facilitate access to care, avoidance of harmful environmental factors, and access to

higher-quality food and drugs.

    In this paper, we examine the impact of health on earnings and income using data from the

Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT), a randomized trial studying the combined effects

of multiple health interventions aimed at reducing coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality risk in

the United States. MRFIT began screening men aged 35 to 57 in 1974 with high risk for CHD

mortality. After three rounds of screening, nearly 13,000 study participants were randomized into

two treatment groups. A “Special Intervention” (SI) group received interventions aimed at lowering

cholesterol, lowering blood pressure, and quitting smoking, while a “Usual Care” (UC) group was

instructed to continue seeking standard medical care in the community. The MRFIT intervention

substantially reduced CHD risk throughout the six (or more) years that each participant was

monitored.

    We find that the improved health of the SI group raises earnings by three percent and total

family income by four percent, with no concurrent effect on labor force participation, when measured

six years after enrollment. These results are robust to multiple forms of sample selection including

survey attrition and labor force exit. While MRFIT has been examined extensively, particularly

in the medical and epidemiological literatures, this paper offers, to the best of our knowledge, the

first examination of the effects of the intervention on earnings, income, and other labor market

outcomes.

    A key contribution of this paper is that it isolates the impact of health on earnings and family

income while avoiding concerns about reverse causality and unobserved heterogeneity. Surveys of

the literature examining the relationship between health and labor market outcomes (Currie and


                                                 1
Madrian 1999; O’Donnell, Doorslaer, and Van Ourti 2015) note that identification typically relies

on estimation strategies with “dubious” exclusion restrictions or, more recently, within-person

variation in health over time which also requires strong exogeneity assumptions. Recent work

in developing countries uses randomized controlled trials to study the impact of health on labor

market outcomes. However, while many of the interventions in developing economy settings focus

on increasing nutrient or consumption levels, MRFIT is largely aimed at improving health through

reducing overconsumption. In this way, our paper provides novel evidence of the effects of developed

countries’ health improvements on earnings.

   Our analysis focuses on a key aspect of health in the United States, coronary heart disease.

Although the rate of mortality due to heart disease has been in steady decline for at least fifty

years, heart disease remains the leading cause of death in the United States (Kochanek et al.

2016). While MRFIT began in the 1970s, our findings are relevant for understanding how lowering

CHD mortality risk affects labor market outcomes in the present day as the current advice for

preventing CHD is dominated by the primary components of the MRFIT intervention: adjust

your diet, stop smoking, and control your blood pressure (e.g., Torpy, Burke, and Glass 2009).

Although the results of our analysis from MRFIT cannot speak directly to how any type of health

improvement will affect labor market outcomes, understanding the impact of CHD risk on workers’

outcomes is important due to the widespread prevalence of heart disease in the United States.

   We investigate potential avenues through which the health improvements lead to higher earn-

ings. We test for differential earnings effects across subgroups defined by baseline health character-

istics including cholesterol, smoking, and blood pressure levels as well as CHD mortality risk and

BMI. We also examine earnings effects by baseline occupation classification (white vs. blue collar)

and occupational tasks (as defined by Autor, Levy, and Murnane (2003)). However, the resulting

estimates are mainly suggestive as we are only able to reject the null hypothesis that the impact

of the intervention on earnings is the same across subgroups when comparing groups defined by

baseline smoking intensity and (marginally) when comparing white and blue collar workers.

   In his seminal work, Grossman (1972) notes that investments in health can raise earnings by

increasing the amount of healthy time available for market work. Using responses to annual survey

questions which ascertain information on events that occurred over the past year, we find that

                                                  2
the SI group experiences less time lost to illness and lower levels of work-preventing disabilities

during the experimental period. Our results suggest that this mechanism posited by Grossman

likely contributed to the increased earnings levels due to the intervention.

   In our analysis, we focus on the reduced form effect of the MRFIT intervention on labor market

outcomes. We do so for two reasons. First, we do not possess an ideal single measure of health

which fully captures the impact of health as affected by MRFIT. For example, while the intervention

lowered measured CHD risk, this metric may not fully capture all the dimensions through which the

intervention improved health. In addition, a global health summary question, such as self-reported

health status, was not asked of participants. Second, for nearly every potential health measure

that could be used in our analysis, there likely would be concerns about the exclusion restriction.

For example, as part of the smoking modification intervention, participants were encouraged to

avoid behaviors, such as going to bars, that might trigger the desire to smoke. To the extent that

this aspect of the intervention is not captured in a single health measure, using the intervention as

an instrument for health would lead to concerns regarding the validity of the exclusion restriction.

Our reduced form estimates still answer an important question: how does an intervention focused

on reducing mortality due to the leading cause of death in the United States affect labor market

outcomes?

   Our paper contributes to an extensive literature examining the relationship between health and

labor market outcomes. Recent studies, using experimental or quasi-experimental research designs,

exploit the effects of short-run environmental factors (often, pollution) on productivity and labor

supply, in some cases focusing on intrahousehold effects (Graff Zivin and Niedell 2012; Adhvaryu,

Kala, and Nyshadham 2016; Aragón, Miranda, and Oliva, 2016). Other studies leverage the impacts

of medical interventions aimed at preventing or treating diseases (Thirumurthy, Graff Zivin, and

Goldstein, 2008; Lucas, 2010; Fink and Masiye, 2015; Dillon, Friedman, and Serneels, 2015).

Compelling evidence of one aspect of health on productivity comes from experimental evidence of

the effects of iron supplementation, particularly on anemic workers (Thomas et al., 2006).1 While

this work provides important evidence in developing contexts, individuals in developed countries
  1
    Other studies of iron supplementation on productivity include Haas and Brownlie (2001), Li et al. (1994),
Edgerton et al. (1979), and Basta et al. (1979).



                                                     3
face different health challenges. Health is naturally a multidimensional characteristic, and the

effects of variation in one dimension informs relatively less about effects along another dimension.2

        Adult health interventions in the economics literature are relatively rarer in developed countries

than in developing economies. Some notable studies examine the causal impact of variation in the

costs of either health insurance or healthcare itself (Newhouse et al., 1993; Dow et al., 1997).

Broadly speaking, the findings point to a reduced form result that lower healthcare costs are

associated with better labor market outcomes. The intermediate step, in which greater access

to care leads to improved health is also generally supported, but can become more complicated.

Objective measures of health may improve with greater access to care, but self perceptions of health

may fall with the availability of health information. The analysis presented in this paper partially

sidesteps this issue because the UC group received continued (if less frequent) information about

health markers. In other research, evidence on the effects of body composition, as measured by

body-mass index (BMI), on labor market outcomes is summarized by Cawley and Ruhm (2011). In

terms of the relevant health conditions, this work is most closely related to ours although evidence

in these studies is plagued by concerns about unobserved heterogeneity.3

        This paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the specifics of MRFIT, its sample, and the

data. After briefly documenting the impact of the intervention on health in section 3, we estimate

the effect of health on earnings and family income in section 4. Section 5 discusses and concludes.



2        Experimental Design

We leverage the experimental impact of MRFIT to identify causal effects of health on labor market

outcomes. MRFIT was designed to understand the impact of CHD on mortality where CHD

mortality risk was experimentally manipulated by a bundle of treatments. The trial was not

     A related literature, reviewed by Thomas (2009), examines the effects of resources and nutrients before birth or
at young ages on adult economic outcomes. See Almond (2006), Roseboom et al. (2001), and Field, Robles, and
Torrero (2009) for examples spanning various countries and contexts. For examples from the extensive literature on
the effects of childhood nutrition or treatment against infection, some of which persist into adulthood, see Alderman,
Hoddinott, and Kinsey (2006), Glewwe and Miguel (2008), Maluccio et al. (2009), and Hoddinott et al. (2008).
   3
     Although our discussion focuses on the evidence regarding the impact of health on labor market outcomes, as
we noted above the causality may run in the opposite direction. For example, Frijters et al. (2005) exploit income
changes associated with German reunification to identify the effect of income on health. Work by Case, Lubotsky,
and Paxson (2002) and Currie and Stabile (2003) finds that the strong relationship between adult income and adult
health is also present for children and grows stronger as children age.

specifically designed to affect or measure our outcomes of interest. This section describes the

background, intervention, and data created by MRFIT. The information presented below draws

heavily on the eight papers making up volume 10, issue 4 of Preventive Medicine (1981), which

detailed the implementation of MRFIT and presented its early results.


2.1   Development of MRFIT

Prior to the 1960s, epidemiological research had already shown connections between coronary heart

disease and several risk factors. Existing research had found both that serum cholesterol levels were

associated with incidence of myocardial infarction and that cholesterol levels could be affected by

modifying dietary intake (Zukel et al. 1981). Blood pressure and smoking had also been established

as risk factors for CHD. Interest grew throughout the 1960s in a large-scale demonstration of the

effects of risk factor modification on CHD and mortality. While single-factor trials were considered

by epidemiologists and public health officials, a 1970 task force, organized by the director of the

National Heart and Lung Institute to address arteriosclerosis, recommended against trials modi-

fying diet alone and suggested a multiple-risk-factor trial as the way forward. A multiple-factor

intervention was considered most likely to produce measurable results.

   In response to these recommendations, the National Heart and Lung Institute’s Clinical Ap-

plications Program undertook planning for a trial addressing the multiple risk factors of serum

cholesterol, blood pressure, and smoking. The Framingham Heart Study, an ongoing observational

study of factors associated with heart disease, was used to determine the necessary sample sizes to

measure the expected effects. Ultimately, grants were awarded to 22 clinics across 16 metropolitan

areas in order to identify study participants and implement the trial. Study organizers provided

detailed information to each of the clinics and ensured that information and techniques were con-

sistent across them.


2.2   Screening and Randomization

The MRFIT clinics screened initially 361,662 men in total, of whom 12,866 were randomized into

the Special Intervention and Usual Care groups (Sherwin et al., 1981). The study targeted men



                                                 5
aged 35 to 57 in the upper end of the CHD risk distribution as determined by a model predicting

CHD mortality risk using Framingham Study data.4 The upper age limit was chosen so as to

avoid participants moving at retirement since, as discussed below, participants in the SI group

needed to make regular visits to the clinics. There was not a unified method for sampling possible

participants, so clinics were free to enroll participants in different ways, provided that they met the

age and CHD risk requirements. Initially, the intention was to exclude men with diastolic blood

pressure readings over 110 mm Hg or who were taking antihypertensive medication, but both of

these requirements were ultimately relaxed.

      Potential participants were enrolled through three separate screening visits separated by three to

four weeks. At each screening, measures needed to compute CHD risk were taken and the potential

respondents were analyzed for the likelihood of responding to intervention. Only those with elevated

CHD risk, initially targeted as the upper 15 percent of the distribution, and a willingness to change

risk factors were contacted again after each screening. The vast majority of the initially-screened

men were excluded after the first screening for having estimated CHD risk that was below the study’s

threshold (Sherwin et al., 1981). Despite targeting the upper 15 percent of the distribution based on

Framingham data, this restriction actually eliminated some 90 percent of the 360,000 men attending

the first screening. In total, 22,088 men returned for the second screening. Further respondents

were excluded because they expected to move from the area, had previously been hospitalized for

more than two weeks due to a heart attack, had been prescribed diabetes medication, or had very

high levels of serum cholesterol (greater than 350 mg/dl) or diastolic blood pressure (greater than

115 mm Hg). Following the third screening, participants were randomized into the SI and UC

groups.


2.3      The Intervention

MRFIT was a non-blind randomized trial. The SI group was subject to the intervention, which

is described in detail throughout this section, while the UC group was advised to seek their usual

avenues of care in the community. Information on their medical conditions and risk factors were

disclosed to the UC group and their medical providers. As the MRFIT organizers were aware,
  4
      We discuss the details of the CHD risk prediction model below.


                                                         6
the UC group was not a control group per se and, hence, avoided the standard “treatment” and

“control” terminology by instead using the SI and UC labels. UC participants were informed of

their elevated risk along with a number of medical measures and were followed-up with throughout

the study. However, the interventions described below induced differences in the two groups, which

were effectively identical at baseline. The SI and UC means for key baseline variables are displayed

in Table 1.5 There are no statistically significant differences in the means of these variables between

the two groups.6

       The intervention for the SI group had multiple arms and aspects of implementation that were

used throughout the six years of the study. After initial meetings and screenings at baseline, SI

group members participated in a series of 10 meetings with MRFIT staff and other SI participants

over the first two or three of months of the study (Benfari, 1981). These sessions were aimed at

communicating to the participants the specific risks associated with various risk factors, giving

information on changing behaviors, and providing support for doing so. Participants were encour-

aged to bring their wives or “homemakers,” which was intended to be especially helpful in affecting

changes in diet and smoking behavior. Following this intensive period of meetings, depending on

their progress in modifying risk factors, the participants entered a period of extended intervention

or maintenance for each risk factor. Extended intervention involved continued efforts at changing

behavior, while maintenance provided support for changes already observed.


2.3.1      Cholesterol Intervention

MRFIT organizers sought to decrease serum cholesterol levels for all men in the SI group, but

a particular focus was placed on achieving a ten percent decrease for participants with baseline

levels greater than 220 mg/dl (Caggiula et al., 1981). Based on evidence from prior studies, it

was thought that such a reduction could be achieved by recommending a diet with ten percent of

calories each from saturated and polyunsaturated fats and a limit on dietary cholesterol of 300 mg
   5
     Our analysis sample, which is used in Table 1, contains the 12,562 of the original 12,866 MRFIT participants
that have non-missing data for age, race, education, marital status, and employment status measured at baseline.
Additional information regarding the available data is discussed below in the Data and Measurement sub-section.
   6
     The p-values for the differences reported in Table 1 are based on a wild cluster bootstrap which clusters at the
level of the 22 clinics (Cameron, Gelbach, and Miller 2008). All the differences shown in Table 1 remain statistically
insignificant, with little movement in the corresponding p-values, if we do not applying clustering methods.



                                                          7
per day.7 The diet also set a goal for total fat intake as 35 percent of calories. Weight loss was also

a target for the subset of men in the SI group who were over 1.2 times “ideal body weight,” which

is solely determined as a function of height.8

       When MRFIT participants turned out to have, on average, healthier pre-intervention diets

than those seen in the prior studies, these targets were made more ambitious. Compared to exist-

ing evidence, MRFIT participants in both experimental groups consumed fewer calories, a lower

percentage of calories from total fat and saturated fat, and a higher percentage of calories from

polyunsaturated fat at baseline. Diets were particularly better-than-expected among participants

with high baseline cholesterol levels. Caggiula et al. (1981) hypothesize that in response to screen-

ings showing high cholesterol levels, participating men had already begun to adjust their diets. In

1976, some two to three years into the study, the saturated fat and dietary cholesterol limits were

lowered to eight percent of calories and 250 mg per day, respectively. The weight loss targets were

extended to include men over 1.15 times ideal body weight, and a goal of reducing bodyweight by

at least 10 pounds was added for most of the men in the SI group.

       The specifics of the MRFIT intervention for modifying diet amounted to targeting particular

levels of intake for various food groups. A written manual was distributed to SI participants,

categorizing food types according to whether they were “OK” or should be avoided. SI sessions were

aimed at providing this kind of relevant information to participants and their wives or homemakers.

In addition to basic information on what foods to target and avoid, MRFIT sessions highlighted

shopping skills, label-reading, food demonstrations, and tastings. Over the long term, the intensity

of follow-up with each participant was a function of their cholesterol response. Throughout the

study, the serum blood cholesterol levels of the SI group was tracked at least every four months.
   7
     It should be noted that more recent evidence shows no impact of dietary cholesterol on serum cholesterol, which
has resulted in the USDA dropping dietary cholesterol recommendations from its guidelines. See p. 17 of the USDA’s
“Scientific Report of the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee.” Regardless, as shown in results reported
in this paper as well as prior research, MRFIT did achieve serum cholesterol reductions, presumably due to the fat
intake recommendations and changes to participant weight.
   8
     “Ideal weight” in this context is 0.9 times the average height-specific weight for men aged 18–34 in the National
Health Survey, 1960-1962. This makes ideal weight for a six-foot man approximately 162 pounds, and 1.2 times ideal
weight is just over 194 pounds. For most heights, 1.2 times ideal body weight amounts to a BMI in the range of 26
to 28.




                                                          8
2.3.2    Smoking Intervention

Smoking cessation for the 59 percent of participants that smoked was a key design goal of MRFIT.

Given the relatively high CHD risk among MRFIT participants due to other factors, smoking was

viewed as a particularly high risk to this population (Hughes et al., 1981).9 MRFIT clinics were

staffed with smoking specialists, psychological consultants, and health counselors to aid participants

in quitting. As in the dietary aspects of the intervention, participants’ wives were also engaged

to support smoking cessation. An initial intervention at baseline involved participants receiving

a “strong antismoking message from a physician” (Hughes et al., p.482) who provided tailored

information based on the participant’s health measures. This was followed by a meeting with

a smoking specialist, from which the specialist could identify preferred cessation techniques and

whether the participant appeared prepared to attempt cessation.

    The smoking intervention from this point forward was structured around documentation created

specifically for MRFIT participants. The intervention group meetings highlighted the risks of

smoking and the benefits of cessation and encouraged participants to examine details of their

smoking behaviors. Meetings involved behavioral modification techniques and group discussions.

The smoking specialists followed up regularly to offer support to participants who reported they

had stopped smoking. Participants received feedback on a number of objective medical measures

including serum thiocyanate and expressed carbon monoxide. Over the extended intervention

period, those who had not quit or who had relapsed were considered for additional intervention.

These interventions were tailored more specifically to each individual and potentially involved more

information from physicians, additional types of group meetings, or further cessation therapies.


2.3.3    Blood Pressure Intervention

The blood pressure intervention in MRFIT targeted reducing diastolic blood pressure for hyperten-

sive participants (Cohen et al., 1981). Blood pressure readings were taken throughout the screening

process, as part of sample selection, but categorization as hypertensive was initially based on the

third screening, when systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings were both taken. Participants
   9
     However, because the sample participants were selected to meet a CHD risk threshold, there is a negative within-
sample correlation between smoking intensity and the other risk factors.


                                                         9
were categorized as hypertensive if they had a diastolic blood pressure reading of 90 mm Hg at

third screening and again at a confirmation follow-up. If a participant’s readings later exceeded

these thresholds at a regular visit and a confirmation follow-up, they were categorized as hyper-

tensive at that point. Any participant on antihypertensive medication was considered hypertensive

throughout. Those who were taking such medication were given a diastolic blood pressure target

of 80 mm Hg. For participants not initially on medication, the specific target was 89 mm Hg or a

10 mm Hg reduction, whichever was lower.

   Hypertensive participants were treated with a “stepped care” approach. This involved steady

increases in the level of hypertensive medication in a way that was standardized across clinics.

During a period of close monitoring, participants were put on increasingly potent blood pressure

medications if the desired blood pressure reductions were not observed. The medications used in

MRFIT were from a centralized source, prepackaged for participants, and provided free of charge

(Cohen et al., 1981). If blood pressure readings fell consistently below 80 mm Hg or weight loss was

achieved, participants’ medications were eligible to be stepped down. In addition to the medication,

dietary advice on weight reduction and reduced sodium intake were counseled for hypertensive

treatment.


2.4   Data and Measurement

Men in the UC group were invited back for annual visits and examinations after randomization.

Men in the SI group were invited for these visits as well as interim follow-ups approximately every

four months (Sherwin et al., 1981). The annual visits allowed MRFIT to record new information

on medical history, 24-hour dietary recall, leisure activity, smoking history, and other behaviors.

The annual examinations of all participants included, in addition to a physical examination, the

recording of a number of biomarkers. For tracking changes to health, this paper uses data from all

these annual visits. However, certain labor force information was only recorded at baseline and the

six-year follow-up. This includes reported earnings from participants’ main jobs as well as family

income, both of which are reported in categories. Other labor force information, including layoff,




                                                10
firing, and disability over the prior year, are reported at annual visits.10

       Participation throughout the experimental period was relatively high. Sherwin et al. (1981)

note that a “large majority” of men participated in the group sessions and that those who did not

were “usually” willing to participate in individual sessions. Nearly 75% of wives of the SI group

participated in at least some of the group sessions. Through the fourth year of the experiment, over

91% were either attending their annual visits or known to be deceased, with participation nearly

equal for the SI and UC groups. We discuss sample attrition in more detail in section 4.3.


2.5      Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) Risk

We follow previous MRFIT researchers in using calculated measures of CHD risk to summarize the

overall health of the participants and the intervention’s effects. These risk scores are generated using

estimates from the Framingham Study as reported in Neaton et al. (1981).11 Risk is estimated with

a logit model with the outcome being mortality due to CHD within a six year period and using serum

cholesterol, diastolic blood pressure, and cigarettes smoked per day as predictors.12 While other

participant characteristics (e.g., age) could be used in calculating risk scores, as in many publicly-

available risk calculators based on the Framingham sample, we follow previous researchers and the

MRFIT organizers in using these risk scores that are based on key indicators for MRFIT’s targeted

dimensions of health. We control for additional characteristics of participants, including age, in our

empirical analysis as described in the following sections. Using serum cholesterol, diastolic blood

pressure, and cigarettes per day with the logit coefficients from Neaton et al. (1981), we calculate

risk scores at screening and at each follow-up year.13

       Kernel-smoothed densities of baseline CHD risk by experimental status are displayed in the top

left panel of Figure 1. The magnitudes of the risk scores map directly into CHD mortality risk from

  11
     We deviate slightly from Neaton et al. (1981) in that we do not adjust self-reported smoking levels for the
respondent’s measured serum thiocyanate, which is a biomarker for smoking. To the extent that individuals in the
SI might be more likely to underreport their smoking behavior (perhaps because they are expected to reduce their
smoking levels), we will tend to overstate the CHD risk differences between the SI and UC groups. However, we show
below that serum thiocyanate levels are lower in the SI group than the UC group.

     The logit coefficients in this model, found in Neaton et al. (1981, Table 18), are 0.0088 on serum cholesterol,
0.0464 on diastolic blood pressure, and 0.0286 on cigarettes per day, with an intercept of 11.0336.
  13
     All three variables were not recorded at the same screening visits, the estimates reported here use first-screening
serum cholesterol and third-screening blood pressure and cigarette smoking levels.

the original Framingham logit model. That is, a risk score of two percent indicates a two percent

probability of mortality due to CHD within six years. In addition to being statistically equivalent

at the mean (see Table 1), the densities for the SI and UC groups are quite similar across the entire

distribution (Figure 1a).14 Further, while the mean risk scores are just above two percent, both

distributions exhibit a noticeable positive skew.

    In order to perform power calculations and determine the necessary sample size, MRFIT or-

ganizers anticipated the effects of the intervention on the SI and UC groups. They made these

predictions based on evidence from prior interventions. The predicted effects are shown in Ap-

pendix Table A1. While the organizers anticipated cholesterol and blood pressure impacts to be

concentrated among participants with high baseline levels of those risk factors, they anticipated

larger percentage reductions in cigarettes smoked for those at the low end of the smoking distri-

bution. In examining possible heterogeneous effects of the intervention in section 4.5, we use these

subgroups defined by the MRFIT organizers based on baseline risk factors.



3     The Impact of MRFIT on Health Outcomes

Before turning to employment-related outcomes, we briefly document the impact of the MRFIT

intervention on health outcomes that were directly impacted by the three interventions: serum

cholesterol reduction, smoking cessation, and lowering blood pressure. The longitudinal impacts

of MRFIT on serum cholesterol (Caggiula et al. 1981), smoking behavior (Hughes et al. 1981),

and blood pressure (Cohen et al. 1981) have been previously shown for the first four years of the

experiment. We extend these findings to cover the first six years of the experiment and also present

findings for the longitudinal impact on CHD risk scores.


3.1    The Impact on CHD Risk Scores

The reductions in CHD risk were large and sustained as shown in Figure 1. After the first year

of the intervention, Figure 1b shows that the average CHD risk in the SI group is over 40 percent
  14
     We can compare the risk scores of the MRFIT sample to a nationally-representative sample from the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I), which was in the field from 1971 to 1975. We find that the
average CHD risk score for men ages 35 to 57 in NHANES I was 1.26, consistent with MRFIT participants being
drawn from the upper end of the risk distribution.


                                                      12
lower than that found in the UC group. Consistent with the prediction that the cholesterol and

blood pressure interventions will affect those with the highest initial levels, the long right tail of

the SI distribution is particularly diminished. By year six of the experimental period, as displayed

in Figure 1c, the average risk scores for both groups had fallen further. Decreases in the UC group,

however, outpaced those in the SI group, leading to a smaller effect for the intervention on CHD

mortality risk by year six.15

       To examine the longitudinal effects of the MRFIT intervention, we estimate the equation


                                        yit = αt + βt SIi + γt Xi + εit ,                                      (1)


where yit is an outcome for participant i in year t, SIi is an indicator equal to 1 for those in the

SI group, and Xi is a vector of controls measured at baseline. These baseline controls include a

full set of indicators for age, an indicator for being white, indicators for four education groups, and

an indicator for being married. Inclusion of the controls is not expected to affect the estimated

experimental impacts as SIi is randomly assigned. Indeed, the intervention is balanced as shown

in Table 1 and, in practice, dropping the controls has a negligible impact on the experimental effect

point estimates. Rather, we include the controls to increase the precision of the estimates.

       To produce confidence intervals displayed with these results, we cluster standard errors at the

level of the 22 clinics involved in the experiment. When examining individual health, the clustering

of the standard errors may be viewed as too conservative although the group meetings at the

beginning of the intervention may have led to correlated health outcomes among the SI participants

at the same clinic. When we subsequently turn to labor market outcomes, clustering is likely more

relevant as all participants at the same clinic are exposed to the same local labor market shocks.

Since we have relatively few clusters, we use the wild cluster bootstrap to construct confidence

intervals and test statistics (Cameron, Gelbach, and Miller 2008). Our subsequent analysis of the

primary labor market outcomes of interest employ alternate variance estimation methods that are

robust to small numbers of clusters.
  15
    It should be noted that the MRFIT participants had aged six years beyond the sample used to estimate the
coefficients for CHD risk score. The CHD risk scores may no longer reflect actual six-year CHD mortality group for
the sample as it ages, however, the measure remains a time-consistent summary of the effects of the intervention on
key variables.


                                                        13
       The evolution of the average experimental CHD mortality risk differences is shown in Figure 1d.

Each point in this figure represents the coefficient on the intervention indicator from a regression

based on equation (1) where CHD risk for different years is the outcome. The effects of the

intervention on risk scores are largest after one year and decay over time. The coefficients indicate

a relative initial decrease in CHD risk on the order of one-third for the SI group. The experimental

differences fade slightly over the subsequent years, but remain precisely estimated and meaningfully

different across the groups.


3.2      The Impact on Cholesterol

The effect of the intervention on serum cholesterol is displayed in the top two panels of Figure 2.

As shown in Figure 2a, we find that the intervention reduced serum cholesterol by approximately

8 mg/dl with the impact falling slightly in the later years of the experimental period. Figure 2b

displays the estimated intervention effects on serum cholesterol split by the baseline levels used

for the predicted impacts shown in Appendix Table A1. Among participants with baseline serum

cholesterol levels of 220 mg/dl, the intervention reduced serum cholesterol by 10 mg/dl, which is

smaller than the 10% reduction predicted for this group. This effect fades slightly during the last

two experimental years. The intervention significantly also lowered serum cholesterol levels for

those under 220 mg/dl at baseline, although the magnitude of the response is smaller for this group

relative to those with higher serum cholesterol levels at baseline.

       The SI group self-reports a large initial reduction in total daily caloric intake of approximately

300 calories which grows to approximately 350 calories by year three of the experimental period

(Figure 2c). Given the baseline average caloric intake of 2,369 calories, these differentials represent

intake reductions of 12 to 15 percent.16 The calorie reductions remain in this range over the entire

sample period, suggesting long-term food-intake changes for the SI group relative to the UC group.

However, in spite of the large self-reported reduction in calories, the SI group only experiences a

small, but significant, decline in weight of two pounds (Figure 2d). Although this last result suggests

that the SI group may be overstating the extent to which they adhere to their food pattern, the
  16
    Additional results for the food intake categories explicitly targeted by the intervention (saturated fat, polyunsat-
urated fat, dietary cholesterol, and total fat intake) are are displayed in Appendix Figure A1.



                                                          14
serum cholesterol results clearly indicate that the intervention improves cholesterol levels.


3.3   The Impact on Smoking

The estimated impact of the MRFIT intervention on smoking outcomes is displayed in Figure 3.

The effects of the intervention can be seen most pointedly at year one, as shown in the top left panel

of the Figure, where the probability of smoking falls by nearly 20 percentage points or roughly one

third of the baseline smoking population. The experimental effect shrinks over subsequent years

which is due to more-rapidly decreasing smoking rates in the UC group (not shown here). A

similar narrowing of the gap in daily cigarettes smoked also occurs following an initial reduction

of more than 40 percent. The bottom left panel of Figure 3 displays the experimental effect on

serum thiocyanate which is a biomarker for smoking levels. Although thiocyanate is present even

among those who never smoke, its concentrations are dramatically higher among current smokers,

increasing with the intensity of consumption (Hughes et al. 1981). The experimental effect on

serum thiocyanate is negative and immediately apparent in the first year of the experiment and

only exhibits modest amounts of decay over time.

   The bottom right panel of Figure 3 shows the experimental impact on smoking cessation across

the distribution of baseline smoking intensity. The groupings of baseline smoking intensity match

those used for predicting experimental responses shown in Appendix Table A1. The relative de-

crease of over 40 percentage points among the lightest smokers (fewer than 20 cigarettes per day)

is much larger is than the roughly 25 percentage point decline for the heaviest smokers (at least

40 cigarettes per day). This general pattern is in line with the predicted smoking effects described

in Appendix Table A1. While the experimental effect fades for all baseline intensity groups, this

happens most dramatically for the light-smoking group and becomes indistinguishable from the

moderate-smoking effect in later years.


3.4   The Impact on Blood Pressure

Figure 4 shows the impact of the intervention on blood pressure. Baseline diastolic blood pressure

is 91 mm Hg, indicating that the average participant is at the low end of stage 1 hypertension.



                                                 15
As shown in the top left panel, the intervention lowers the SI group’s diastolic blood pressure by

nearly -4.5 mm Hg in year two before decreasing to near -3 mm Hg by year six. Consistent with

the experimental predictions, we find heterogeneous effects when splitting participants by baseline

blood pressure based on Appendix Table A1 (Figure 4b). The intervention successfully lowers blood

pressure levels for those with the highest starting blood pressure although the decrease does not

quite reach the ten percent reduction predicted for this group. Both groups have effects that peak

in the middle years of the study and fade slightly in the later years.

         A similar overall pattern appears in the systolic blood pressure effects displayed in Figure

4c. The treatment effect peaks in size at year two, with a decrease of approximately 7 mm Hg

on a base of 135 mm Hg. Much of these effects is likely driven by variation in the likelihood

of taking hypertension medication over time. At baseline, just under one-fifth of the sample is

taking hypertension medication. Blood pressure medication use is higher for the SI group in all

experimental years, with the relative difference peaking in year two as shown in Figure 4d. At that

point, the differential effectively doubles the medication rate in the SI group relative to baseline

levels.



4         The Impact of MRFIT on Earnings and Family Income

4.1        The Impact of MRFIT on Earnings and Income CDFs

Given the large and sustained impact of the MRFIT intervention on health, we next turn to

investigating the impact on labor market outcomes. We first examine the impact of the intervention

on the discrete earnings and income distributions. We use specifications similar to equation (1) to

measure the effects of the experiment on the discrete CDFs of observed earnings and income. This

approach provides insight into which parts of the earnings and income distributions are affected by

the intervention.

         The top left panel of Figure 5 displays differences at baseline between the SI and UC groups in

1-CDF of earnings.17 That is, we examine the differences between the two experimental groups in
    17
    The results shown in Figure 5 condition on being employed. However, as we show below in section 4.3, the
rates of non-employment at year six in the SI and UC groups are identical. The PDFs for the earnings and income
variables, by experimental group, are shown in Appendix Figure A2.


                                                      16
the fraction of observations at or above a given earnings category. These estimates are generated

from a series of linear probability models similar to equation (1) using an indicator for having

earnings at or above the given category as the outcome and using baseline demographic and health

controls that we include in equation (2). Across most of the distribution, the point estimates are

negative and, in some cases, significant, which indicates that the SI group has slightly lower baseline

earnings than the UC group.

       The impact of the intervention on the 1-CDF of year six earnings is shown in the remaining two

panels of Figure 5. We find a significant impact of the MRFIT intervention on the upper end of the

earnings distribution in year six (Figure 5b). As the inflation rate was high throughout much of the

sample period but the nominal thresholds for the earnings and income categories were the same in

year six as at baseline, much of the distribution shifted into the upper earnings categories in year

six.18 Given that we find that the SI group has slightly lower earnings at baseline, we also present

additional results in which we account for these initial differences by including a set of indicators for

the categorical baseline earnings outcomes.19 As displayed in Figure 5c, the intervention increased

the fraction of individuals in the top three earnings categories after accounting for baseline earnings.

       Figure 6 presents the experimental impact on 1-CDF of family income. The 1-CDF differences at

baseline are not statistically different for the SI and UC groups although all of the point estimates,

except for one in the top left panel, are negative. The top right panel of the Figure shows that

at year six, there is a significant difference between the two experimental groups in three income

categories and is even more pronounced than what we found for earnings.20 The bottom panel

of the Figure finds slightly larger effects on year-six income when including indicators for baseline

family income as controls.
  18
     See the PDF for year six earnings in the upper right panel of Appendix Figure A2.
  19
     These estimates restrict the sample to participants employed both at baseline and year six. We provide a detailed
discussion of sample selection issues in section 4.3. As we discuss below, we believe sample selection has a negligible
impact on our earnings and family income results.
  20
     We discuss possible explanations for differences in the estimated impact between earnings and family income in
section 4.4.




                                                          17
4.2     Quantifying the Impact of MRFIT on Earnings and Income

We next quantify the impact of MRFIT on earnings and family income. To do so, we estimate a

variant of an ordered probit to account for the categorical reporting of these outcomes. In place of

actual earnings or income, inc∗it , we observe incit which contains J categories where


                incit = 1 ⇐⇒ inc∗it ≤ µ1

                incit = j ⇐⇒ µj−1 < inc∗it ≤ µj ∀ j ∈ {2, . . . , J − 1}

                incit = J ⇐⇒ µJ−1 < inc∗it ,


      Assuming that log earnings or log income is normally distributed, we could estimate a standard

ordered probit where the µj , j = 1, . . . , J − 1 are unobserved parameters to be recovered. How-

ever, since we know the actual thresholds for the categorical variables, we can modify the ordered

probit likelihood function to make explicit use of these thresholds rather than estimate the cut-

points.21 Specifically, we assume that the log of earnings (income) is normally distributed and use

the corresponding log cutpoints in estimation.

      The equation we estimate using the modified ordered probit are


                                 log(inc∗it ) = λt + δt SIi + θt Xi + νit ,                           (2)


where inc∗it is (unobserved) earnings or income of participant i in period t, SIi is a binary indicator

which equals one for those in the SI group, Xi are baseline demographic and health controls, and

νit is a normally distributed error term. The baseline demographic controls are the same as we use

to estimate equation (1) while the health controls include continuous baseline measures of serum

cholesterol, diastolic blood pressure, and number of cigarettes smoked as well as an indicator for

being a smoker. The parameter δt is the impact of the intervention on log earnings or log income.

To conduct inference, we cluster at the level of the clinic. As we only have 22 clinics in our sample,

we use the procedure developed by Kline and Santos (2012), analogous to a wild cluster bootstrap,
 21
    In MRFIT, for both earnings and income, J=9 and and the thresholds are $4200, $7200, $10,000, $12,000,
$15,000, $18,000, $22,500, and $35,000. These thresholds are the same at baseline and at year six.




                                                    18
for M-estimators.


4.3      Sample Selection

Issues involving sample selection arise in three possible ways in our analysis: attrition between

baseline and year six, non-employment, and missing data. Table 2 shows the share of observations

that are dropped from the analysis for each reason, both at baseline and at year six, and does so

separately for the SI and UC groups. We show these rates separately for the earnings and family

income analysis both because family income is non-zero even when the participant is not employed

and because there are slightly different rates of missing data for earnings and family income.

       The first two panels of Table 2 show the share of observations dropped from the baseline

earnings and family income regressions. As shown in Panel A, roughly four percent of observations

are dropped from the baseline earnings regressions in both the SI and UC groups. The rate of

missing earnings data due to non-employment at baseline is extremely low, although this can be

explained, at least in part, by the age restrictions on the MRFIT sample which limited participants

to ages with the highest employment rates. Information on labor force status at baseline is rather

limited which may also contribute to the high reported employment rates.22 The fact that the rates

of sample selection at baseline are almost identical across the experimental groups is not surprising

as participants learn the results of the assignment to the SI or UC group after the baseline interview

that collects labor force information. As shown in Panel B, the only source of sample selection for

the baseline family income analysis is missing data as the non-employed reside in households with

positive family income. Given these results, we do not account for sample selection in our analysis

of baseline earnings and family income.

       As shown in the bottom two panels of Table 2, a much higher share of observations are dropped

from the year six regressions. However, the overall rates of dropped observations from the earnings

regressions, at roughly 29.5%, is essentially the same for the SI and UC groups (Panel C). The
  22
    Labor force status at baseline is determined from a question in which participants are asked whether they have
two or more jobs to which they can provide one of three answers: yes, no, or retired. Thus, the non-employed are
those who state that they are retired. In fact, the majority of those classified as having missing data in Panel A are
those who do not respond to this labor force question. If we were to treat all of these observations as non-employed,
the rates of non-employment are still quite low at baseline.




                                                         19
rate of attrition by year six is 9.8% in the SI group and is 11.6% in the UC group.23 These

attrition rates are substantially lower than what is found in a standard longitudinal dataset used

in economic research. For example, Zabel (1998) finds that roughly 25% of participants in the

nationally-representative portion of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics leave the sample by the

sixth year of the study. The non-employment rate at year six of those who remain in MRFIT

is 10.2% and is identical for the SI and UC groups.24 The share of observations dropped due to

missing data of 9.4% is slightly higher for the SI group than the 7.7% rate for the UC group. The

total share of observations dropped from the year six family income regressions (Panel D) are very

close for the SI and UC groups with slight differences in the rates being dropped for attrition and

missing data.

       Applying the standard approach to modeling sample selection in economics (e.g., Heckman

1979), the selection equation is

                                             s∗i = πt SIi + ωt Wi + it ,                                             (3)

where the observed selection indicator, si , equals one if s∗i > 0 and equals zero otherwise. Since

we have three different mechanisms for selection, in general using a single selection equation is

not appropriate. Moreover, finding one, much less three, valid exclusion restrictions in order to

estimate the corresponding system of equations is quite challenging.

       However, if we are willing to assume that two of the three sources of selection are (conditionally)

random, then we can account for the remaining form of selection with a single equation. For

example, many studies using longitudinal data do not account explicitly for sample attrition, even

among studies with dramatically higher rates of attrition than are found in MRFIT. Similarly,

the rates of missing data in MRFIT are dramatically lower than in the Current Population Survey

where in recent years nearly one-third of earnings observations for employed individuals are missing
  23
     The differential attrition rates by year six are not due to differential mortality for the SI and UI groups. Seven
years after the beginning of the intervention, mortality was slightly higher for the SI group although this difference was
statistically insignificant (MRFIT Research Group 1982). Mortality was lower for the SI group when measured ten
years and again sixteen years after the intervention although both these differences were only marginally significant
(MRFIT Research Group 1990, 1996).
  24
     The question eliciting employment status at year six provides far more detail than the corresponding question
at baseline. Respondents are asked “What is your present job status?” to which they can respond either “working
full-time,” “working part-time,” or “unemployed.” Those giving the final option as a response are given a follow-up
question to determine whether they are laid off, disabled, retired, or other.



                                                           20
and subsequently imputed (Stephens and Unayama 2015). In these instances, researchers routinely

treat sample selection as (conditionally) random by not modeling sample attrition, by using imputed

values, or by dropping observations with imputed data.25

       We can account for non-employment in multiple ways. Lee (2009) develops a method for

bounding the impact of a binary treatment when the outcome of interest is subject to sample

selection. If sample selection is based on a single index as in equation (3) and if whether a participant

works, as a function of treatment assignment, is consistent with a monotonicity assumption, then

bounds on the treatment effect can be constructed by trimming the highest and lowest outcomes

in the treatment group with the larger share of positively selected observations.26 If we treat

attrition and missing data as random and then apply Lee’s method, the fact that the rates of

non-employment at year six are essentially identical for the SI and UC groups means that there are

very few observations to trim when estimating the proposed bounds.27 Thus, the resulting bounds

on the treatment effect would differ very little from estimated treatment effect.

       Non-employment at year six occurs for many reasons: just over half of the non-employed are

retired, nearly 30% are either temporary or permanently disabled, and the remainder give other

reasons including being laid off. The different factors that drive these multiple dimensions of non-

employment may invalidate the single index function approach to sample selection required for

applying Lee’s bounding method. Alternatively, as shown in Figure 7, there is an important age

component to the reason for non-employment in MRFIT.28 While rates of attrition and missing

data are fairly constant by baseline age, the rate of non-employment rises sharply for older MRFIT
  25
      Results from estimating a logit to predict who remains in the sample in year six show that those in better baseline
health, who are better educated, and who are married are more likely to appear in year six. However, we do not
find that experimental status is not quite marginally significant (p-value=0.101). Thus, below we present earnings
and income estimates which include controls for these baseline health and demographic characteristics to account for
attrition along these dimensions.
   26
      As Lee notes, the treatment effect that is bounded is for the specific sub-group that is always positively selected
regardless of treatment status. In our context, this effect is the impact of MRFIT on earnings for the sub-population
that would be employed regardless of being assigned to either the SI or UC group.
   27
      In the simple case where we ignore covariates and treat attrition and missing year six earnings as random, the
trimming proportion, which is the fraction of positively selected observations that need to be trimmed 0.0011. That
amounts to trimming 0.1%, or five, observations before computing the upper and lower bounds.
   28
      Although MRFIT participants were initially screened to fall between ages 35 and 57, inclusive, the baseline
ages used in Figure 7 are from the third screening visit at which time baseline earnings, income, and employment
information was collected. Hence, some participants may have had a birthday in the intervening period which is why
the oldest age displayed in Figure 7 is 58.




                                                           21
participants.29 The year six non-employment rates are highest for those who are ages 56 and older

at baseline as these participants reached the Social Security early retirement age by year six. Thus,

we also present results in which we limit the sample to those that are age 48 and under at baseline,

for whom the rates of non-employment do not exceed seven percent, in order focus on an exogenous

subset of the sample for which non-employment is a minor issue.

    Before turning to the earnings and income results, we briefly note the impact of the intervention

on basic labor force outcomes at year six which we estimate using equation (1). Since MRFIT

participants were ages 35 to 57 at baseline, the vast majority of participants are still in their working

years at year six with an 88 percent employment rate for the UC group. The intervention has no

effect on employment at this horizon as the estimated impact is statistically and substantively zero.

A small minority (5.9 percent) of UC participants are retired by year six and there is no significant

difference in retirement status due to the intervention. Of those who are employed, 97 percent in

both groups are working full-time and there is no significant difference in this outcome. Moreover,

while 60 percent of working UC participants report a change in job title or kind of work over the

study period, this rate of job change is not significantly different than what we find for the SI

group.30


4.4    Earnings and Family Income Estimates

Estimates of the impact of MRFIT on earnings and family income using equation (2) are shown in

Table 3. Since we are modelling the impact on the log of the outcome of interest, we can interpret

the coefficient as the percentage effect on the outcome due to treatment assignment. The estimated

effects on earnings are shown in Panel A of Table 3. When we include only the treatment indicator

in estimating equation (2) for baseline earnings (column (1) of Table 3), we find that those in the

SI group have slightly lower earnings, consistent with the results shown in Figure 5.31 Including
  29
     The rate of missing data does decline slightly with age although the high rates of non-employment for these older
individuals reduces the share of them that can be at risk for having missing earnings data.
  30
     These results on year six labor force outcomes are based on linear regressions using equation (1) which include
baseline health and demographics as controls. The estimate effects for being in the SI group are: employment
β = 0.003 (p-value=0.645), retirement β = 0.003 (p-vaue = 0.603), full-time employment conditional on being
employed β = −0.0004 (p-value=0.918),and job change β = −0.001 (p-value = 0.946).
  31
     In Table 3 we report, in brackets, p-values for the test of the null hypothesis that the parameter equals zero based
on the Kline-Santos procedure for conducting inference when using a limited number of clusters with a non-linear
estimator.


                                                           22
baseline health and demographic controls (column (2)) shrinks the estimated difference in baseline

earnings between the experimental groups.

       The next three columns of Table 3 show the impact of the intervention on earnings at year six.

When only a treatment indicator is included (column (3)), we find that earnings are roughly two

percent higher for the SI group, a difference which has a p-value of 0.025. However, as we have seen,

there is a small difference in baseline earnings between the SI and UC groups. When we also include

a complete set of indicators for the baseline earnings outcome (column (4)), the estimated impact of

the intervention on earnings rises to 2.7 percent with a p-value of 0.011. Further including baseline

health and demographic controls (column (5)) increases the estimated effect to 3.1 percent with an

even lower p-value.32 Thus, the MRFIT intervention has a significant impact on the earnings of

the SI group.

       The intervention effects on family income are shown in Panel B of Table 3. As shown in column

(1), baseline family income is slightly lower for the SI group but this difference is not statistically

significant, a finding which remains with the inclusion of baseline health and demographic charac-

teristics. At year six (column (3)), family income is 3.5 percent larger for the SI group and this

finding is highly statistically significant. Including controls for baseline family income categories

raises this estimate to 3.9 percent and including baseline health and demography controls further

raises it to 4.1 percent.

       One possible reason why the impact on family income is larger than that on earnings is that,

recalling that the earnings measure is for the participants’ main job, the intervention induces effects

on the participants’ earnings beyond their main jobs. Using responses to the year six question “Do

you presently work for 2 or more employers?” we find that 9.6% of workers in the SI group answer

affirmatively while 8.6% of those in the UC group do so. However, this difference is not statistically

significant (p-value=0.152) and the one percentage point gap in having a second employer between

the groups is too small to explain the difference in the earnings and family income estimates.

Another possibility is that these changes are the result of intrahousehold reallocation of time and

resources, as in Thirumurthy, Graff Zivin, and Goldstein (2008), or they could reflect improved
  32
    In year six earnings and income regressions where we condition on baseline health and demographics, we also
require respondents to have non-missing year six health characteristics.



                                                      23
health and earnings of other household members. Given that wives were to be heavily involved in

the intervention itself, this latter explanation is certainly possible although no information on the

work effort of spouses was collected.

    The final column of Table 3 limits the sample to those age 48 and under at baseline. As

discussed in Section 4.3, non-employment at year six is a very limited concern for this subset of

participants. As we see in Panel A, the estimated impact of the intervention on earnings for this

subset is only slightly smaller than that of the full sample. As shown in Panel B, the estimated

impact on family income falls from 4% to 3% when we limit the sample to this younger subset

of participants. However, since our family income estimates are not affected by non-employment,

the observed decline in this estimated parameter is due to the age restriction rather than sample

selection issues. These results, along with our earlier discussion of Lee’s bounding method, suggest

that our main results are not substantively affected by selection due to non-employment.


4.5    Earnings Impacts by Baseline Health

We next examine the heterogeneity in the impact on earnings by baseline health characteristics.33

We use the same categorizations that compose the predicted health impacts shown in Appendix

Table A1 in order to delineate baseline health.34 We use specifications analogous to those shown

in column (5) of Table 3 which include baseline earnings, health, and demographics as controls. As

we find little evidence that non-employment impacts our estimates in Table 3, we do not account

for sample selection in estimating the heterogeneity in the earnings impacts by baseline health.

    The results are presented in Figure 8. Each panel of the figure shows the results from a different

regression.35 As such, we do not estimate the impact of the intervention by jointly including each

baseline health characteristic but rather do so separately for each health characteristic. The top

left panel of Figure 8 finds a three percent earnings impact for the high cholesterol group that is
  33
     The estimated heterogeneity of the impacts on family income are qualitatively similar to those found for earnings
and are not reported here. These results are available from the authors.
  34
     The one exception is for serum cholesterol. Since only 16% of participants are below under 220 mg/dl at baseline,
we raise the threshold to under 240 mg/dl for the earnings regressions at which point roughly one-third of participants
are below the threshold.
  35
     Following the discussion by Cameron and Miller (2015), each 95% wild cluster bootstrap confidence interval
shown in Figure 8 is the set of candidate null hypotheses for which the p-value of the test of that null hypothesis
equals or exceeds 0.05.



                                                          24
statistically significant. The impact for the low cholesterol group is nearly identical to that of the

high cholesterol group and we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the treatment effect is the

same for those with low and high cholesterol at baseline (p-value=0.932). We also find that the

impact by baseline blood pressure, shown in the center of the top row of Figure 8, is essentially the

same for both blood pressure groups (p-value=0.654).

    The impact by baseline smoking status is shown in the top right corner of Figure 8. The

left two estimates show the earnings impacts by whether or not the participant was a smoker at

baseline. While the estimated impact is over two percentage points greater for non-smokers than for

smokers, the difference in the earnings impact between smokers and non-smokers is not statistically

significant (p-value=0.241). The estimated impact for smokers hides some interesting differences

across groups defined by the baseline daily number of cigarettes smoked. We also estimate a

specification in which we allowed the impact on earnings to depend upon whether the individual

is a non-smoker, smoked less than twenty cigarettes daily, smoked twenty to thirty-nine cigarettes

daily, or smoked forty or more cigarettes per day. As shown in the top right corner of Figure

8, we find a large and significant effect of the intervention on the earnings of light smokers (less

than twenty cigarettes per day), while the effect of the intervention diminishes as the number of

cigarettes smoked at baseline increases. Moreover, the test of the null hypothesis that the impact

of the intervention on earnings is the same for all three groups of smokers is marginally significant

(p-value=0.053). We cannot reject, however, that the impact is the same for non-smokers and light

smokers.

    We also examine the earnings impact by baseline CHD mortality risk quartile. The estimated

impacts are roughly three and a half percent for the first through third quartiles. The estimated

earnings impact for the highest quartile is less than two percent and is statistically insignificant.

However, despite these patterns, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the earnings impact by

is the same across all CHD mortality risk quantiles (p-value=0.605).36 In addition, recall that a

condition for being enrolled in MRFIT is to have high CHD risk relative to the broader population

so that the results need to be interpreted in this context. That is, among individuals with relatively
  36
     However, we can reject the null hypothesis that the treatment effects for the four quantiles all equal zero (p-
value=0.045).



                                                        25
high CHD mortality risk, the point estimates suggest that the intervention raised the earnings for

everyone except those with the highest CHD mortality risk.

       Finally, we examine the earnings impact by baseline BMI across three groups: normal weight,

overweight, and obese.37 The intervention raises earnings by three percent for overweight and by

five percent for obese individuals.38 The impact on the earnings of normal weight individuals is less

than one percent. However, we are unable to reject the hypothesis that the effects are the same for

all three groups defined by BMI (p-value=0.223).


4.6      Earnings Impacts by Baseline Occupation Characteristics

We also examine whether the impact of the intervention on earnings varies systematically with

occupational characteristics. Participant occupation information was collected both at baseline and

at year six and was coded using the 1970 Census three-digit occupation classification system. Not

surprisingly, we find that baseline earnings are higher for white collar workers relative to both blue

collar workers and farm/service sector workers.39 We estimate that the intervention increases year

six earnings by over four percent for white collar workers, a finding which is statistically significant.

The intervention increases earnings by less than one percent for blue collar workers. However, we

cannot reject the null hypothesis that the treatment effects are equal across occupation groups,

although when comparing just white collar and blue collar workers the difference is marginally

significant.40

       In addition, we examine whether the earnings impact differs by the routine and non-routine task

content of occupations using the methodology of Autor, Levy, and Murnane (2003) to define task
  37
     We follow standard BMI based classifications in defining participants to be normal weight (18.5 ≤ BMI < 25),
overweight (25 ≤ BMI < 30), and obese (BMI ≥ 30). Roughly half of participants are classified as overweight at
baseline with roughly a quarter of participants falling into each of the other two groups. Very few participants in
MRFIT are classified as underweight (BMI < 18.5) and they are placed in the normal weight group for our analysis.
  38
     Our specification includes main effects for the BMI categories in addition to the interactions of the BMI categories
with experimental group assignment.
  39
     We use standard classification schemes based on the 1970 Census three-digit occupation system to defined white
collar workers (occupation code less than 400), blue collar (occupation codes greater than 400 but less than 800),
and farm/service workers (occupation code greater than 800).
  40
     The p-value for the test of the joint null hypothesis that the impact of the intervention is the same for all three
occupation groups is 0.135. The p-value for the test of the joint null hypothesis that the impact is the same for blue
and white collar workers is 0.054. Results by occupation group are not reported in tables but are available from the
authors by request.




                                                           26
content.41 We find that baseline earnings increase with higher levels of an occupation’s non-routine

cognitive tasks (proxied by quantitative reasoning, and direction, control, and planning of tasks) and

(insignificantly with) non-routine manual tasks (eye-hand-foot coordination) and with lower levels

of an occupation’s routine manual tasks (finger dexterity) and routine cognitive tasks (set limits,

tolerances, or standards). However, we do not find any strong evidence that interactions between

the intervention and the task content of occupations affect year six earnings as these interactions

are jointly insignificant while only the finger dexterity dimension is marginal significant.42


4.7    The Impact of MRFIT on Work-Related Health Outcomes

Our results indicate that the MRFIT intervention not only improved health outcomes but also

increased the earnings and family income of the SI group. However, while there is some sugges-

tive evidence that the intervention has heterogeneous earnings impacts associated with baseline

characteristics, none of the differences we examine are statistically significant. Thus, the exact

mechanism(s) through which the improved health raises earnings and income is unclear.

   The canonical framework for understanding the relationship between health and earnings is

Grossman’s (1972) model. In this framework, investments in health raise one’s stock of health

capital but do not increase worker productivity (i.e., human capital). However, more health capital

increases the amount of healthy time that one is able to devote to various tasks, most notably

market work, and thereby provides a link between health improvements and market earnings.

While we lack exact measures of worker productivity (e.g., hourly wages) and non-health human

capital (aside from educational attainment), MRFIT participants are asked about changes in their

health and labor market outcomes over the past year at baseline as well as at each of the first five

annual interviews. We examine two of these questions which shed some light on the mechanisms

described by Grossman.

   The first question is “Within the past 12 months, have you experienced a physical illness which

kept you in bed for a week or more, or sent you to the hospital?” The top panel of Figure 9 shows the
  41
     We use male occupation specific task content based on the 1977 Dictionary of Occu-
pational Titles linked to the 1970 Census codes from Autor, Levy, and Murnane found at
http://economics.mit.edu/faculty/dautor/data/autlevmurn03.          For twelve occupation codes used in MRFIT
but not found in the Autor et al. data, we use values averaged over from the same occupation subgroup.
  42
     Task content results are not reported in tables but are available from the authors.


                                                     27
impact of the intervention responses to this question for the SI group using equation (1) in which

baseline health and demographics are included as controls. While there is no difference in the

response to this question at baseline, the SI group is significantly less likely to report an affirmative

answer in four of the five experimental waves in which the question is asked. Cumulatively, 44

percent of the UC group report an affirmative answer to this question at least one time during the

first five years of the experimental period while the SI group is 2.3 percentage points less likely to

do so, a difference that is statistically significant.43

         The second question is “Within the past 12 months, have you experienced not being able to work

because of a disability?” The bottom panel of Figure 9 examines whether the respondent reported

experiencing a work-limiting disability. We find that respondents in the SI group experience 15

to 30 percent lower rates of disabilities that prevent work during the experimental period with

these differences being significant for years two through four. Cumulatively, 15.5 percent of the UC

group report being unable to work at least one time during the first five years of the experimental

period while the SI group is 1.7 percentage points less likely to do so (although this difference is

marginally significant). Interestingly, over two-thirds of participants who give a positive response

to this question only do so one time which suggests that many of these reported work preventing

disabilities are transitory. Indeed, as we have noted above, there is no significant difference in

employment rates at year six between the two treatment groups which further suggests that these

periods of disability are mainly transitory. Overall, the findings from these two questions indicate

decreased rates of illness and injury for the SI group.



5         Discussion

This paper examines the labor market effects of a randomized health intervention of working-age

men which was focused on reducing mortality due to coronary heart disease, the leading cause of

death in the United States. MRFIT succeeded in improving the health of the Special Intervention

group along several dimensions. We find that the intervention also significantly increased earnings

by three percent and family income by four percent with no concurrent effect on labor force par-
    43
    These results are conditional on responding to the fifth annual interview. The estimated cumulative difference is
regression adjusted based on equation (1).


                                                         28
ticipation. Although there is some sample attrition and labor force exit, we find that accounting

for sample selection has no substantive impact on our results. Our findings suggest that there may

be differential impacts on earnings for groups defined by baseline health and occupational charac-

teristics although these differences are only statistically significant in the case of baseline smoking.

We further show that a partial explanation for the effect of health on earnings is an increase in the

availability of healthy time for market work. This finding is consistent with the basic prediction of

the seminal model of Grossman (1972).

       It is unlikely, given the magnitude of these results, that this increase in healthy time alone is

enough to explain the three percent earnings increase due to the intervention. While the avail-

able data constrain the number of other potential mechanisms we can examine, results presented

throughout this paper allow us to examine the roles of some mechanisms that appear to have lim-

ited effects. First, the weight loss of the SI group may represent an increase in their attractiveness,

which previous research has shown to be rewarded in the labor market (Hamermesh and Biddle

1994). However, Figure 2 panel (d) shows that the relative weight loss is only two-to-three pounds

(on a base of 189 pounds), which we consider to be too small to represent meaningful increases in

attractiveness that would generate the observed higher earnings.44 Second, other observed labor

market outcomes do not appear to be driving the results because, as discussed at the end of Sec-

tion 4.3, there are not meaningful differences in employment or retirement between the two study

groups. Results in that section also show that the share of participants experiencing a change in

job title or kind of work is the same across the groups, so there is little reason to believe that

the effects are driven by promotions or career advancement for the SI group. Finally, while the

analyses in Sections 4.5 and 4.6 suggest larger effects for blue collar workers, participants with

higher levels of baseline BMI, and participants with lower levels of baseline smoking, we are not

able to statistically distinguish the effects for these groups from the effects for their complements.

Ultimately, there are surely additional mechanisms that we are unable to examine, but our results

indicate that the flow of healthy time is at least one contributing factor to the earnings and family

income differences that we observe.
  44
    There was slightly greater weight loss among participants who were obese at baseline, a group that had larger
estimated earnings effects as shown in panel (e) of Figure 8. Still, average relative weight loss for the SI group among
the obese was only four to five pounds.


                                                          29
   If better health capital indeed improves labor market outcomes through a greater flow of healthy

time, we might also expect to see effects over the entire course of MRFIT. Almost all measures

of health capital improve by year one of the study and change over the subsequent five years. A

fully dynamic analysis would relate these changes over time to health working time and earnings,

which could differentiate between possible relationships between the interventions and labor market

outcomes. It is possible that the health changes at year one represent improvements in health capital

that immediately bring about a greater flow of available working time and, ultimately, earnings.

Alternatively, the relevant dimensions of health capital could evolve slowly as healthier behaviors are

maintained throughout the duration of the study. This would deliver gradual increases in healthy

time and corresponding gradual increases in earnings. Finally, a dynamic analysis might reveal

increases in earnings and income that are not associated with healthy working time at all. Such a

finding would suggest other mechanisms and aspects of health lead to greater income and earnings.

Unfortunately, the data limitations prevent us from further exploring the relationship between

health, healthy time, and economic outcomes throughout the intervention period as earnings and

family income are only available at baseline and at year six.

   Much of the development literature on health and economic outcomes explores the role that

health plays in changing other measures of human capital. In US data, the model of Restuccia

and Vandenbroucke (2013) suggests that life expectancy gains over the last half-century were re-

sponsible for a quarter of the increase in education over the same period. Extending this logic to

MRFIT, it is possible that the SI group is not more productive due to health improvements but

simply accumulates more human capital in anticipation of lower future mortality. The endogenous

relationship between longevity and human capital, including health, is further highlighted in the

model of Ehrlich and Chuma (1990). If large adjustments to human capital or other behaviors are

at play, the results presented in this paper would not indicate the effect of health on labor market

outcomes. However, there are a number of reasons to think that this is unlikely in our context.

First, men in the age range of MRFIT are relatively less likely to make human capital adjustments

than, say, school-aged individuals. Second, if human capital is already optimized with respect to

health, changes to health will only induce second-order effects on human capital and earnings, as

argued by Bleakley (2010). If a MRFIT participant has already optimized his level of human capital

                                                  30
as a function of market forces and health, the envelope theorem would imply that innovations to

health should not produce first-order effects on earnings through human capital re-optimization.

On the other hand, direct effects of health on productivity, particularly for individuals who are

constrained by the flow of healthy time, could induce first order impacts on earnings. Finally, prior

research finds that the impact of MRFIT on mortality was generally small, with no detectable ef-

fects on mortality measured seven years after the intervention began and only marginally-significant

effects at the ten and sixteen year marks (Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial Research Group,

1982, 1990, 1996). While it is possible that perceptions of increased longevity may have induced

relatively large changes in the non-health behavior of the SI group, these perceptions would have

not matched the realized gains in longevity.

   Ultimately, we find that MRFIT raised earnings and family income for the SI group relative

to the UC group. We identify reduced time lost to disability and illness as a possible mechanism

underlying this effect. As heart disease remains the leading cause of death in the United States

and the health dimensions addressed by MRFIT continue to be public health concerns today, our

findings are highly relevant for the current relationship between health and the US labor market.

While the available data preclude us from studying all other possible mechanisms, our findings

and the context suggest that other mechanisms, like individuals’ attractiveness or human capital

adjustment, are less likely. As such, we interpret our findings as demonstrating positive direct

effects of health on earnings and family income.

Notes: This table reports ordered probit estimates in which the cutpoints are known and the unobserved latent out-
come is assumed to be log normally distributed. The baseline health and demographic controls are serum cholesterol,
diastolic blood pressure, number of cigarettes smoked, an indicator for being a smoker, a full set of indicators for age,
an indicator for being white, indicators for four education groups, and a marital status indicator. The baseline out-
come controls used for the year six outcomes in columns (4)-(6) are a set of indicators for the corresponding outcome
at baseline. The earnings regressions are restricted to those who are employed for the relevant survey waves. Column
(6) further restricts to participants who were 48 or younger at baseline. The outcomes are nine-group categorical
earnings and income measures with cut points at $4200, $7200, $10,000, $12,000, $15,000, $18,000, $22,500, and
$35,000. Kline-Santos wild cluster bootstrap p-values for the null that the parameter is equal to 0 are reported in
brackets clustering at the clinic level.

Notes: See the text and Neaton et al. (1981) for the calculation of CHD mortality risk. Risk score levels are calculated using observed risk factors in each
year. The densities are smoothed with an Epanechnikov kernel. Treatment effect estimates are the estimated coefficients on an indicator for being in the
SI group from linear regressions of the form of equation(1). The regression controls include a full set of indicators for age, an indicator for being white,
indicators for four education groups, and a marital status indicator. The 95% confidence interval bars shown in the bottom left panel are from using a wild
cluster bootstrap which clusters at the clinic level.

19 or fewer cigarettes per day, while heavy smokers are those who self-report 40 or more cigarettes per day. In Panel (e), normal weight is defined as BMI
< 25 and obese is defined as BMI ≥ 30. The 95 percent wild cluster bootstrap confidence interval bars contain the set of candidate null hypotheses for
which the p-value of the test of that null hypothesis equals or exceeds 0.05.. The regressions include baseline health and demographic controls: linear serum
cholesterol, linear diastolic blood pressure, number of cigarettes smoked, an indicator for being a smoker, a full set of indicators for age, an indicator for
being white, indicators for four education groups, and a marital status indicator. The regressions further include a full set of indicators for baseline earnings
categories. Because BMI does not appear in the general set of controls used throughout this paper, indicators for baseline BMI group are also included in
the regression for Panel (e).

Notes: Each point is coefficient from a different regression of the form of equation (1). The 95% confidence interval
bars are from using a wild cluster bootstrap which clusters at the clinic level. The regressions include baseline health
and demographic controls: serum cholesterol, diastolic blood pressure, number of cigarettes smoked, an indicator for
being a smoker, a full set of indicators for age, an indicator for being white, indicators for four education groups, and
a marital status indicator.

Notes: Sourced from Sherwin et al. (1981, Table 1). The Table presents the percentage changes in key CHD risk
factors anticipated by MRFIT organizers as a function of baseline levels of the risk factors. The predicted serum
cholesterol effects were informed by experimental results from the National Diet-Heart Study, the New York Anti-
Coronary Club, and the Chicago Coronary Prevention Evaluation Program. The diastolic blood pressure predictions
were informed by the Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program. Anticipated effects of the anti-smoking
intervention were less firm but were informed by prior studies suggesting that greater percentage reductions were
possible among lighter smokers (Sherwin et al., 1981).
