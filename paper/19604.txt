The Home Front: Rent Control and the Rapid Wartime Increase in Home Ownership

                                              ABSTRACT

The US home ownership rate rose by 10 percentage points between 1940 and 1945, about half the
size of the net change over the 20th century, despite severe restrictions on construction during World
War II. I present evidence that wartime rent control played an important role in this shift. The empirical
test exploits features of the central authority's method of imposing rent control, which generated variation
in the frozen level of rents for cities that had seen similar increases in rents prior to control. Greater
rent reductions at the onset of rent control were associated with greater increases in home ownership
over the first half of the 1940s. This relationship is not driven by differential trends in housing demand
or other unobserved factors potentially correlated with variation in rent reductions. The results imply
that if maximum rents had been set at their peak pre-control level rather than at a lower level, the increase
in home ownership would have been 10 percent smaller. Combined with new data showing rapid house
price appreciation during the war, this result suggests that 10 percent is a lower bound on the share
of the "wartime" increase in home ownership that rent control can explain.

1        Introduction
              ...many a landlord is deciding that it is better to sell at the inflated market price than
          to rent at a fixed ceiling price. The ceiling on rents, therefore, means that an increasing
          fraction of all housing is being put on the market for owner-occupancy, and that rentals
          are becoming almost impossible to find, at least at the legal rents.

                              – Milton Friedman and George J. Stigler, Roofs or Ceilings? (1946)


        The mid-20th century increase in home ownership in the United States is often framed as a

post-World War II change, associated with surging construction of new housing in suburban areas

(e.g., Jackson, 1985). The years from 1945 to 1960 indeed saw home ownership rise rapidly. Yet in-

tercensal survey estimates suggest that the home ownership rate increased by 10 percentage points

between 1940 and 1945, slightly more than the postwar rise from 1945 to 1960. The timing of

this increase is seemingly incongruous with differences in housing supply between the wartime and

postwar periods: in contrast to the high elasticity of postwar construction, residential construction

was severely restricted during the war. This paper investigates one of the largest government inter-

ventions in housing markets during the 1940s – wartime and postwar rent control – and illuminates

its role in this “wartime” rise in home ownership.

        World War II saw the most widespread imposition of rent control in the history of the United

States. Roughly 80 percent of the 1940 rental housing stock lay in areas that the federal government

put under rent control between 1941 and 1946. At the same time, sales prices were not controlled.

Many observers at the time, including Friedman and Stigler (1946), argued that rent control led

to higher rates of home ownership as landlords chose to sell at uncontrolled prices rather than

continuing to rent out their properties at the controlled price. Consistent with this story, a large

share of the wartime increase in home ownership came from the same dwellings shifting from renter-

to owner-occupancy.1 But most contemporary arguments on the importance of rent control were

based solely on aggregate national trends, even though many other factors – such as rising income

and savings or increasing marginal tax rates – could have played a role in the observed shift in
    1
    Given the link between tenure and structure type – Glaeser and Shapiro (2003) show that in modern data most
single family detached units are owner-occupied and most multifamily units are renter-occupied – it is useful to note
that in 1940 about 43 percent of single-family detached units were renter-occupied (by 1950, only 27 percent of single
family detached units were renter-occupied). It was certainly true, however, that most owner-occupier households in
1940 – about 84 percent – lived in single family detached housing.

housing tenure.

   An empirical test of the hypothesis that wartime rent control increased home ownership is

complicated by the fact that nearly all urban areas were placed under rent control during the war.

To overcome this challenge, I leverage local-level variation in the severity of rent control at the

time it was imposed, generated by the central authority’s method of determining rent reductions.

The empirical test compares cities with similar increases in rents prior to control, but different

reductions in rent when control was imposed. The key idea is illustrated in Figure 1. On the date

when rent control was imposed in each city (the right vertical line), the maximum legal rent for

each dwelling was set at its level on the city’s ‘base’ date (the left vertical line). The spirit of the

test is to draw comparisons like that between Baltimore and Buffalo and to avoid comparisons like

that between Baltimore and Boston, since Boston’s low severity of control was most likely due to

lesser growth of housing demand. Conditioning on the degree of rent appreciation before control, I

use the implied reduction in rents from their pre-control levels to their base date levels as variation

in the initial severity of rent control, and test whether cities in which rent control was more severe

at imposition saw greater increases in home ownership over the first half of the 1940s.

   To implement this test, I compile a dataset of 51 cities for which the National Industrial Con-

ference Board (NICB) had begun publishing a monthly rent index by March 1940, and link the

data on rents to newly digitized records from intercensal housing surveys carried out by the Census

Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) between 1944 and 1946. The results provide

evidence that rent control did increase home ownership. A 2.5 percentage point greater reduction

in rents relative to their maximum pre-control levels at the time control was imposed – roughly a

standard deviation in the sample cities – was associated with roughly a 1 percentage point greater

increase in home ownership between 1940 and the city’s survey date.

   Spillover of excess demand from the rental to the sales market also raises the possibility that

rent control had significant effects on house price appreciation over the war. Because of the scarcity

of data, house prices over this period have been seldom studied, especially in a sample of more than

a few cities. To shed light on how rent control may have influenced them, I use new data on home

asking price appreciation between April 1940 and September 1945, obtained from records at the



                                                   2
National Archives. Specifications similar to those used for the main results suggest that greater

initial severity of rent control also led to greater house price appreciation: a standard deviation

greater reduction in rents was associated with a 10 percentage point greater rise in home asking

prices.

   The identifying assumption in the main specification is that conditional on pre-control rent

appreciation, the rent reduction at the time of control was unrelated to unobserved city trends

also driving differential changes in home ownership. Three complementary approaches support the

validity of this assumption. The first approach isolates more transparent variation in how rent

reductions were determined. Conditional on the degree of rent appreciation prior to control, the

implied rent reduction for a city depended on the combination of the central authority’s choice of

base date and the timing of rent increases in that city. Base dates in the initial wave of rent control

imposition were typically city-specific, and meant to pre-date rent increases that the administering

agency judged to have been caused by defense activities. Most areas controlled in the second wave,

however, were set to a common “default” base date, thus generating variation in severity associated

only with the precise timing of rent increases. I show that the severity result holds in the subsample

of second-wave cities as well, and further show using “placebo” base dates that conditional on

rent appreciation prior to control, the timing of rent increases is unlikely to have been related to

underlying trends driving home ownership. The second approach is to introduce additional controls

related to trends in other factors that may have increased home ownership. I show that the main

results cannot be explained by cities with initially more severe rent control having greater increases

in income or savings, greater increases in benefits from the tax treatment of owner-occupied housing,

different expectations of future city growth, or greater declines in home ownership over the 1930s.

The final approach supports the argument by using an entirely different source of variation – the

timing of imposition of control across cities – to assess whether it also offers evidence consistent

with rent control encouraging home ownership. In a new dataset on newspaper advertisements, I

show suggestive evidence that the imposition of control led to a differential increase in the number

of ads for home sales, with little evidence of differential pre-control trends.

   The results imply that if maximum rents in all cities had been set at their peak pre-control



                                                   3
levels when control was imposed, rather than actually reduced in some cities, the increase in home

ownership in the sample cities over the first half of the 1940s would have been 10 percent smaller.

The rapid house price appreciation observed in the years after control was imposed suggests that

rent control still would have created disincentives for renting out properties even if maximum rents

had been set at their peak pre-control levels, however – in the absence of control, growing demand

would have continued to push up rents. For this reason, this thought experiment is likely to

underestimate the overall importance of rent control, suggesting that 10 percent is a reasonable

lower-bound estimate of the share of the increase in urban home ownership that rent control can

explain.

    A first contribution of this paper is to our understanding of the rise of home ownership in the

United States in the mid-20th century. Most work on this shift has focused on forces that increased

home ownership in the postwar era, when the metropolitan population increasingly suburbanized

and new housing was supplied elastically.2 The recent economics literature has not generally noted

the increase in home ownership before the end of World War II. Unlike the postwar increase, the

wartime increase in home ownership requires an explanation that takes into account the inelastic

supply of structures during the war, and hence accounts for the decisions of the erstwhile landlords

(or other property owners) who chose to supply housing for owner-occupancy. Framing the increase

in home ownership as a loss of rental housing, in turn, raises important and under-studied questions

about the rise of home ownership in the mid-20th century: who supplied rental housing prior to the

mid-century increase, and how did the many forces that drove rising home ownership affect them?

    It bears emphasis that the focus of this paper is on understanding the role of rent control in

the wartime shift, rather than on understanding what kept home ownership rates high after the

war. Several factors, such as the postwar expansion of mortgage credit, likely kept home ownership

rates increasing even as some of the forces driving them in wartime faded. It is plausible that

rent control influenced postwar development as well, through the sudden creation of a large group
   2
     Baum-Snow (2007) and Boustan and Shertzer (2013) discuss trends in suburban residence; Glaeser (2013) notes
the highly elastic supply of housing in the postwar years. With elastic supply, several factors may have contributed
to rising home ownership after the war. Past work has investigated the roles of rising incomes (Chevan, 1989),
non-neutralities in the income tax code (Rosen and Rosen, 1980), and expansions of mortgage finance (Fetter, 2013;
Chambers, Garriga and Schlagenhauf, 2014). Fetter (2014) provides further discussion of this literature.

of home owners during the war and the corresponding disinvestment in rental housing, or simply

through the continuation of rent controls in many areas in the postwar decade. Unfortunately, since

the empirical strategy of this paper uses a measure of rent control severity that directly captures

variation only in the initial reduction in rents, it is not well suited to testing for effects over a longer

time horizon, when the relationship between the contemporaneous and the initial severity of rent

control is likely to have been weaker. Hence, testing for the longer-run role of World War II-era

rent control is beyond the scope of this paper, but in the conclusion I offer some speculation on its

possible influences.

       Secondly, this paper contributes to the economic history literature on the US economy during

World War II. There has been much work on labor markets during the war, the macroeconomic

effects of war spending, and other dimensions of the wartime economy – Goldin (1991), Goldin and

Margo (1992), Higgs (1992), Mulligan (1998), Collins (2001), Acemoglu, Autor and Lyle (2004),

Field (2008), Rockoff (2012), and Fishback and Cullen (2013) are but a few examples from the last

two decades. But the modern economics literature has thus far said comparatively little about the

operation of wartime housing markets, which is an important gap to fill given how prominently the

housing shortage figured at the time.3

       Finally, despite the fact that the effect of rent control on housing supply is a classic economic

question, and the recognition that World War II was an important period of rent control, to the

best of my knowledge there has been no work using modern empirical methods to examine it. An

empirical demonstration of the behavioral response to wartime rent control is important in part

because one might presume that behavioral distortions would be small when there is little privately

initiated construction anyway, an idea noted in Arnott (1995). Further, although wartime is obvi-

ously an unusual setting, for a general understanding of price controls it is critical to understand

their effects in wartime given that historically, war has been one of the major reasons for their im-

plementation (Rockoff, 1984). Another fresh contribution of this paper to the rent control literature

is that a large share of the rent control literature has focused on single-market case studies, and on
   3
    As evidence on this last point, a casual internet search turns up several films premised on the wartime housing
shortage, such as “The More the Merrier” (1942) and “Standing Room Only” (1944).




                                                        5
cases in which local jurisdictions themselves impose rent control.4 Centralized administration of

wartime rent control generates more transparent variation in rent control regulations, and its wide

geographic extent allows the construction of market-level rather than unit-level counterfactuals.

Finally, while textbook models predict that rent control will reduce the supply of rental housing,

in their review of the vast empirical literature on rent control Turner and Malpezzi (2003) note

that there are remarkably few direct empirical tests of this prediction; Sims (2007) is a more recent

exception.5 Isolating a supply relationship for rental housing is not the goal of this paper, but the

results are consistent with the prediction that rent control reduces rental housing supply.



2        Rent control and wartime housing markets

2.1       Federal rent control

The expansion of military production in the early 1940s brought large population inflows to many

urban areas, with the civilian population more than doubling between 1940 and 1943 in some cities.

As early as 1940, rising rents in the areas undergoing industrial expansion drew the attention of

the federal government, which feared that rising rents would put upward pressure on wages and

reduce labor supply in war production centers.6 In response to rising prices in many sectors, the

Emergency Price Control Act of 1942 established the Office of Price Administration (OPA) as an

independent agency, and gave it broad powers to ration goods and to control prices and rents.

        Rent control was imposed at the level of ‘defense rental areas,’ which were designated by the

OPA. After a period of 60 days following this designation, the OPA could impose a ceiling on rents.

In most cases, defense rental areas were made up of whole counties or groups of counties because in
    4
      The latter point is why it is important in both Sims (2007) and Autor, Palmer and Pathak (2014) that the
removal of rent control in Cambridge and other Eastern Massachusetts cities was determined by a state-wide ballot
initiative rather than by local decisions. Central administration of wartime rent control is similarly helpful in my
empirical setting.
    5
      In addition to Turner and Malpezzi (2003), Glaeser and Gyourko (2008) and Arnott (1995) also offer relatively
recent reviews of the broader literature on rent control. Much of the early empirical literature, such as Olsen (1972),
estimated the size and distribution of benefits of rent control to tenants in controlled units rather than supply effects.
    6
      The discussion that follows, except where noted otherwise, is summarized from Harvey C. Mansfield and Asso-
ciates (1948). In addition to its general concern about inflation, the government appears to have worried that rent
increases would lead to greater tenant mobility within cities, reducing their time spent working, and that high rents
would dissuade potential new workers from migrating to war production centers.




                                                            6
the urgency of wartime the OPA found more precise delineation of areas undergoing rent increases

to be too time-consuming. Initially, the OPA requested surveys of rents from the BLS and Work

Projects Administration (WPA) to determine areas in which rising rents threatened the defense

program, and designated these areas first. In October 1942, however, the entirety of the rest of

the country was designated into defense rental areas and was subject to the imposition of control,

although in the end not all areas were actually put under control.

       The method of rent control was to set a ‘maximum rent date’ as a base date for freezing rents

in each area. The Emergency Price Control Act required that rents in a defense rental area be

stabilized at a level prevailing prior to the impact of defense activities. Recognizing that war

production affected different areas at different times, the OPA chose a maximum rent date for each

defense rental area according to its assessment of when defense production led to rent increases in

that area (Porter, 1943). Once a base date was chosen, the OPA required every rental unit in the

area to be registered. Forms were sent to the landlord for every rental unit to record the rent and

services provided on the base date, with a copy sent to the tenant to verify the landlord’s report.

The maximum legal rent for each dwelling was then set at its level on the base date.7 Choice of

the base date was flexible except that it had to be the first of a month. In some cases rents were

rolled back by as much as a year and a half, but in general such long rollbacks were found to be

problematic. In the first group of cities put under control, in the summer of 1942, a variety of

different base dates were used. But by the fall of 1942, a common base date was used for nearly

all newly controlled areas. This “default” base date was March 1, 1942, chosen because it was the

base date used for other goods under the General Maximum Price Regulation.

       The OPA rapidly put an extraordinarily large share of rental housing under control. As shown

in Table 1, the counties that had been placed under federal rent control by 1946 had held over three

quarters of the 1940 total population, and 87 percent of the 1940 nonfarm population.8 In almost
   7
     In cases where landlords made improvements or reduced services provided, the level at which rents were frozen
could be adjusted. Similarly, the OPA allowed for adjustment of the maximum rent in cases of “substantial” increase
or decrease in occupancy. In cases where a unit existed but was not rented on the base date, the rent was negotiated
between the landlord and tenant but was subject to OPA adjustment. New construction projects had to be approved
by the Federal Housing Administration and were subject to an FHA-imposed rent ceiling.
   8
     Data on rent control regulations by county and defense rental area used in this paper, including dates of des-
ignation as defense rental areas, dates of control, and maximum rent dates, are from various issues of the Federal
Register.



                                                         7
all areas, rent control was imposed and administered by the OPA, rather than local authorities:

the few exceptions included Washington, DC, which was covered by its own rent control law passed

in December, 1941, and Flint, Michigan, which passed an ordinance in 1942.9

       Several considerations suggest that property owners would not have expected rent control to

be a short-term intervention. Although it was initially an emergency measure, rent control was

only rarely relaxed until well after the war, and in fact continued to be imposed in new areas

even in 1946. Decontrol did not begin in earnest until the late 1940s, and many areas saw control

continue (albeit with some modifications) into the 1950s.10 During the war, moreover, landlords

may well have believed that widespread rent control would continue indefinitely, at least in some

form. Newspaper articles from the time quote representatives of property owners’ groups and

real estate boards asserting a real possibility that rent control would be kept indefinitely, citing the

emergency rent regulations imposed in France in 1914 that continued through the then-present day,

as well as the presence of a large group in government seeking to make rent control permanent.11

       Despite widespread federal price and rent control, the OPA did not have the authority to control

real estate sales prices or commercial rents.12 As documented below, house prices rose dramatically

during the war, giving landlords an incentive to withdraw units from the rental market in order

to sell them on the uncontrolled market for owner-occupancy. The OPA recognized this incentive

and initially attempted to counteract it by imposing restrictions on eviction. A reportedly more

common evasive device was for the landlord to sell the dwelling to the present occupant with a low
   9
      Rent control in Washington and Flint was similar to federal rent control: the Flint ordinance was closely modeled
on federal rent control, and federal control itself was modeled partly on the DC law.
   10
      A handful of areas were decontrolled during or immediately after the war, more were decontrolled in the late
1940s, and most controls that had been imposed during the war or immediately afterwards were eliminated by the
mid-1950s, with the famous exception of New York City and some other cities in New York State (Lett, 1976).
Estimating the effects of rent control using variation in decontrol is somewhat more difficult than using variation in
the imposition of control. Without the urgency of wartime, geographic boundaries of decontrol were delineated much
more precisely than were boundaries of areas put under control; a large share of decontrol actions were also driven
by local decisions, unlike the centralized decisions that imposed control.
   11
      These examples come from Al Chase, “Rent Controls are Here to Stay, Say Realtors,” Chicago Daily Tribune, 14
September 1942, sec. A1, p. 23 and Al Chase, “Extended Rent Rule in Peacetime Forecast,” Chicago Daily Tribune,
14 November 1944, sec. A1, p. 25.
   12
      As noted in Harvey C. Mansfield and Associates (1948), from the beginning the OPA recognized this lack of
authority would be a weak point in its rent control program, but decided not to seek the power to control sales prices
or commercial rents out of fear that doing so would make the imposition of rent controls politically infeasible. OPA
tried on two later occasions to obtain the power to impose price ceilings, but failed. The politics of price control
in the housing sector was just one example of the influence of congressional-executive politics on the price control
program; Fetter (1974) provides a broader discussion.



                                                          8
down-payment, but with regular payments above the maximum rent. In response to this type of

evasion, the OPA imposed a restriction in October 1942 that down-payments had to be at least one

third of the purchase price (later relaxed to one-fifth) and had to be paid in cash. Nevertheless,

conversion of units to owner-occupancy was recognized as a problem throughout the operation of

federal rent control.

   Consistent with OPA’s recognition of this problem, many observers in the postwar decade

argued that rent control led to a shift towards higher rates of home ownership. Friedman and

Stigler (1946), quoted above, is one example. Humes and Schiro (1946) documented the wartime

withdrawal of units from the sample of rental dwellings the BLS used for its cost-of-living index,

and claimed that “forced purchases probably constituted a substantial part of these transactions.”

The history of the OPA in Harvey C. Mansfield and Associates (1948) agreed, noting that “the

rent control program undoubtedly contributed to the movement of properties from the rental to

the sale market.” The Census Bureau’s summary of the rapid rise in home ownership over the

1940s (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1953) also attributed the increase partly to federal rent control.

Grebler (1952) emphasized that the movement from renter- to owner-occupancy was particularly

important for single-family dwellings, although Harvey C. Mansfield and Associates (1948) noted

that there was also some conversion of multifamily dwellings into “cooperatives” during the war.

Little evidence has thus far been advanced to support these contemporaneous claims other than

aggregate national trends.

   Although these observers typically emphasized actual withdrawals from the rental stock, with-

drawals need not have been the only channel through which rent control affected home ownership.

The difference in relative returns between renting and selling a property would also have been

relevant to the decision of any property owner, whether she had begun as a landlord or not. It is

also possible that rent control reduced construction of multifamily dwellings, although with new

construction very strictly regulated during the war, this channel was most likely quantitatively

less important. Given the possibility of multiple supply channels through which rent control may

have influenced housing tenure, as well as the lack of data on specific units, the analysis below will

focus on the relationship between rent control and the home ownership rate rather than solely on



                                                  9
withdrawals.


2.2   The wartime rise in home ownership

The potential importance of rent control to the rate of home ownership is suggested by Figure

2, which combines owner-occupancy rates from the Decennial Censuses with estimates for 1944,

1945, and 1947 from the Monthly Report on the Labor Force. The increase in home ownership

between 1940 and 1945 is remarkable not only for its size – about half that of the overall net change

over the 20th century – but also for the fact that it occurred at a time when very little housing

was built, as illustrated in Figure 4. If supply of housing for owner-occupancy came only from

new construction, the 1940s would present something of a paradox: due to wartime restrictions on

residential construction, the years from 1942 to 1945 saw levels of housing starts that were nearly

as low as they had been in the depths of the Great Depression. In contrast, increases in home

ownership from 1945 to 1950 (and from 1947 to 1950 in particular) were comparatively modest,

despite record levels of single-family housing construction.

   As these comparisons suggest, a key characteristic of increasing home ownership over the early

1940s was that a large part of its supply side involved conversion of the same dwellings from

renter- to owner-occupancy. The BLS recorded 2.3 million nonfarm housing starts in the years

from 1940 to 1945, most of them in 1940 and 1941. Yet the number of owner-occupied units

increased by 4.8 million from April 1940 to November 1945, and the number of nonfarm owner-

occupied units increased by 4.5 million, as documented in Table 2. At the same time, the number

of renter-occupied units showed an absolute decline of two million units, from 19.7 to 17.6 million;

the number of nonfarm renter-occupied units fell by about 0.9 million. Notably, Figure 3 shows

that the 1940s were the only decade of the twentieth century over which the number of renter-

occupied units declined, and that this decline appears to have occurred only between 1940 and

1945. Supporting the interpretation that these changes reflected conversion of renter-occupied units

to owner-occupancy rather than abandonment of deteriorating rental housing, the Census Bureau

used cross-tabulations of tenure and year built in the 1950 Census of Housing to estimate that

at least 3 million units that were owner-occupied in 1950 had been renter-occupied in 1940 (U.S.



                                                 10
Bureau of the Census, 1953). The fact that much of the rise in home ownership involved conversions

of the same units is consistent with – although certainly not proof of – the hypothesis that rent

control induced landlords to sell their properties for owner-occupancy rather than continuing to

rent them out.

   In part, the size of the increase in home ownership from 1940 to 1945 was associated with

the particularly low level of home ownership in 1940 that followed the foreclosures of the Great

Depression. Ratcliff (1944) estimated that there were about 600,000 to 700,000 dwelling units that

had been owner-occupied in 1930 but were renter-occupied in 1940 due to foreclosure. A substantial

share of these were likely in the hands of financial institutions that may have been unwilling

landlords, and hence eager to sell them once prices recovered (Fishback, Rose and Snowden, 2013;

Rose, 2014). Yet a ‘rebound’ associated with declines in home ownership over the 1930s does not

suffice on its own as an explanation for the rapid increase over the early 1940s, at least from the

perspective of understanding the supply of dwellings for owner-occupancy. Illustrating this point,

Figure 5 plots the city-level change in home ownership over the first half of the 1940s against

the city’s change in home ownership between 1930 and 1940, for the sample used in the analysis.

As described in more detail below, surveys were carried out at different times between 1944 and

1946, so the figure plots the residuals from regressions of the city-level changes on survey year

fixed effects and within-survey-year time trends. There is a slight (and statistically insignificant)

negative relationship between the two, but the change in home ownership over the 1930s does little

to explain where home ownership increased over the early 1940s: the partial correlation in the

sample, after conditioning on survey timing, is -0.067. Similarly, the city-level 1920-30 change in

home ownership is, if anything, negatively correlated with the change over the early 1940s, with a

partial correlation of -0.227. Hence, a ‘return to trend’ is also unlikely to serve as an explanation

on its own.

   Although the focus on rent control in this analysis puts most of the emphasis on the supply

side of the market, it may be helpful to note how these home purchases might have been financed.

With incomes rising during the war and little to spend them on, rising personal savings would

have helped finance home purchase over the early 1940s. Mortgage lending for home purchase



                                                 11
was also active during the war, as aggregate data on home mortgages from the annual reports

of the Federal Home Loan Bank Administration from 1941 through 1945 suggest (Federal Home

Loan Bank Administration, various years). While overall lending by savings and loans (S&L’s),

banks, and trust companies decreased in fiscal years 1942 and 1943, individual mortgagees were

a substantial share of lending over this period (in fiscal year 1941, they represented 24 percent

of the number of mortgage loans and 16 percent of their dollar volume) and mortgage lending by

individuals increased with each fiscal year from 1941 through 1945, except for a slight decline in

fiscal year 1943. Moreover, the dollar volume of loans given by S&L’s for home purchase increased

in absolute terms in each fiscal year from 1941 through 1945, despite a decrease in the total volume

of S&L lending driven by declines in loans for construction, refinancing, and reconditioning.



3     Empirical Strategy and Results

3.1    Data

The results below are based on a sample of 51 cities in which the National Industrial Conference

Board (NICB) had begun monthly rental surveys by March 1940, for construction of the rent com-

ponent of its cost-of-living index.13 The NICB’s choice of sample cities based on characteristics

determined prior to 1940 alleviates concerns that the sample would be skewed towards cities expe-

riencing unusual housing conditions during the war. Most of the cities in the NICB sample were

relatively large, with all but three having a 1940 population of 100,000 or more. I obtained the

values of the NICB rental indices for these cities from National Industrial Conference Board (1941)

and from various issues of the Conference Board Economic Record and Management Record. In

1943 the NICB published revisions to its indices for many of the sample cities; in these cases I use

the revised values. Throughout the paper, the index is scaled to measure changes in rents relative

to their March 1940 level.
  13
     There were 56 cities in which the NICB had begun tracking rents by March 1940. For four of these 56 cities
there was no tenure data available for the mid-1940s. These were Lansing, Michigan; Lynn, Massachusetts; Oakland,
California; and Wausau, Wisconsin (Lynn and Oakland were in fact surveyed, but only as part of much larger areas,
without reporting of data at a more disaggregated level). Minneapolis and Saint Paul, Minnesota had separate NICB
rent indices but a combined tenure survey; I combine them for my analysis.




                                                       12
    City-level data on housing tenure in the mid-1940s come from a set of newly digitized housing

surveys carried out by the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) between 1944

and early 1947 (Humes and Schiro, 1946; U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1947a, 1948). Surveys were

carried out in most large cities, as well as smaller cities that were thought to be experiencing

serious housing shortages (Humes and Schiro, 1946). Cities were surveyed at different times; most

of the cities in my sample were surveyed in 1945 or 1946, and a few in 1944. The measure of home

ownership used below is the estimated share of occupied, privately-financed dwelling units that

were owner-occupied as of the survey date.14 The dependent variable used below is the difference

between this mid-1940s measure of home ownership and the level of home ownership for the same

geographic area in 1940, based on information from the 1940 Census.15

    For the main results and the robustness checks that follow, I link information on rents and

changes in tenure to various characteristics of cities before and during the 1940s. The additional

data includes information on the characteristics of war housing built, reported in the September

1945 Consolidated Directory of the Disposition of War Housing (National Housing Agency, 1945a)

and the growth in county bank deposits from 1941-44, from the Distribution of Bank Deposits

by Counties (U.S. Department of the Treasury, 1943, 1945). An additional variable of particular

interest, which I have for 35 of the 51 NICB cities, is a measure of the degree of house price

appreciation between April 1940 and September 1945. This measure comes from unpublished

results of a study carried out by the National Housing Agency (NHA) in the late 1940s (National

Housing Agency, 1947), which I obtained from the National Archives. This study is the source of

the monthly house price series covering Washington, DC from 1918 to 1947 that was reproduced

in Fisher (1951) and used in the 5-city median house price index of Shiller (2005). In addition to

the monthly series for Washington, DC, the NHA calculated median asking prices for single-family
  14
     It excludes public housing projects, commercial rooming houses, trailers, tourist cabins, transient hotels, dormi-
tories and institutions (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1948). War housing projects were an important part of changing
housing markets in urban areas during World War II, but those that were publicly financed are excluded from my
measure of housing tenure.
  15
     In most cases surveys were done within city limits, but in other cases they covered counties or ‘areas’ combining
the city with surrounding communities or other large cities nearby. Levels of home ownership for the same (or very
close to the same) geographic area in 1940 are either provided in the surveys, or can be reconstructed using 1940
Census data. The few minor geographic inconsistencies appear not to be a concern. Further details are given in the
data appendix.

houses that were not newly built and had no commercial features in approximately 80 cities in

April 1940, September 1945, and several months in late 1946.16 Most of the other data below come

from Haines (2010); when possible I use variables reported at the city level, but when necessary I

use variables reported for the corresponding county or counties.

       Table 3 reports summary statistics on the 51 cities in the NICB sample. To assess the compara-

bility of the NICB sample with other large cities, I also show statistics for the set of all 92 cities that

had a 1940 population of at least 100,000. The cities of the NICB sample tended to have greater

population in 1940 than those in the larger set of cities and had slightly less rented single-family

housing, but they were quite similar in other respects, suggesting that it is reasonable to expect

that the effects found in the NICB sample generalize to a broader class of cities. This table also

offers a first look at changes in housing markets in the sample cities over the first half of the 1940s.

On average, home ownership rates increased by 9.6 percentage points between the 1940 Census and

the city’s first survey date. This increase followed an average 6.2 percentage point decline over the

1930s and an average 6.6 percentage point increase over the 1920s. Prior to control, the average

city had seen a 6.4 percent rise in rents, and with the imposition of control the average reduction

in rents was about 2 percent. Average appreciation in home asking prices suggests that the initial

reduction in rents understates the true degree of rent control severity, however: in the 35 cities

for which a measure is available, the median asking price in September 1945 was, on average, 56

percent higher in nominal terms than it was in April 1940.


3.2      Empirical test and results

Since essentially all U.S. cities were placed under rent control during World War II, estimating the

effects of rent control on changes in tenure by comparing controlled to uncontrolled areas is not a

feasible empirical approach in this setting. Instead I use variation across cities in the initial severity

of rent control: the degree to which rent control forced down rents at the time it was imposed. The
  16
     Use of an asking-price series to calculate home price appreciation has obvious limitations. Asking prices may
differ from selling prices, and this deviation may vary over the business cycle; houses advertised for sale may also
differ systematically from other houses. But Williams (1954), who constructs an asking-price series for Los Angeles
from 1940 to 1953, compares his index to one based on actual sales prices and finds that rates of appreciation based
on asking prices are very similar to those based on actual sales prices, especially over the 1940s.




                                                        14
test takes advantage of the fact that even across cities in which rents rose to similar degrees prior

to control – and hence, are likely to have had similar housing demand shocks early in the 1940s

– the combination of the OPA’s choice of base date and the precise timing of prior rent increases

meant that rent control reduced rents by different amounts in different cities. To recapitulate, the

idea is illustrated in Figure 1. For each city, the left vertical line marks the base date, and the right

vertical line marks the date on which rent control was imposed. The obvious difficulty in comparing

Baltimore to Boston is that while rent control had much less initial impact on rents in Boston, this

was because Boston had only minimal increases in rents prior to control, and therefore had either a

much smaller demand shock or a much more elastic supply of housing than Baltimore. In contrast,

the rent indices for Baltimore and Buffalo show similarly large increases in rents from March 1940

to mid-1942. Yet in Baltimore, the choice of base date brought down rents substantially, whereas

the choice of base date in Buffalo meant that rent control had much less initial impact on rents.17

The spirit of the test is to draw comparisons like that between Baltimore and Buffalo, in order to

avoid comparisons in which variation in the severity of control was due, for example, to differences

in housing demand. In practice, the main specifications implement this idea by controlling for the

maximum degree of rent appreciation prior to control.

       The specific measure of severity is the percent decline in rents that would be implied by a

reduction in rent from its maximum pre-control level to its level on the base date. That is, it is

the difference between the pre-control maximum value of the NICB rent index and its value in the

base date month, normalized by the pre-control maximum value.18 Using only rental market data

as of the date of imposition of control has the advantage that the measure is less influenced by

endogenous decisions that potential sellers, tenants, or buyers make in response to rent control. But
  17
     It is evident that the rent indices did not always fall to the base date values at the time of imposition of rent
control. This fact may represent rent adjustments or removal of lower-rent units from the NICB sample, but it is
also possible that the NICB index does not accurately reflect the decline in rents after the imposition of control. For
example, the BLS rent index for Buffalo closely tracks that of the NICB prior to control but falls further, to the level
on the base date, after the imposition of control.
  18
     Note that the maximum rent appreciation is measured over different time periods for different cities. An alter-
native is to use appreciation up to May 1942 (the last month before the first wave of OPA rent control), but doing
so leads to only modest changes in the estimates. Note also that the measure here uses no information from the rent
index after the imposition of control, because post-control values of the rent index may be influenced by landlords’
responses to rent control. In practice, using a post-control measure of severity gives qualitatively similar but smaller
and less precise estimates for the main specifications.




                                                          15
since the initial reduction in rents will not fully reflect the incentives faced by market participants

over the course of the war, the main estimates should be interpreted as reduced-form estimates of

the effect of rent control.

   The basic regression specification for city i, with first housing survey in year t, is


                 ∆t(i),40 (home ownership rate)i = α (t(i)) + β(severity)i + γ 0 Xi + εi              (1)


where ∆t(i),40 (home ownership rate)i is the percentage point change in home ownership between

April 1940 and the first survey date for city i, carried out in month t (which is hence a function of

i). Since the dependent variable is specified as a difference, this specification implicitly controls for

time-invariant city characteristics: the right-hand-side controls in the vector Xi allow for differential

trends according to city characteristics. Below, I first show the relationship between severity and

home ownership conditional only on survey time effects, which account for the fact that cities were

surveyed at different times. Except where specified otherwise, the function controlling for common

time effects for a given survey month, α(t(i)), is allowed to be piecewise linear, with discontinuities

between survey years: I include linear trends by survey month within each survey year, allowed to

differ across years, as well as a set of fixed effects for survey year, which allow level shifts by survey

year. After showing the raw relationship, I estimate specifications that include various covariates in

Xi . As noted above, among the key controls is the maximum pre-control rent appreciation in city

i, which is measured relative to March 1940. Other controls included in the baseline specifications

are the city’s change in home ownership from 1930 to 1940 as well as its change from 1920 to

1930, and three separate controls for the share of housing units in 1940 that were single-family and

owned, rented, and vacant. These variables help to capture the possibility that some cities had

greater potential for increases in home ownership than others; put differently, they condition on

factors in the pre-treatment period likely to be correlated with the elasticity of supply of housing

for owner-occupancy.

   The relatively small size of the NICB sample makes the downward bias in the usual Eicker-

Huber-White robust standard errors a concern. Accordingly, I follow Imbens and Kolesar (forth-

coming) and report HC2 standard errors, along with p-values that correspond to a t-distribution

                                                   16
with the degrees of freedom adjustment proposed by Bell and McCaffrey (2002).

       Table 4 confirms that cities with greater severity had larger increases in home ownership.19

Column (1) shows the simple relationship between the size of the rent reduction and the change in

home ownership, corrected for survey timing (Appendix Figure A1 shows this relationship graph-

ically). The coefficient suggests that an increase in severity of 2.5 percentage points – roughly

a standard deviation in the NICB sample – was associated with roughly a 1.1 percentage point

greater increase in home ownership during the early 1940s, with a p-value of 0.023.

       The main test of the rent control hypothesis is the specification in column (2), which adds

a control for the maximum pre-control rent appreciation, as well as the baseline set of controls

described above. The relationship between severity and increased home ownership does not appear

to be driven by the degree of pre-control rent appreciation, and hence does not merely reflect, for

example, differential housing demand growth. The coefficient on severity in fact increases slightly in

this specification, and remains significant at a reasonable level, with a p-value of 0.082. The point

estimate suggests that severity greater by 2.5 percentage points led to roughly a 1.2 percentage

point greater increase in home ownership over the early 1940s (Appendix Figure A2 illustrates

this relationship). Finally, in Column (3) I add additional controls to allow differential trends by

Census region and by other 1940 city characteristics – house values and rents in 1940 and the

nonwhite share of the population. Doing so has little effect on the size or statistical significance of

the coefficient on rent control severity.


3.3      The effect of rent control on house prices

The primary focus of this paper is the effect of rent control on home ownership, but a closely

related question is the impact that it had on prices for owner-occupancy.20 To the extent that

excess demand from unsatisfied consumers in the rental market spills over into the owner-occupied

market, there will be upward pressure on house prices. Consistent with this mechanism is the 56
  19
    Coefficients on the covariates are reported in Appendix Table A1.
  20
    It may be helpful to note that if price increases over the war were entirely driven by the initial reduction in rents
under rent control, any increase in ‘severity’ subsequent to the imposition of rent control would be captured in the
main results. But this is evidently not the case: house prices rose substantially even in cities where rents were frozen
at their peak pre-control level (and hence the reduction in rents was zero).




                                                           17
percent average rise in the home asking price index from April 1940 to September 1945. In general,

however, it is ambiguous whether rent control should increase or decrease prices in the uncontrolled

market for owner-occupied dwellings, as a long-running literature has discussed.21 Several other

factors may play a role as well. For example, Autor, Palmer and Pathak (2014) note that control

of rental units may affect house prices through externalities related to maintenance and residential

sorting; they find that the removal of rent control in Cambridge in the mid-1990s raised values of

uncontrolled housing.

    To assess the effect of rent control on house prices in this setting, I estimate specifications

similar to equation (1) with home asking price appreciation from April 1940 to September 1945 as

the dependent variable. The measure of house price appreciation is available for 35 of the sample

cities. Unfortunately, the NHA’s criteria for choosing a sample of cities to survey for house prices

were not clearly specified, but it can be said that these 35 cities had similar average growth in

home ownership to the full NICB sample of 51 cities (9.6 percentage points for the full set of

51 and 9.4 percentage points for the subsample with price appreciation data), and also that rent

control severity is not a statistically significant predictor of the presence of price data either in an

unconditional specification or conditional on the main set of controls used above.22

    The results in Table 5 suggest that cities with greater initial rent control severity saw greater

house price appreciation from 1940 to 1945; Appendix Figure A3 illustrates this relationship.23 In

particular, the specification in column (3), which contains the full set of controls, gives a coefficient

of 3.984 (and a p-value of 0.030), suggesting that an initial level of severity greater by 2.5 percentage

points (a standard deviation in the full sample) was associated with appreciation in house prices

that was greater by 10 percentage points. In the context of World-War II era housing markets, it

appears that rent control tended to increase prices for owner-occupancy.
  21
     An early article on this question was Gould and Henry (1967), who pointed out that even in the absence of
a supply response, the effect of price controls on the price of an uncontrolled substitute depends on the rationing
mechanism in the controlled market. Fallis and Smith (1984) questioned the applicability of their analysis to the
housing market, noting that the most natural assumptions on how controlled housing is allocated imply that rent
control would raise the price of uncontrolled substitutes. More recent discussions relevant to the effect of rent controls
on the price of uncontrolled substitutes include Hubert (1993) and Häckner and Nyberg (2000).
  22
     For example, conditional on the controls used in column (2) of Table 4, except for survey time effects, the
coefficient on severity is 0.539 with an HC2 standard error of 4.091.
  23
     Coefficients on the covariates are reported in Appendix Table A2. Since house price data are for the same time
period for all cities, I do not include survey time controls as in the tenure results.



                                                           18
4     Assessing robustness to alternative explanations

The identifying assumption in the main specifications is that conditional on the maximum pre-

control rent appreciation, the reduction in rents induced by rent control was unrelated to underlying

city trends that were also associated with differential trends in home ownership. In this section, I

offer three complementary pieces of evidence supporting a causal interpretation of the estimates.


4.1   Exploiting the ‘default’ base date

The variation in the initial severity of rent control in the main specifications comes from the

combination of the OPA’s choice of base date and the timing of increases in rent. My first approach

to assessing the identification assumption is to use the OPA’s “default” base date to isolate variation

in rent control severity that does not rely on city-specific choices of the OPA, but instead relies

only on variation in the timing of rent increases across cities. I then assess whether the variation in

timing of rent increases is likely to be related to unobserved factors that also led to greater growth

in home ownership.

    The OPA devoted much attention to setting city-specific base dates in the initial wave of rent

control imposition in the summer of 1942, and a number of different base dates were used. By

October 1942, however, nearly all newly controlled counties were assigned the default base date of

March 1, 1942: 92 of 97 counties controlled in October, 197 of 198 counties controlled in November,

and 111 of 112 counties controlled in December. Twenty cities in my sample were put under control

over these three months, and all shared the common base date. I re-estimate a variant on my main

specification on the sample of cities controlled between October and December 1942, making it

slightly more parsimonious given the smaller size of the sample.

    By controlling for maximum pre-control rent appreciation and testing for differences in increases

in home ownership in cities that had sharper initial rent reductions when rolled back to March 1942,

this specification exploits variation in the precise timing of rent increases. The spirit of this test

is to draw comparisons between two cities in which rents rose by similar amounts prior to control

at the end of 1942, but in which rents had risen by different amounts as of March 1942. A city

where most of the rent increase happened by March 1942 would have lower severity, and one where


                                                  19
most of the increase happened after March 1942 would have greater severity. The identification

assumption is that given that cities eventually had similar rent increases before control, the degree

of rent appreciation by March 1942 was unrelated to unobserved factors that drove differential

trends in home ownership. Below I present evidence supporting this assumption.

   The point estimates in Table 6 for this smaller sample suggest that the possible correlation

between the OPA’s choice of base dates and unobserved factors increasing home ownership does

not induce upward bias in the main estimates. The coefficient in column (3), which controls

for the maximum pre-control rent appreciation and survey timing in the same way as the main

specifications, suggests that a severity greater by 1 percentage point was associated with a 1.6-

percentage point greater increase in home ownership over the 1940s. The point estimate is somewhat

larger than those in the main specifications. Taking this result at face value, it may be that the

OPA’s choice of city-specific base dates induces a downward bias in the main results. For example,

suppose that defense production stimulates demand for rental housing more than for owner-occupied

housing because it is expected to be a temporary labor demand shock. If the OPA chose base dates

to reduce rents more in cities where rent increases were associated with defense activities, as the

institutional background in Section 2 suggests, then greater rent control severity should have been

related to greater demand shocks for rental, not owner-occupied, housing. Given the wide confidence

intervals in column (3), however, the difference in point estimates may not be very meaningful.

   The identifying assumption for this robustness check is that conditional on the eventual degree

of pre-control rent appreciation, the precise timing of the appreciation was not correlated with

unobserved factors that themselves led to greater increases in home ownership between 1940 and

the mid-1940s. To evaluate the plausibility of this assumption, I re-estimate the specification in

column (3) of Table 6 using months from March 1941 to February 1942 as placebo base dates.

If the relationship between rent control severity and home ownership is due to unobserved factors

associated with early rent increases, then it is likely that it should not matter whether “early” means

prior to March 1942, or instead means prior to September 1941 (to choose one example). That

is, calculating rent control severity as the implied reduction to base dates other than March 1942

should produce similar results. Note that since rents are serially correlated, as the placebo dates



                                                  20
approach the true base date we should expect them to deliver larger and more significant effects

– in the extreme, a “placebo” date one day prior to the actual base date would deliver estimates

essentially identical to those from using the actual base date, not really being a “placebo” at all.

In the absence of a clear criterion for determining which dates are too close to the true base date

to be considered “placebo” base dates, I include results using placebo dates close to the true base

date, but the results below should be interpreted with this caveat in mind.

    I show the coefficients and confidence intervals for each placebo date as well as the true one in

Figure 6. The results support the identifying assumption. Conditional on the eventual degree of

rent appreciation, “later” rent appreciation does not appear to be correlated with greater increases

in home ownership except when it coincides with greater rent control severity. Using any of the

months from March through December 1941 as a placebo base date delivers estimates that are

not statistically significantly different from zero, and for which the point estimates themselves are

relatively close to zero. Only when the placebo base date approaches the true base date do the

estimates begin to come close to the estimate in Table 6. As noted above, due to serial correlation

in rents we would expect to begin seeing larger and more significant effects as the placebo dates

approach the true one, which indeed is what is observed in the data.


4.2    Introducing controls for alternative explanations

There are several other candidate explanations for unusually sharp increases in home ownership

rates during the early 1940s, and one might be concerned that these are correlated with the variation

in rent control severity even conditional on the degree of rent appreciation prior to control. One

possibility is that rising incomes and savings encouraged a shift towards ownership as a form of

housing tenure.24 Another is that the wartime rise in marginal income tax rates made the non-

neutralities in the tax code between owner- and renter-occupied housing more relevant than they had

been before, driving a shift towards owner-occupancy (Rosen and Rosen, 1980). The abnormally

low level of home ownership in 1940, after the foreclosures of the 1930s, may have led to an unusually
  24
     As with some of the other explanations listed below, rising income and savings and rent control are not mutually
exclusive explanations; the effect of rent control should be interpreted against the backdrop of rising housing demand.
The question here is whether the main specifications adequately control for variation in housing demand.




                                                          21
fast increase as the ‘overhang’ of properties was sold off. Finally, the war economy may have raised

expectations of future growth and encouraged home purchase. As a second approach to supporting

a causal interpretation of the main estimates, I assess whether or not these alternative explanations

are likely to explain the main result by introducing additional controls that should provide measures

of geographic variation in these alternatives. Many of these variables could plausibly be affected

by rent control itself, so the coefficient estimates in these specifications should be interpreted with

caution; the spirit of this exercise is to see whether inclusion of these variables leads to a substantial

reduction in the severity coefficient.

   The results shown above, in fact, already address two of these alternative hypotheses. Column

(1) of Table 7 reproduces the final column from Table 4. This specification already controls for

the city’s 1930-40 and 1920-30 changes in home ownership, making it unlikely that the rent control

result is driven by depressed levels of home ownership in 1940. It also addresses the possibility that

rising marginal tax rates increased home ownership during the war. Work studying geographic

variation in housing tax benefits over the 1980s and 1990s (Gyourko and Sinai, 2003, 2004) uses

more extensive data than are available for my sample, but as a rough approximation, differential

changes in the tax benefit to owner-occupied housing as income tax rates rose during the 1940s

should be correlated with city housing values in 1940. Column (1) includes a control for the median

owner-occupied housing value in 1940, and as seen in Table 4, inclusion of this control did little

to change the size of the severity coefficient. Hence, it is unlikely that spatial variation in the tax

benefit to owner-occupied housing explains the rent control result.

   I address a range of other concerns in columns (2) through (6), adding controls that are likely to

be correlated with income, savings, and expectations of future city growth (in Appendix Table A3

I introduce each individually). There is no data directly measuring city- or county-level personal

incomes over this period, so I use two alternative measures: the change in log retail sales per capita

from 1939-1948, following Fishback and Cullen (2013), and the change in the log total dollar value

of manufacturing wages from 1939 to 1947. As a first proxy for savings, I use the 1941-44 change in

log bank deposits. I also include a control for county E-bond sales per capita. Both of these types of

savings could of course substitute for saving in the form of housing, but it may be that differential



                                                   22
shocks to the ability to save translated into greater saving in all forms. Two final controls in column

(2) are the change in log county civilian population from 1940 to 1943 and total county World War

II spending from 1940-1945 (normalized by the 1940 population). These variables are meant to

serve as additional controls for the size of the housing demand shock across cities. To proxy for

expectations of future growth, I control for the share of war housing that was privately financed.

The rationale for doing so is that when future demand for housing was uncertain, war housing

tended to be publicly financed (National Housing Agency, 1945b). An alternative, which focuses

on changes in expectations prior to restrictions on construction, is to use data on city-level building

permits before the end of 1941 as a measure of anticipated housing demand at the beginning of the

1940s. I use the number of new housing units authorized in 1940 and 1941, from U.S. Bureau of

the Census (1966), normalized by the number of dwelling units in 1940.

   The results suggest that the rent control result is not driven by correlated trends in incomes,

savings, or housing demand. Including controls for income, savings, county war spending, and

population change reduces the coefficient on severity only modestly, from 0.465 to 0.419. Data on

financing of war housing are unavailable for two cities in my sample, so in column (3) I re-estimate

the baseline specification omitting these two, and add a control for financing of war housing in

column (4). The coefficient of 0.413 is again close to the 0.465 that I estimate in the baseline

specification. Data on permits are unavailable for six cities in the sample, so in column (5) I re-

estimate the baseline specification omitting these six, and control for permits in 1940 and 1941 in

column (6). The results are quite imprecise but the point estimate on severity is not dramatically

changed by the inclusion of the final control. Altogether, the evidence in Table 7 suggests that

these alternative stories do not explain the relationship between rent control severity and increased

home ownership.


4.3   Evidence from the timing of imposition

Use of an entirely different source of variation – the timing of rent control imposition across cities –

provides a final approach to supporting the interpretation of the main estimates. There is no data

on housing tenure at a sufficiently high temporal frequency to use this test to examine shifts into



                                                  23
home ownership directly, but changes in the number of newspaper advertisements offering houses

for sale is likely to provide a rough measure of the degree to which property owners chose to attempt

to sell in response to the imposition of rent control.25 For one newspaper from each of nine cities,

I have collected data on the number of ads offering houses for sale on the first Sunday of each

March, June, September, and December from 1939 to 1946. Details on the sample and the data

construction are given in the data appendix. Although the sample is small, there is a reasonable

degree of variation in timing of rent control across the nine cities: one was controlled in 1941q4,

two in 1942q2, three in 1942q3, two in 1942q4, and one in 1943q4.

       The basic specification is

                                                 8+
                                                 X
              ln(# sale ads)ct = αc + βt +              γτ 1(control imposed at time t − τ )ct + εct               (2)
                                               τ =−8+


for city c observed in quarter t. This specification controls flexibly for fixed city characteristics

and time shocks common across cities. It also allows an assessment of the identifying assumption

by testing whether cities appeared to be on different trends in sales prior to the imposition of

control. I estimate a separate coefficient for each relative quarter from 7 quarters prior to 7

quarters following control, plus a common coefficient for all quarters 8 or more before and one for

8 or more after control. The omitted category is the quarter immediately preceding the quarter in

which rent control was imposed. In the preferred specifications below, I augment equation (2) by

controlling for city-specific linear time trends and city-specific season (quarter of year) fixed effects.

The motivation for including the latter is pronounced seasonality in advertisements that appears

to have been specific to a few cities in the sample. I estimate standard errors clustered by city;

following Imbens and Kolesar (forthcoming), I use the Bell and McCaffrey (2002) adjustment for

both standard errors and hypothesis testing to account for the small number of clusters (nine).

       Figure 7 plots the estimates of γτ for the log number of sale advertisements, from a specification

that augments equation (2) with city-specific trends and city-season fixed effects. These coefficients

and those from alternative specifications are also shown in Appendix Table A4. There is little
  25
     A caveat is that in general, more ads need not always mean that more homes are being put on the market, since
it is also consistent with homes staying on the market for longer. But in light of the results on severity shown above,
this seems a less plausible interpretation of the results.


                                                          24
indication of a differential trend in sale ads pre-dating the imposition of rent control. The coefficients

for the first period of control and afterwards indicate a differential uptick in the number of sale

ads immediately after the imposition of rent control, with a number of sale advertisements about

0.2 log points higher about a year after the imposition of control. The results are quite imprecise,

as would be expected with only nine clusters, so caution is clearly merited in interpreting the

estimates. But taken together, they provide suggestive evidence supporting the interpretation of

the main estimates, that rent control induced property owners to put their properties on the market

for owner-occupancy.



5    How much of the increase in home ownership can rent control

     explain?

The results so far indicate that wartime rent control increased urban home ownership; a natural

question is what share of the large wartime increase in home ownership rent control can explain.

The main regression results can be used to answer the question of how much home ownership would

have increased in the sample cities if the initial reduction in rents had been zero in all cities, which

would correspond to setting the frozen level of rents at their peak pre-control levels rather than

reducing them. Even in cities where rents were not initially reduced under rent control, however,

keeping rents at their pre-control levels would still have been a reduction in rents relative to what

they would have been in the absence of rent control, as housing demand grew over the course of

the war. Hence, house price appreciation over the course of the war would have increased the

relative return to selling rather than renting out housing, since rents were still frozen at their

nominal pre-control values. To give an idea of the quantitative magnitudes, in 21 of the 35 cities

for which price appreciation data are available, the initial reduction in rents implied by a return

to the base date was less than half a percent. The rent increases in these cities prior to control

ranged from 0.3 percent to 9.6 percent, with an average of 4 percent. By September 1945, nominal

asking prices in these 21 cities had risen 56 percent on average, and 15 percent at a minimum. The

magnitude of house price appreciation suggests significant growth in the relative return to selling



                                                   25
between the imposition of control and the observation of home ownership rates in the mid-1940s.

A back-of-the-envelope calculation simulating home ownership rates around the end of the war in

the counterfactual scenario of zero initial rent reductions in all cities is therefore likely to give a

lower bound for the overall contribution of rent control to the increase in home ownership during

the early 1940s.26

         Of the 51 sample cities, there are 50 with estimates of the number of occupied dwellings on

the tenure survey date (necessary to calculate a home ownership rate for the cities as a group). In

these cities as a group, weighting by each city’s share of all occupied dwellings, the increase in home

ownership was 7.76 percentage points. Using the coefficient on initial severity of 0.465 estimated

in Column (3) of Table 4, the predicted increase in home ownership if the initial severity of control

had been zero in all cities – that is, if rents had been frozen at their peak pre-control levels in all

cities rather than reduced in some cities – is 7.03 percentage points. This calculation suggests that

rent control can explain at least 9.4 percent of the increase in home ownership in the sample cities

over the early 1940s.



6         Conclusion

World War II coincided with extraordinary changes in urban housing markets, of which one of the

most notable was the rapid increase in home ownership. While other periods of rising home own-

ership over the last century have been associated with construction of new housing, the extremely

limited amount of construction during the war meant that a substantial share of the increase in

home ownership over the early 1940s came from shifting existing structures from renter- to owner-

occupancy. This fact shifts the focus to the incentives facing property owners to sell their properties

for owner-occupancy rather than to rent them out.

         In a new dataset on city-level changes in tenure, rents, and house prices during the first half of

the 1940s, I show that conditional on the degree of pre-control rent appreciation, cities in which
    26
    This is a ‘likely’ lower bound in part because higher prices today, while increasing the returns to selling today in
a static model, in principle may not have the same effect in a dynamic model: if higher prices predict greater future
appreciation that is not fully capitalized into today’s house prices, landlords may also optimally delay rather than
accelerating sale.




                                                          26
rent control was more severe at the time of control – as measured by the degree to which control

was meant to lower rents – had greater increases in home ownership. This relationship is stable

across specifications that allow for differential trends by a variety of pre-1940 characteristics, and is

not explained by differential changes in income, savings, tax benefits to home owners, expectations

across cities, or endogenous choice of base dates. The estimates suggest that rent control can

explain at least 10 percent of the urban increase in home ownership over the early 1940s.

   An open question is what role rent control played in the longer-run increase in home ownership.

It is not unreasonable to suppose that it may have had persistent effects: landlords’ experience

under rent control, for instance, may have discouraged subsequent investment in rental housing. A

large increase in home ownership rates as a result of temporary factors may also have affected the

political economy of home ownership. For example, home purchases among lower-income groups in

the immediate postwar period, when rent control was still in effect in many areas, were cited as one

of the reasons behind the introduction of the exclusion of capital gains on the sale of a principal

residence in 1951 (U.S. Congress, 1951).

   More broadly, the attentiveness of home owners to local politics (Fischel, 2001) suggests that

the rapid creation of a large new group of home owners may have exerted substantial influence on

local political decisions well into the postwar period. It would be interesting for future research to

explore the effects of the rapid wartime increase in home ownership on local government or on the

course of postwar suburbanization.

Notes: Figure shows change in home ownership between the 1940 Census and each city’s first housing survey against
the city’s 1930-40 change in home ownership, accounting for different survey timing by plotting residuals from
regressing each change on survey year indicators and within-year survey time trends (all housing surveys were carried
out between 1944 and 1946). Partial correlation: -0.067.

Notes: Graph shows γτ coefficients from estimating equation (2) with dependent variable ln(#sale ads), augmented
with city-specific linear time trends and city-quarter (season) fixed effects. Omitted quarter is the quarter before
control was imposed. Vertical line separates last quarter before control from quarter in which control was imposed.

Notes: NICB sample comprises the 51 cities tracked by the NICB prior to March 1940 with data from the Census /
BLS tenure surveys. Data on home asking prices are available for only 35 of the NICB cities. There were 92 cities of
population greater than 100,000 in 1940. Share owner-occ, sfd is share of all dwelling units that were single-family
detached and owner-occupied in 1940, and similarly for share renter-occ, sfd and share vacant, sfd (the residual
category is housing that was not single family detached). Rent and price indices are nominal. Reduction in rent
is difference between maximum pre-control rent index and the level on the base date, as a share of the maximum
pre-control index.

Notes: HC2 standard errors in parentheses. Reported p-values correspond to a t-distribution with degrees of freedom
determined by Bell and McCaffrey (2002) adjustment. ‘Max pre-control rent’ indicates that the specification controls
for the degree of rent appreciation from March 1940 to the pre-control maximum. Year fixed effects / trends are
fixed effects for survey year and separate linear trends in survey month for each survey year. Baseline controls are
1920-30 change in home ownership; 1930-40 change in home ownership; 1940 share of dwellings single-family and

7     Appendix
7.1   Data construction
51-city sample
    As described in the text, the sample for the main regressions comprises repeated observations
for 51 cities in which the NICB had begun tracking rents by March 1940. By that point the NICB
had actually begun tracking rents in 56 cities, but two, Minneapolis and St. Paul, had a combined
tenure survey, and four had no tenure survey (these were Lansing, Michigan; Lynn, Massachusetts;
Oakland, California; and Wausau, Wisconsin – Lynn and Oakland were, in fact, surveyed, but only
as part of much larger Boston area and San Francisco Bay area surveys).
    The tenure surveys provide data at various levels of geographic aggregation, and using them to
measure changes relative to 1940 requires some care in identifying comparable geographic areas for
the 1940 values. Sometimes survey data is provided for the city boundaries, sometimes for county
boundaries, and sometimes for “areas” encompassing multiple cities or a city and surrounding
areas. When multiple levels of geographic aggregation are available for a city, I choose survey data
according to the following rules of precedence. Having chosen the surveys, I then use the earliest
tenure survey available for each city.

 (1) When surveys following the city boundaries were available, I used those, and excluded any
      surveys at the area level. This group included 32 of the final 51 cities.

 (2) If no survey at the city level was available but there was a survey at the county level, I used
      those (and excluded any survey at the area level for the same city). This group included
      three cities: Los Angeles (Los Angeles County), Cleveland (Cuyahoga County), and Newark
      (Essex County).

 (3) If there was no survey for a single city but there was for a pair of cities (without surrounding
      areas outside of the cities), I used the pair of cities. This group included two pairs of cities:
      Minneapolis-St. Paul and Duluth-Superior.

 (4) If surveys were not available at either the city or county level, I used data at the “area” level
      (encompassing the primary city and one or more surrounding smaller areas). This group
      included the remaining 14 cities in the sample.

For 4 of the 14 surveys at the “area” level, the surveys reported 1940 tenure figures for an area
that covered the same area as the intercensal survey, and in 5 of the “area”-level surveys the 1940
tenure figures covered between 95 and 100 percent of the intercensal survey area. Of the remaining
five surveys at the area level, four have no 1940 data reported with the intercensal surveys and one
has data reported for a 1940 area covering only 85 to 95 percent of the intercensal survey area. For
these five, I reconstruct 1940 home ownership numbers for a comparable area using the reported

                                                  42
area definitions and the minor civil division data from the 1940 Census, referring to the original
survey reports to identify the survey areas when necessary.
   A related issue is that for cities that annexed land between 1940 and the first tenure survey and
which subsequently had tenure surveys reporting figures for the city, it is not always clear whether
the boundaries followed were the original ones or those after annexation. In my sample, there are
8 cities that had annexed more than half a square mile of land between 1940 and the year of the
first tenure survey (based on information from various issues of the Municipal Year Book (Ridley
and Nolting, various years)) and whose survey reported figures at the city level.
   Ultimately, any area inconsistencies in the tenure measures do not appear to be a concern.
There are 13 cities in which area comparability may be an issue: those that (a) were surveyed at
the area level but with coverage between 95 and 100 percent, or (b) were surveyed at the city level
and annexed more than half a square mile of land before the first tenure survey. Omitting these 13
cities from my sample strengthens the results reported in the text.
   Several control variables are measured at the city level, regardless of the geographic extent of
the tenure survey. These include the 1920-30 and 1930-40 changes in home ownership, and the
variables on occupancy and tenure by structure type. For three observations I combine two cities
to calculate these control variables (these are Minneapolis-St. Paul, Duluth-Superior, and the Fall
River-New Bedford area). The NICB rent indices are also measured at the city level.
   To calculate control variables at the county level, I aggregated data from all counties in which
a sample city (or pair of cities, for Minneapolis-St. Paul and Duluth-Superior) had population in
1940. The one exception is Youngstown, Ohio, which had 99.9 percent of its 1940 population in
Mahoning County.

   Newspaper advertisements
   The data on advertisements of housing for sale comes from nine cities for which digital images
of classified ads were available consistently throughout the sample period, with headings in the
classified ad section that allow a straightforward classification of ads into offered sales (as opposed
to, for example, houses either for sale or for rent). The nine newspapers are the Chicago Tribune, the
Cleveland Plain Dealer, the Dallas Morning News, the Los Angeles Times, the New Orleans Times-
Picayune, the New York Times, the Portland Oregonian, the Seattle Times, and the Washington
Post. In each city, I use the count of ads appearing on the first Sunday of each March, June,
September, and December. I include housing in the city or suburban areas. For the New York
Times, I exclude ads for housing in suburban areas that were put under control before or after the
first wave of rent control in New York City (for example, counties in New Jersey, Connecticut, and
some nearby counties in New York State were put under control either earlier or later than New
York City was).
   I attempt to exclude certain types of advertisements from the count of sale ads. Among the
excluded ads are those for the sale of unimproved land; ads for the sale of “income property,” such


                                                  43
as apartment buildings or farms; ads for summer homes, beachfront or resort properties; ads for
exchange of real estate; ads for home building or financing; and ads offering homes “for rent or
sale.” A caveat is that sometimes ads for empty lots are included in the same classification as
ads for homes in suburban areas. As a rule, the counts include or exclude entire classifications of
ads, rather than trying to distinguish between different types of ads under the same classification.
Hence, when ads for empty lots are included under classifications that primarily advertise homes,
they are included in the total count. Some ads advertise multiple properties, but since many of these
do not specify the exact number available, I use counts of the number of distinct advertisements
rather than the number of distinct properties.

Notes: x-axis shows residuals of percent change in NICB rent index from the maximum pre-control rent to the level on
the freeze date, net of survey year fixed effects and linear time trends within survey year. y-axis shows corresponding
residuals of percentage-point change in home ownership between the 1940 Census and the first intercensal tenure
survey carried out in each city.
