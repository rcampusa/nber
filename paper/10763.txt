Will Job Testing Harm Minority Workers?

                                                 ABSTRACT

Because minorities typically fare poorly on standardized tests, job testing is thought to pose an equity-efficiency
trade-off: testing improves selection but reduces minority hiring. We develop a conceptual framework
to assess when this tradeoff is likely to apply and evaluate the evidence for such a trade-off using data
from a national retail firm whose 1,363 stores switched from informal to test-based worker screening
over the course of on year. We document that testing yielded more productive hires at this firm -- raising
median tenure by 10-plus percent. Consistent with prior research, minorities performed worse on the
test. Yet, testing had no measurable impact on minority hiring, and productivity gains were uniformly
large among minorities and non-minorities. These results suggest that job testing raised the precision
of screening without introducing additional negative information about minority applicants, most plausibly
because both the job test and the informal screen that preceded it were unbiased.

I    Introduction

In the early twentieth century, the majority of unskilled, industrial employees in the United States
were hired with no systematic eﬀorts at selection [Wilk and Cappelli, 2003]. Sanford Jacoby’s well-
known industrial relations text describes an early 20th century Philadelphia factory at which foremen
tossed apples into crowds of job-seekers, and hired the men who caught them [Jacoby, 1985, p. 17].
These hiring practices are no longer commonplace. During the 1980s, as much as one-third of large
employers adopted systematic skills testing for job applicants [Bureau of National Aﬀairs, 1980 and
1988]. But skills testing has remained rare in hiring for hourly wage jobs, where training investments
are typically modest and employment spells brief [Aberdeen, 2001]. Due to advances in information
technology, these practices are poised for change. With increasing prevalence, employers use com-
puterized job applications and assessments to administer and score personality tests, perform online
background checks and guide hiring decisions. Over time, these tools are likely to become increasingly
sophisticated, as for example has occurred in the consumer credit industry.
    Widespread use of job testing has the potential to raise aggregate productivity by improving the
quality of matches between workers and firms. But there is a pervasive concern, reflected in public
policy, that job testing may have adverse distributional consequences, commonly called ‘disparate
impacts.’ Because of the near universal finding that minorities, less-educated and low socioeconomic-
status individuals fare relatively poorly on standardized tests [Neal and Johnson, 1996; Jencks and
Phillips, 1998], job testing is thought to pose a trade oﬀ between eﬃciency and equality; better
candidate selection comes at a cost of reduced opportunity for groups with lower average test scores
[Hartigan and Wigdor, 1989; Hunter and Schmidt, 1982]. This concern is forcefully articulated by
Hartigan and Wigdor in the introduction to their influential National Academy of Sciences Report,
Fairness in Employment Testing (p. vii):

      “What is the appropriate balance between anticipated productivity gains from better em-
      ployee selection and the well-being of individual job seekers? Can equal employment oppor-
      tunity be said to exist if screening methods systematically filter out very large proportions
      of minority candidates?”

Nor is this expression of concern merely rhetorical. Hartigan and Wigdor recommend that the U.S.
Employment Service apply race-conscious score adjustments to the General Aptitude Testing Battery
(GATB) to limit harm to minorities–despite their conclusion that the GATB is not race biased.
    This presumed trade-oﬀ between eﬃciency and equality has garnered substantial academic, legal
and regulatory attention, including specific provisions in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 gov-


                                                   1
erning the use of employment tests,1 several Equal Employment Opportunity Commission guidelines
regulating employee selection procedures [U.S. Department of Labor, 1978],2 and two National Acad-
emy of Sciences studies evaluating the eﬃcacy and fairness of job testing [Hartigan and Wigdor, 1989;
Wigdor and Green, 1991]. Despite this substantial body of research and policy, the case for a trade-oﬀ
between equality and eﬃciency in the use of job testing is not well-established empirically–nor, as
this paper argues, is it well-grounded conceptually.
       We start from the presumption that competitive employers face a strong incentive to assess worker
productivity accurately, but such assessments are inevitably imperfect. In our discussion and con-
ceptual model, we consider two distinct–and not mutually exclusive–channels by which job testing
may aﬀect worker assessment. The first is to raise the precision of screening, which occurs if testing
improves the accuracy of firms’ assessments of applicant productivity. A large body of research demon-
strates the eﬃcacy of job testing for improving precision, so we view this channel as well-established.3
The second is to ‘change beliefs’–that is, to introduce information that systematically deviates from
firms’ assessments of applicant productivity based on informal interviews. This occurs if either the job
test is biased or if the informal screen that precedes it is biased–or, potentially, if both are biased,
albeit diﬀerently.
       To see the relevance of these distinctions, consider a firm that is initially screening informally for
worker productivity and which introduces a formal job test that improves the precision of screening.
Assuming that minority applicants perform significantly worse than majority applicants on this test,
will the gain in screening precision come at a cost of reduced minority hiring? As we show below, the
answer will generally be no if both the informal screen and the formal test provide unbiased measures
of applicant productivity. In this case, the main eﬀect of testing will be to raise the precision of
screening within each applicant group; shifts in hiring for or against minority applicants are likely
to be small and will favor minorities. Notably, this result does not require that both the test and
informal screen are unbiased. Our model below suggests that the harm or benefit to minority workers
from testing depends primarily on the relative biases of the formal and informal screens. So long as

     The EEOC’s Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Criteria [1978] introduces the “Four Fifths” rule, which
states (Section 4d), “A selection rate for any race, sex, or ethnic group which is less than four-firths (4/5) (or eighty
percent) of the rate for the group with the highest rate will generally be regarded by the Federal enforcement agencies
as evidence of adverse impact.”
   3
     In an exhaustive assessment, Wigdor and Green [1991] find that military recruits’ scores on the Armed Forces
Qualification Test (AFQT) accurately predict their performance on objective measures of job proficiency. Similarly,
based on an analysis of 800 studies, Hartigan and Wigdor [1989] conclude that the General Aptitude Test Battery
(GATB), used by the U.S. Employment Service to refer job searchers to private sector employers, is a valid predictor
of job performance across a broad set of occupations. Most relevant to this study, the consensus of the personnel
psychology literature is that commonly administered personality tests based on the “five factor model” are significant
predictors of employee job proficiency across almost all occupational categories [Barrick and Mount, 1991; Tett, Jackson
and Rothstein,1991; Goodstein and Lanyon, 1999].


                                                           2
the information provided by job tests about minority applicants is not systematically more negative
than firms’ beliefs derived from informal screens, job testing has the potential to raise productivity
without a disparate impact on minority hiring. This result makes it immediately apparent why the
presumption that job testing will harm minority workers is suspect: there is little reason to expect
that job testing is more minority-biased than informal hiring practices.4
    This discussion, and our conceptual model, suggest that the presumed trade-oﬀ between eﬃciency
and equality in hiring is an empirical possibility rather than a theoretical certainty. Evaulation of
the evidence for this trade-oﬀ requires a comparison of the hiring and productivity of similar workers
hired by comparable employers with and without the use of employment testing. There is to our
knowledge no prior research that performs this comparison.5 In this paper, we empirically evaluate
the consequences of private sector job testing for minority employment and productivity by studying
the experience of a large, geographically dispersed retail firm whose 1, 363 establishments switched
from an informal, paper-based screening process to a computer-supported, test-based screening process
over a one year period. Both hiring methods use face-to-face interviews, while the test-based method
also places substantial weight on a personality test that is administered and scored by computer. We
use the rollout of this technology over a twelve month period to contrast contemporaneous changes in
productivity and minority hiring at establishments diﬀering only in the date that employment tests
were introduced at their sites.
    We find strong evidence that testing yielded more productive hires–increasing mean and median
employee tenure by 10 to 12 percent. Consistent with a large body of work, we find that minority
applicants performed significantly worse than majority applicants on the employment test. Had the
test changed employers’ beliefs about the average productivity of minority relative to majority appli-
cants, our model suggests that testing would have raised White hiring at the expense of Black hiring
and reduced the substantial productivity gap between Black and White workers. Neither of these
eﬀects occurred; the racial composition of hires was unchanged by testing and productivity gains were
uniformly large among both minority and majority hires.
    In light of our theoretical model, these results imply that the job test was unbiased relative to the
informal screen it supplemented. Testing therefore raised productivity by improving selection within
minority and majority applicant pools rather than by shifting the distribution of employment towards
the higher scoring group (White applicants). By performing a parametric simulation of the conceptual
   4
     In practice, there is considerable evidence that employers favor majority over minority workers when interviewing
and hiring, suggesting the presence of taste-based or statistical discrimination or both [Altonji and Blank, 1999; Goldin
and Rouse, 2000; Bertrand and Mullainathan, 2004].
   5
     All prior studies of which we are aware compare anticipated or actual hiring outcomes using an employment test to
a hypothetical case in which, absent testing, firms do not already account for majority/minority productivity diﬀerences.

model using the observed data on test scores, hiring and productivity, we reach a stronger conclusion:
the lack of relative bias demonstrated by our results is most plausibly explained by a lack of absolute
bias. That is, we accept the hypothesis that both the informal screen and job test were unbiased.
      Our research contributes to the influential literature on testing, race and employment in three
respects. First, despite substantial regulatory concern about the possible adverse consequences of
job testing for minority hiring, we are unaware of any work that empirically evaluates whether use
of job testing in a competitive hiring environment harms (or benefits) minority workers. Second,
whereas the bulk of the prior literature on job testing focuses on the U.S. military and other public
sector agencies, we study the experience and personnel data of a large, for-profit retail enterprise as it
introduces job testing. Since incentives and constraints are likely to diﬀer between public and private
sector employers, we believe this makes the findings particularly useful. A final unusual feature of our
research is that we look beyond the hiring impacts of job testing to evaluate its consequences for the
productivity of hires (as measured by job spell durations), both overall and by race. As our conceptual
model underscores, these two outcomes–hiring and productivity–are theoretically closely linked and
hence provide complementary evidence on the consequences of job testing for employee selection.
      Most closely related to our work is a study by Holzer, Raphael and Stoll [2006], which finds that
employers that initiate criminal background checks for job applicants are more likely to hire minority
workers than those who do not. Holzer et al. conclude that absent criminal background checks,
employers statistically discriminate against Black applicants. Like these authors, we find that improved
job applicant information–here, job tests–did not harm minority applicants, despite the fact that
minority applicants perform worse than majority applicants on the hiring screen. Relative to prior
work, a key virtue of our study is that it exploits the phased rollout of job testing across numerous sites
belonging to the same firm to potentially eliminate any unmeasured confounds between sites’ screening
practices and their preferences towards hiring minority workers. The analysis is therefore likely to
provide a credible test of the ceteris paribus impact of testing on minority hiring and productivity.6
      Prior to the analysis, it is important to clarify the provenance of our data and address questions
about the constraints under which the research was performed. The data analyzed for this study were
provided to the first author by Unicru, Inc. (now a subsidiary of Kronos, Inc.) under a non-disclosure
agreement with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This agreement placed no constraints on
the conclusions of the analysis except that they be factually accurate. Among numerous potential
firms available for analysis, the firm studied in this article was selected by the first author because
its phased rollout of job testing across company sites oﬀered a compelling research design. Unicru

    Close in spirit to our study, though answering a distinct question, is Angrist [1993], which demonstrates that
successive increases in the military’s AFQT qualification standard reduced minority enlistment.

personnel had not previously analyzed the firm’s data to evaluate the eﬀect of job testing on the racial
distribution of hiring or productivity. All data used for the analysis were obtained from Unicru’s data
warehouse, which contains archives of personnel data for client firms. Consent for use of these data
was not required or requested from the firm studied. After the analysis was complete and the first
draft of the paper was in circulation in January 2004, personnel managers of the firm were briefed on
the study and interviewed about the firm’s personnel policies before and after the implementation of
job testing.
     The paper proceeds as follows. The subsequent section describes our data and details the firm’s
hiring procedures before and after the introduction of testing. Section III oﬀers a theoretical model
that illustrates how the possible disparate impacts of job testing depend critically on both the test’s
precision and its bias relative to the informal screens it supplements. Sections IV and V provide our
empirical analysis of the consequences of testing for productivity and hiring. Section VI synthesizes
and interprets these findings by benchmarking them against a parametric simulation of the theoretical
model applied to the observed applicant, hiring and productivity database. Section VII concludes.


II     Informal and test-based applicant screening at a service sector
       firm

We analyze the application, hiring, and employment outcome data of a large, geographically dispersed
service sector firm with outlets in 47 continental U.S. states. Our data include all 1, 363 outlets of this
firm operating during our sample period. All sites are company-owned, each employing approximately
10 to 20 workers in line positions and oﬀering near-identical products and services. Line positions
account for approximately 75 percent of total (non-headquarters) employment, and a much larger
share of hiring. Line job responsibilities include checkout, inventory, stocking, and general customer
assistance. These tasks are comparable at each store, and most line workers perform all of them. Line
workers are primarily young, ages 18 through 30, and many hold their jobs for short durations. As is
shown in the first panel of Table I, approximately 70 percent of hires are White, 19 percent are Black
(non-Hispanic), and 12 percent are Hispanic.7 Median duration of completed job spells of line workers
is 99 days, and the corresponding mean is 174 days (panel B).

A     Worker screening before and after use of job tests

Prior to June 1999, hiring procedures at this firm were informal, as is typical for this industry and
job type. Workers applied for jobs by completing brief, paper application forms, available from store
   7
     These figures pertain to the flow of workers. Since Whites at this firm typically have longer job spells than minorities,
they will be over-represented among the stock of workers relative to the flow of hires.

employees. If the store had an opening or a potential hiring need, the store manager would typically
phone the applicant for a job interview and make a hiring decision shortly thereafter.
       Commencing in June of 1999, the firm began rolling out electronic application kiosks provided by
Unicru, Inc. By June of 2000, all stores in our sample were equipped with the technology. At the
kiosk, applicants complete a questionnaire administered by a screen-phone or computer terminal, or
in a minority of cases, by a web-based application. Like the paper application form, the electronic
questionnaire gathers information on demographics and prior experience. In addition, applicants sign
a release authorizing a criminal background check and a search of records in a commercial retail
oﬀender database.
       A major component of the electronic application process is a computer-administered personality
test, which contains 100 items and takes approximately 20 minutes to complete. This test measures
five personality attributes that collectively constitute the ‘Five Factor’ model: conscientiousness, agree-
ableness, extroversion, openness and neuroticism. These factors are widely viewed by psychologists
as core personality traits [Digman, 1990; Wiggins, 1996]. The particular test instrument used by this
firm focuses on three of the five traits–conscientiousness, agreeableness and extroversion–which have
been found by a large industrial psychology literature to be eﬀective predictors of worker productiv-
ity, training proficiency, and tenure [Barrick and Mount, 1991; Tett, Jackson, and Rothstein, 1991;
Goodstein and Lanyon, 1999].8
       Once the electronic application is completed, the data are sent to Unicru for automated processing.
The results are transmitted to the store’s manager by web-posting, email or fax. Two types of output
are provided. One is a document summarizing the applicant’s contact information, demographics,
employment history and work availability. This is roughly a facsimile of the conventional paper
application form. Second is a ‘Hiring Report’ that recommends specific interview questions and
highlights potential problem areas with the application, such as criminal background or self-reported
prior drug test failure. Of greatest interest, the report provides the applicant’s computed customer
service test score percentile ranking, along with a color code denoting the following score ranges: lowest
quartile (‘red’), second-to-lowest quartile (‘yellow’), and two highest quartiles (‘green’).
       Following the employment test, hiring proceeds largely as before. Store managers choose whether
to oﬀer an interview (sometimes before the applicant has left the store) and, ultimately, whether to
oﬀer a job. Managers are strongly discouraged from hiring first quartile (‘red’) applicants, and, as is
shown in Table II, fewer than 1 percent of hires are from this group. Figure I shows that hiring rates
   8
    An identical paper and pencil personality test could have been used prior to the introduction of computer-supported
applicant screening. The cost of administering and scoring this paper and pencil test may have made it unattractive,
however.




                                                          6
are strongly increasing in the test score in all deciles (see also panel c of Table II).9 The low hiring rate
observed in the data–only one in 11 applicants is hired–in part reflects the fact that applications are
submitted continually while vacancies open only occasionally. For the typical store in our sample with
15 line positions and mean tenure of 173 days, we would expect approximately 28 job applications per
month for 2 to 3 vacancies.

B        Hiring and termination data

The primary data source for our analysis is company personnel records containing worker demographics
(gender, race), date of hire, and termination date and termination reason for each worker hired during
the sample frame. We use these data to measure pre-post changes in hiring and productivity by store
following the introduction of testing. We calculate length of service for all employment spells in our
sample, 98 percent of which are completed by the close of the sample. In addition, we utilize data
on applicant’s self-reported gender, race (White, Black, Hispanic), zip code of self-reported residence
and zip code of the store to which they applied.10 We merge these zip codes to data from the 2000
U.S. Census of Populations Summary Files 1 and 3 [U.S. Census Bureau, 2001 and 2003] to obtain
information on the racial composition and median household income of each applicant’s residence and
each store’s location.
        A critical feature of our research database is that employment (but not application) records are
available for workers hired prior to implementation of the Unicru system at each store.11 Hence, we
build a sample that includes all line workers hired from January 1999, five months prior to the first
Unicru rollout, through May 2000, when all stores had gone online. After dropping observations in
which applicants had incompletely reported gender or race, we were left with 33, 924 workers hired
into line positions, 25, 561 of whom were hired without use of testing and 8, 363 of whom were hired
after receiving the test.12
        Notably absent from our data are standard human capital variables such as age, education and
earnings. Because most line workers at this firm are relatively young and many have not yet completed
    9
     Our data do not distinguish between an applicant who is not oﬀered a job and an applicant who declines a job oﬀer.
The observed hiring rate is therefore a lower bound on the oﬀer rate.
  10
     A small share of workers (0.9 percent) is classified as ‘other’ race. We exclude these workers because of a concern
that the ‘other’ race category was not consistently coded before and after the introduction of job testing. The working
paper version of this manuscript [Autor and Scarborough, 2004] contains complete results that include the ‘other’ race
category. These results are nearly identical.
  11
     Unicru imports its clients’ personnel data into its own computer systems to produce performance evaluations. A
by-product of this practice is that Unicru often obtains personnel data for workers hired prior to the implementation of
the Unicru system. This is the case with the firm studied here.
  12
     We closed the sample at the point when all hires at this firm were made through the Unicru system. Because the
rollout accelerated during the final three of twelve months, the majority of hires during the rollout period are non-tested
hires. Twenty-five percent of the hires in our sample are made prior to the first rollout.



                                                            7
schooling, we are not particularly concerned about the absence of demographic variables. The omission
of wage data is potentially a greater concern. Our understanding, however, is that wages for line jobs
are largely set centrally and that the majority of these positions pay the minimum wage. We therefore
suspect that controlling for year and month of hire, as is done in all models, should purge much of the
unobserved wage variation in the data.

C       Applicant test scores

To analyze test score diﬀerences in our sample, we draw on an applicant database containing all White,
Black and Hispanic applications (189, 067 total) submitted to the 1, 363 stores in our sample during
the one year following the rollout of job testing (June 2000 through May 2001). This secondary data
source is not linked to our primary research sample and is collected exclusively after the rollout of
testing was completed. Although we would ideally analyze paper and electronic applications submitted
during the rollout, these were not retained. In Section IV, we demonstrate that test scores from
the applicant database are strongly correlated with the productivity of workers hired at each store
before the introduction of employment testing, suggesting that this database provides an informative
characterization of workers applying for job during the rollout period.
       Table II shows that there are marked diﬀerences in the distribution of standardized (i.e., mean zero,
variance one) test scores among White, Black and Hispanic applicants. Kernel density comparisons
of test scores in Figure II underscore the pervasiveness of these diﬀerences. Relative to the White
test score distribution, the Black and Hispanic test score densities are visibly left-shifted. These racial
gaps, equal to 0.19 and 0.12 standard deviations, accord closely with the representative test data
reported by Goldberg et al. [1998].13 To examine whether these race diﬀerences are explained by
other observable, non-race attributes of test-takers, we report in Table III a set of descriptive OLS
models in which individual test scores of job applicants are regressed on all the major covariates in
our database including race, gender, year and month of application, indicator variables for each of
the 1, 363 stores in the sample, state specific time trends, and measures of the median log income
and percent non-White in the applicant’s zip-code of residence. Conditional on these detailed control
variables, race gaps in test scores are 60 to 75 percent as large as the unconditional diﬀerences and
are highly significant, suggesting that the job test conveys information about applicants that is not
fully proxied by observable characteristics.
  13
     Using a representative sample of the U.S. workforce, Goldberg et al. [1998] find that conditional on age, education
and gender, blacks and Hispanics score, respectively, 0.22 and 0.18 standard deviations below whites on the conscientious
trait. Blacks also score lower on extroversion and Hispanics lower on agreeableness (in both cases significant), but these
discrepancies are smaller in magnitude.

III        When does job testing pose an equality-eﬃciency trade-oﬀ?

Prior to analyzing the eﬀect of testing on hiring and productivity at this firm, we provide a conceptual
framework to explore when job testing is likely to pose an equality-eﬃciency trade-oﬀ. We define
an equality-eﬃciency trade-oﬀ as a case where the productivity gains from testing come at a cost
of reduced minority hiring. Our conceptual framework is related to well known models of statistical
discrimination by Phelps [1972], Aigner and Cain [1977], Lundberg and Startz [1984], Coate and Loury
[1993] and Altonji and Pierret [2001]. The contribution of our analysis is to explore how the impact
of job testing on the employment opportunities and productivity (conditional on hire) of minority
and majority workers depends on the discrepancy between firms’ prior information about population
parameters–based on job interviews and other established hiring practices (briefly ‘interviews’)–and
the information provided by job tests. We refer to the discrepancy between tests and interviews as
the relative bias of tests.
       Our analysis yields three main results: (1) if job tests are relatively unbiased (i.e., relative to
interviews), they do not pose an equality-eﬃciency trade-oﬀ; that is, the eﬃciency gains from testing
come at no cost in reduced minority hiring; (2) if job tests are bias-reducing–that is, they mitigate
existing biases–eﬃciency gains accrue in part from reduced hiring of groups favored by pre-existing
(i.e., interview) biases; thus, minority hiring is reduced if pre-existing biases favor minorities, and so
an equality-eﬃciency trade-oﬀ is present; (3) if job tests are bias-enhancing–that is, they increase the
extent of bias–testing raises the hiring of groups favored by the test but does not necessarily increase
eﬃciency. We present the model and its main conclusions below. Proofs of selected propositions are
found in the Appendix, with detailed proofs of all propositions available from the authors.

A       The environment, timing and distributional assumptions

There are many firms facing numerous job applicants from two identifiable demographic groups, x1
and x2 , corresponding to a majority and minority group. For simplicity, assume that each group
comprises half of the applicant population (thus, ‘minority’ refers to historical circumstances rather
than population frequency).
       The ability (Y ) of job candidates is distributed as

                                                 Y ∼ N (μ0 (x) , 1/h0 ) .

The mean parameter μ0 (x) may depend on x. Assume that h0 , equal to the inverse of the population
variance σ 20 , is constant, independent of x.14 Let the ability of each applicant, y, be a random draw
from the population distribution for the relevant demographic group (x1 or x2 ). The firm treats the
  14
       The assumption that σ 20 is independent of x stands in contrast to several models of statistical discrimination in


                                                             9
population parameters as known. Thus, the firm’s prior distribution for a draw y is the population
distribution.
      Firms have a linear, constant returns to scale production technology and are risk neutral. Workers
produce output, f (y) = y. Hence, ability and productivity are synonymous. Job spell durations are
independent of y and wages are fixed,15 so firms strictly prefer to hire more productive workers.
      Job applicants are drawn at random from the pooled distribution of x1 and x2 workers. Firms
hire applicants using a screening threshold where applicants whose expected productivity exceeds
a specified value are hired. In a fully elaborated search framework, this screening threshold would
depend on technology and labor market conditions. In our reduced form setup, the screening threshold
is chosen so that the aggregate hiring rate is held constant at K ∈ (0, 0.5). This simplification
focuses our analysis on the first-order impacts of job testing on the distribution of hiring across
demographic groups, holding total employment fixed. We additionally assume that the hiring rate of
each demographic group is below 50 percent, so selection is from the right-hand tail of each applicant
distribution.
      Initially, applicants are screened using interviews. Each interview generates an interview signal, η.
When testing is introduced, applicants are screened using both interviews and tests. The test score is
denoted by s.
      Suppose that there is no bias in interviews. Then the distribution of interview signals will be
centered on the true productivity of each applicant. Precisely,

(1)                                                η ∼ N (y, 1/hη ) ,

where hη is the inverse of the variance of the interview signal (a measure of accuracy of the interview).
Assume hη does not depend on x.
      Conditional on perceived productivity μ0 (x) for group x and the interview signal η, the firm
updates its assessment of the expected productivity of the applicant:

(2)                                   m (x, η) ≡ y|x,η ∼ N (μ (x, η) , 1/hI ) ,

where the updated degree of precision equals hI ≡ hη + h0 , and the updated mean equals μ (x, η) ≡
[ηhη + μ0 (x) h0 ] /hI .
which testing is diﬀerentially informative (or uninformative) for minority groups due to their higher (lower) underlying
productivity variance, e.g., Aigner and Cain [1977], Lundberg and Startz [1984], and Masters [2006]. We believe that
the evidence supports our assumption. Analysis in Hartigan and Wigdor [1989], Wigdor and Green [1991] and Jencks
and Philips [1989, chapter 2] all suggest that while tests commonly used for employee selection show marked mean
diﬀerences by race, the by-race variances are comparable and, moreover, these tests are about equally predictive of job
performance for minorities and non-minorities. As shown in Figure II and Table II, mean test scores in our sample also
diﬀer significantly among White, Black and Hispanic applicant groups but the variances of test scores are nearly identical
for all three groups.
  15
     As above, the majority of line workers at the establishments we study are paid the minimum wage.


                                                           10
          Suppose that there is no bias in testing. Then the distribution of test signals will be centered on
the true productivity of each applicant. Precisely,

(3)                                                 s ∼ N (y, 1/hS ),

where hS is the inverse of the variance of the interview signal (a measure of accuracy of the interview).
Assume hS does not depend on x. This generates a posterior for the firm’s perception of the applicant’s
productivity

(4)                                 m(x, η, s) ≡ y|x,η,s ∼ N (μ (x, η, s) , 1/hT ),

where the degree of accuracy for the posterior (based on both testing and interviews) is hT ≡ hS + hI ;
and the updated mean equals μ (x, η, s) ≡ [shS + μ(x, η)hI ]/hT . Note that hT > hI .

B          First outcome of interest: Hiring rates

To assess when testing poses an equality-eﬃciency trade-oﬀ, we study two outcomes. The first is the
hiring gap, defined as the hiring rate of majority workers minus the hiring rate of minority workers.
          Denote the hiring decision as Hire = 0, 1 for the firm. If there is no testing, the hiring decision
will completely depend upon the firm’s prior and the results of interviews: Hire = I{μ(x, η) > κI },
where κI is the screening threshold that yields a total hiring rate of K using interviews and I {·} is
the indicator function. The expected hiring rate of group x applicants who have received the interview
is
                                            Eη [Hire|x] = 1 − Φ (zI (x)) ,

where zI (x) ≡ [κI − μ0 (x)]/σ 0 ρI and ρI ≡ Corr [μ (x, η) , y] = (1 − h0 /hI )1/2 . Note that we iterate
expectations over η to obtain the unconditional hiring rate (i.e., not conditional on a specific value of
                                                                           R
η) for group x applicants based on interviews. Specifically, Eη [Hire|x] = E [Hire|x, η] f (η|x) dη.16
          If both testing and interviews are used, the hiring decision is Hire = I{μ(x, η, s) > κT }, where
κT is the screening threshold that yields a total hiring rate of K using both interviews and test scores.
The expected hiring rate of group x applicants who have received the interview and the test is:17

                                            Eη,s [Hire|x] = 1 − Φ(zT (x))

where zT (x) ≡ [κT − μ0 (x)]/σ 0 ρT and ρT ≡ Corr [μ (x, η, s) , y] = (1 − h0 /hT )1/2 .
     16
     Since η is normally distributed and assessed productivity conditional on η is normally distributed, the unconditional
distribution of perceived productivity is also normally distributed. It can be shown that the variance of the unconditional
distribution is Vη,y (μ (x, η)) = ρ2I σ20 .
  17
     We iterate expectations over η and s to obtain the unconditional hiring rate for group x applicants based on interviews
and tests. It can be shown that the variance of the unconditional distribution is Vs,η,y (μ (x, η)) = ρ2T σ 20 .


                                                            11
      When hiring is based on interviews, the hiring gap between majority and minority workers is

                                     γ I = Eη [Hire|x1 ] − Eη [Hire|x2 ].

When hiring is based on testing and interviews, this gap is

                                   γ T = Eη,s [Hire|x1 ] − Eη,s [Hire|x2 ].

We denote the eﬀect of testing on the hiring gap as ∆γ ≡ γ T − γ I .

C      Second outcome of interest: Productivity

A second outcome of interest is the eﬀect of testing on productivity. If only interviews are used, the
mean productivity for hired workers of group x is

(5)                             Eη [y|Hire = 1, x] = μ0 (x) + σ 0 ρI λ(zI (x)),

where λ (zI ) is the inverse Mills ratio φ (zI ) / [1 − Φ (zI )], equal to the density over the distribution
function of the standard normal distribution evaluated at zI .
      If both tests and interviews are used, the mean productivity for hired workers of group x is

(6)                            Eη,s [y|Hire = 1, x] = μ0 (x) + σ 0 ρT λ(zT (x)).

      A comparison of equations (5) and (6) shows that testing aﬀects the productivity of hired applicants
through two channels: selectivity (equal to one minus the hiring rate) and screening precision. All
else equal, a rise in selectivity (i.e., a reduction in hiring) for group x raises the expected productivity
of workers hired from group x by truncating the lower-tail of the group x productivity distribution.
Screening precision refers to the accuracy of the firm’s posterior, and its eﬀect is seen in the terms ρI
and ρT in equations (5) and (6), with ρT > ρI (more precisely, both ρI and ρT are increasing functions
of screening precision, so hT > hI implies that ρT > ρI ). All else equal, a rise in screening precision
improves the accuracy of firms’ assessments of worker productivity and so raises the quality of hires
from each demographic group.
      In addition to the impact of testing on overall productivity levels, we also study its eﬀect on the
productivity gap, defined as the mean productivity of majority workers minus the mean productivity
of minority workers. This gap proves relevant to our empirical work because our model suggests that
testing typically moves the hiring and productivity gaps in opposite directions.
      When hiring is based on interviews, the majority/minority productivity gap is

                              π I = Eη [y|Hire = 1, x1 ] − Eη [y|Hire = 1, x2 ].

                                                      12
When hiring is based on interviews and tests, this gap is

                              π T = Eη,s [y|Hire = 1, x1 ] − Eη,s [y|Hire = 1, x2 ].

We denote the eﬀect of testing on the productivity gap as ∆π ≡ π T − π I .

D    The eﬀects of testing when both interviews and tests are unbiased

The potential for an equality-eﬃciency trade-oﬀ is relevant when one applicant group is less productive
than the other. For concreteness, and without loss of generality, suppose that minorities are the less
productive applicant group (μ0 (x2 ) < μ0 (x1 )). These underlying population productivity diﬀerences
imply observed diﬀerences in the hiring and productivity of minority and majority workers prior to
use of tests. First, the hiring rate of minority applicants based on interviews will be lower than that
of majority applicants (γ I > 0). Second, minority workers hired using interviews will be on average
less productive than majority workers (π I > 0). Both inequalities follow from the firm’s threshold
hiring policy wherein applicants whose assessed productivity (equation (2)) exceeds a reservation
value κI are hired.18 This observation is significant for our empirical work because, as shown in Table
I, minority workers hired using interviews are less productive, as measured by job tenure, than are
majority workers hired using interviews.
    To derive the eﬀect of testing on the hiring gap, we note that the overall hiring rate in the model is
constant at K. Hence, testing must either leave hiring of both groups unaﬀected or change the hiring
rate of each group by equal but opposite amounts. It is straightforward to show by diﬀerentiation
that: (1) it is not possible for hiring of both groups to be unaﬀected; and (2) testing raises minority
hiring or, more generally, raises hiring of the applicant group with lower average productivity (see
proof in Appendix):
                                                      ∆γ < 0.

Intuitively, because the interview signal is error-ridden (1/hη > 0) and expected majority applicant
productivity exceeds expected minority applicant productivity, firms disproportionately hire applicants
from the group favored by their prior–that is, majority applicants. Testing increases minority hiring
because the posterior including the test score places more weight on observed signals and less weight
on group means. However, simulations show that the eﬀect of testing on the majority/minority hiring
gap is typically small under the assumed normality of the productivity distributions. We therefore do
not generally expect testing to induce a substantial change in minority hiring.
  18
     The hiring rule (Hire = I{μ(x, η) > κI }) equates the expected productivity of marginal hires from each applicant
group. Because the average majority applicant is more productive than the average minority applicant, the average
majority hire is also more productive than the average minority hire. As a referee pointed out, this result stems from
the fact that the normal distribution is thin-tailed.


                                                         13
    We obtain a similar, but stronger, result for the eﬀect of testing on the majority/minority produc-
tivity gap: although minority workers hired using interviews are less productive than majority workers
hired using interviews, testing leaves this majority/minority productivity gap essentially unaﬀected.
More precisely, testing raises productivity of both minority and majority hires approximately equally,
with exact equality as selectivity approaches one (see proof in Appendix). We write:

                                                         ∆π ≈ 0.

The intuition for this result stems from two sources: first, the threshold hiring rule equates the
productivity of marginal minority and majority hires both before and after the introduction of testing;
second, when selection is from the right-hand tail of the normal distribution, the truncated mean
increases near-linearly with the point of truncation with a first derivative that is asymptotically equal
to unity.19 Consequently, a rise in screening precision raises the marginal and average productivity of
hires almost identically for minority and majority workers.
    Summarizing, if both interviews and job tests are unbiased, testing does not pose an equality-
eﬃciency trade-oﬀ. Although job tests unambiguously raise productivity, the gains come exclusively
from improved selection within each applicant group, not from hiring shifts against minorities.
    These results are illustrated in Figure IIIa, which provides a numerical simulation of the impact
of testing on hiring and productivity for a benchmark case where majority applicants are on average
more productive than minority applicants and job interviews and job tests are both unbiased. The x -
axis of the figure corresponds to the correlation between test scores and applicant ability (Corrhs, yi =
1/ (1 + h0 /hs )1/2 ), which is rising in test precision. The y-axis depicts the hiring rate of majority and
minority applicants (left-hand scale) and the expected productivity (equivalently, ability) of majority
and minority hires gap (right-hand scale).20 Prior to the introduction of testing–equivalently, ρ = 0
in the figure–minority applicants are substantially less likely than majority applicants to be hired
and are also less productive than majority workers conditional on hire. Job testing slightly reduces the
minority/majority hiring gap. But this eﬀect is small relative to the initial gap in hiring rates, even
at maximal test precision. By contrast, testing leads to a substantial rise in the productivity of both
   19
      Numerical simulations of the normal selection model show that this asymptotic equality is numerically indistinguish-
able from exact equality at selectivity levels at or above +0.1 standard deviation from the mean (i.e. zI , zT ≥ 0.1). This
result is also visible in the numerical simulation in Figure IIIa, where the productivity gap between minority and majority
hires is invariant to testing. Recall from Table II that the overall hiring rate at this firm is 8.95 percent, implying that
zI , zT ≈ 1.34.
   20
      In the simulation, the ability (equivalently productivity) of nonminority applicants is distributed N (0, 0.29), the
productivity of minority applicants is distributed N (−0.19, 0.27), the precision of the informal ability signal is 1/0.45,
and 8.95 percent of applicants are hired. Thus, h0 = 1/0.27, hη = 1/0.45 μ0 (x1 ) = 0, μ0 (x2 ) = −0.19 and K = 0.0895.
These values are chosen to match estimates from the parametric model simulation in Section VI of the paper. The
precision of the job test ranges from 1/10, 000 to 1/0.0001, corresponding to a correlation of (0.0, 1) between test scores
and applicant ability (plotted on the x-axis).


                                                            14
minority and majority hires, with the degree of improvement increasing in test precision. Consistent
with the analytic results, testing has no detectable eﬀect on the majority/minority productivity gap
at any level of test precision.

E       The eﬀects of testing when interviews and tests are biased: The case of identical
        biases

Our main result so far is that use of an unbiased test introduced in an unbiased hiring environment
raises productivity without posing an equality-eﬃciency trade-oﬀ. We now consider how test and
interview biases aﬀect this conclusion.
       Suppose there is a mean bias in interviews. So, change equation (1) to

                                             η ∗ ∼ N (y + ν η (x), 1/h)

where ν η (x1 ) 6= ν η (x2 ). We say that job interviews are minority favoring if ν η (x2 ) > ν η (x1 ), and
majority favoring if ν η (x1 ) > ν η (x2 )). For example, managers may perceive majority applicants as
more productive than equally capable minority applicants, or vice versa.21
       Similarly, suppose there is a mean bias in job tests. So, change equation (3) to

                                            s∗ ∼ N (y + ν s (x), 1/hS )

where ν s (x1 ) 6= ν s (x2 ), with the definition of minority favoring and majority favoring tests analogous
to that for interviews. This might arise if tests are ‘culturally biased’ so that for given applicant
ability, minority applicants score systematically below majority applicants.
       Define the net bias of interviews as ∆ν η = ν η (x1 ) − ν η (x2 ) and, similarly, the net bias of tests as
∆ν s = ν s (x1 ) − ν s (x2 ). If ∆ν η > 0, interviews favor majority applicants, and vice versa if ∆ν η < 0
(and similarly for job tests). We refer to the diﬀerence in bias between tests and interviews (∆ν s −∆ν η )
as the ‘relative bias’ of tests.
       Assume that firms’ updated assessments of applicant productivity (based on interviews) and pos-
teriors (based on interviews and tests) are still given by equations (2) and (4) except that we now
substitute η ∗ and s∗ for η and s. For consistency, suppose that firms’ prior for each draw from the
applicant distribution is mean-consistent with the information given by interviews, as in the unbiased
case: y|x ∼ N (μ0 (x) + ν η (x) , 1/h0 ). Thus, firms do not compensate for biases in interviews or tests
and we say that their perceived productivity of the applicant distribution is equal to true productivity
plus interview bias.
  21
   Equivalently, ∆ν η could be interpreted as taste-discrimination: firms’ reservation productivity for minority and
majority hires diﬀers by ∆ν η .



                                                        15
         How do these biases aﬀect our prior results for the impact of testing on equality and eﬃciency?
Suppose initially that interviews and tests are equally biased –that is, both tests and interviews contain
biases but these biases are identical (∆ν s = ∆ν η 6= 0). In this no relative bias case, our prior results
require only slight modification:

     1. Use of tests that are unbiased relative to job interviews does not pose an equality-eﬃciency
           trade-oﬀ. In particular: (1) testing raises hiring of the applicant group with lower perceived
           productivity, ∆μ + ∆ν η (the minority group by assumption); and (2) testing raises productivity
           of both minority and majority hires approximately equally, with exact equality as selectivity
           approaches one. Thus, expanding on our earlier conclusion: unbiasedness of both interviews and
           tests (∆ν s = ∆ν η = 0) is a suﬃcient but not a necessary condition for the no-trade-oﬀ result
           to hold. If both interviews and tests are equally biased (∆ν s = ∆ν η )–thus, there is no relative
           bias–testing does not pose an equality-eﬃciency trade-oﬀ.

     2. We showed above that if both interviews and tests are unbiased, the applicant group with lower
           average productivity will have a lower hiring rate and lower productivity conditional on hire
           than the group with higher average productivity (Signhγ I i = Signhπ I i). Interview and testing
           biases can reverse this positive correlation. Because biases reduce selectivity of the favored
           group and raise selectivity of the non-favored group, it is possible for the group with a greater
           hiring rate to have lower productivity conditional on hire.22 So, if minority hires are observed
           to be less productive than majority hires, this implies that either minority applicants have lower
           mean productivity than majority applicants (i.e., μ0 (x2 ) < μ0 (x1 )) or that job interviews are
           minority-favoring (∆ν η < 0) or both.

F         The eﬀects of testing when interviews and tests have non-identical biases

We finally consider how job testing aﬀects the productivity and hiring gaps when the test is biased
relative to job interviews (i.e., ∆ν s 6= ∆ν η ). For concreteness, we continue to assume that minority
applicants are perceived as less productive than majority applicants: μ0 (x1 ) + ν η (x1 ) > μ0 (x2 ) +
ν η (x2 ). It is straightforward to establish the following three results:

     1. Use of a job test that is biased relative to interviews: (1) raises the hiring rate of minorities if the
           test favors minorities (i.e., relative to interviews) but has ambiguous eﬀects on minority hiring
           otherwise; and (2) reduces the productivity level of the group favored by the test relative to the
           group that is unfavored. For example, if minority applicants are perceived as less productive
    22
    This result requires only that the absolute level of bias is suﬃcient to oﬀset underlying mean majority/minority
productivity diﬀerences, which can occur even if there is no relative bias in tests.


                                                        16
       than majority applicants, use of a relatively minority-favoring test will raise minority hiring and
       reduce the productivity of minority relative to majority hires (thus, ∆γ < 0, ∆π > 0).

   2. If the job test is bias-reducing–that is, if the test is less biased than are job interviews (formally,
       ∆ν η > ∆ν s ≥ 0 or 0 ≥ ∆ν s > ∆ν η )–it unambiguously raises productivity.23 Intuitively, a
       bias-reducing test improves hiring through two channels: (1) raising screening precision and (2)
       reducing excess hiring of the group favored by interviews (thus, increasing selectivity for this
       group). Both eﬀects are productivity-enhancing.

   3. By contrast, a bias-increasing test (|∆ν s | > |∆ν η |) has ambiguous eﬀects on productivity.
       Although testing always raises screening precision–which is productivity-enhancing–a bias-
       increasing test causes excess hiring of the group that is favored by the bias, which is productivity-
       reducing. The net eﬀect depends on the gains from increased screening precision relative to the
       losses from increased bias.

    Figure IIIb illustrates result (2). Here, we simulate the impact of testing on hiring and productivity
for a case where minority applicants are less productive than majority applicants and job interviews
are minority-favoring.24 Prior to testing (equivalently, ρ = 0 in the figure), the majority/minority
hiring gap is small and the majority/minority productivity gap is large relative to a setting with no
biases (Figure IIIa). This contrast with Figure IIIa reflects the fact that a minority-favoring interview
raises minority hiring and reduces minority productivity. Job testing counteracts this bias, leading to
a marked decline in the hiring of minority applicants and an equally marked decline in the productivity
gap between majority and minority hires (with the magnitude depending upon test precision).25 Thus,
an unbiased job test increases eﬃciency at the expense of equality if job interviews are biased in favor
of minorities.
    Summarizing our three main conclusions: if job tests are relatively unbiased, they do not pose
an equality-eﬃciency trade-oﬀ; if job tests are bias-reducing, they pose an equality-eﬃciency trade-
oﬀ if and only if interviews are minority-favoring; if job tests are bias-enhancing, they may pose an
equality-eﬃciency trade-oﬀ–or they may simply reduce equality and eﬃciency simultaneously.
  23
     However, if the test and interview have biases of opposite sign (Signh∆ν s i = Signh∆ν η i), testing does not necessarily
increase productivity even if job tests are less biased than interviews.
  24
     We use the same parameter values as in Figure IIIa except that we now assume that ∆ν η = μ0 (x2 )−μ0 (x1 ) = −0.19.
  25
     In the limiting case where job tests are fully informative, the unbiased and biased-interview cases converge to the
same hiring rates and productivity levels.




                                                             17
G    Empirical implications

Our illustrative model contains many specific–albeit, we believe reasonable–assumptions and so it
is unwise to generalize too broadly based on this analysis. In fact, a key purpose of the conceptual
framework is to demonstrate that, contrary to an influential line of reasoning, job testing does not
pose an intrinsic equality-eﬃciency trade-oﬀ, even if minority applicants perform worse than majority
applicants on job tests.
    Beyond this observation, three general conclusions are warranted. First, the potential eﬀects of job
testing on minority hiring depend primarily on the biases of job tests relative to job interviews (and
other existing screening methods). Job tests that are unbiased relative to job interviews are unlikely
to reduce minority hiring because such tests do not adversely aﬀect firms’ average assessments of
minority productivity.
    Second, testing is likely to reduce minority hiring when tests are relatively biased against minorities
(i.e., relative to interviews). In such cases, testing conveys ‘bad news’ about the productivity of mi-
nority relative to majority applicants and so is likely to adversely aﬀect minority hiring. Nevertheless,
if testing mitigates existing biases, it will still be eﬃciency-enhancing, and so an equality-eﬃciency
trade-oﬀ will be present. If instead testing augments bias, it may be eﬃciency-reducing.
    Finally, testing will generally have opposite eﬀects on the hiring and productivity gaps between
majority and minority workers; a test that reduces minority hiring will typically diﬀerentially raise
minority productivity. This implication proves particularly useful for our empirical analysis.
    Below, we use this model to interpret the empirical findings in light of their implications for the
relative biases of the job test and the informal screen that preceded it. To make this interpretation
rigorous, we parametrically simulate the model in section VI using observed applicant, hiring and
productivity data to calculate a benchmark for the potential impacts of job testing on the major-
ity/minority hiring and productivity gaps under alternative bias scenarios.


IV     Estimating the productivity consequences of job testing

Our model is predicated on the assumption that job testing improves productivity. We verify this
assumption here. The productivity measure we study is the length of completed job spells of workers
hired with and without use of job testing. While job duration is clearly an incomplete measure of
productivity, it is likely to provide a good proxy for worker reliability since unreliable workers are
likely to quit unexpectedly or to be fired for poor performance. Notably, the firm whose data we
analyze implemented job testing precisely because managers believed that turnover was too high. In
the working paper version of this article [Autor and Scarborough, 2004], we also consider a second


                                                    18
productivity measure, involuntary terminations, and find results consistent with those below.
       We begin with the following diﬀerence-in-diﬀerence model for job spell duration:

(7)                                   Dijt = α + δTi + Xi β + θt + ϕj + eijt ,

where the dependent variable is the job spell duration (in days) of worker i hired at site j in year
and month t. The X vector includes worker race and gender, and T is an indicator variable equal
to one if the worker was screened using the job test, and zero otherwise. The θ vector contains
a complete set of month × year-of-hire eﬀects to control for seasonal and macroeconomic factors
aﬀecting job spell durations. Our main specifications also include a complete set of store eﬀects,
ϕ, which absorb time invariant factors aﬀecting job duration at each store. Since outcomes may be
correlated among workers at a given site, we use Huber-White robust standard errors clustered on
store and application method.26 For these and all subsequent models, we have also experimented
with clustering the standard errors on stores’ month-by-year of adoption to account for potential error
correlations among adoption cohorts. These standard errors prove comparable to our main estimates.
       Consistent with the bivariate comparisons in Table I, the estimate of equation (7) in column 1 of
Table IV confirms that Black and Hispanic workers have substantially lower mean tenure than White
employees. When 1, 363 site fixed eﬀects are added to the model, these race diﬀerences are reduced
by approximately 40 percent, indicating that minority workers are overrepresented at establishments
where both minority and majority workers have high turnover. Nevertheless, race diﬀerences in tenure
remain highly significant and economically large.
       Columns 3 and 4 of Table IV show that job testing raises job spell durations significantly. In models
excluding site eﬀects and race dummies, we estimate that workers hired using the employment test
worked 8.8 days longer than those hired without use of the employment test. When site fixed eﬀects
are added, this point estimate rises to 18.8 days.27 Adding controls for worker race and gender does
not change the magnitude or significance of these job-test eﬀects. When state × time interactions
are added in column 6 to account for diﬀerential employment trends by state, the main estimate
rises slightly to 22.1 days. This represents about a 12 percent gain in average tenure relative to the
pre-testing baseline. Models that include a full set of state × month-year-of-hire interactions (not
tabulated) yield nearly identical and highly significant results.
       The tenure gains accruing from job testing are also visible in Figure IV, which plots the density and
cumulative distribution of completed job spells of tested and non-tested hires. The distribution of spells
  26
     We exclude from these models the 2 percent of spells that are incomplete.
  27
     The flow of hires in our sample intrinsically overrepresents workers hired at high-turnover stores (relative to the
stock of hires). When testing is introduced, a disproportionate share of tested hires are therefore hired at high turnover
establishments. Adding site eﬀects to the model controls for this composition bias and hence raises the point estimate
for the job testing indicator variable (compare columns 3 and 4).


                                                           19
for tested hires lies noticeably to the right of the distribution for non-tested hires and generally has
greater mass at higher job durations and lower mass at shorter durations. As shown in the lower panel
of the figure, the job spell distribution of tested hires almost entirely first order stochastically dominates
that of non-tested hires. Quantile regression estimates for job spell durations (not tabulated) confirm
that the eﬀect of testing on job spell duration is statistically significant and monotonically increasing
in magnitude from the 10th to the 75th percentiles. These models find that testing increased median
tenure by 8 to 9 days, which is roughly a 10 percent gain (thus comparable to the estimated eﬀect at
the mean).

A       Endogeneity of testing?

Our findings could be biased if the decision to test a worker is endogenous. We observe that in the one
to two months following the rollout of testing at a site, 10 to 25 percent of new hires are not tested.
This may be due to operational issues following system installation (i.e., the kiosk is oﬄine) or due to
record-keeping lags wherein workers oﬀered a job shortly before the advent of testing do not appear on
the payroll until after testing is already in use. A more pernicious concern, however, is that managers
could circumvent testing to hire preferred candidates–a potential source of endogeneity bias.
       To purge any potential endogeneity, we estimate a two-stage least squares (2SLS) version of equa-
tion (7) in which we use a dummy variable indicating that a store has adopted testing as an instru-
mental variable for the tested status of all applicants at the store. Since we do not know the exact
installation date of the testing kiosk at a store, we use the date of the first observed tested hire to
proxy for the rollout date. The coeﬃcient on the store-adoption dummy in the first stage equation of
0.89 indicates that once a store has adopted testing, the vast majority of subsequent hires are tested.28
The 2SLS estimates of the eﬀect of testing on job spell durations shown in columns 7 through 10 of
Table IV are quite similar to the corresponding OLS models, suggesting that endogeneity of individual
test status is not a substantial source of bias.
       A second source of endogeneity is that the timing of stores’ adoption of testing might be correlated
with potential outcomes. Although all stores in our data adopt testing during the sample window,
the timing of adoption is not necessarily entirely random. To our understanding, the rollout order
of stores was determined by geography, technical infrastructure, and internal personnel decisions. If,
however, stores adopted testing when they experienced a rise in turnover, mean reversion in the length
of employment spells could cause us to overestimate the causal eﬀect of testing on workers’ job spell
durations.29
  28
     A table of first-stage estimates for the 2SLS models is available from the authors.
  29
     Managers who we interviewed were not aware of any consideration of store-level personnel needs in the choice of
rollout order. They also pointed out that timely analysis of store-level personnel data was not feasible prior to the Unicru


                                                            20
      As a check on this possibility, we augmented equation (7) for job spell duration with leads and lags
of test adoption. These models (available from the authors) capture the trend in job spell durations for
workers hired at each store in the nine months surrounding introduction of testing: four months prior
to three months post adoption. While the lead estimates in these models are in no case significant
and have inconsistent signs, the lag (post-rollout) dummies show that workers hired in the first month
of testing have 12 days above average job spell duration, and workers hired in subsequent months
have 17 to 25 days above average duration (in all cases significant). Thus, our main estimates do not
appear confounded by pre-existing trends in job spell duration.30

B      Do test scores predict productivity?

It would be valuable to corroborate these findings by showing that test scores predict worker pro-
ductivity. We would ideally proceed by regressing gains in store level productivity on gains in test
scores for cohorts of workers hired at the same stores before and after the advent of job testing. Our
strong expectation is that stores that saw greater increases in worker ‘quality’ as measured by test
scores would have experienced larger gains in productivity. Unfortunately, the firm that we study
did not collect baseline test score data for cohorts of workers hired prior to the use of testing. As
an alternative, we draw on the database of 189, 067 applications submitted to the 1, 363 stores in our
sample during the year after the rollout of employment testing (Table II). Under the assumption that
the characteristics of applicants by store were stable before and after the introduction of job testing,
these data can be used to benchmark the relationship between test scores and productivity.31
      We estimate the following variant of our main model for worker tenure:

(8)                                 Dijst = α + ζ S̄j + Xi β + θt + χs + eijt .

Here, the dependent variable is the completed job spell duration of workers hired at each store j in
state s, S̄j is the average test score of store j 0 s applicants, which serves as a proxy for the average
‘quality’ of applicants at the store, and χs is a vector of state dummies. If test scores are predictive
of worker productivity (as our analysis so far suggests) stores with lower average applicant quality
should exhibit lower overall productivity prior to the advent of testing.
      Table V presents estimates. Column 1 finds a sizable, positive relationship between store-level
average applicant ‘quality’ and the productivity of workers hired prior to the use of testing. A one-
installation.
  30
     We also estimated a version of equation (7) augmented with separate test-adoption dummies for each cohort of
adopting stores, where a cohort is defined by the month and year of adoption. These estimates find a positive eﬀect of
testing on job spell duration for 9 of 12 adopter cohorts, 6 of which are significant at p < 0.05. None of the 3 negative
point estimates is significant.
  31
     We cannot link test scores of workers in the primary sample to their employment outcomes, however.


                                                           21
standard deviation diﬀerence in mean applicant quality (cross store standard deviation of 0.16) predicts
a 6.3 day diﬀerence in mean store job duration. Since we cannot include site eﬀects in these cross-
sectional models, subsequent columns add controls for state-specific trends and measures of minority
resident share and median household income in the store’s zip code (calculated from the Census STF
files). These covariates have little impact on the coeﬃcient of interest.
      The next three columns provide estimates of the relationship between store-level productivity and
mean test scores of hired workers. These point estimates are likely to be substantially attenuated
by measurement error since the hired sample used to calculate the means is only 10 percent as large
as the applicant sample. Despite this, we find an equally large coeﬃcient for the test-score variable.
Because the cross-store standard deviation of hired worker test scores (0.32) is about twice as large as
the cross-store standard deviation of applicant test scores, the standardized eﬀect size of 13 days of
tenure is also twice as large. When we instrument the test scores of hires with those of applicants to
reduce the influence of measurement error (columns 7 through 9), the point estimate on the test score
variable increases in magnitude by about a third. Taken together, these results demonstrate that job
test scores have significant predictive power for worker productivity.

C      Testing for diﬀerential productivity impacts by race

A central implication of the model is that if job tests are unbiased relative to job interviews, they will
raise the productivity of majority and minority hires equally. Conversely, if tests are relatively biased
against minorities, they should raise the productivity of minority hires by more than majority hires
(and vice versa if tests are majority-favoring). To assess the impact of testing on the productivity of
majority and minority hires, we estimate an augmented version of equation (7) where we replace the
‘tested’ dummy variable with a full set of interactions between tested-status and the three race groups
in our sample:

(9)       Dijt = α + δ w Ti × Whitei + δ b Ti × Blacki + δ h Ti × Hispanici + Xi β + θt + ϕj + eijt .

The parameters of interest in this equation, δ b , δ h and δ w , estimate the diﬀerential gains in job spell
duration for tested Black, Hispanic and White hires relative to their non-tested counterparts.
      Table VI presents OLS and 2SLS estimates of equation (9). In the baseline specification in column
1, which excludes site eﬀects and state trends, we estimate that job testing raised spell durations by
14 days among White hires, 15 days among Black hires, and −1.2 days among Hispanic hires. When
site eﬀects and state trends are added, these point estimates rise to 23 days for both Black and White
hires and 13 days for Hispanic hires. The tenure gains for Whites and Blacks are highly significant.
Those for Hispanics are significant at the 10 percent level in the final specification but not otherwise.


                                                      22
A test of the joint equality of the tenure gains by race accepts the null at p = 0.36. In subsequent
columns, we present 2SLS estimates using site adoption of testing as an instrument for whether or not
an individual hire received the employment test. These models show comparable patterns.
    In net, we find that testing had similar impacts on productivity for all worker groups. In the case
of Black versus White productivity gains, the point estimates are extremely close in magnitude in all
models. Although estimated tenure gains are smaller for Hispanic hires than for other groups, the
data do not reject the hypothesis that tenure gains are identical for all three groups (Whites, Black
and Hispanics).

D    Robustness checks

A natural concern with job spell duration as a productivity measure is that it captures quantity but not
quality of labor input. Consider, for example, that college students hired during their summer breaks
may be more capable or reliable than average workers and yet may have shorter job stints. As one
check on this possibility, we reestimated all models in Tables IV and VI while excluding all workers
hired in May, June, November and December–that is, the cohorts most likely to include seasonal
hires. These estimates, available from the authors, are closely comparable to our main results.
    To supplement the evidence from the job duration analysis, it would be valuable to have a more
direct measure of worker productivity. In Autor and Scarborough [2004], we explore one such mea-
sure: firing for cause. Using linked personnel records, we distinguished for-cause terminations (e.g.,
theft, job abandonment, insubordination) from neutral or positive terminations (e.g., return to school,
relocation, new employment). Consistent with the results for job tenure above, these models find that
job testing modestly reduced firing-for-cause and significantly reduced voluntary turnover without
yielding diﬀerential impacts on minority and majority hires.


V     Testing for disparate impacts of testing on minority hiring

Did the productivity gains from testing come at a cost of reduced minority hiring? Although the test
score distributions of Black, White and Hispanic job applicants diﬀer significantly (Figure II), the
test score distributions of Black, White and Hispanic hires are quite comparable (Figure V)). The
reason is that the hired population from each race group almost entirely excludes the lower tail of the
applicant distribution, where a disproportionate share of Black and Hispanic applicants reside. The
contrast between Figures II and V suggests that disparate hiring impacts were a real possibility.
    Yet, initial evidence suggests that a disparate impact did not occur. Unconditional comparisons
of hiring by demographic group in Table I show a slight increase in minority employment after the
implementation of job testing. To provide a rigorous test, we contrast changes in minority versus

                                                  23
majority hiring at stores adopting testing relative to stores not adopting during the same time interval.
The outcome variable of interest is the minority hiring rate, equal to the flow of minority hires over
minority applicants. Unfortunately, our data measure the flow of hires but not the flow of applicants.
To see the complication this creates, let Pr (x2 |Hire = 1) equal the probability that a new hire is
a minority worker and let Pr (x1 |Hire = 1) be the corresponding probability for a majority worker.
Applying Bayes rule, we obtain
                      µ                   ¶      µ             ¶      µ         ¶
                        Pr (x2 |Hire = 1)          E(Hire|x2 )          Pr{x2 }
                   ln                       = ln                 + ln             .
                        Pr (x1 |Hire = 1)          E(Hire|x1 )          Pr{x1 }

The odds that a newly hired worker is a minority is a function of both the minority/majority hiring
rate and the minority/majority application rate (Pr{x2 }/ Pr{x1 }). Since we lack data on application
rates, we must assume that minority/majority application rates are roughly constant within stores
over time to isolate the pure impact of testing on the minority/majority hiring rate.32
    To perform this estimate, we fit the following conditional (‘fixed-eﬀects’) logit model,
                                                       ¡                    ¢
(10)                              Pr (x2 |Hire = 1) = F ξTi + Xi β + θt + ϕj ,

where x2 indicates that a hired worker is a minority, the vectors ϕ and θ contain a complete set of store
and month-by-year of hire dummies, and F (·) is the cumulative logistic function.33 The coeﬃcient,
ξ, measures the total eﬀect of job testing on the log odds that a newly hired worker is a minority. If
our assumption is correct that minority/majority application rates are roughly constant within stores,
these rates will be ‘conditioned out’ by the store fixed eﬀects and ξ̂ will capture the impact of job
testing on the minority hiring rate. If this assumption fails, ξ̂ still provides a valid estimate of the
causal eﬀect of job testing on minority hiring but in that case, we cannot separate the eﬀect of testing
on application versus hiring rates.
    The top panel of Table VII reports estimates for the change in the log hiring odds of Black, White
and Hispanic applicants. These models yield little evidence that employment testing aﬀected relative
hiring odds by race. In all specifications, the logit coeﬃcient on the job testing dummy variable is
small relative to its standard error (z < 1).
    As a supplemental test, we fit in panel B of Table VII a simple fixed-eﬀects, linear probability
model of the form:
  32
     Unicru personnel believe that the application kiosks attract more job seekers overall but have no information on how
kiosks aﬀect application rates by race. One might speculate that the kiosks discourage minority applicants since minorities
are disproportionately likely to have criminal records [Petit and Western, 2004] and completing the electronic application
requires providing a social security number and authorizing a criminal background check. Such discouragement would
bias our results towards the finding that job testing reduced the minority hiring rate.
  33
     We use a conditional logit model to avoid the incidental parameters problem posed when estimating a conventional
maximum likelihood model with a very large number of fixed eﬀects (1, 363).



                                                            24
(11)                              E (x2 |Hire = 1) = α + ψTi + Xi β + θt + ϕj .

This model measures the eﬀect of testing on the share of hires who are minorities. So that coeﬃcients
may be read as percentage points, point estimates and standard errors are multiplied by 100. In all
cases, the estimated impact of testing on hiring rates by race is under one half of one percentage point
and insignificant. The 2SLS estimates of these models (panel C) are similar to the corresponding OLS
models, implying an even smaller reduction in Black hiring and a slightly larger reduction in Hispanic
hiring. These point estimates suggest that testing had negligible eﬀects on the race distribution of
workers.34

A       Disparate hiring impacts: A second test

Since the hiring results are central to our conclusions, we test their robustness by analyzing a com-
plementary source of variation. Prior to the advent of testing, we observe a tight link between the
neighborhoods in which stores operate and the race of workers that they hire: stores in minority and
low-income zip codes hire a disproportionate share of minority workers. We use this link to explore
whether testing changed the relationship between stores’ neighborhood demographics and the race of
hires. Specifically, we estimate a variant of equation (11) augmented with measures of the minority
share or median income of residents in the store’s zip code, calculated from the 2000 U.S. Census
STF-1 files.
       Column 1 of Table VIII shows that, prior to the use of job testing, a store situated in a zip code
with a 10 percentage point higher share of non-White residents would be expected to have an 8.7
percentage point higher share of non-White employees. The point estimate in column 2 shows that
this relationship was essentially unchanged by testing. The next two columns make this point formally.
When we pool tested and non-tested hires and add an interaction between the test dummy and the
share of non-White residents in the zip code, this interaction term is close to zero and insignificant.
When site dummies are included (column 4)–thus absorbing the main eﬀect of the zip code’s non-
White resident share–the interaction term is again small and insignificant.
       Panel B provides analogous estimates for the relationship between the racial composition of em-
ployees and neighborhood household income. In the pre-testing period, stores in more aﬄuent zip
  34
    Lead-and-lag estimates for the eﬀect of testing on race composition are generally insignificant and do not have
consistent signs. The point estimates suggest a brief rise in black hiring and decline in white hiring in the first three
months following the introduction of testing, followed by a slight reduction in Black hiring and rise in White hiring in
months three forward. These latter eﬀects are far from statistically significant. A table of estimates is available from the
authors.



                                                            25
codes had a substantially higher share of White employees: 10 additional log points of neighbor-
hood household income was associated with a 3.2 percentage point greater share of White employees.
Employment testing did not alter this link. For all demographic groups, and for both measures of
neighborhood demographics, the pre-post change in the relationship between neighborhood charac-
teristics and the group membership of hires is insignificant and is close to zero in the model with site
dummies.


VI        What conclusions do the data support? A model-based test

In this final section, we apply the theoretical model from section III to synthesize and interpret the
findings above. Drawing on the applicant, hiring and productivity databases summarized in Tables I
and II, we parametrically simulate the model to assess what combinations of interview bias, test bias,
and underlying majority/minority productivity diﬀerences are most consistent with the findings. One
overriding conclusion emerges from this exercise: the data readily accept the hypothesis that both job
tests and job interviews are unbiased and that the average productivity of White applicants exceeds
that of Black applicants. By contrast, the plausible alternatives that we consider–most significantly,
that the job test is relatively biased against minorities–are rejected.

A       Simulation procedure

Let observed job spell durations, D, be a linear function of applicant ability y , with D = α + ϑy,
where ϑ > 0 is a parameter to be estimated from the data. Suppose that the ability of an applicant
drawn at random from the distribution of group x applicants is equal to y = μ0 (x) + ε0 . Prior to
the introduction of job testing, firms have access to an interview signal, η, for each applicant that
is correlated with ability. When job testing is introduced, it provides a second signal, s, that is also
correlated with ability. We assume initially that both interviews and tests are unbiased, with η = y+εη
and s = y + εs . In these expressions, ε0 , εs and εη are mean-zero error terms that are normally and
independently distributed, with variances to be estimated from the data.
       To estimate the variance parameters, we use the following empirical moments: the mean test score
of applicants is normalized to zero and the mean test score of workers hired using the test is 0.707
(Table II); the variance of test scores is normalized at one (hence, 1 = σ 20 + σ 2s );35 the observed
hiring rate is equal to 8.95 percent; and the average gain in productivity from testing is 21.8 days
(Table IV). We make a further adjustment for the fact that the observed hiring rate is only 22
percent at the 95th percentile of the score distribution (see Table II), implying either that stores are
  35
    It is the ratio of variances (σ2η /σ20 , σ2s /σ 20 ), not their levels, that determines the informativeness of the signals. Thus,
the normalization that σ20 + σ2s = 1 is innocuous.


                                                                26
extraordinarily selective or, more plausibly, that a portion of applicants is turned away because there
are no vacancies.36 Since ability is unobserved, we cannot directly estimate the structural relationship
between ability and job spell duration, ϑ. Instead, we use the empirical relationship between test
scores and productivity from Table V (ζ̂ = 53.9 in equation (8)) to calculate the implied value of ϑ
based on other moments of the model. Putting these pieces together, we calculate that σ̂ 2s = 0.71,
σ̂ 2η = 0.45 and σ̂ 20 = 0.29. Hence, test scores have approximately 60 percent more measurement error
than do interviews.37
       Using these parameter estimates in combination with the database of 189, 067 applications sum-
marized in Table II, we implement the following simulation procedure:38

   1. For each applicant, we draw a simulated ability level, y, as a function of the applicant’s observed
         test score and the estimated error variance of the test. Although this simulated ability level is
         not observed by employers, it contributes to applicants’ interview and test scores and completely
         determines their job spell durations conditional on hire.

   2. Using the ability draws and the estimated variance parameters, we draw an ‘interview signal’
         for each applicant. In contrast to applicant ability levels, these interview signals are observed
         by firms and are used for hiring.

   3. Using applicants’ interview signals, their race, and firms’ priors, we calculate firms’ ‘interview-
         based’ posterior productivity assessment for each applicant (see equation (2)).

   4. We then simulate hiring under the interview-based regime by calculating a store-specific interview-
         based hiring threshold such that the count of applicants whose interview-based posterior assess-
         ment meets the threshold exactly equals the count of hires observed at the store. Applicants
         meeting the threshold are labeled ‘interview-based hires.’

   5. We next use the draws of ability, y, to calculate the job spell durations of interview-based
         hires (equal to D = α̂ + ϑ̂y). In combination, steps (4) and (5) allow us to calculate the
         race composition and productivity of hires (both overall and by race) under the interview-based
         regime.
  36
     To adjust for vacancies, we estimate the hiring rate conditional on a vacancy (‘active hiring rate’) by calculating what
the model implies that the hiring rate should be at the 95th percentile of the test score distribution given other estimated
parameters. If the observed rate is lower than the calculated rate, we attribute the diﬀerence to lack of vacancies and
impute the active hiring rate as the ratio of the implied hiring rate to the observed hiring rate. In practice, the active
hiring rate is solved simultaneously with the other parameters of the model since they are not independent. We estimate
the active hiring rate at 40.4%; that is, 4 in 10 applicants are hired when a vacancy is present.
  37
     It would be highly surprising to find that tests are more informative than interviews since the item response data
gathered by the personality test appear (to us) crude relative to the nuances of attitude and behavior observable during
interviews.

     We sketch the procedure here, with further detals available in an unpublished appendix.

   6. To obtain analogous outcomes under the test-based regime, we repeat steps (3) through (5),
         making two modifications to the procedure. First, we replace firms’ interview-based posterior
         productivity assessments with their test-based posterior productivity assessments (see equa-
         tion (4)).39 Second, when performing the simulated hiring process in step (4), we replace the
         interview-based hiring threshold with a test-based hiring threshold that generates an identical
         number of hires at each store.

   7. In the final step, we compare the race composition and productivity of hires (overall and by
         race) under the interview-based and test-based regimes. Since the distribution of ability and the
         hiring rate are identical at each store under each regime, a comparison of (simulated) hiring and
         productivity outcomes under these two regimes provides an estimate of the pure screening eﬀect
         of testing on equality and eﬃciency.

       This baseline procedure simulates the case where both interviews and tests are unbiased. It must
be slightly extended to explore cases where test or interview biases are present. Table II shows that
applicants from the majority group score significantly higher on the job test than applicants from the
minority group. We accordingly consider two cases for test bias: in the first case, tests are unbiased
and, by implication, minority applicants are on average less productive than majority applicants; in
the second case, we assume that job tests are majority-favoring while minority and majority applicants
have the same average productivity.40
       We allow for the possibility of interview bias in a parallel fashion. Because the data provide no
guidance on the possible sign of interview bias, we consider three cases: no bias, minority-favoring
bias, and majority-favoring bias. In the unbiased case, the interview signal is equal to η = y + εη ,
as above. In the minority-favoring case, the interview signal additionally includes an additive bias
term that precisely oﬀsets the mean test score diﬀerences between minority and majority applicants.
Conversely, in the majority-favoring case, the interview signal contains a bias of equal magnitude and
opposite sign to the minority-favoring case.
       These assumptions give rise to six permutations of the simulation: two cases of testing bias (unbi-
ased and majority-favoring) permuted with three cases of interview bias (unbiased, minority-favoring
and majority-favoring). For each scenario, we perform 1, 000 trials of the simulation to obtain mean
outcomes and bootstrapped standard errors, equal to the standard deviation of outcomes across trials.
  39
      These test-based posteriors diﬀer from the interview-based posteriors only in that they incorporate both interview
and test signals.
   40
      Since we do not know the true mean ability of each applicant group–only the group’s mean test score–we make the
following ancillary assumptions: if job tests are unbiased, mean ability for each applicant group is equal to the groups’s
mean test score. If job tests are majority favoring, mean ability for each applicant group is equal to the White mean.



                                                           28
Because our focus is on Black-White diﬀerences, we discuss and tabulate results for only these two
groups. Hispanics are included in the simulation, however.

B       Simulation results

Table IX summarizes the simulation results. Columns 1 through 6 present the simulated productivity
and hiring eﬀects of testing under each of the six scenarios considered. For comparison, column 7 lists
the actual outcome statistics for each productivity and hiring measure (from Tables I, VI and VII).
The bottom row of each panel provides chi-squared statistics for the goodness of fit of the simulated
outcomes to their observed counterparts.41
       As shown in column 7, prior to the use of job testing, the unconditional mean job spell duration
gap between White and Black hires was 45 days. Our analysis found that testing raised mean White
and Black job spell durations by 23 days each, leading to no change in the productivity gap. Testing
also yielded no significant change in the racial composition of hires, though our point estimates suggest
a increase in the White employment share of 0.24 percentage points. How do the simulation results
compare to the actual outcomes?
       Only one of the six simulation scenarios closely corresponds to the data. This is the case where
interviews and job tests are unbiased and average White productivity exceeds average Black produc-
tivity (column 1). Under this scenario, the simulation predicts a gain of 18.6 and 19.9 days respectively
for White and Black job spells, as compared to an observed rise of 23.2 days. The simulation further
implies a 52 day gap in mean job spell duration between White and Black applicants hired using the
informal screen, as compared to the observed diﬀerence of 44.9 days. A chi-squared test of goodness
of fit of these estimates (bottom row of panel A) readily accepts the null of equality between the
observed and simulated statistics (p = 0.50). Alongside these productivity impacts, the simulation
predicts a small rise in Black employment (panel B). This predicted value does not diﬀer significantly
from the small observed decline in Black employment.42 An omnibus test of goodness of fit for both
productivity and employment outcomes (panel C) accepts the null at p = 0.33.
       It is also instructive to consider the cases that do not fit the observed outcomes. The alternative
scenario that comes closest to matching the data is one in which job interviews are biased towards
  41
    To compare each simulated statistic with its observed value, we calculate the following chi-square square statistic
with one degree of freedom:                       #                        $2
                                          2             [sim − obs]
                                         χ (1) =                              .
                                                        2
                                                    (SEsim  + SEo2b s )1/2
To calculate pooled summary tests for each simulation scenario, we sum the χ2 statistics and the degrees of freedom (thus,
treating each statistic as independent). When performing pooled tests, we exclude redundant statistics. For example,
we include the changes in White and Black productivity but exclude the change in the Black-White productivity gap.
  42
     We have also performed goodness of fit tests for changes in log-odds of hiring rather than changes in employment
shares. Results are similar to those tabulated but statistical power is lower.


                                                           29
whites, the job test is unbiased and the expected productivity of White applicants exceeds that of
Black applicants (column 2). As in the prior case, the simulation suggests comparable tenure gains
for Whites and Blacks of 20.4 and 19.7 days.43 Here, however, the predicted initial productivity
gap of 30.1 days falls far short of the observed diﬀerence of 44.9 days. Where this scenario departs
most substantially from the data, however, is in its predictions for minority hiring. Because the job
test is assumed to be relatively minority-favoring, the simulation predicts a substantial gain in Black
employment, leading to a closing of the White-Black employment gap of 4.1 percentage points. This
prediction is rejected by the data since the actual change in White-Black employment is negligible.
    A second scenario of particular interest is shown in Column 3. Here, the informal screen is minority-
favoring, the job test is unbiased (thus, the job test is relatively biased against minorities) and average
White productivity exceeds average Black productivity. As per the Introduction, this is the focal case
where job testing could produce a disparate impact–reducing Black hiring while raising productivity
diﬀerentially for Blacks hires (as well as overall). Consistent with expectations, the simulation predicts
a significant diﬀerential gain in job duration of 6.3 days for Black relative to White hires and a small
decline in Black employment. In practice this scenario is rejected by the data (p = 0.00) since there
was neither a diﬀerential gain in Black productivity nor a fall in Black hiring. We therefore reject the
presence of an equality-eﬃciency trade-oﬀ in this setting.
    Consider finally the cases in columns 4 through 6, where Black and White applicants are assumed
to have identical mean productivity. These scenarios are at odds with the data in one key respect:
all predict substantially smaller minority-majority gaps in initial productivity than are observed in
the data; in two of three cases, these gaps are of the wrong sign. This pattern underscores that it
is diﬃcult to square the hypothesis that minority and majority applicants have the same underlying
productivity with the fact that job spell durations of minority hires are substantially shorter than
those of majority hires. To reconcile these two observations, one must assume, as in column 6, that
job interviews are heavily minority-favoring. Under this assumption, however, job testing is predicted
to substantially raise White employment, which does not occur.
    In net, the simulation results reject each of the scenarios considered except one in which both
job interviews and job tests are unbiased and White applicants are on average more productive than
Black applicants. This leads us to conclude that job testing increased the precision of worker selection
without yielding disparate impacts because both job interviews and job tests were unbiased.
  43
     Given that the job test in this scenario is relatively biased towards minorities, one may wonder why the model does
not predict a greater rise in the productivity of White relative to Black hires. We do not have a precise answer to
this question, but believe it stems from the fact that the distribution of Black productivity is relatively flat near the
hiring threshold. Thus, a marginal increase in the selectivity of Black hires does not yield a substantial change in the
productivity of black hires.

VII       Conclusion

An influential body of research concludes that the use of standardized job tests for employment
screening poses an intrinsic equality-eﬃciency trade-oﬀ: testing improves selection but reduces mi-
nority hiring. We develop a simple conceptual model that demonstrates that this equality-eﬃciency
trade-oﬀ is only unambiguously present when job tests counter pre-existing screening biases favoring
minority applicants. By contrast, if job tests are unbiased relative to the screens they supplement,
there is no equality-eﬃciency trade-oﬀ–gains in productivity do not come at a cost of lower minority
hiring. Since we see little reason to suspect that existing informal screens are minority-favoring or that
job tests are more biased against minorities than are informal screens, we believe that the presumed
equality-eﬃciency trade-oﬀ likely to be largely irrelevant in practice.
    We studied the evidence for an equality-eﬃciency trade-oﬀ in employment testing at a large, geo-
graphically dispersed retail firm whose 1, 363 stores switched over the course of one year from informal,
paper-based hiring to a computer-supported screening process that relies heavily on a standardized
personality test. The advent of employment testing increased productivity, raising mean and median
employee tenure by 10 to 12 percent and slightly lowering the frequency of terminations for cause.
Consistent with expectations, minority applicants performed significantly worse on the employment
test. Had the informal screen that predated testing been comparatively minority-favoring such that
it masked underlying majority/minority diﬀerences in average productivity, our model suggests that
employment testing would have slightly diminished Black employment and raised the productivity
of Black hires by approximately 40 percent more than it raised the productivity of White hires. In
point of fact, we detect no change in the racial composition of hires and, moreover, productivity gains
were equally large among minority and majority hires. These findings, paired with evidence from a
parametric simulation of our theoretical model, lead us to conclude that both the job test and the
informal screen were unbiased. Thus, job testing did not pose an equality-eﬃciency trade-oﬀ because
the job test raised screening precision without introducing bias.44
    In considering the external validity of these findings, several caveats are in order. First, our data
come from only one large retailer. Since retail firms in the U.S. operate in a competitive environment,
we might anticipate that other firms would respond similarly. Nevertheless, analysis of other cases
is clearly warranted. A second caveat is that the between-group diﬀerences in test scores found
  44
     A final alternative interpretation of the findings is that minority and majority workers are equally productive but
that the productivity measures are themselves contaminated by race bias. In this case, our findings would indicate only
that the job test was unbiased relative to the informal screen but not necessarily unbiased in a cardinal sense. While
we cannot dismiss this alternative hypothesis using available data, previous studies that benchmark standardized tests
scores against objective productivity measures in civilian and military settings find no evidence to suggest that such tests
are race-biased [Hartigan and Wigdor, 1989; Wigdor and Green, 1991; and Jencks and Philips, 1998, chapter 2].



                                                            31
by the employment test used at this firm are not as large as diﬀerences found on other standard
ability tests such as the Armed Forces Qualification Test. This fact limits the power of our analysis
to distinguish competing scenarios, and one might posit that an alternative employment test that
revealed larger group productivity diﬀerences might potentially generate disparate impacts. Although
we do not discount this possibility, we generally expect that employers will account for expected
group productivity diﬀerences. Hence, a test that reveals large disparities on some measure should not
necessarily pose an equality-eﬃciency trade-oﬀ. Moreover, employment testing guidelines issued by the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission make it legally precarious for firms to use employment
tests that ‘pass’ minority applicants at less than 80 percent of the pass-rate of majority applicants.
Hence, employment tests will not generally show greater group diﬀerences than those found here.
    An important final point of interpretation is that our results speak only to firms’ private gains
from improved worker selection. The extent to which these private gains translate into social benefits
depends on the mechanism by which testing improves selection. If testing improves the quality of
matches between workers and firms, the attendant gains in allocative eﬃciency are likely to raise social
welfare [Costrell and Loury 2004]. By contrast, if testing primarily redistributes ‘desirable’ workers
among competing firms where they would have comparable marginal products, social benefits will be
decidedly smaller than private benefits [cf. Stiglitz, 1975; Lazear, 1986; Masters, 2006]. Moreover,
since testing itself is costly, the net social benefits in the pure screening case could potentially be
negative. Though our results provide little guidance as to which of these scenarios is most relevant, it
appears unlikely that the social benefits from testing exceed the private benefits. Quantifying these
social benefits is an important area for research.

Suppose there is no formal testing. Decompose η ∗ as η ∗ = η + ν η (x); an applicant from group x is

hired iﬀ μ(x, η ∗ ) > κI , where μ(x, η ∗ ) =   hI η + hI [μ0 (x)+ν η (x)]   = μ(x, η)+ν η (x). Thus the applicant
is hired iﬀ

Since we can decompose η as η = y + εη , with εη ∼ N (0, 1/hη ) and independent of y, the distribution

   We will also need to make use of the following lemma:

B    Claim III.D.1

      Testing reduces the majority/minority hiring gap (unbiased case with minority applicants
      less productive than majority applicants).

    Assume without loss of generality that x1 is the more productive group, and let γ 1 = Eη,s [Hire|x1 ]−
Eη [Hire|x1 ] and γ 2 = Eη,s [Hire|x2 ] − Eη [Hire|x2 ]. A constant hiring rate implies that testing either
leaves hiring of both groups unaﬀected or moves the hiring rate of each group by equal but opposite
amounts (either γ 1 , γ 2 = 0 or γ 1 = −γ 2 6= 0). We note that ∆γ can be expressed as ∆γ = γ 1 − γ 2 .
    The introduction of testing without a change in bias is identically equal to a rise in screening
precision. We can therefore sign ∆γ by diﬀerentiating γ 1 and γ 2 with respect to ρT , bearing in mind
that the screening threshold, κT , also depends upon screening precision. This derivative is:


                                       ∂
                                γx =       [1 − Φ (zT (x))]
                                      ∂ρT
                                                 ∙                 ¸
                                                   zT (x) ∂κT /∂ρT
                                    = φ (zT (x))         −           ,
                                                     ρT     ρT σ 0

where zT (x) ≡ [κT − μ0 (x)]/σ 0 ρT . Since φ (·) > 0 and zT (x1 ) < zT (x2 ), it cannot be the case
that γ 1 and γ 2 are simultaneously equal to zero. Therefore SignhzT (x1 ) − [∂κT /∂ρT ] /σ 0 i = − Sign
hzT (x2 ) − [∂κT /∂ρT ] /σ 0 i. Given that zT (x1 ) < zT (x2 ), we conclude that γ 1 < 0, γ 2 > 0 and
∆γ = γ 1 − γ 2 < 0. Testing therefore raises minority hiring or, more generally, raises hiring of the
group with lower average productivity.




                                                         35
C    Claim III.D.2

      The eﬀect of testing on the productivity gap approaches zero as the proportion of applicants
      hired approaches zero (unbiased case).

    We can write

                   ∆π = σ 0 ρT [λ(zT (x1 )) − λ(zT (x2 ))] − σ 0 ρI [λ(zI (x1 )) − λ(zI (x2 ))].




Define
                                                                     ∆μ0
                                    αT    = zT (x1 ) − zT (x2 ) = −          ,
                                                                     σ 0 ρT
                                                                    ∆μ0
                                    αI    = zI (x1 ) − zI (x2 ) = −        .
                                                                    σ 0 ρI


Now consider taking limits as K → 0; as K → 0, zT (x2 ) → ∞ and zI (x2 ) → ∞ while αT and αI
remain fixed constants. Recall that lim λ(z) − z = 0, so that
                                         z→∞

                   lim   [λ(zj (x2 ) + αj ) − (zj (x2 ) + αj )] − [λ(zj (x2 )) − zj (x2 )] = 0
                zj (x2 )→∞
                                                  lim   [λ(zj (x2 ) + αj ) − λ(zj (x2 ))] = αj,
                                               zj (x2 )→∞



for j ∈ {T, I}. It follows that

                                         lim ∆π = σ 0 ρT αT − σ 0 ρI αI
                                       K→0
                                                   = ∆μ0 − ∆μ0
                                                   = 0.

Figure III note.

In the simulation, nine percent of applicants are hired, the productivity (equivalently ability) of majority
applicants is distributed N(0,0.27), the productivity of minority applicants is distributed N(-0.19,0.27), the
precision of the interview signal is 1/0.45 and the precision of the job test ranges from 1/10,000 to
1/0.0001 corresponding to a correlation between test scores and applicant ability of (0,1). These values are
chosen to match estimates from the parametric simulation of the model in Section 6 of the text. In panel
(A), both interviews and tests are mean-consistent with true applicant ability. In panel (B), the job test is
mean-consistent with the true applicant ability and interviews are mean-biased in favor of minority
applicants by +0.19.
