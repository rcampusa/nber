Homework in Monetary Economics: Inflation, Home Production, and the Production of Homes

                                              ABSTRACT

We study models incorporating money, household production, and investment in housing. Inflation,
as a tax on market activity, encourages substitution into household production, and thus investment
in household capital. Hence, inflation increases the (appropriately deflated) value of the housing stock.
This is documented in various data sources. A calibrated model accounts for a fifth to a half of the
observed relationships. While this leaves much to be explained, it demonstrates the channel is economically
relevant. We also show models with home production imply higher costs of inflation than models
without it, especially when home and market goods are close substitutes.

   It is sometimes heard that housing is a good hedge against inflation. Is this true? And,

if so, one might ask where and when — i.e., in what countries and time periods — and of

course, one might want to know why? To address these issues we think that one needs to

look carefully at the data, build a rigorous theoretical model, and apply it quantitatively.

This paper presents the results of our eﬀorts in that endeavor.

   Using various data sources, mainly for the U.S., although we also look at other countries,

we find that appropriately deflated values of the housing stock are positively related to both

inflation and nominal interest rates. While one may be able to think of diﬀerent ways to

interpret this fact, we pursue the following idea. In any reasonable monetary model, inflation

is a tax on market activity as long as cash is used in at least some market transactions.

Thus, inflation leads agents to substitute out of market and into nonmarket activity, and in

particular into household production — e.g., when inflation is higher, people go out less and

eat more meals at home, given that going out is cash intensive. Of course not all market

activity uses cash, but it uses cash more than household production, since home-produced

goods (like home-cooked meals) are generally not even traded, let alone traded using currency.

Hence, inflation increases demand for inputs to household production, including time, and

also capital, such as appliances and housing itself. In this way, inflation increases the value

of the housing stock — perhaps mostly through prices in the short run, and more in quantities

as supply catches up, but either way it increases.

   We formalize this reasoning by integrating the literature on the microfoundations of

monetary exchange, the literature incorporating household production into macro, and the

literature that models housing explicitly.1 This is motivated by much previous work showing

that incorporating home production into otherwise standard nonmonetary macro models has

     For surveys on the microfoundations of monetary economics, see Nosal and Rocheteau (2011) or
Williamson and Wright (2010); our setup is closest to Aruoba et al. (2011), which is a generalization
of Lagos and Wright (2005). As an independent contribution to monetary economics, this is the first paper
we know that builds an explicit retail sector into the framework. On home production, there are surveys by
Greenwood et al. (1995) and Gronau (1997), but we review many of the more recent contributions below.
We also review some of the literature on housing; as a preview, we follow Davis and Heathcote (2005).

                                                    1
significant eﬀects.2 We use our setup to formalize the economic intuition described above, to

organize the empirical findings, and to measure the eﬀects of inflation. The last application

is natural, since it is well known that home production models can give diﬀerent quantitative

answers, compared to models without home production, to other policy questions. We want

to see if it makes a diﬀerence for a classic monetary policy question: what is the cost of

anticipated inflation?

   In our theory, housing capital is valued as an input to household production, like market

capital is valued as an input to market production in standard macro. We first prove several

analytic results, then ask how well calibrated versions of the model capture the empirical

findings. The model accounts for a sizable fraction, but not all, of the relationship between

appropriately deflated measures of value of the housing stock, on the one hand, and inflation

or nominal interest rates, on the other, while matching several additional observations of

interest. To be precise, we can account for between a fifth to a half of the key relation-

ships, depending on details. While this leaves a significant amount to be explained by other

channels, it demonstrates that the eﬀect we isolate is economically relevant. We also show

that models with home production imply a higher cost of inflation than models without it,

especially when home and market goods are relatively close substitutes,

   In terms of other work, several papers study the relation between stock markets and

inflation, which is similar in that equity and housing are both assets (see Geromichalos et

al. 2007 for references). Other papers analyze house prices and inflation explicitly through


   2
      By way of example, Benhabib et al. (1991) and Greenwood and Hercowicz (1991) put the ideas of Becker
(1965,1988) into dynamic general equilibrium, and show models with home production do a better job than
otherwise similar models matching key business-cycle moments. It has been shown that such models also
account better for consumption (Baxter and Jerrmann 1999; Baxter 2010; Aguiar and Hurst 2005,2007a),
investment (Gomme et al. 2001; Fisher 1997,2007), female labor-force participation (Greenwood et al. 2005;
House et al 2008; Albanesi and Olivetti 2009), and labor supply generally, including retirement and other
life-cycle issues (Rios-Rull 1993; Rupert et al. 2000; Gomme et al. 2004; Aguiar and Hurst 2007b; Ngai and
Pissarides 2008; Rogerson and Wallenius 2009). Home production models give diﬀerent answers to certain
policy questions, such as the impact of taxation (McGrattan et al. 1997; Rogerson 2009). They also do a
better job accounting for international diﬀerences in income, and provide a diﬀerent perspective on growth
and development (Einarsson and Marquis 1997; Parente et al. 2000).

                                                    2
the eﬀects on mortgages, including Kearl (1979), Follain (1982) and Poterba (1991). These

are complementary ideas, but we focus on diﬀerent channels. Brunnermeier and Juiliard

(2008) in particular assume “money illusion” where agents confound nominal and real interest

rates, which may ring true, but we want to see how far we can get with rational agents.

An innovative recent paper by Burnside et al. (2011) also studies housing markets with

departures from standard rational expectations assumptions, but again we want to see how

far we can get without this. He et al. (2011) show how housing can bear a liquidity premium,

because home equity can be used to collateralize loans. We are after diﬀerent issues, and

abstract from home equity loans. As we remark below, this suggests concentrating on data

prior to 2000, before the use of home equity loans rose dramatically, but we still show data

pre- and post-2000. Similar in spirit is work by Piazessi and Schneider (2010), who study how

portfolios adjust when inflation taxes returns to financial assets but not housing. In terms

of diﬀerentiating our product, we incorporate household production explicitly, allowing us

to take advantage of many theoretical and empirical results in home production research.3

    Section 1 discusses the data. Section 2 presents the theoretical framework, and Section 3

defines equilibrium. Section 4 presents a simplified version of the model and derives analytic

results. Section 5 presents the numerical analysis. Section 6 concludes.


1       Data

Here we make the case that the value of home capital, scaled by either nominal output or the

money supply, is positively related to inflation and nominal interest rates. We obviously have

to scale by something, to correct for purely nominal increases in value, and we emphasize

that our theory is about more than the idea that inflation makes prices go up. Our model

    3
      Also, we mention here that although our model has frictional goods markets, housing is traded in
frictionsless markets, just like capital is traded in standard growth theory. The growing body of research
on frictional housing markets includes Wheaton (1990), Albrecht et al. (2007), Caplin and Leahy (2008),
Coulson and Fisher (2009), Ngai and Tenreyro (2009), Novy-Marx (2009), Piazzesi and Schneider (2009),
and Head and Lloyd-Ellis (2010).

predicts the value of home capital over nominal output, and of home capital over the money

supply, both increase with inflation or nominal interest rates. We first show this is true

in the U.S., then examine other countries. We consider several measures of the value of

home capital, each defined by an estimate of housing wealth (price times quantity), plus

the stock of durable goods from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). We add durables

since we think of home capital more broadly than just housing, even if housing is the biggest

component — i.e., around 75%. We describe the diﬀerent approaches to measuring housing

wealth in some detail here, but more information on data sources is given in the Appendix.

1.1    United States

Our first estimate of housing wealth uses data from Davis and Heathcote (2007), DH for short.

This is a relatively short sample, starting in 1975, but provides a very accurate measure.

Figure 1 shows time series and color-coded scatter plots for home capital over nominal output

vs inflation and vs the nominal interest rate, as well as home capital over the money supply

vs inflation and vs the nominal rate. Our measure of output is GDP minus rents paid to

housing services, as in related studies on home production. Our measure of money is the

M1S series that adjusts M1 for the practice of banks since the 1990s of “sweeping” checkable

deposits into overnight money market accounts (Cynamon et al. 2006). For inflation we use

the appropriately adjusted GDP deflator, and for the nominal rate here we use T-bills. We

consider both inflation and interest rates, even though the Fisher Equation predicts they

should move together in theory, because they do not cohere perfectly in practice. Figure 1

also reports correlations, and semi-elasticities computed from regressing of the log of home

capital over GDP or home capital over M1S on inflation or interest rates. The black line

shows the predicted relationship 1975-1999, and the blue line shows it 2000-2009.

   It is apparent that something unusual — the housing bubble — happens in the 2000s relative

to the previous 25 years. Unlike some of the work mentioned in the Introduction, we do not



                                             4
have much to say in this paper about the post-2000 U.S. housing boom and bust, and there

may well have been something going on that our model is not designed to capture (see, e.g.,

Burnside et al. 2011, Mian and Sufi 2011, He et al. 2011 and references therein). Therefore

it may be reasonable to concentrate more on “normal” times, by ending the sample at 1999,

but we do not want to hide anything, and so we still show what happened after 2000. From

1975 to 1999, home capital over GDP and home capital over M1S are obviously positively

correlated with both inflation and interest rates. This is also true after 2000, but that decade

simply looks diﬀerent. Over the whole sample, 1975-2009, there is not much of a correlation,

but not because there is no relationship — rather, because the positive relationship rotates

or shifts, depending on whether we look at inflation or interest rates.

   Our second measure of housing wealth uses data from the Flow of Funds Accounts (FFA).

An advantage of FAA data is that they go back to 1952, although as is common in macro we

prefer to start in 1955, post Korean war. In any case, we believe FFA data do not provide

the best estimates of the house values in 1975-1990, which is a key period for our analysis

because it has a lot of variation in inflation. This is because the housing capital gains implied

by the FFA data in this period do not align well with capital gains computed using standard

price indexes. Unlike the DH data, where capital gains are taken directly from price indexes,

for this period FFA data spline together estimates from various surveys. With this caveat

in mind we show the results in Figure 2. There little correlation between home capital over

GDP and inflation prior to 2000, although the relationship is positive after 2000, and it

is positive in both periods for home capital over GDP and interest rates. The correlation

between home capital over M1S and either inflation or interest rates is also positive in both

periods, and again one can see a rotation or shift post 2000. So, even if we are less confident

in this data, the basic pattern is similar.

   Our third measure is based on the replacement cost of structures estimated by the BEA,

as used in, e.g., McGrattan et al. (1997). A disadvantage of these data is that they do not


                                               5
include the value of land, which prior to 1970 was between 10 to 20 percent and is currently

about a third of aggregate housing value (Davis and Heathcote 2007). The advantage is that

they are constructed according to well-documented methods, and go back to the 1930s. It

is not clear, however, what to make of data that far back, where the situation is confounded

by the Great Depression, as well as some swings in inflation having to do with price controls

and wars. Given these caveats, Figure 3 shows the BEA data.4 In this case the regression

lines come from splitting the sample between 1930-1954 and 1955-1999 (although we show

the data to 2009). For home capital over GDP vs inflation, the relationship in the latter

(earlier) period is slightly positive (negative) For home capital over GDP vs interest rates,

the correlation is positive in both subsamples. For home capital over M1S vs inflation the

relationship in the latter (earlier) period is strongly positive (slightly negative). For home

capital over M1S vs interest rates, the relationship between home capital over M1S and

interest rates is remarkably strong in both periods, with correlation coeﬃcients around 0.9.

    Our fourth and final measure of housing wealth is computed directly from the Decennial

Censuses of Housing (DCH). The advantages are that these numbers are very accurate,

and go back to 1930, although of course we have only one observation every 10 years, so

we interpolate between data points. In Figure 4, the regression lines in the scatters are

from splitting the sample between 1930-1954 and 1955-1999. For home capital over GDP vs

inflation, again the relationship in the latter (earlier) period is slightly positive (negative).

For home capital over GDP vs interest rates it is always positive. For home capital over

M1S vs inflation the relationship is positive (slightly negative) in the latter (earlier) period.

For home capital vs the nominal interest rate the relationship is again remarkably strong in

both periods.5 We are mostly interested in what happens post 1955, and do not have a lot

   4
       Since here we go back to the 1930s, the interest rate uses AAA corporate bonds. If we use these instead
of T-bill rates for Figures 1 and 2, there is little change before 2000, although there is some change after
2000 (which is not too surprising given so few post-2000 observations).
     5
       We remark that the relationship between housing and interest rates is generally more clear than the
relationship between housing and inflation. One reason may be that nominal rates better reflect perceptions
of long-term inflation than actual reported inflation rates, especially in periods with price controls.

                                                      6
to say about the Depression, major wars or price controls. Once we move past those events

there is a clear relationship between the variables in question.

   To make one more point, Figure 5 shows Shiller’s (2005) house price index (HPI) series,

focusing on post-1955. Over this period, HPI declines secularly relative to GDP and M1S,

rendering correlations uninformative. More importantly, Table 1 reconciles decade-by-decade

changes in HPI and housing wealth. Column 1 reports HPI growth; Column 2 reports growth

in the average price of housing units; Column 3 reports growth in the number of units; and

Column 4 reports growth in nominal GDP. The percentage change in the value of housing

is approximately Column 2 plus Column 3. Columns 1 and 2 show average prices increase

faster than the HPI in every decade. This is because Shiller’s data holds housing quality

constant, and the gap between Columns 1 and 2 reflects quality improvement. Also, Shiller’s

data do not track changes in the number of units, which increased rapidly over the period

(Column 3). To sum up, Columns 2 and 3 show the change in housing wealth between 1950

and 2000 is 528 percent, about the same the 517 percent change in nominal GDP. The HPI

increased only 284 percent, about half the change in housing wealth. Given this, the HPI is

less useful for our purposes than it might be for others. Also, this may explain why people

who focus on Shiller’s data have not noticed the facts we document in the other sources.

   To reiterate, we are interested in the value of home capital scaled by either GDP or

M1S, and we want to know how this is related to inflation and interest rates, because our

theory makes strong predictions about that. We are less interested in house prices, or house

prices relative to general consumer prices, because as we show theory makes less definitive

predictions about that. Several U.S. data sets indicate that appropriately scaled values of

home capital are positively related to inflation and interest rates. Although the exact semi-

elasticities vary, the pattern is usually quite clear, and when it is less clear, like in the earlier

half of the last century, this may be due to events like the Depression, major wars and price

controls.


                                                 7
1.2     Other Countries

Data on housing wealth prior to 1990, and certainly prior to 1980, are virtually nonexistent

outside the U.S. However, various estimates of prices have been constructed for several

countries. As we said, we prefer price times quantity, but for most countries prices are all

we have. Figure 6 presents house prices over GDP vs inflation for 16 countries, where now

we do not distinguish the 2000s since the boom and bust is less apparent in these economies.

We have direct source data for Belgium, France, Ireland, Switzerland and the UK. For the

remaining countries, we use 1971-2009 data from the Bank for International Settlements

(BIS) (see Andre 2010). We are less sure about these data, since we do not know the

original sources, but we checked price growth from the BIS against source data for the five

economies mentioned above, and they align well, giving us some confidence. The bottom

line is that there is a positive relationship in 13 out of the 16 countries.

    To conclude, virtually every source of information we could find — and we made an eﬀort

to cast our net widely — points to similar conclusions. There is a positive relationship between

house prices over GDP or over the money supply, on the one hand, and inflation or nominal

interest rates, on the other hand. This is clear at least for the US, and we did what we could

for other countries. The rest of the paper presents one way of accounting for this evidence.6


2       Model

Time is discrete and continues forever. Each period has two subperiods, with a distinct set

of markets, as discussed below. This temporal structure is natural, since it allows house-

holds to adjust home production after realizing the outcome of their stochastic retail market

experience. There is a [0 1] continuum of homogeneous households, a [0 ] continuum of

retail firms, and a set of production firms, the cardinality of which does not matter due to

    6
     Jeﬀ Campbell asked whether one should interpret these findings in terms of a moment — a repeated
pattern in the time series — or an event — one big rise and fall in postwar inflation, and suggested the evidence
may be even more compelling from the latter point of view. We are agnostic.

                                                       8
constant returns. There is also a government that controls the money supply  and levies

a lump sum tax  . In the first subperiod’s market, production firms hire labor and capital

from households at nominal factor prices  and , to make output . Households purchase 

for direct consumption, and for investment in home and market capital. Retailers purchase

 and transform it into a diﬀerent good , to sell to households in the market that convenes

in the second subperiod.

   Households discount at rate  = 1 − 1  0 across periods, but not across subperiods,

without loss of generality. Within-period utility is


                                  (     ) −   −   


where  ,  and  are consumption in the first market, consumption in the second (retail)

market, and nonmarket (home) consumption, while  and  are market and nonmarket

labor hours. Having utility linear in labor keeps the analysis tractable. For some of what

we do, we shut down  so that there are only two goods, but it is useful to bring  back

for quantitative work, as it is important for matching velocity observations. Also, in the

quantitative work we consider two specific functional forms, but for now we keep a general

specification  (·), satisfying the usual monotonicity and convexity assumptions.

   There are two nominal assets: money , which is is used as a medium of exchange;

and a bond , the role of which is merely to compute an interest rate — i.e.,  need not be

traded in equilibrium, but we can still price it. There are three real assets: market capital  ,

residential structures  , and land  . As is standard,  is an input to the market production

function  (   ). There is also a nonmarket production function  (   ), where  is

nonmarket capital, which in the theoretical discussion we call housing even though in the

empirical analysis we add consumer durables. Housing combines residential structures and

land according to  =  (   ). One could alternatively say that home production has

three inputs, labor, structures and land, but for our purposes we want housing to be an


                                                 9
explicit function of  and  . Market capital and structures depreciate at rates   and   ,

while land does not depreciate and it’s fixed supply is normalized to 1. The technologies

 (·),  (·) and  (·) are strictly increasing, concave and homogeneous of degree 1.

    While the first-subperiod market is frictionless, the retail market has search-type frictions.

There are two distinct locations, one where agents have access to record keeping, and another

where they do not. The measures of households that get to trade in the first and second

locations are 1 and 2 , so  0 = 1 −  1 −  2 is the measure that do not get to trade at all. To

remember the notation, the  in  refers to the number of payment instruments available:

with probability 1 there is one, money; with probability  2 there two, money and credit; and

probability  0 there are none. Credit means acceptance by retailers of households’ promises,

to be honored in first-subperiod next period. When record keeping is not available, credit

is impossible and trade requires currency.7 We assume the same measure of retailers and

households trade in each location, and since the ratio of retailers to households is , a given

retailer trades in the credit market with probability  2 , and in the money market with

probability  1 . We assume that all agents are price takers in the retail markets.8

2.1     Households’ Problems

At the start of each period, a household’s state variable is a portfolio z = (       ),

plus outstanding debt from the previous period, . Given quasi-linear utility, without loss

in generality we assume all debt is paid oﬀ in the first subperiod. Let  (z ) and  (ẑ  )

be the value functions in the first and second subperiods. The first-subperiod problem is


                               (z ) = max {−  +  (ẑ  )}

                  st  +  + Ω =   + ̂ +  ̂ +  ̂ +  ̂ +  ̂ 

   7
     Since Kocherlakota (1998), we know it is imperfect record keeping that generates an essential role for
a medium of exchange. For more on why currency, and not, say, bonds or claims to capital, is used in this

     One can say they meet multilaterally in these markets, on islands, as in the Lucas-Prescott labor-search
model, instead of bilaterally, as in the Mortensen-Pissarides search-and-bargaining model.

    Eliminating  using the budget equation, we reduce the problem to

combined with  and  . The envelope conditions are

    In the second subperiod, three events may occur for households: with probability 0

they have no opportunity to trade in the retail market; with probability 1 they have an

opportunity to trade using money; and with probability 2 they have an opportunity to trade

using money or credit. Conditional on each event, the value function is denoted   (ẑ  ),

 = 0 1 2, and  (ẑ  ) = Σ     (ẑ  ). In what follows, we use two standard results: First,

in the money-only retail market households cash out — i.e., they bring no more money than

they plan to spend in the event that credit is unavailable. Second, when credit is available,

all agents are indiﬀerent between using credit or cash, so we assume they use credit only.

      Since ,  and  are the same physical good, they have the same price,  . Also, notice households
choose market work  in the first subperiod, but home work  is not decided until the second. Finally, one
can imagine that households build their own homes using purchases of  and  , but as we discuss below,
it is equivalent to have them buy houses from competitive construction firms.

                                                    11
    The second-subperiod problem is to choose consumption and home work, given what

happened in the retail market. For a household with no retail opportunity, 0 = 0,

And finally, for a household with a credit retail opportunity,

and the marginal benefit on the RHS, where said dollar is spent in the retail market with

probability  1 and carried into the next period with probability 1 −  1 . Also, (7) implies

where  = 0  − 1 is inflation. The real interest rate on a loan between the first subperiod

at  and  + 1 is , and if we define the nominal rate  via the Fisher Equation 1 +  =

(1 + ) (1 + ), (12) says  = 1 (1 + ) Agents are happy with any  iﬀ this holds.

2.2     Firms’ Problems

The representative production firm maximizes profit by hiring labor and capital,


                             Π = max {  ( ) −  − }                              (13)


where  and  are aggregates. The solution satisfies  =  1 ( ) and  =  2 ( ),

and Π = 0 by constant returns.

     Retail firms purchase  and convert it into  , where for simplicity the conversion is one

to one. They have an opportunity to sell it for money or credit in the retail market with

probabilities 1  and 2 , resp. Because we assume that unsold inventory fully depreciates

when the retail market closes, venders supply their wares inelastically, so 1 = 2 = 

(consumption is the same in the cash and credit markets). Therefore, expected retail profit

is
                                   n       1        2      o
                           Π = max −  +  1  +  2                               (14)
                                                    
     The first term on the RHS of (14) is the cost of inventories; the second is expected revenue

from cash sales, discounted by  = 1 (1 + ) since this can only be dispersed next period;

and the third is expected revenue from credit sales discounted the same way. The FOC is

                                            1        2
                                      =       1 +  2                               (15)

                                                13
Retailers are happy with any  as long as (15) holds, and Π = 0. To pay for , in the

first market, retailers issue bonds that households are happy to buy given  = 1 (1 + )

(although nothing interesting would change if, say, retailers instead issue equity).

2.3     Policy

Government controls the supply of money, which grows at rate . This can be implemented

either using the lump sum tax/transfer  , or by spending new money on  (with quasi-

linear utility, nothing depends on this except  ). Without loss of generality, we balance the

budget each period. We focus on stationary outcomes where all real variables are constant,

implying  = . Hence, it is equivalent to use the money growth rate or inflation rate as

a policy instrument. Since 1 +  = (1 + ) (1 + ), it is also equivalent to use the nominal

interest rate . Policy does not determine the real interest rate across periods; that is pinned

down by the preference parameter .


3     Equilibrium

We first show how to express all prices (        1  2 ) in terms of the allocation. To
                                                          ¡           ¢               ¡       ¢
begin with factor prices, we already know  = 1 ̄   and  = 1 ̄   , where

̄ is aggregate market hours and equilibrium requires  =  and ̄ = . Note that for

each household  =  (Ω) depends on their wealth at the start of the period, which diﬀers

according to their recent retail experience, but all we need to characterize macro equilibrium
        R
is ̄ =  (Ω). In terms of land, (10) implies it is priced by its capitalized value as an

input to housing, which is itself an input to home production,


                              = (1 − )−1 2 (   ) E (2 2 )  


Notice on the RHS we divide by  and multiply by the wage , to convert utility into

time and time into money. For bond prices, we already know  = 1 (1 + ) where  is



                                                  14
eﬀectively set by policy. For retail prices, in the cash market 1 1 = ̂ = (1 + ) , and in

the credit market we have the FOC 2 (  2  2 ) = 2  0 . Hence, 1 = (1 + ) 1

and 2 = (1 + ) 2 (  2  2 )  . Finally, from the retailers’ FOC (15) we get the price

level in the first subperiod,
                                                   1 1 +  2 2
                                            =                   
                                                     (1 + )
   This gives all prices as functions of the allocation. In fact, we can pare down the descrip-

tion of an allocation as follows. In terms of land, structures and housing, since  = 1 and

 =  (  1), we need only keep track of  . And in terms of consumption, 1 = 2 = 

and  = [   (  1)]. So we can fully describe an allocation by retail inventories, market

and home capital, and market and home work.

Nominal GDP is ( 1 1 +  2 2 ) + (   +    +  ). With  as a price index, real GDP

is

Velocity is  =  , and a standard notion of money demand is 1 =   (see, e.g.,

Lucas 2000). Finally, consider the price of a house  and value of the stock   , the em-

pirical objects discussed earlier. If we introduce competitive home builders, the allocation is

the same as if individuals build their own houses; yet we can still imagine builders combin-

ing land and structures according to household specifications to deliver  =  (   ). The

profit from this activity is


                                   Π =   (   ) −   −                               (24)


which is 0 in equilibrium. Hence,   =   +   and  = (  +   )  (   ).


4         Simple Model: Analytic Results

The general framework is complicated, because we are interested in some complicated issues,

but we can simplify it to convey the intuition. First, eliminate investment decisions by fixing

market capital and structures at  and  , with   =  = 0, so housing is fixed at

 =  (  1). Then to ease the presentation, for now, simplify household production by

setting  =  . Also, rather than trading  and  , households now trade  directly at

price  , and trade  at price  . Also set 2 = 0, so there is no retail credit, and ignore

bonds, so z = (    ). Finally, ignore  = 0 by writing utility as  (   ). Then the
     10
    Note    (a positive markup) due to search and inflation. This is one reason we are content to use
Walrasian pricing in this exercise, although we can imagine bringing back bargaining in future work.

they demand less given the relative price, so   must fall to clear the market. But when

where ̃  0. The second and third terms on the RHS are positive if home and market

goods are substitutes, while the first term is positive iﬀ − 11  1 . Hence, if households

are not too risk averse, inflation also increases  deflated by nominal GDP defined using

consumer prices.

    Of course, with  fixed, all the results about  can be restated as eﬀects on the value

of housing wealth   . We summarize all this as follows:

                                                                 18

   We are most interested in the eﬀects of  on housing wealth   , relative to either 

or GDP, as discussed above. The idea is that inflation aﬀects the economy in general, and

housing in particular, by creating an incentive to move economic activity out of the market

and into the home. We have shown how these eﬀects work qualitatively, and later we consider

their magnitude. Before the quantitative work, however, we mention that the analytic results

can be generalized to some degree, and sketch the extension to a general home technology

 =  (   ). For this we set  = 1 = 1 and still abstract from investment.

   Generalizing (28), we now get two equations in time use (   )

                                      £ ¡        ¢              ¤ ¡          ¢
                       (1 + )  = 1  ̄     (   ) 1 ̄                             (29)
                                           £ ¡        ¢              ¤

These conditions exhibit a nice symmetry between market and home time use, only broken

by exactly the channel we want to highlight: the former is taxed, while the latter is not

taxed, by inflation. It is routine to derive

                            (11 2 + 12 22 )        − 1 1 21
                            =                        and     =               

where ̂  0. Thus,  and  decrease with , while  and  increase iﬀ  and  are

substitutes. As before, the eﬀect of  on   is ambiguous, but

in the natural case where  and  are substitutes while  and  are compliments. We

can also show   increases with , and other results.

                                                          19
      We like the fact that this theory generates such clean analytic predictions, at least with

capital fixed. Even with endogenous investment, the model is still fairly tractable. Contin-

uing to set  1 = 1, with endogenous investment we have


                         (1 + )  = 1 [   (   )] 1 (   )

                              +   = 2 (   )

                              +   = 1 (   ) 2 [  (   )] 2 (   ) 


where  satisfies the obvious feasibility condition. If so inclined, one can also assume  is

endogenous but  fixed (or vice-versa) by dropping the final (penultimate) equation. While

some analytic results are available, at this stage computational methods are appropriate —

especially since we want the magnitudes, not just signs, of the relevant eﬀects.


5          General Model: Quantitative Results
                                                             1−                       1−
We use standard technologies:  (   ) =                    ,  (   ) =       and  (   ) =
         1−
            . We have three goods, (     ) and, as we mentioned above, we cannot drop

 if we want to match standard observations on velocity (something that obviously never

came up in nonmonetary home production models). Hence, we consider two specifications,

both of which seem a priori reasonable. In Calibration 1,  and  are perfect substitutes

and we identify them collectively as market consumption:13

                                                                                 1
                                    (     ) = log [( +  ) +  ] 


Here 1(1 − ) is the EOS between market and home goods. In Calibration 2, we use:


                               (     ) =  log ( ) + (1) log ( +  )

     13
     There is implicitly a constant multiplying  , but we can set it to 1 without loss of generality by a
choice of units.

                                                         20
Here  no longer directly captures the EOS we want to target, so we average (using ex-

penditure shares) the EOS between  and  , which is 1, and between  and  , which is

1 (1 − ).

    We use long-run observations to calibrate as many parameters as we can, and use prop-

erties of the empirical money demand curve, including its elasticity, for some others. Unless

otherwise noted, our targets are computed using US data, for the period 1975 to 1999 (since

we are not attempting to explain the housing bubble). The length of a period is a quarter,

although the results are robust to this choice. The average annual inflation rate and 3-month

T-bill rate are 413% and 680% in the sample, which yield  = 00066 and  = 00103. We

set  = 073 to match the value of residential structures plus durables relative to the value

of housing capital, and set   =   = 0015 for a 6% annual depreciation rate on both 

and  , all obtained using data discussed in Section 2. We set 2 = 051 , so that there are

half as many retail trades with credit as there are with money, based on data from the recent

Bank of Canada Methods of Payment Survey.14

    Since a key parameter is , as it governs the EOS between market and home goods, we

discuss this in some more detail. In their original home production macro model, Benhabib

et. al. (1991) argue for an EOS of 5. Estimates by Rupert et al. (1995) using PSID

data, however, yield numbers closer to 18 or 2. Estimates by McGrattan et al. (1995) using

aggregate time series and a DSGE model yield values between 15 and 18. Aguiar and Hurst

(2007a), using scanner and time-use data, estimate an EOS of 18 Chang and Schorfheide

(2003) using aggregate data get a slightly higher estimate of 23. While there is obviously no

unique definitive number, there is a consensus on a reasonable range, and as a compromise

we use an EOS of 18, the median of these estimates. In Calibration 1 this immediately

implies  = 044, while in Calibration 2 we need to calibrate  jointly with the remaining

  14
     See Arango and Welte (2012). To give a little more detail, the probabilities of using cash in any
transaction for single and married people are 55% and 48%, resp., and the probabilities of using credit cards
are 20% and 25%, resp., making  2 close to  1 2

                                                     21
parameters to match the EOS target.

    At this point, for Calibration 1 the parameters (           1 ), and for Cali-

bration 2 these plus , are calibrated to match the following targets. As is standard in the

literature (Greenwood et al. 1995) households work on average ̄ = 33% of their discre-

tionary time in the market and ̄ = 25% in the home, while market capital over annual

output is   = 207 and household capital over annual output is   = 196. For the

retail markup we target 30% based on data from the Annual Retail Trade Survey.15 Finally,

we match the level and slope of money demand, targeting an average annual velocity of

576 and a semi-elasticity of with respect to  of 256%, obtained using a standard log-linear

regression. While the parameters are calibrated jointly, heuristically  and  match the

targets for hours,  and  match the capital-output ratios,  matches the markup, 

matches the level of velocity and  1 matches its elasticity.

    The top panel of Table 2 report calibration results. In Calibration 2  is 083, which

implies a large EOS between  and  (coincidently, very nearly the value used in Benhabib

et. al. 1991), but maintains the target EOS between overall market and nonmarket con-

sumption of 18. In terms of the retail market, for Calibration 1 (2 is similar), the measure of

retailers is  = 022, and the measure of households that trade each period is 1 +  2 = 017.

Therefore (1 +  2 ) , or 78%, is the fraction of retail inventories sold each period, while

17% of households make a purchase in this market each period. Defining market expendi-

ture as   + 1 1 1 + 2 2 2 , about 15% of total market consumption is purchased in

the frictional retail market, while the rest is  ; this is largely driven by average velocity in

the data. To understand the importance of home production, we compute the percentage

increase in market consumption required to compensate for the loss if home consumption

set to 0. For households that are able to trade in the retail market, each period, market
  15
     We first saw this data discussed in Faig and Jerez (2005). To give more detail, at the low end (Warehouse
Clubs, Superstores, Automotive Dealers and Gas Stations), markups range from 17% to 21%; at the high
end (Specialty Foods, Clothing, Footware and Furniture), they range from 42% to 44%. We pick 30%, right
in the middle.

                                                     22
consumption has to increase by 77% to compensate for no home production. For households

that cannot trade in the retail market, this number is 152%. Hence, both retail and home

consumption are economically important.

5.1     Positive Results

We now ask how well the model accounts for the facts discussed in Section 1 — the relationship

between the inflation or nominal interest rate, on the one hand, and the value of home

capital over nominal output or over the money supply, on the other. Here we denote the

value of home capital over nominal output and over the money supply by  and .

These ratios are tightly connected to inverse velocity,  , by the relationship  =

 × . Since the average value of  and   are calibration targets, the average

value of  matches the data, by construction. The only elasticity we target is the semi-

elasticity of   with respect to the nominal rate, denoted    . The model generates

endogenously a semi-elasticity for  , denoted   , and the elasticity of  then

follows from   =   +    . We are mainly interested in seeing how the model

accounts for   .16

    We first compute the steady state for diﬀerent values of  in the data between 1975-

1999. This takes every year to be a steady state of the model with a particular , which is

obviously not strictly correct, due to the persistence of shocks and transitions. As we think

the theory is more relevant for medium- to longer-run observations, this may not be such

a bad approximation; in any case, studying shocks or transitional dynamics is beyond the

scope of this project. Then, among other statistics, for a particular variable of interest ,

we compute the relevant elasticity by regressing log ( ) on a constant and . Table 2 reports

the results and Figure 7 shows  ,  and  vs.  for Calibrations 1 and 2, as well

as the data. In Calibration 1 we get   = 023 and in Calibration 2 we get   = 055, or
   16
     One reason for this is something pointed out by Marcelo Veracierto: even if   does not move at all,
as long as real balances fall with , we get   right, at least qualitatively, by construction. It therefore
seems more interesting, and challenging, to focus on   .

                                                      23
21% and 50% of the semi-elasticities in the data, respectively.17 It obviously matters which

specification one uses: diﬀerent ways a disaggregating market consumption into  and 

are simply not equivalent, even when they are roughly similar in terms of their predictions

for the EOS. More work can be done to uncover which is a better specification.

   Given that we tend to think the theory is mainly relevant at medium-run frequencies, and

less relevant for business cycles, we do not expect to match all the fluctuations in the data.

But as Figure 7 shows, we capture the main long-run patterns fairly well. These findings

are robust. Changing the level of risk aversion from 1 to 12 or 2, e.g., has little eﬀect. Nor

does increasing the calibration frequency to monthly or even weekly. This is important, to

us, because it is one of the reasons for modeling retail as a frictional market. With a typical

cash-in-advance model, where households spend all their money each period, there is no way

to match velocity when the period is short. With our frictional retail market, we can shorten

the period length and keep everything else basically the same by scaling the arrival rates.

As regards the EOS target, varying this in the range 15 to 23 yields roughly similar results,

although as the EOS increases the fraction of   accounted for by the model increases. In

fact, if in Calibration 2 we use an EOS of 5, we can account for basically 100% of   . But

an EOS of 5 is too high, given the body of empirical work. We prefer to conclude that for a

reasonable EOS we can account for 20% − 50% of the relationship.

5.2     Normative Results

We are also interested in how inflation aﬀects welfare. There are two reasons for revisiting this

classic issue. First, it is well known that models with relatively explicit microfoundations

for money can generate bigger costs of inflation than reduced-form models. A standard

exercise is to compute the cost of 10% inflation as the amount of consumption households

would be willing to sacrifice to go from 10% to the Friedman rule, which means an inflation

  17
     When we consider   , the model accounts between 78% and 87% of the elasticity in the data, but
again we prefer to focus on   

                                                  24
rate consistent with a 0 nominal interest rate. A consensus estimate from reduced-form

analyses is that the answer is around 12 of 1%, while in various versions of the model in

Lagos and Wright (2005) the number can easily be closer to 5%, an order of magnitude

higher (see Aruoba et al. 2011 for references). Second, it is well known that incorporating

home production into otherwise standard models can have a big quantitative impact on fiscal

policy, so why not see if this is also the case for monetary policy?18

    Figure 8 shows how the equilibrium changes with inflation. Results are shown for the two

benchmark calibrations, as well as a version of the model with home production shut down.

Since inflation is a tax on money holdings, higher inflation reduces real money balances and

1 . Since 1 = 2 = , this also reduces demand by retailers for inventories, employment

and investment. In the model with no home production, market activity falls with inflation,

and this creates a loss in welfare. In the household production model households can make

up for some of the lost market consumption by increasing home consumption. In the end,

the cost of inflation is larger when home production is an option: going from 10% inflation

to the Friedman rule implies a welfare gain of 04% without home production, 053% in

Calibration 1, and 066% in Calibration 2.

    Hence inflation is more costly with home production, especially when home and market

goods are better substitutes. As in standard public finance, a household’s optimal behavior

in response to an increase in inflation is to reduce market and increase nonmarket activity.

Depending on the degree of substitutability, individual welfare may be minimally aﬀected by

this. But if all households do the same thing, aggregate demand for home capital and  

rise — e.g., by about 015% as inflation goes up from the Friedman rule to 10% in Calibration


  18
      In fact, the main reason for the big welfare eﬀects in Lagos-Wright models is that they use bargaining,
rather competitive pricing. Bargaining power can be calibrated to match the markup, which would be 0
with competitive pricing. With a markup calibrated to the data, bargaining introduces what is sometimes
called a hold-up problem in money demand, which, in our notation, reduces  below the eﬃcient level even
at the Friedman rule. In this paper, even with competitive pricing we get a markup. Although it may be
worth incorporating noncompetitive pricing in the future, here we ask how home production aﬀects the cost
of inflation without the complication of hold-up problems.

                                                     25
1. Due to these general equilibrium eﬀects, the increase in home consumption does not

completely make up for the loss in market consumption. In Calibration 2  responds

significantly more, due to the higher substitutability between  and  , and households

increase their demand for housing so much that   grows by about three times as much

as in Calibration 1. While there is room for more work on this important topic, we want to

simply make one point: microfoundations matter for quantitative policy issues, not just for

aesthetics, and this is true for both the microfoundations of monetary economics and the

microfoundations of household behavior.


6    Conclusion

Many people these days seem interested in housing. Our view is that housing is household

capital, and it only makes sense to study this by specifying how this capital enters the

home production function, exactly as we study investment in market capital by specifying

how it enters into the market production function. We began by asking if housing is a

good hedge against inflation. The answer is yes, in this sense: when inflation is high, and

hence one’s money is worth less, the value of the housing stock is high. In terms of hard

data, we documented that appropriately-deflated values of the housing stock, measured using

various sources, go up with inflation or nominal interest rates. In terms of theory, we proved

analytically the model is consistent with this finding. Numerical work shows the model

accounts for a reasonable portion of the key observations, between 20% and 50%, depending

on which version one uses. Clearly it matters which utility function one uses, and this is

worth further study. In any case, although we can account for a relevant fraction of the

observations under study, there a lot left to be explained, and hence more to be done in

future work.
