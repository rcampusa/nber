               Investment Patterns and Financial Leverage



                                ABSTRACT



      This study Investigates the influence of the type of Investment

opportunities facing a firm on its choice of capital structure. It Is

shown that the more discretionary Investment opportunities a firm faces,

the lower its financial leverage. Inclusion of other possible

determinants of capital structure, such as availability of internal

funds, tax effects and risk, while significant, do not affect the

importance of discretionary investment. The evidence supports (1) the

existence of a moral bazzard problem which inversely relates risky debt

and discretionary investment choice, and (2) a desire by most firms to

use sources of internal funds prior to entering the capital market.

1. Introduction

       The effect of capital structure on firm value has been a subject of

controversy over the years. Most early work, such as Modigliani and Miller

(1q58), showed that when capital markets are      perfect   and investment policy is

         capital structure is irrelevant to firm value. Later studies
ficed,
IModigliani and Miller (1963), Baxter (1967)] introduced corporate taxes

and/or bankruptcy costs in an effort to explain capital structure. The

tax/bankruptcy arguments have been extended by Miller (1976) who showed that

with   personal taxes   there Is no corporate   advantage to leverage, and De Angelo
and Masulis   (1980) who hypothesized that the extent of non—debt tax shields

determines a firm's optimal capital structure. Recently there has been a

movement away from the traditional tax-bankruptcy cost argument toward a

consideration of agency costs as the major determinant of financial

leverage. Jensen and Meckling (1976) showed that with risky debt outstanding,

a firm's investment policy is not fixed. Myers (1977) first recognized the

underinvestment problem by noting that shareholders of'       firms   with risky debt

will invest only   when (or up to the point where) the expected return on
investment    is at least as great as the promised payment to bondholders. When

the expected return is less than the promised payment, shareholders fail to

exercise the investment option (or invest less than the optimal amount) which

reduces firm value. It is this decline in firm value which limits the amount

of debt a given firm can issue.

       Myers correctly identifies investment opportunities, including, for

example, the maintenance of equipment, as leading to potential underinvest—

ment. He notes that owners, by devising complex debt contracts, can reduce
                                            2




the effect of potential underinvestment and induce bondholders to pay a higher

price for debt. But debt contracts can be effective only when the firm's

Investment opportunity set is observable.

        In this study we show that because intangible, firm—specific, and there—

        unobservable growth opportunities reduce the effectiveness of bond
sore
covenants, the only way in which owners of firms with a high proportion of

intangible investment opportunities can control the agency costs of debt Is by

limiting the amount of risky debt outstanding. Conversely, this imp1ie that

if a firm's investment opportunities consist primarily of tangible assets,

such as capital equipment, they can always support a greater level of debt.

        The same arguments apply to the asset substitution problem [Black and

Scholes (1973), Smith and Warner (1979)]. While riskier (more capital

intensive) equipment can always be purchased, such investments are

observable. With intangible investments, it is a relatively easy matter for

owners to increase firm risk without bondholders being aware of the shift for

many years.      For example, a firm   can concentrate its research and development

(R&D)    on projects with a low   probability of extremely high returns. Since

most    firms closely guard information concerning R&D projects, this type of
risk shifting is difficult for outsiders to detect.
        Thus   our major conclusion is that it   is   the type of investment
opportunities     facing the firm which determines financial leverage. The

empirical evidence supports this conclusion.

        Our analysis of the effect on investment type on corporate       leverage
proceeds    as follows. In Section 2 we develop a model showing the cause and

effect of underlnvestment and asset substitution. We then analyze the

differing effects which investments in tangible or intangible assets have on

firm   value and present our hypothesis. Section 3   describes our sample and the

variables used to characterize investment alternatives, and    presents   our em-

pirical results. Included are tests incorporating additional variables sug-

gested by other researchers. Finally, we present and discuss the implications

     our findings in Section Z.

2.    Investment Choice and Financial Leverage: Theory

       In this section we analyze the underinvestment and -asset substituttpn

problems as they relate to the type of investment opportunities facing a

firm. We show that because investments in tangible assets, such as capital

equipment, can be observed, firms with a high proportion of tangible invest-

ment opportunities can always support more debt than firms facing intangible,

or firm specific opportunities. It is these difficult to observe firm—

specific investments which provide true economic growth and at the same time

reduce financial leverage.

       We examine investment related agency problems by considering a firm which

operates for three periods, t=O, 1, 2, in an economy characterized by state

cøntingent claims which promise to pay $1.00 in period t, if and only if state

S occurs. Capital markets are perfect so that there are no taxes or

transactions costs. However, there are agency costs related to risky debt.

It is assumed that some debt is advantageous because of offsetting agency

costs of equity, and that these costs have been minimized so that managers act

on behalf of owners. The firm starts out at t=0 with initial equity

capitalization, an Initial asset base, and a set of investment opportunities

which can be exercised at t=1. The investments which are accepted will

provide earnings at t:2 which depend both on the state of nature and the level

of investment. At the end of' t=2, the value of the Investments is zero, i.e.,
they are fully depreciated. The following notation is used throughout the

paper.

the analyses which follows.

The    Underinvestinent Problem

        Consider first the choice of the level of investment for the unlevered

firm.     At t=1,       owners will maximize their wealth.



                    =          +
                           1        5     R(C1, S2) q1(S2)dS2



This of course equals the net present value of the investment to the fir at
t=1. The first order condition for equation (1) leads to the classic
microeconomic       result: Invest to the point,              C1, where the expected marginal

return on investment            equals its marginal cost.


(2)                     —1 +                                                 0

                                   Sd2 IR(C1', S2)/C1] q1 (S2) dS2


This is equivalent to investing in all projects with a NPV                       0. The value of

the firm equals the owners wealth in the firm, and is optimal at this point.



(3)       V =   Ve : _C1 1              q0(S1)ds1   +   o   Sd2 R(C1', S2) q0(S2)dS2


Now assume that instead of remaining all equity funded at t=0, owners issue

debt which promises to pay an amount P at t=2. The debt is pure discount so

that the amount paid, B, reflects anticipated payment at t=2. Owners use

these proceeds to repurchase equity at t:O, and fund C1 by issuing new equity

at t=1. At t=2, owners default on debt if the return is less than the


promised payment, R(C1,
                                          < P, which occurs in all states S2 <      S.    Thus at


t:1, when   maximizing their              wealth, owners recognize that they receive a return
                                                   —6—

Equation (J4) leads to a first order condition, and thus a level of investment

C!1, which does         not maximize   firm value.

The second term in equation (5) is less than the corresponding term in

equation (2) since Sb2 > Sd2.             Because owners only receive payoffs after they

have paid bondholders, they invest less than the optimal amount, C' <                   C'.      The

value of equity Is then the present value of the shareholders' portion of firm

value.

       Since the proceeds from the sale of debt are distributed to owners, their

wealth depends on the price paid for debt. This in turn depends on the

ability of potential bondholders to accurately assess owners' Investment

decisions, which requires knowledge of the firm's investment opportunity set.

       Suppose first that potential bondholders do not anticipate

                                                                Then the price they are willing

Because they assume C'1 is invested they also assume that the default state,

S*b2 is lower than its actual state, Sb2. This results in a wealth loss equal

to the price paid for the bonds less the true value of debt (B—Vd).

Bondholders priced debt as If they would receive the present value of area

OABCSN.   However debt is actually worth the present value of area OA'B'CSN.

The bondholders overpaid (and transfered to owners) an amount equal to the

present value of the shaded area, AA'BB'. The effect on owners wealth depends

on whether the gain from bondholders exceeds the decline in the value of

equity (area BB'DD'). If owners could underinvest without bondholders

anticipating their actions, they would increase their wealth.

      But in a rational capital market, bondholders will attempt to anticipate

underlnvestment. If the firm's investment opportunities are tangible in

nature, potential bondholders are able to estimate the Investment opportunity

set and thus fully anticipate the lower level of investment. They will then

pay the true value of debt so that B             Vd.

The value of debt is equal to the present value of the promised payment In

As long as bondholders accurately anticipate uriderinvestment, owners bear a

los in firm value which increases with the amount promised to bondholders.

Tlen it is to the owner's advantage to provide monitoring of investment

decisions. Whether monitoring of investment decisions is provided by

bondholders (through debt covenants) or by the capital market itself (implicit

monitoring), much of the negative effect of risky debt can be eliminated     Low

growth firms with tangible, generalized investment opportunities, such as

plant and equipment can support more debt because of the ability of potential

bondholders to estimate under investment and to observe and monitor investment

decisions.

      But suppose that the firm's investment opportunities are intangible

and/or firm specific in nature so that potential bondholders are unable to

estimate either the firm's investment opportunities, or the extent of

underinvestment. Then they normally will assume the worst possible case,

which in the limit is zero Investment. While owners could promise higher

payments to bondholders in order to induce them to purchase debt, Myers has

shown that increasing P is not effective. Because firm value declines as the

promised payment increases, beyond some point, called the firm's debt

capacity, increasing P reduces rather than increases the value of debt.

Further, if bondholders are unable to estimate underinvestment, they are also

unable to observe or monitor the firm's investment policy. Thus the

effectiveness of either bond covenants or implicit capital market monitoring

is reduced. Since the market cannot effectively monitor investment decisions,

it instead limits the amount of debt. Because high growth firms cannot be

effectively monitored, they will have lower financial leverage.

Asset Substitution

      Consider the investment decision as it concerns the risk of the assets

purchased. It is well known that increasing firm risk may decrease bondholder

walth while increasing owners wealth. We examine this problem by assuming

that the firm faces a second set of investments at t=1, C"1 with a return

function at t=2 of R"(C1", S2). To highlight the asset substitution problem,

we assume that Cr11        C'1 so that owners maximize their wealth at the same

level of investment. The new set of investments is riskier, implying that

5b2 < Sb2", Sd2 < Sd2" and

These patterns of returns are shown graphically on figure 2.



                                       [Insert Figure   21



The   second   set of investments results in a higher probability of operating

default as well as a higher probability of financial default. Figure 2 shows

that the expected marginal return on the original investment over states

S2    Sb2 (area Sb2ACSN) is equal to the expected marginal return on the

riskier investment over states S2           5b2" (area Sb2" B'C'SN). This leads to

identical first order conditions for owners' wealth maximization and thus to

the same level of investment. Figure 2 also shows that the expected marginal

return on      the   original investment over states 2 Sd2 (area Sd2 ACSN) exceeds
                                           — 10 —



the    expected   marginal return on   the riskier investment over states S2 >

 (area Sd2 BC SN). Thus, given the above assumptions, the first order condi-

tions to maximize firm value shows that the less risky investment is prefer-
        1
able.

       The value of equity with the original investment is given by equation

(6). The value of'     equity,   Ve", with the riskier investment depends on the

returns to owners in states S2 >

The first term in (11) is the difference in value of the two investments in

states of no default on debt and is positive by assumption. The second term

is negative, since owners do not default on debt in states S2 >

choose the original investment. The value of equity may increase if the

riskier investment is chosen. Whether or not it does, depends on the promised

payment to bondholders.

       As with underinvestinent, if'   bondholders       did not anticipate investment

substitution, they would assume that the original investment would be chosen

The price paid by bondholders is the present value (PV) of area 0ABCS- The

true value of debt is the PV of area OB'CSN. The overpayment (wealth loss) is

the PV of area OABB'. This amount is transferred to owners. In addition

owners gain the difference between the PV's of area DEF and area BB'D.

Finally firm value declines by the difference between shareholders' gain and

bondholders' loss (PV of areas DEF - OAD).               Thus owners may gain even when

firm value declines.

       But again, in a rational market the amount paid for debt equals its true

expected    value; B =   Vd, so that       potential loss in firm value is borne by

owners.     If bondholders have reason to suspect that           owners will   move towards
riskier investments, the price of debt will be discounted in the capital
market. In the extreme, investors may anticipate losses so great that addi-
tional debt will not be purchased at any promised payment.

        Again, it is intangible investment which leads to the problem. When a

firm invests in capital equipment, it is relatively simple to estimate the

owner's incentives to substitute riskier investments and to observe their

contribution to firm risk. This means that it is more likely that bondholders

can accurately anticipate asset substitution.2 But when a firm faces many

firm—specific    investment opportunities, it is a relatively simple matter for

owners    to increase firm risk over time. Because of the intangible nature of
                                       12




these investments, market participants often have difficulty estimating their
risk and return. Further, since the ultimate effect of increasing the risk of
intangible Investments may not be known for several years, It is almost Impos-
tble   for bondholders or the capital market to monitor such Inyestments. For

tiese reasons, we hypothesize that firms with a high proportion of value due

to Intangible investment opportunities can support less debt than those whose

value depends on tangible assets.

3. Empirical Results

       We test our hypothesis that a firm's choice of capital depends on the

type of Investment opportunities it faces by examining the cross—sectional

behavior of firms during the period 1978-1980.

       Our primary source of data is the COMPUSTAT Annual Industrial File. All

manufacturing firms (SIC four digit classification 2000 through 3999) which

contained a full set of data for 1978—1980 were considered as our Initial sam-

ple.3 Additional data were obtained from the CRSP Daily Return Tape. This

limited our sample to firms listed on either the New York (NYSE) or American

Stock Exchange (AMEX). Our final sample consists of 55 firms of which 139

are In the S & P 500, 216 are non—S & P 500 NYSE firms and 190 are listed on

the AMEX. We require two sets of variables: those measuring financial lever-

age and those measuring the type of investment opportunities.

       Measuring financial leverage is relatively straightforward. Our previous

analysis suggests that firms will choose a capital structure which reflects

the type of investment opportunities they face. However, it is well known

that firms do not instantaneously adjust their financing mix to reflect

changes in underlying characteristics. Rather, the issue or retirement of

debt occurs at fixed points in time as the firm adjusts to its target debt
                                          — 13 —




ratio.    Thus, the average stock of debt outstanding during any           period   of time

should provide a better indication of a firm's target capital structure than

changes in the level of debt. In addition, since our            hypothesis   centers on

tité   effect   of long term investments on the firm's      financing   decisions, we wish

t consider only long-term, funded debt. We thus measure financial leverage

as the book value of all long—term, funded debt.5

       When considering the effect of investment type on fnanc1al leverage, we

must devise measures which capture the realization that firms             raise   capital

prior to funding investments. This implies that our investment measures

should be current flows rather than stocks.6 In addition, we must recognize

that, as Myers pointed out, all investments are discretionary in nature and

thus may lead to agency problems. But we hypothesize that It is only firm—

specific, intangible investment opportunities which reduce the firm's debt

capacity and thus their financial leverage. Because all investments provide

some growth in the firm's assets, we need variables which distinguish between

growth due merely to expansion (NPV =       0) and true economic growth (NPV > 0).
True economic growth results from a firm's ability to select investments which

create a unique product or process. Two such investments for which there are

readily available data are research and development (R & D) and advertising.

To capture the flow of funds into alternative Investments, we use the firm's

reported R & D and advertising expenditures as our proxies for firm—specific,

intangible      Investments, and the   firm's   reported   capital expenditures to meas-

ure    expansionary or tangible investments.
        All of the above variables, financial leverage, H        & D,   advertising and
capital expenditures, are measured using accounting data. Because there is a
large    variation in the size of firms, a direct comparison of these variables
                                     — 114   —




is   impossible. To standardize our measures, we use a size related denominator

and compute ratios. Since we are primarily interested in how firms   have
raised capital to fund their mix of Investments, we seek a standardizing van-

able which reflects invested capital. We define Invested capital as the book

        of long-term debt and equity. We then modify this measure by recogniz-
vlues
ing that there are several categories of capital, such as R & D and advertis-

ing, which, because of the difficulty In measuring future benefits, are cur-

rently required by GAAP to be expensed. The expensing, rather than the api—

talIzation, of these items is in contrast to the treatment of tangible assets,

which are capitalized initially and then depreciated. Since the items which

are expensed are precisely those which we hypothesize can support little debt,

we adjust our denominator by adding capitalized advertising and R & D. We

assume a five—year life for R & D, a three—year life for advertising and

straight—line amortization. Because the use of capitalized B & D and adver-

tising reduces the financial leverage variable for firms with higher such

expenditures, there is a potential bias in our results. For this reason, we

examine alternative standardizing variables: total assets and invested capi-

tal (without capitalized H & D and advertising). To control for any unusual

conditions which might affect a variable at any point in time, we average our

ratios over a three—year period from 1978 through 1980.

       We also wish to consider the effect of' the firm's asset (operating) risk

on capital structure decisions. The traditional finance literature assumes

that operating and financial risk are offsetting decisions, so that firms with

greater operating risk will have lower financial leverage. By including a

measure of operating risk, we are better able to Isolate the effects of in-

vestment choice on financial leverage. We are interested In the firm's sys—
                                             15




tematic risk, or beta, which is assumed to capture all of its business or

asset risk. We first compute the firm's equity beta, using the geometric

average of 20 daily returns to approximate one month.7 We then unlever the

b'ta as suggested by Hamada (1972) and Rubenstein (1973) usingthe market

%lue of equity and the book value of debt as a percent of total value to

weight equity and debt respectively. Because we assume debt is riskiess, our

measure    underestimates systematic risk for high leverage, firms.8 We include
the unlevered beta as an independent variable in all tests using individual
firm    data.

        In addition, to completely neutralize a firm's underlying business risk,
we also form      equal beta portfolios by first determining the median unlevered
beta.     We then list all firms in decreasing order of financial leverage, and

place them into one of' two groups: those with unlevered betas above the

median and those with unlevered betas below the median. Next we place the

first four firms in each group into an 8 firm portfolio. We weight the port-

folio so that its unlevered beta is equal to the median beta. We continue the

process until all firms are assigned to a portfolio. This process, which

creates   68 equal beta portfolios, each with a different degree of financial
leverage, greatly reduces the random variation in our predictor variables.
This   reduction in variation can    be   seen on Table 1.
                                 [Insert Table 1]
       Table 1 shows that for each variable,, the standard    deviation is lower

when portfolio data are used. However, because the use of        portfolios results
in a loss    of data, all results are reported     for both individual firms and
portfolios      of firms. Our basic models of the predictors of'   financial   leverage
are   presented below.

        Equation (114) is the model used to test data for the 68 portfolios while

equation (15) is used to test data for the 5145 firms. Both models are tested

using ordinary least squares regression. Table 2 presents the results of

tests of equation (114) using the three alternative denominators discussed

above, while Table 3 presents the results using firm data.

                                  [Insert Tables 2 and 3]

        Table 2 shows that, depending on the denominator used, between 35% and

141% of the variation in debt is explained by investment type. In each case,

the signs are as predicted. The results using invested capital plus capital-

ized R & P. and advertising and those using totals assets are quite similar.

The results using only invested capital also are similar, except that the

significance of the advertising variable declines. Because the results are

similar, and because we feel that it is appropriate to capitalize rather than

expense R & D and advertising, all future tests will use variables standard-

ized by invested capital plus capitalized R & D and advertising.

        Table 3 shows that for individual firms, systematic risk and investment

type explain 21% of the variation in debt. Not surprisingly, the most signi-

ficant variable Is systematic asset risk, with riskier firms having lower

financial leverage.9 All variables measuring investment type have the

predicted sign and are statistically significant. Firms with discretionary

investment opportunities have lower financial leverage than those facing tan-

gible investments

        We now wish to determine whether or not the above results indicate a true

ral hazard problem. It is possible that our results reflect spurious corre—

tion of our proxies for investment type with other, more important determi-

nants of financial leverage. We investigate this possibility by examining the

effect of variables suggested by other researchers on the power of the
                                                                           -A.


model. These determinants include non—interest related tax shields, firm

specific (unsystematic) risk, and the availability of internal funds.11 In

addition, we examine whether or not agency problems affect short-term borrow-

ing decisions. Because several of our variables exhibit multicollinearity, we

examine the correlation matrices for both firms and portfolios, before

presenting our results.

                               [Insert Tables 14 and 51

        Tables 14 and 5 show that there is a high degree of multicollinearity

between capital exp&iditures and investment related tax shields, which might

affect either the sign or interpretation of the tax variable. However, it is

interesting to note that the tax shield is positively related to long-term

debt.

        In addition, a comparison of tables II and 5 shows that when we neutralize

risk, advertising and B & D are positively correlated with operating cash

flows. These correlations are not present in individual firm data. Thus when

we consider the effect of operating cash flow on the power of the moral hazard

model, we might expect different results for the two sets of data. Table 14

also shows that while systematic and unsystematic risk are positively

correlated, their effect on debt is opposite. With these relationships in
                                       18




mind, we now examine each variable separately, and determine its effect on the

moral hazard model.

      We first examine the effect of investment related tax shields on the

pwer of our model. Expanding on Miller (1977), DeAngelo and Masulis (1980)

first suggested that a firm's financial leverage depends on the availability

of investment—related tax shields, such as depreciation and investment tax

credits. They show that when such tax shields are available, corporate. capi—

tal   structure is relevant to individual firms. They argue that the presence
of non—debt tax shields affects the extent to which corporations can gain from
the substitution of debt for equity. Since higher financial leverage in-

creases the probability that non—debt tax shields will be lost, they hypothe-

size that firms with lower tax shields will employ more debt in their capital

structure. This implies that firms investing heavily in capital equipment,

which generates large tax shields, should have less debt. We have already

observed that the relationship between capital expenditures and financial

leverage is positive. However, we wish to directly test the effect of tax

shields. We compute the depreciation tax shield as depreciation expense times

the corporate marginal tax rate plus the change in deferred taxes. The total

investment—related tax shield is the sum of the depreciation tax shield and

the investment tax credit.12

                                [Insert Table 6]

      Table 6 presents the results of including the investment related tax

shield in our model. We see that because of multicollinearity, the coeffi-

cients are negative but insignificant. The coeffiecents of our moral hazard

variables remain as predicted and all are significant. Thus while we cannot

exclude the possiblity of' tax effect, we can conclude that the moral hazard

problem remains and is important in determining financial leverage.
                                              19




       We next turn to the question of whether or not a firm's total risk in-

fluences its financial leverage. Agency theory contends that the higher the

variance of the firm's returns, the less the underinvestment problem. Because

lrwestments   which reduce   firm   risk   provide a capital gain to bondholders at

              of shareholders, owners are likely to forego such investments.
te expense
Conversely, because they hold claim to the upper portion of a firm's distribu-

tion of return, shareholders are more likely invest in high variance projcts.

Thus, all other factors equal, high variance firms will lower agency costs of

debt due to underinvestment and thus higher financial leverage.13 If, how-

ever, we consider the possibility that bankruptcy costs matter, higher vari-

ance firms would have less debt. Thus, if total risk has a positive effect

on leverage, we assume     that    the moral hazard problem outweighs the increased

probabilityof bankruptcy, and vice versa if' the effect is negative. If both
problems are important, then they should offset each other and the effect of
total risk on financial leverage should be neutralized.
     We measure total risk as the unsystematic, firm specific, residual vari-

ance   of the firm's stock returns, standardized by the market variance.15

                                      [Insert Table 7]

       Table 7 shows   that when using data for individual firms or portfolios,
unsystematic   risk has a significantly positive effect on financial leverage.

We note   that with firm   data,    the effect of unlevered beta on   financial lever-

age is negative. To attempt to determine the overall affect of risk, we also

used the firm's total variance of stock returns, unlevered to remove the

effect of debt. Our results showed that total risk also is significantly

positively correlated with financial leverage. This indicates that control of

underinvestment exerts a greater influence on debt capacity than does the in-
                                          20




creased probability of bankruptcy. While       we   cannot conclude that bankruptcy
costs    are irrelevant, we can state that inclusion of risk measures does not

affect   the ability of the   moral hazard variables   to explain financial lever—


        We next examine the possibility that the size of a firm's operating cash
flows   determines financial leverage. There are two possible explanations why

cash flows might influence corporate borrowing.

        First, as Donaldson (1961) noted, managers may prefer to minimize their

costs and constraints by using internally generated funds. This is consistant

with Miller's (1977) argument that with personal taxes and no transactions

costs firms are Indifferent to capital structure. If we then introduce trans-

actions costs, we would expect that firms will choose the form of financing

which is least expensive. Therefore, firms with adequate internal funds will

provide most of their capital requirements internally, while less liquid firms

will be forced to resort to outside funding.

        However, it is also possible that a firm's cash flows are a proxy for the

type of investment opportunities they face. In the absence of positive net

present valued investments, we would expect that if risk were held constant,

all firms would have the same before tax operating cash flows. Any observed

variation in cash flows can be attributed to variation in economic growth.

True economic growth results from a firm's ability to select investments which

create unique products or processes. When investment opportunities are firm—

specific or intangible, they are more likely to generate positive net present

values and thus higher cash flows. Thus it is possible that the size of a

firm's cash flows is a proxy for firm-specific investment opportunities

instead of growth opportunities.
                                         21




      We measure operating cash flows as earnings before interest, depreciation

and taxes. If either explanation is correct, we expect cash flow to have a

negative relationship with financial leverage.

                                   [Insert Table 8]

      Table 8 indicates that operating cash flow is indeed negatively related

to financial leverage. In the model using firm data, inclusion of cash flow

does not affect the explanatory power of the moral hazard variables. However,

since firms with higher systematic risk should have higher profitability, we

consider these results inconclusive.

      When we examine the effect of cash flow when risk is neutralized, we see

that the importance of both advertising and R & D is reduced below statistical

significance. This is due to the previously noted high positive correlation

amongthe variables. There are three possible explanations for this
phenomenon. First, because our portfolios are ordered by financial leverage,
it   is possible   that low leverage firms have high cash flows, and independent-
ly, have   high advertising and R & D expenditures. In this case, because cash

flows exert a stronger influence on leverage, the importance of advertising

and B & D is reduced, but the variables do not proxy for each other. A second

possiblity is that advertising and B & D create high cash flows and therefore

proxy for the availability of internal funds. Finally, it is possible that

 cash flows are a proxy for all firm—specific investment opportunities,

including advertising and B & D.

        While we cannot empirically distinguish    among the alternative
                   it appears likely that the first is correct and the variables
explanations,
 are independent determinants of'    leverage.   Because capital expenditures is not

 strongly correlated with cash flows, it is still statistically significant.
                                      22




Capital expenditues also measures the extent of moral hazard problems and its

inclusion in the model (after the influence of cash flows has   been   considered)

increases the explained variation in financial leverage by 25%. Thus while we

cinnot explain the relationship between advertising, R & D and-cash flows, we

    conclude that the moral hazard problem is important.

     Finally, we look at whether or not our basic model can explain a firm's

use of short-term sources of funds. If short—term borrowing is used in order

to resolve agency problems, advertising and R & D should exert a positive ef-

fect. But if firms turn to short—term borrowing solely to finance cyclical,

short—term requirements, while choosing to finance longer term requirements by

issuing long—term, funded debt, the effect of our variables on the level of

short—term debt should be negligible. Table 9 shows the results of our basic

model using short—term debt as our dependent variable.

                               [Insert Table 9]

     Table 9 shows that when we use firm data, advertising and capital

expenditures have a positive effect on short—term borrowing while H & D has a

negative effect. Our results with portfolio data are similar, except that

B & D does not enter the equation. In both cases, our explained variation is

extremely small. It appears as if firms make short-term borrowing decisions

independent of long-term investment requirements and do not attempt to resolve

agency problems by the substitution of short-term for long-term debt.

1L Conclusions and Implications

       We have shown   that   the moral hazard problem, which affects a firm's

investment decisions, is a major determinant of corporate leverage. Specific—

a'ly, we developed a model in which a firm's         financial   leverage depends on

tether it invests in tangible, capital assets or in intangible, firm—specific

assets. We tested our model using both a large sample of'           individual   firms and

68 eight—firm   portfolios formed to neutralize systematic operating risk. We
were   able to explain 21% of' the    variation for individual firms    and   141% of the

variation when risk was held constant.
       We then examined the robustness of our model by including various vari-
ables   which other researchers have suggested may influence financial leverage.

Our intent was not to prove or disprove alternative theories but rather to

determine the power of the moral hazard model. We found that including in-

vestment related tax shields or firm      specific   risk did not affect our results.

When we included a variable measuring before tax operating cash flow, we found

that two of our variables, advertising and H & D, did lose power. While we

were unable to determine precisely the relationship among the variables, we

did find evidence that they are independent measures. It appears that while

the availability of internal funds may be the most important determinant of

whether or not a firm    seeks   external sources of funds, the moral hazard

problem can still explain the choice of debt or equity.

       We conclude that a major factor which influences corporate leverage deci—

sions is the type of investments a firm      undertakes.   Given that a firm must

seek an outside source of funds, its choice between debt or equity will depend

in part on the magnitude of potential agency costs of debt. Because of these

costs, corporations which invest heavily in intangibles, such as H & D and
                                        2Z1




advertising   have a tighter capital market imposed debt capacity than those

investing in tangible assets. Our    findings   provide direct empirical evidence

that the moral hazard problem is important, and that investment and financing

decisions are   not   independent.

Since the second term ifl equation (A) exceeds that of equation (B), when.the

level of investment is constant the less risky investment is optimal for the

firm. It can be shown (see Myers) that when the level of investment varies,

the less risky investment may lead to greater underinvestment, I.e., area

Sd2 AA' Sb2 may be greater than Sd2" BB' Sb2" on figure 2.

       2 For example if alternative capital equipment with different contribu-

tions to operating risk is available, this Is likely to be known and the ef-

fect of the riskier Investment on debt values can be anticipated. Or, if the

shift in risk Is accomplished by replacing existing equipment, It Is likely

that the price paid for the equipment will approximate its true value. Then

all bondholders need be concerned about is that the expected NPV of the new

equipment is non—negative.

       3 When there were missing data, the values were collected from 's

Industrial Manual.

       Myers has shown that because short term debt is retired prior to invest-

ment choice It does not affect owner's investment decisions. We examine this

proposition later in this paper.

       5We investigate the possibility that since agency problems can be cir-

cumvented either by issuing convertible debt [Jensen and Meckling, (1976)], or
                                       26




by leasing the inclusion of these items in our measure of debt may bias our

results. However, when we remove convertible debt and leases from our measure

of financial leverage, we achieve identical results for both the portfolios

ad individual firms.                                           —

     6
         The use of investment stocks would seriously bias our results. The

stock of' debt reflects the current level of debt. The stock of investments

reflects all previous investment decisions, many of which were made prior to

issuing any of' the long term debt which is currently outstanding. The .ow of

funds into alternative investments adequately reflects the use to which the

funds raised from the sale of debt were put.

     7 Betas are determined using 60 "months" of data where possible. Where

60 months are not available less are used except that at least 36 "months" are

required.

         If' debt is not riskless, our estimate underestimates the asset beta by

a factor equal to the firm's leverage ratio times its true debt beta. If we

assume that debt of higher leverage firms has greater systematic risk, this

underestimation is magnified.

         This relationship is due in part to the negative bias in our computa-

tion of unlevered beta for high leverage firms.

     10 It was suggested that our results might be due to a few firms which

have extremely high advertising or R & D expenditures. To test this, we

eliminated firms in the pharmaceutical industry, which have high H & D ex-

penses, and those in the cosmetics industry, which have above average adver-

tising outlays. Our results did not significantly change.

         We also examined the possibility, suggested by Dasgupta and Stiglitz

(1980), that a firm's competitive environment determines both whether or not
                                               27




intangible   investments are     undertaken,    and its financial leverage. According

to their model one would expect that firms in medium concentration industries

weuld have greater expenditures in H & D and advertising. Sinee these firms

.so face greater demand uncertainty, they can support less debt. We tested

the proposition that financial leverage is determined by a firm's competitive

environment by considering a model which incorporates industry concentration.

We define industry concentration in two ways.            First,   we compute the percent—

age of industry output produced by the four largest firms in each fourdigit

SIC. We also compute a second measure, designed to reach a maximum at 50%

concentration (100* Concentration —         Concentration2).      We found that neither

measure is correlated with either the type of investment or with financial

leverage, and   thus   had   no effect on the power of our model.
     12 There are two methods used in accounting for investment tax credits.

The flow through method reports the entire tax benefit in the year of pur.-

chase, so that our measure is taken directly from each firm's income state--

ment. The deferral methods capitalized the benefit and             amortizes   it over five

years. For these firms we use the income statement value plus balance sheet

changes in investment tax       credit   accounts.

     13 We recognize the potential agency costs involved in the substitution

of the same quantity of risky       projects   for those with less risk and      greater
value. However, if more positive valued projects are undertaken, then firm

value will show a net increase. In most cases, the underinvestment problem

dominates the asset substitution problem.

        Studies of actual bankruptcy costs find that they are quite small and
increase less than proportionally with the size of the firm. For example see
Warner (1977)   and   Ang, Chau, and McConnell       (1982).

     15 There is a slight negative bias in our measure. We compute unsystem-

atic risk as the total variance of stock returns, standardized by the market

variance less the square of the stock beta. It can be shown   that   all other

ting equal, the change in unsystematic risk with respect to the debt—equity

rat1o is slightly negative.
