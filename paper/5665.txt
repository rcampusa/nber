duty) in bringing about changes in the average U.S. tariff from 1865-1973.   About three-quarters of

the post-Smoot Hawley decline in U.S, tariffs, for example, can be attributed to higher import prices,

the remainder to negotiated reductions in tariff rates.

I. Introduction

        A curious feature of the U, S. tariff code from 1789 to the present has been its mixture of

ad valorem duties, specific duties, and compound duties (which are a combination of both). 1 It

has long been recognized that changes in import prices affect the average ad valorem equivalent

of the specific duties; itiation   (deflation) will reduce (increase) the ad valorem equivalent of the

specific duties and thus tiect     import demand, The use of specific duties has meant that, during

certain periods, price-level changes have had an important impact on the average tariff.2 What

remains unclear is the degree to which fluctuations in import prices and adjustments to tariff rates

(enacted by Congress or resulting from trade negotiations) have been responsible for movements

in the average tariff over the course of U. S. history.

        This paper attempts to determine the relative importance of import prices and tariff rate

adjustments to changes in the average ad valorem U.S. tariff from the Civil War until the early

1970s. This paper finds that import price movements account for a much greater proportion of

the change in the average U, S. tariff than commercial policies that directly altered tariff rates.      ‘

About three-quarters    of the post-Smoot Hawley decline in the average tti,      for example, can be

attributed to higher import prices and only about a qutier     due to cuts in import duties. As a

result, it maybe misleading to attribute or interpret observed movements in average tariffs as


        1 Ad valorem duties are assessed as a percentage of the value of imports whereas specific
duties are a nominal dollar amount per imported quantity.

        2 This aspect of the tariff has been explored in the post-Civil War period by McGuire
(1990), the interwar period by Crucini (1994), and the 1970s by Van Cott and Wipf (1983).



         .
mostly reflecting changes in commercial policy.

        Section II discusses general issues relating to tariff measurement and the role of (and

rationale for) specific duties in the U.S. tariff code. Specific duties were levied on roughly two-

thirds of dutiable U.S. imports for much of the century tier   the Civil War and were justified on

administrative grounds (for simplicity and to prevent underinvoicing).    Section 111develops an

econometric model of the determinants of the average ad valorem tariff rate from 1865-1973 and

uses the estimated parameters to distinguish the effects of import prices and commercial policies

on the average tariff. Import prices consistently account for over two-thirds of the major swings

in the tariff during the twentieth century, implying that passive changes in the tariff due to price

movements have been more important than active changes in tariff rates. Section IV briefly

examines the pre-Civil War period from 1821-60 and finds that price-level effects on the average

tti   were much less important.     Section V discusses some of the implications of the results.




II. Tariff Measurement     and Specific Duties

        The most frequently used measure of the average ad valorem tariff rate is the ratio of total

revenue from import duties to the value of dutiable imports. Figure 1 presents these data for the

United States from 1865 -1973.3 This readily available series is usually interpreted as reflecting

the average height of the tariff and thus the stance of a-count~’s   commercial policy. The high

tariff period from 1865-1913, for example, is said to reflect the political dominance of

protectionist   Republicans.   The brief period of liberalization under the Democrats around World

War I was followed by a return to protection in which the Republican Fordney-McCumber           and


        3 Sources for all the data used in this study are described in the data appendix.

Smoot-Hawley        tariffs of 1922 and 1930 are thought to have pushed the average tariff over 50

percent.       Successive negotiations under the Reciprocal Trade Agreement Actof1934             andthe

General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) tier                1947, it is believed, then brought the tariff

down to about 10 percent.

           ~ameasure      of the`` average'' tariff, ttisratio   hasseverd   conceptual shoficomings.      The

most serious drawback is its downward bias as a indicator of tariffs: imports subject to high or

prohibitive tariffs receive little or no weight in the index. This problem can be surmounted by the

laborious task of calculating the average tariff with some appropriate weights other than the

current value of imports and keeping these weights fixed over periods in which tariff policy

changes.4 Yet this bias may not be so extensive as to make the tariff revenue measure completely

unreliable. Lerdau (1957) calculated an average U.S. tariff index annually from 1909-46 using

weights from the wholesale price index. He reported a correlation of 0.88 (which I was able to

wnfirm) between his index and tariff revenue as a share of dutiable imports.             This correlation, he

concludes (p. 239), “in view of the absence of a significant trend and in view of the considerable

amplitude of the fluctuations, must be considered surprisingly high. The use of this cruder index

as an indication of changes in the tariff over time is therefore fw less suspect than it would appear

to be on purely theoretical grounds.”5




           4 See, however, the recent approach propo~ed by Anderson and Neary (1 994).

        5 Other fixed-weight indicators of tariff changes yield results that are just slightly higher
than those evident from the tariff revenue measure. For the Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1930, for
example, the tariff revenue measure increased 17.4 percent between the second halves of 1929
and 1930, a fixed weight calculation by the U.S. Tariff Commission suggests an average increase
of 22.7 percent, while Lerdau’s index rises 21.0 percent between 1929 and 1931, See Irwin
(1996), pp. 3-4.

           As an indicator of commercial policy, in terms of legislative or executive changes in rates

of import duty, this measure of the average ad valorem tariff rate suffers from spurious volatility:

the series moves, sometimes substantially, during periods in which there are no changes in the

actual tariff rates. This problem is ofien thought to be less serious than the bias noted above, but

could be more serious if the aim of using the average tariff measure is to identifi the effects of

commercial policy. This volatility could be due to the dependence of the ad valorem equivalent of

specific duties on the level of import prices. That fluctuations in impoti prices are a plausible

source of variation in the average tariff is also illustrated in Figure 1, which includes an index of

U.S. impofi prices. Large changes in import prices are inversely related to major swings in the

tariff (the correlation between the two series is -0.93). The substantial increase in import prices

during World War I and during and just afier World War II coincides with dramatic reductions in

the average tariff, for example, while plunging import prices in the early 1920s and again in early

1930s are associated with large increases in the tariff.

           Is the highly negative correlation between import prices and the average tariff explained by

the use of specific duties? Although data on the importance of specific duties in the U, S. tariff

code is difficult to come by, Table 1 presents some limited information compiled from various

sources.     The table indicates that, from the late 1860s until the 195os, roughly two-thirds of

dutiable U.S. imports were subject to specific or compound duties (with compound duties usually

constituting    less than 5 percent of dutiable imports),   This proportion fell to half by the mid- 1960s

and to less than 40 percent by the early 1970s. Specific duties raised approximately 40-50 percent

of tariff revenue from the late 1860s until 1920, but this share shot up in the early 1920s. By the
                                                      5

1970s, about a quarter of tariff revenue was derived from specific and compound duties.4 The

Tokyo Round of GATT negotiations, concluded in 1979, converted             manyspecificdutiesto d

*duties            in the u-s. tafiffcode.

          What explains the heavy reliance on specific duties?’ The main rationale was apparently

administrative     simplicity, to avoid the tricky issue of valuing imports and to prevent

underinvoicing     fraud. However, just as the political parties differed as to the proper height of the

tariff for much of this period (Republicans favoring high, protective tariffs, Democrats advocating

moderate, revenue tariffs), they differed in their preference for specific and ad valorem duties.

From the Merrill Act of 1861, Republicans ensured that most import duties were specific, not ~

h.            In 1888, the House of Representatives (controlled   byDemocrats)tried to includemore

ad valorem duties in the tariff code, but the Senate (controlled by Republicans) prevented this

action.

          The Democrats incorporated more ad valorem rates into the Wilson-German            tariff of

1894, but Republicans promptly reversed this move three years later. Democrats again included

more ad valorem duties in the Underwood tariffof1913.           Table 1 indicates that the share of

specific or compound duties fell from 63 to 42 percent of dutiable imports between 1913 and

1914. But the Republican Fordney-McCumber            tariff of 1922 restored and extended the use of

specific duties.    These specific duties were locked into the tariff code by the Smoot-Hawley        tariff

duties in 1973.

of 1930, the last tariff act passed by Congress.   This act fixed specific duties at nominal amounts

circa 1930, and hence their ad valorem equivalent was ripe for an increase through deflation or

erosion through itiation   in subsequent years.

        What issues were involved in the debate over the merits of specific and ad valorem duties?

The main Republican argument against ad valorem duties, what they once called “the objection . .

. most important,” was the incentive given to importers to underinvoice:      “Inasmuch as the duty

depends on the price, a cheat on the price is a cheat on the duty.”a Specific duties avoided this

problem, which Republicans evidently believed to be rampant, and “have been advocated by all

our Secretaries of the Treasury” (with one exception) for their “simplicity and certainty in

execution.”9

        Democrats pointed out that specific duties too could be subject to evasion and proposed

coupling ad valorem duties with strong enforcement measures. 10 The main Democratic argument

against specific duties and in favor of ad valorem duties was equity: that fixed nominal duties

placed a heavier burden on lower priced items in any given tariff category and therefore

undervaluations [ad valorem duties] invite evasions of the law and reward dishonest importers,
while they destroy the businesses alike of honest importers and domestic manufacturers” and
enable the fraudulent importer to “escape his fair share of taxation.” U, S. Congress (1909), p. 52,
and U.S. Congress (1913), p. Ivii.

         9 Meanwhile, according to Republicans, the ad valorem tariff “has been condemned by the
experience of every commercial nation in the world, by the judgment of those who have been
intrusted with the responsibility of customs administration, and by honest importers and
merchants, as well as by intelligent political economists and legislators of every shade of economic
belief” U.S. Congress (1909), p. 52.

        10 Specific duties require more tariff classifications and “permit slight changes in industrial
processes made for the purpose of shifting goods from one classification into another, and thereby
avoid the necessity of paying a higher rate of duty.” U.S. Congress (1913), p. xxxii.

constituted a regressive tax on consumers.’1 Republicans did not dispute that specific duties were

regressive, but saw a silver lining in their “beneficial tendency to exclude from the country

inferior, adulterated, and worthless goods.”]2 Democrats also believed the lack of transparency of

specific duties abetted excessive protectionism. 13

        Both parties recognized that the ad valorem equivalent of specific duties was inversely

related to import prices, but thought this a secondary consideration to judge from the

Congressional committee reports on the various tariff bills. Republicans liked the protective

insurance provided by specific duties against low prices. “When business is depressed and foreign

prices abnormally low, when foreign competition is most to be dreaded, and when a defensive

barrier is most needed by domestic producers, then ad valorem rates are lowest, production is

reduced, and depression intensified. ” Democrats saw an “injustice” in this feature of a specific

duty in that it “ftils to take account of fluctuations in value, and it therefore imposes a relatively

low rate when prices are high and a relative high rate when prices are low, notwithstanding       the




         11 “A duty which taxes according to kind, pound, weight, measure, or the like, without
regard to value, always oppressed the less wealthy consumer and lightens the burden on his richer
fellow-citizen.” U.S. Congress (1909), p. 292. Democrats once complained that a Republican
effort “to restore specific instead of ad valorem rates simply means, no matter what pretenses may
be set up, that the goods used by the poor shall be taxed out of all proportion to those used by the
rich,” U.S. Congress (1909), p. 132.

        12 U.S. Congress (1909), p. 54.                 :

          13 A specific duty “strongly tends to mask the real character and burden of the tariff, and
thereby to keep the consumer who pays the cost in ignorance of his real contributions.” U.S.
Congress (191 3), p. xxxii. Democrats once complained that the shift toward more specific duties
“render it difficult for the minority to approximate with satisfactory certainty the extent to which
tariff taxation is increased or diminished upon the articles included in the various schedules or
what effect these changes will probably have upon the amounts of revenues to result from such
changes.” U.S. Congress (1909), p, 123,



         .
undesirability of such a method.”14

        Whatever their rationale, specific duties have clearly loomed large in the U. S. tariff code

over the past century. The next question is one of determining the extent to which changes in the

tariff arise from changes in import prices, commercial policies, or other sources of variation.




III. Changes in the Tari~ Prices or Policies?

        The aim of this section is to determine the degree to which the changes in U. S. tariffs

observed in Figure 1 are due to impofi price movements or to changes in the actual rates of

import duty.

        To motivate the issue conceptually, suppose there are two classes of imports, Ml subject

to ad valorem duties and Mz subject to specific duties (and their associated prices, pl and pz). The

average ad valorem tariff rate r is then defined as (tplM1 + sMz)/pM, or (1 -a)t + as/pz, where t is

the ad valorem tariff, s is the specific duty, a is the weight of imports (by value) subject to specific

duties, and pM is the total value of (dutiable) imports, It is straightfomard     to show that if all

imports are subject to ad valorem duties alone (a = O), then a change in import prices will not

afTect the average tariff (i.e., 13t/dp = O). If all imports are specific (a = 1), then d~/dp = -s/p2.

When imports are subject to a combination of duties, and assuming for simplicity that pz is

perfectly correlated with the overall import price index p, the result is dT/dp = -as/p2.

        Plugging values into this last formula can give an indication of the expected magnitude of

the elasticity of the average tariff with respect to import prices, Table 1 suggests that a can be

approximated   as .65, while the mean value of T (from 1865-1973, multiplied by 100) is 34. Data

on s/p, the ad valorem equivalent of specific duties, is less clear: U. S, Tariff Commission

estimates for select years during 1913-25 range from a high of 43.06 in 1914 to a low of 10.45 in

1920. The elasticity of the average tariff rate with respect to import prices -- calculated as

(&/T)/(ap/p)   = -as/pr -- would be about -0,48 ifs/p = 25, -0.67 ifs/p = 35, -0.86 if slp = 45.

        To separate out the effects of import prices and commercial policies on the average tariff,

the econometric   approach proposed here is to estimate the following equation:

                                     ti = PO+ ~lln(p) + Z~jDji + ui,

where Z ~jDj is a series of dummy variables representing various tariff regimes. The semi-log

specification allows the elasticity of the tariff with respect to price to be easily determined by

dividing PI by the mean of r. This specification also preserves an easy interpretation of the

coefficients on the dummy variables in terms of their impact of the average tariff level.

        The problem with this specification is that import prices enter directly into the calculation

of ~i and therefore pi and ui will be negatively correlated,   While this works to reduce ~1, thereby

understating the role of prices, it can be corrected by using an appropriate instrument for pi.

Because relative price movements between domestic and imported goods tend not to be ve~

large, domestic wholesale prices might be expected to be a usefil instrument.

        Table 2 presents econometric results from various regressions in which the dependent

variable is always the average ad valorem tariff (multiplied by 100), The sample consists of 109

observations from the years 1865-1973.15 There are 12 dummy variables representing

administrative changes in tariff rates. The first nine variables are acts of legislation passed by the

Congress in which rates of import duty in the tariff code were changed.      These span the

(unnamed) Tariff Act of 1872 to the Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1930, the last time Congress directly

changed the schedule of import duties. The last three dummy variables represent rate reductions

resulting from executive agreements with foreign countries: the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act

of 1934 (considered here to be effective from 1936), the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade

(from 1948), and the Kennedy Round (from 1968).”

        In the first regression (column 1) of Table 2, the dummy variables representing tariff

legislation and negotiated trade agreements are taken to be the only factors determining the

average tariff. The coefficients indicate the deviation of the average tariff during a given period

from the regression intercept.    For example, when the McKinley twiff was in effect from 1890-

1893, the average tariff was about 47.5 percent (PO+ j3~.       The Democratic Wilson-German

tariff (in effect from 1894-96) dropped the tariff nearly 6 percentage points (~ ~~ - ~~      to 41.6

percent, although the Republicans prompted erased this reduction with the Dingley tariff (1 897-

1908). The Underwood        tariff (19 13-2 1) pushed the average tariff to 28.5 percent, a dramatic 13

percentage point drop from the Payne-Aldrich tariff (1909-1 912), or 9 percentage points from the

Dingley tariff. According to these results, the Fordney-McCumber        tariff raised duties about 10

percentage points while Smoot-Hawley added another 11 percentage points, pushing the tariff up

to an average 50 percent.    The RTM      brought about a 17 percentage point tariff reduction (to 33


         ‘c While the RTAA involved negotiations with numerous countries over several years, the
most important tariff reductions were implemented in 1936-38, with virtually no negotiations
thereafter. Similarly, while three GATT negotiating rounds were held between the first at Geneva
in 1947 and the Kennedy Round (1962-67), they were held mainly to add new members and
resulted in negligible reductions in U, S. tariffs.

percent), the GATT added another 21 percentage point reduction (to 12 percent), and the

Kemedy Round another 2percentage           points to10percent.    Butinattributing   allchanges   inthe

tariff to rate changes and none to import price fluctuations, this regression attributes too much to

these acts of policy.

        The regression in column 2 introduces import prices. The coefficient on the log of import

prices is negative, reflecting the inverse relationship between import prices and the ad valorem

equivalent of specific duties, and is highly significant with a t-ratio of over 10. Import prices

boost the explained variation of tariffs (adjusted R2) from 0.94 to 0.98. The coefficient on import

prices implies an elasticity of the average tariff with respect to import prices of -0.61, within the

expected range calculated above. This elasticity indicates that a 1 percent increase in import

prices will reduce the average tariff by 0.61 percent. Consequently,      changes in import prices can

bring about substantial changes in the average tariff, particularly in view of the magnitude of the

observed swings in import prices.

        The addition of import prices also changes the sign, magnitude, and significance of several

of the commercial policy dummy variables as prices absorb what was wrongly attributed to

changes in tariff rates in the initial regression.   For example, the coefficient on Underwood falls

from -19.0 to -15.3, implying a 6 percentage point tariff reduction from Payne-Aldrich rather than

the 13 percent estimated without import prices. Similarly, the coefficient on the GATT period

falls from -35.4 to -21.6, suggesting a modest 5 percentage point reduction in tariffs beyond

import price increases rather than the 21 percent reduction mentioned earlier.

        As previously noted, however, import prices maybe correlated with the error term,

biasing ~1 downward.      The regression in column 3 uses U.S. wholesale prices as an instrument for
                                                       12

import prices. IV estimation raises the coefficient on price to an implied elasticity of-0.67,           There

is little change in the size or significance of the commercial policy dummy variables from the

previous specification,      There are indications of autocorrelation,   and while this does not introduce

bias it results in less efficient estimates.   The regression in column 4, which instruments for import

prices and estimates the equation using Cochrane-Orcutt          generalized least squares, yields virtually

an identical elasticity estimate. 17

regression (which includes commercial policies and import prices), The top panel illustrates how

si~ficant       variation in the tariff is not captured by Congressional or negotiated tariff policies

accounting for important variations in the tariff that the commercial policy variables could not.

        The regression in column 3 can be used to decompose the relative contribution of import

prices and commercial policies to four dramatic swings in the average tariff -- the increase from

38.1 percent in 1873 to 52.4 percent in 1899, the subsequent decrease to 16.4 percent in 1920,

the following increase to 59.1 percent in 1932, and finally the decrease to 11.6 percent in 1954.

Tables 3 and 4 present results from the following exercise: using the estimated coefficients from

the column 3 regression, calculate the predicted tariff holding import prices constant (but allowing
                                                     :
the tariff acts to continue), and then again holding the initial tariff in place (but allowing import

prices to fluctuate),     In other words, calculate the predicted tariff between 1873-99, 1899-1920,

1920-32, and 1932-51 assuming, first, no change in import prices and then, second, no change in

tariff rates within the period under consideration.        Table 3 shows the predicted tariff and the

forecast standard error (in terms of the 95 percent confidence interval), The first thing to note is

that import prices and commercial policies are not offsetting but are reinforcing influences on the

average tariff. That is, the average tariff fell during 1899-1920 and 1932-54 due both to

reductions in tariff rates and rising import prices, with the opposite the case in 1873-99 and 1920-

32.

        Table 4 shows the relative contribution of import prices and commercial policies to the

tariff. The model does not fit the trough and peak of the tariff well in 1873-99, but does indicate

that the tariffs rise was almost entirely due to falling import prices. The results from 1899-1920

indicate that about three-quarters of the almost 70 percent fall in the tariff can be attributed to

rising import prices. Had there been no change in import prices, legislative tariff changes would

have resulted in ordy a 20 percent drop in the tariff. One problem with considering the

counterfactual   in this way is that the timing and extent of changes brought about by tariff

legislation may be dependent upon changes in prices. If import price inflation had not significantly

reduced the average tariff, for example, then perhaps the legislated tariff reductions would have

been more substantial.

        With this caveat in find, the results are similar for the dramatic tariff increase observed

over 1920-32.    Over two-thirds of the i~crease can be attributed to falling import prices during

the early 1920s and again in the early 1930s. 18 Legislated tariff changes, the Fordney-McCumber

tti   of 1922 and the Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1930, raised the tariff only about 44 percent




       18 This result is close to the Irwin (1996) estimate on the relative contributions       of the
Smoot-Hawley rates and deflation to the tariffs rise during 1929-32.

                                                  14

according to these results. Another remarkable finding is that most (again roughly two-thirds) of

the subsequent drop in the tariff from 1932-54 can be attributed to rising import prices. The

RTAA and the GATT made important contributions to tariff reduction, but it was mostly

accomplished by rising import prices during the 1940s and early 1950s. Furthermore, the average

tariff was quite low, about 11 percent, by the early 1950s and was significantly reduced again only

in the early 1970s (to about 5-6 percent) when import prices skyrocketed.      Table 4 also reports

that, over the postwar period from 1945-67, higher import prices account for over 80 percent of

the fall in tariffs.

         The U, S. Tariff Commission recognized that the erosion of specific duties during the

1940s contributed significantly to tariff reduction. In a report published just tier   the formation of

the GATT, the USTC (1948, p. 18) obsemed that “prices of import goods have risen greatly

during the last two decades, and this fact alone would have cause a marked reduction in the

average rate of duties actually collected in recent years compared with earlier years because of the

effects of higher prices on the ad valorem equivalents of the specific and compound duties.

(Imports subject to such duties together account for about two-thirds of total dutiable imports.)”

         The USTC (1948, pp. 19-20) also attempted to determine the relative importance of trade

agreements and higher import prices in reducing the U. S. tariff from 1930-33 to 1948:

         “Two major factors have been chiefly (if not wholly) responsible for this reduction in the
         average rate of duty -- the trade agreements concessions and the advance in prices of
         articles subject to specific or compound duties. (Changes in the composition of imports
         may have affected the averages to some extent, but the direction of the effect is not
         known.) It is impossible to determine exactly the relative importance of these two main
         factors, but it seems probable that they have been not far from equal in their effects.”

The USTC then presented a crude calculation to substantiate the judgment that higher import
                                                     15

prices and negotiated duty reductions contributed equally in bringing the average tariff to its 1948

level.

           The econometric model estimated here cofirms      the USTC’s judgment about the relative

effects of trade agreements and higher import prices for the period they considered (1930-33 to

1948). The coefficients from the column 3 regression in Table 2 imply that the RTAA and GATT

(holding import prices constant) would have reduced the tariff by 34 percent from 1931 (close to

the average 1930-33) to 1948, while higher import prices (holding the Smoot-Hawley          tariff in

place) would have reduced the tariff by 32 percent. Thus, trade agreements contributed just as

much as higher import prices (in fact slightly more) to tariff reduction from the early 1930s to

1948.19

           The changes in 1947-48 alone dramatize the impact of higher import prices and lower

negotiated duties on the average tariff. The USTC (1948, p. 18) calculated that had the tariff cuts

from the first GATT round in Geneva (finalized in October 1947, implemented in January 1948)

been applied to actual imports in 1947, the average tariff would have declined21       percent, from

19.4 percent to 15.3 percent.       The average tariff in 1948 turned out to be 13,9 percent and higher

import prices filly account for the difference, Import prices rose 10.5 percent between 1947 and

1948, which -- given our estimated elasticity of-0.67 -- would have reduced the tariff by 7.0

percent.        Applying both the 21 percent reduction due to the GATT negotiations and the 7 percent

reduction due to higher import prices to the 1947 tariff of 19.4 percent yields exactly 13.9


         19 The calculations in Tables 3-4 attribute more to rising import prices because they start
from the tariff peak in 1932 and end in the mid- 1950s, allowing more time for higher import
prices to reduce the tariff firther below its 1948 level. By the chosen endpoint of 1954, import
price inflation had stabilized and the average tariff leveled off at about 10-11 percent, where it
remained until the early 1970s.

percent.        Sointhis   onepivotal   year, filly athirdofthe   U. S.tariffreduction   wasdue    to higher

import prices. Over time, of course, the cumulative effect of higher import prices dominated the

sporadic, negotiated rate reductions in bringing about lower U.S. ttis               afier 1932.

           Because it was widely believed that a return to the early 1930s-style deflation could not be

ruled out after the war, Congress and import-competing             interests probably did not filly anticipate

the inflation-induced       reduction in tariffs. The USTC (1948, p. 20) thought it “impossible to

forecast, even roughly, the prices of imported goods a few years hence.” Yet import prices rose

81.4 percent between 1945 and 1955, most of which occurred in the five years after the end of the

war, making the lower tariff a fait accomDli by 1950. Were policymakers aware of the erosion of

specific duties due to import price inflation? The USTC’S discussion was not buried deep in its

report, but neither was it highlighted.         During the late 1940s and early 1950s, trade policy debates

in Congress mainly focused on the type of constraints that should be included in legislation

extending the President’s negotiating authority.           I have been unable to find evidence that Congress

was general] y aware or deeply concerned about the erosion of the specific duties, as might be

suggested by proposals to offset the impact of inflation by enacting higher tariffs or to stem its

effects by converting specific duties into ad valorem duties.

           These findings must, to some extent, change our view of the postwar U.S. trade

liberalization.      The bulk of the U. S. tariff reduction was brought about not through the arduous

task of negotiating rate reductions at t he bargaining table, but through the silent and gradual

erosion of specific tariffs through inflation. Although this erosion was permitted to run its course

without intefierence, the resulting tariff reductions were not the result of deliberate policy

decisions, but a by-product of the century-old Republican preference for specific over ad valorem




            .
                                                   17

duties that was frozen into the tariff code by the Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1930.




IV. The Antebellum Tariff, 1821-1860

        The overwhelming importance of import prices in determining the average tariff in the

century tier the Civil War raises the question of its importance in the antebellum period.       Specific

duties were used extensively from the first tariff in 1789 until the Walker tariff of 1846, which

replaced all specific duties with lower ad valorem duties. The tariff act of 1857 retained the

exclusive use of ad valorem duties, although the Merrill tariff of 1861 reintroduced specific duties

in the tariff code. For this reason, import prices were. probably not as important a determinant of

the average tariff in the antebellum period.

        Table 5 confirms this suspicion. Using data from 1821-60, regressions similar to those

petiorrned above yield a coefficient on the log of import prices similar to that found for the

century @er the Civil War, but it is statistically insignificant. When the sample period 1821-45 is

considered, the coefficient is -64.5 (with a standard error of 49.2); when the sample period is

1847-60 (when ad valorem duties were used exclusively) the coefficient is -0.3 (with a standard

error of 3 .4). This last finding illustrates that import prices are not a source of variation in the

tti   when they are comprised of just ad valorem duties.




V. Conclusions and Implications

        For most of the century following the Civil War, roughly two-thirds of dutiable U.S.

imports were subject to specific duties whose ad v’alorem equivalent was inversely related to the

level of impofi prices. This paper finds that changes in import prices were three to four times



        .
                                                   18

more important than changes in the actual rates of import duty in altering the tariff over the

course of the century.   Tariff changes were not determined as much by the policy actions of

legislators and negotiators, but by fluctuations in import prices. One possible reason for the

benign neglect of policymakers is that changes in import prices were pushing the tariff in the same

direction as policy. The deflation of the early 1920s and 1930s coincides with the higher tariff

rates in the Fordney-McCumber      and Smoot-Hawley tariffs, while the inflation from the mid-1 930s

coincides with a trade agreements program designed to reduce tariffs. Policymakers did not need

to take actions offsetting the effects of import prices on the tariff because price movements did

not cotiict   with the direction in which policy was pushing tariff rates.

        “Tariff cycles,” the negative correlation between the tariff and the business cycle, is an

empirical regularity in the literature on the political economy of trade policy (see, for example,

Bohara and Kaempfer [199 1]). The standard interpretation is to view the tendency of tariffs to

rise when unemployment      rises and real GNP and the GNP deflator fall as reflecting the

endogenous determination of tariff rates in the political market, where politicians are responding

to the pressures of import-competing     interests. This paper implies that this correlation is not

entirely the result from political pressures that endogenously determine the tariff (particularly

since the tariff was changed only every seven years, on average, between 1865 and 1930), but

more from the use of specific duties which automatically gives rise to this phenomena.       Thus, the

tariff cycle partly reflects a form of “path dependence” in which a political choice was made

decades ago to favor specific rather than ad valorem rates of duty as the principal method of

levying taxes on imports.
