                                             ABSTRACT

About 10% of US employees now regularly work from home (WFH), but there are concerns this can
lead to “shirking from home.” We report the results of a WFH experiment at CTrip, a 16,000- employee,
NASDAQ-listed Chinese travel agency. Call center employees who volunteered to WFH were randomly
assigned to work from home or in the office for 9 months. Home working led to a 13% performance
increase, of which about 9% was from working more minutes per shift (fewer breaks and sick-days)
and 4% from more calls per minute (attributed to a quieter working environment). Home workers also
reported improved work satisfaction and experienced less turnover, but their promotion rate conditional
on performance fell. Due to the success of the experiment, CTrip rolled-out the option to WFH to the
whole firm and allowed the experimental employees to re-select between the home or office. Interestingly,
over half of them switched, which led to the gains from WFH almost doubling to 22%. This highlights
the benefits of learning and selection effects when adopting modern management practices like WFH.

                                             I. INTRODUCTION

Working from home (also called telecommuting or telework, but hereafter referred to as “WFH”) is
becoming an increasingly common practice. In the United States, about 10% of the workforce
reports working from home at least one day a week (Census 2010), while the proportion that
primarily work from home has almost doubled over the past 30 years, from 2.3% in 1980 to 4.3% in
2010. 1 At the same time, the wage discount (after controlling for observables) from working
exclusively at home has fallen, from 30% in 1980 to zero in 2000 as WFH moved from being
predominantly found in low-skilled jobs to encompassing a wider set of occupations (Oettinger,
2010). Home-based workers now span a wide spectrum of jobs, ranging from sales assistants to
managers and software engineers, with a correspondingly wide range of incomes (Figure 1).

Having employees work from home raises two major issues. First, is it a useful management
practice? This is an important question with no systematic evidence or consensus. 2 Thus, even
within a single industry, practices often vary dramatically. For example, JetBlue Airlines’ call-
center employees all work from home, American Airlines does not allow any home work, and
United Airlines has a mix of practices. More generally, Bloom et al. (2009) reported that 30% of
U.S. and 33% of European manufacturing firms offer opportunities for at least some managers to
work from home, with wide variation in adoption rates within every 3-digit SIC code surveyed.

The second issue relates to the concerns over deteriorating work-life balance in the US and other
developed economies and to the potential of working from home to help address this. The number
of households in the US with both parents working has increased from 25% in 1968 to 48% in 2008
(Council of Economic Advisors, 2010). The increasing pressure for both parents to work is leading
governments in the US and Europe to investigate ways to promote work-life balance, with again a
shortage of evidence:

    A factor hindering a deeper understanding of the benefits and costs of flexibility is a lack of
    data on the prevalence of workplace flexibility and arrangements, and more research is needed
    on the mechanisms through which flexibility influences workers’ job satisfaction and firms’
    profits to help policy makers and managers alike.
                                       (Council of Economic Advisors, 2010, Executive Summary)

The efficacy of WFH as a management practice was what concerned CTrip, China’s largest travel
agency, with 16,000 employees and NASDAQ listed. Its senior management were interested in
allowing its Shanghai call-center employees to work from home because they perceived potential
benefits from reducing office rental costs, which were increasing rapidly due to the booming real
estate market in Shanghai, and from reducing high attrition rates. But the executives worried that
allowing employees to work at home, away from the supervision of their team leaders, would lead
to a large increase in shirking. The call center workforce was mainly younger employees, many of
whom might well have struggled to remain focused working from home without direct supervision.
Many CTrip employees were also interested in working from home to save on commuting time and

1
  In the E.U. in 2005, an average of 7.0% of employees worked from home at least a quarter of the time, and 1.7% did
so almost all the time (EIROnline, 2010).

  See, for example, Bailey and Kurland (2002).

                                                                                                                  2
costs. However, they worried about the isolation of working from home and that it would reduce
their chances of promotion.

Given the uncertainty surrounding the effects of working from home in the research literature as
well as in practice, the firm’s senior management decided to run a randomized control trial. The
authors assisted in designing the experiment and had complete access to the resulting data, as well
as to data from surveys conducted by the firm. We also conducted various surveys ourselves and
numerous interviews with employees, team leaders and senior management.

In summary, CTrip decided to run a nine-month experiment on working from home. They asked the
996 employees in the airfare and hotel departments of the Shanghai call center whether they would
be interested in working from home four days a week, with the fifth day in the office as usual.
Approximately half of the employees (503) were interested, particularly those who were married,
had children and faced long commutes to work. Of these, 249 were qualified to take part in the
experiment by virtue of having at least six months tenure, broadband access and a private room at
home in which they could work. After a lottery draw, those with even-numbered birthdays were
selected to work at home from these 249 employees while those with odd-numbered birthdates
stayed in the office to act as the control group.

Office and home workers used the same IT equipment, faced the same work order flow from a
common central server, and were compensated under the same pay system, which included an
element of individual performance pay. Hence, the only difference between the two groups was the
location of work.3 This allows us to isolate the impact of working from home versus other practices
that are often bundled alongside this practice in attempts to improve work-life balance, such as
flexible work hours.

We found several striking results. First, the performance of the home workers went up dramatically,
increasing by 13% over the nine months of the experiment. This improvement came mainly from a
9% increase in the number of minutes they worked during their shifts (i.e., the time they were
logged in to take calls). This was due to a reduction in breaks and sick-days taken by the home
workers. The remaining 4% improvement came from home workers increasing the number of calls
per minute worked. In interviews the workers attributed this gain to the quieter working conditions
at home. Second, there appear to be no spillovers to the rest of the group. Comparing the control
group to similar workers in CTrip’s other call center in Nan Tong we see no performance drop
despite their losing the treatment lottery. Third, attrition fell sharply among the home workers,
dropping by 50% versus the control group. Home workers also reported substantially higher work
satisfaction and had more positive attitudinal survey outcomes. Fourth, one downside of WFH
appears to be that, conditional on performance, it reduced rates of promotion by about 50%.

There are some obvious concerns with these results. First, was quality sacrificed for quantity by the
home workers? Using two different quality metrics we found no impact on quality of home
working. Second, could the results be driven by the control workers’ becoming frustrated by losing
the randomization lottery and then performing worse? Fortunately, CTrip had a second large call

3
 This of course had implications that were potentially relevant to the experiment. In particular, employees at home did
not have on-going, immediate contact with their managers and they worked in a different environment than those in the
office. We discuss these points more below.

                                                                                                                     3
center in Nan Tong and we can compare the control group to similar employees there. We found
almost identical results. Similarly we can compare the control group workers to eligible non-
volunteers – eligible employees who never wanted to work from home – and we again found almost
identical results. Third, perhaps our results are driven by attrition bias. It turns out that in fact our
results are probably biased by attrition, but biased downwards so the true impact of WFH is
probably substantially larger. In both control and treatment groups worse performing employees
tended to quit more rapidly, but the since the quit rates were twice as large in the control group this
generated a larger upwards bias on the performance measures for the control group. Using the
approach of Lee (2008), we found an upper bound on the treatment effects that is about 50% higher
than our baseline 13% estimate.

Finally, at the end of the experiment, the firm estimated it saved about $2,000 per year per
employee working at home, leading it to offer the option to work from home to the entire firm. It
also allowed the treatment and control groups to re-select their working arrangements. Surprisingly,
over half of all the employees changed their minds, indicating the extent of employee learning
about their own suitability for working from home. In particular, two thirds of the control group
(who initially had all volunteered to work from home 10 months earlier) decided to stay in the
office, citing concerns over the loneliness of home working and lower rates of promotion. In
reverse, half of the treatment group changed their minds and returned to the office – typically those
who had performed relatively badly at home.

This learning and re-selection led to the impact from working at home rising to 22%, almost double
the direct experiment effect of 13%. The reason was strong selection effects: workers with worse
performance at home over the 9 month experiment period returned to the office, while those who
performed well at home stayed at home. Strikingly, this ratio of selection + direct effects (22%) to
direct effects (13%) is similar to the 2:1 ratio in Lazear’s well-known study of introducing piece-
rate pay in Safelite Auto Glass (Lazear 2000). This highlights how selection effects of employees
across different working practices are an important part of the impact of management practices, and
the reason why this experiment – which followed employees over the experiment and subsequent
firm roll-out – was so informative.

This experiment thus highlights the extensive learning by both the firm and employees around the
adoption of a new management practice like working from home. Ex ante, both groups were unsure
about its impact, and the 9-month experiment and subsequent roll-out process were essential for
their ability to evaluate it. These gradual learning effects are one factor behind the slow adoption of
modern management practices, and we see the results as similar to the adoption process for product
innovations, like hybrid seed-corn as emphasized in Griliches’ (1957) classic article.

This experiment is the first randomized experiment on working from home. As such, it also
provides causal evidence to supplement the prior case-study and survey research. It is also unusual
in that it involves a randomized controlled experiment within a large firm. Moreover, we were also
granted exceptional access not only to data but also to CTrip management’s thinking about the
experiment and its results. This was because one of the co-authors of this paper, James Liang – the
co-founder, first CEO and current Chairman of CTrip – was also a doctoral student at Stanford GSB
at the time. As a result, this paper benefited from unusually rich insight into the rollout and
adoption of a new management practice in a large, multinational firm.

                                                                                                       4
Of course the experiment involved a particular group of employees – those working in call-centers
– who tend to be lower paid with a more measurable outcome (i.e. number of calls made). As such
the direct implications for performance are limited to these types of jobs. But as Figure 1 shows,
there are still many millions of US employees working from home in lower-paid jobs, many of
whom are in roles with measurable outcomes like telesales, administration and case-based IT
support. More generally, we also believe that the results on attrition and promotion have broader
applicability – many employees do seem to strongly prefer working from home, but fear this
reduces rates of promotion. Our study also highlights the importance of learning and
experimentation around working from home – CTrip’s management and more than 50% of their
employees appear to have changed their views due to the experiment.

This paper connects to three strands of literature. First, there is a long literature that links the
puzzling dispersion of productivity between firms to differences in management practices (see the
literature from Walker (1887) to Leibenstein (1966) to Syversson (2011), Gibbons and Henderson
(2012) and Bloom et al. (2013)). Our paper suggests that uncertainty about the efficacy of new
practices may play a role in the slow diffusion of these practices, including those addressing issues
of work-life balance such as WFH. These practices have potentially large effects on measured
productivity. For example, based on the methodology that is used to measure productivity using
Census data (e.g. Foster, Haltiwanger and Krizan, 2000) CTrip would have increased productivity
by 30% after introducing working from home, even before accounting for selection effects, because
it increased output while cutting capital and labor inputs.

The second strand of literature is on the adoption of work-life balance practices. It is based
primarily on case-studies and surveys across firms. These tend to show large positive associations
of adoption with lower employee turnover and absenteeism and with higher productivity and
profitability.4 However, these studies are hard to evaluate because of the non-randomized nature of
the programs. This is true both in terms of the selection of firms into adopting working-from-home
programs and also the selection of employees to work at home.

Finally, there is the connection to the urban economics literature. Reducing the frequency of
commuting will reduce vehicle miles travelled, lowering emissions, but also reducing population
centrality as people move out to the suburbs (Bento et al. 2005).5 WFH is also part of the wider
impact of IT on firm fragmentation arising from the increasing ease of long-distance
communicating (e.g. Rossi-Hansberg et al., 2009). CTrip in 2012 was setting up regional offices to
employ workers in lower-wage, inland Chinese cities using the same working-from-home
technology they used in this experiment.

 For example, JetBlue allowed home-based call center employees to live up to 3 hours drive from the office as they
needed to come into the office only one day per month. As a result, many JetBlue employees chose to live in rural areas
outside Salt Lake City, the firm’s headquarters.

                                                                                                                     5
                                           II. THE EXPERIMENT

II.A. The Company
Our experiment took place at CTrip International Corporation, a leading travel agency in China
with operations also in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Like other travel agencies internationally, CTrip
aggregated information on hotels, flights and tours; made reservations and obtained tickets for
clients; and generated revenue through commissions from hotels, airlines and tour operators.
Because of lower Internet penetration in China, CTrip did much more of its business on the
telephone than leading U.S. agencies like Expedia, Orbitz or Travelocity. CTrip was established in
1999, was quoted on NASDAQ in 2003, and was worth about $5bn at the time of the experiment. It
was the largest travel agent in China in terms of hotel nights and airline tickets booked, with over
50% market share in 2010. Exhibit A displays photos of the CTrip Shanghai office, a modern multi-
story building that housed the call center in which the experiment took place, as well as several
other CTrip divisions and its top management team. The firm also operated a second call center in
Nan Tong, a city about 1 hour away from Shanghai, which employed about 5,000 call center staff.
Both locations operate in the same fashion, with the same equipment under the same procedures.

Call center representatives were organized into small “teams”6 of around 10 to 15 people (mean of
11.7 and median of 11), grouped by department and the type of work. There were four jobs in each
of the two departments – hotel and airline – involved in the experiment. These were order takers,
who answered customer calls, took orders, and entered them into the CTrip information system;
order placers, who dealt with the airlines and hotels and then notified the clients; order correctors,
who resolved problems such as a flight being canceled; plus a night shift that both placed and
corrected orders. The members of a given team sat together in one area of the floor, typically
occupying an entire aisle. Each call center representative worked in a cubical with equipment
including a computer, a telephone and a headset. When team members were ready to start work,
they logged on to CTrip’s IT system and, in the case of order takers, client calls were automatically
routed into their headsets. Order placers and order correctors were also allocated tasks
automatically. The allocations between the two Shanghai and Nan Tong call centers were handled
centrally, using a standard call queuing system. When employees wanted to take a break, they
logged out of the system. The team leaders patrolled the aisles to monitor employees’ performance
as well as help resolve issues with reservations, provide ongoing training, and give emotional
support to employees dealing with difficult clients.

The employees typically worked 5 shifts a week, scheduled by the firm in advance. All members of
a team worked on the same schedule, so individuals could not choose their shifts. A team shared the
same team leader and the same work schedule, as well as the same working area on the call center
floor.

Monthly earnings were composed of a flat wage and a bonus. The flat wage depended on seniority,
education, and prior experience, averaging around ¥1300 per month. The bonus portion depended
on the individual’s monthly performance, and also averaged about ¥1300 per month. The bonus was
primarily a linear function of call and order volumes, but with small adjustments for call quality

6
 The call-center jobs did not involve “teamwork” and there was no group-based pay, but we stick with the term “team”
because that was what CTrip called the work groups operating under a common “team” manager.

                                                                                                                  6
(penalties were applied for call quality scores below certain thresholds) and shift type (night shifts,
for example, were paid a higher flat rate). Promotion to team-leader was also based on performance,
so both current pay and career concerns provided incentives for employees to perform well.

Since no other Chinese firm had tried allowing home-working among its call center employees,
there was no local precedent. In the US, the decision to allow employees in call centers to work
from home varied across firms, even those within the same industry, suggesting a lack of any
consensus on its impact. Meanwhile, the prior academic literature on call centers also offered
limited guidance, being based on case studies of individual, firm-level interventions. Given this
uncertainty, management decided to run an experiment.

II.B. The Experimental Design
The experiment took place in the airfare and hotel booking departments in the Shanghai call center.
The treatment in our experiment was to work 4 shifts a week at home and to work the 5th shift in
the office on a fixed day of the week determined by the firm. Treatment employees still worked on
the same schedule as their teammates because they had to work under the supervision of the team
leader (who was always office-based), but they operated from home for 4 of their 5 shifts. For
example, in a team the treatment employees might work from home from 9am to 5pm on Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday and in the office from 9am to 5pm on Thursday. The control
employees from that team would work in the office from 9am to 5pm on all five days. Hence, the
experiment changed only the location of work, not the type or the hours of work. Because all
incoming phone calls and work orders were distributed by central servers, the work flow was also
identical between office and home locations. Home workers also used the same CTrip-provided
computer terminals, communications equipment and software, faced the same pay structure and
undertook the same training as the control group (although for the treatment employees this
occurred only the day they were in the office).

Importantly, individual employees were not allowed to work overtime outside their team shift,
because doing so would require their team leader to supervise their work. Hence, entire teams could
have their hours changed – for example all teams had their shifts increased during the week before
Chinese New Year – but individuals were not able to work overtime on their own. In particular,
eliminating commuting time, which was 80 minutes a day for the average employee, did not permit
the treatment group to work overtime, and so this is not a factor directly driving the results.

Three factors other than location did differ between treatment and control. First, the treatment
group’s spending less time commuting meant that they would sometimes be able to take care of
personal and family responsibilities without taking breaks or leaving early from work. As we will
see, this appears to have had a significant effect. Second, the treatment workers did not have as
much support from their team leaders, because technological limitations meant that they could not
get real-time help from their supervisors while dealing with clients. If anything, this presumably
reduced the effectiveness of the treatment workers. Finally, the work environment differed between
treatment and control. The former were working alone, typically in what was reported to be a
quieter environment. Being alone had some negative effects on willingness to work from home, but
the quietness had positive effects on productivity.




                                                                                                     7
In early November 2010, employees in the airfare and hotel booking departments were informed of
the working from home program. They all took an extensive survey documenting demographics,
working conditions and their willingness to join the program. When asked about their willingness to
join the program, employees were not told the criteria that they would have to meet in order to
participate in the program. Employees who were both willing and qualified to join the program
were recruited for the experiment. Of the 994 employees in the airfare and hotel booking
departments, 503 (51%) volunteered for the experiment. They tend to have a longer commute, less
tenure in the firm, less education and their own bedroom (see Table 1). Importantly, prior
performance (measured simply by the gross-wage, given that almost 50% of earnings was
performance-related pay) was not predictive for the take-up of working from home. This helped to
assuage one concern of the firm, that worse performing employees would be more tempted to work
from home to avoid the direct supervision of their team leaders.

Interestingly, 49% of employees did not opt to work from home, despite the considerable saving in
commuting time and cost. The major reason given for this in later interviews was the loneliness of
working from home and the lack of opportunities to socialize in the office and after work. Another
reason was the possible negative impact for WFH on promotion, which as we discuss in section IV
below, appears to have been a legitimate concern.

To qualify to work from home, an employee also needed to have tenure of at least 6 months, have
broadband Internet at home to connect to the network, and an independent workspace at home
during their shift (such as their own bedroom). Among the volunteers, 249 (50%) of the employees
met the eligibility requirements and were recruited into the experiment.

The treatment and control groups were then determined from this group of 249 employees through
a public lottery. Employees with an even birth date (a day ending 2, 4, 6, 8, etc.) were selected into
the treatment and those with an odd birth date were in the control group. This selection of even
birthdates into the treatment group was randomly determined by the Chairman, James Liang, by
drawing a ping pong ball from an urn in a public ceremony one week prior to the experiment’s start
date (see Exhibit B). 7 The treatment group was notified and equipment was installed at each
treatment participant’s home the following week. Comparison between treatment and control
groups (see Appendix A2) shows there was a significant difference between them in 2 of the 18
characteristics: the control group was more likely to be married and have children. This reflects the
fact that with 18 different characteristics on average we expect 1 difference to be significant, with 2
differences not unusual. Importantly, when we interact these differences with the impact on WFH
we find no impact (Appendix table A5), suggesting this sampling variation is not material for the
results.

The experiment commenced on December 6, 2010 and lasted for 9 months, which employees knew
in advance. All treatment employees had to remain at home for this period, even if they changed
their minds and wanted to return to the office. On August 15, 2011, employees were notified that
the experiment had been a success and that CTrip would roll out the experiment to those who were
qualified and wanted to work at home in the airfare and hotels departments on September 1st, 2011.

7
  It was important to have this draw in an open ceremony so that managers and employees could not complain of
“favoritism” in the randomization process. The choice of odd/even birthdate was made to ensure the randomization was
straightforward and transparent.

                                                                                                                  8
Throughout the experiment, employees were told the experiment would be evaluated to guide future
company policies, but they did not learn the actual policy roll-out decision until August 15th.
Because of the large scale of the experiment and the lack of dissemination of experimental results
beyond the management team, prior to the roll-out decision, employees were uncertain about what
that decision would be. Employees in the treatment group who wished to come back to work in the
office full-time were only allowed to do so after September 1st, while control group had to stay in
the office for the full duration of the experiment.8 Hence, the treatment and control assignments
were fixed for the full 9 months, except for a few cases where equipment broke down or employees
changed apartments and lost access to their own room.9

Figure 2 shows compliance with the experiment throughout the experimental period, and for one
year after the general roll-out. During the experiment, the percentage of treatment group working at
home hovered between 80% and 90%. Since compliance was not perfect, our estimators take even
birth date status as the treatment status, so we estimate an intention to treat result. The impact on
performance if compliance were perfect would be about 10% larger.

After the experiment, we see about 50% of the treatment group immediately decided to return to the
office, despite having to incur the financial and time costs of commuting. Strikingly, only about
35% of the control employees – who all initially were interested in working from home – actually
moved home when they were allowed to do so. The main reasons both groups gave in interviews
for changing their minds were concerns over being isolated at home. Finally, we also see that about
10% of the workers who did not initially volunteer changed their minds after the experiment and
decided to work from home.

It is worth noting that the firm’s management was surprised by two of the findings. First, they were
struck by how many employees changed their minds about working from home. More than 50% of
the volunteer group and 10% of the non-volunteer group switched preferences after the 9-month
experiment. Employees reported that after working from home for a few months they became
lonely and wanted to return to the office.

Second, despite the time and financial savings from not having to commute, more than half of the
workers eligible to work at home decided to work in the office, suggesting they place a high value
on social interactions at work (Hamermesh, 1990). This is particularly striking because, as we note
below, we find no negative impact of home working on performance or quality of service.

II.C. Data Collection
CTrip had an extremely comprehensive central data collection system, in large part because its
founding team came from Oracle and had extensive database software experience. The bulk of the
data we used in our paper were directly extracted from the firm’s central database, providing

8
  Employees who would like to work from home in the control group were allowed to work from home after equipment
were installed at home starting late October 2011.
9
  In all estimations, we use the even birthdate as the indicator for working-at-home, so these individuals are treated as
home workers. In a probit for actually working from home during the experiment, none of the observables are
significant, suggesting that returning to the office was effectively random. One reason is that the IT group policed this
heavily to prevent employees fabricating stories to enable them to return to the office.

                                                                                                                       9
extremely high data accuracy. The data we collected can be categorized in 7 fields: performance,
labor supply, attrition, promotions, reported employee work satisfaction, detailed demographic
information, and survey information on attitudes towards the program.

Performance measures varied by the job: the 134 order takers versus the 11 order placers, order
correctors, and night shift workers (details in Appendix 1). Order takers’ key performance measures
were the number of phone calls answered and number of orders taken. The key measures for the
other three groups were the numbers of different types of calls made. For order takers, we could
also accurately measure time spent working (in terms of minutes on the phone) because phone calls
and call lengths were logged in the central CTrip database. The firm used these measures to monitor
the work of its employees. We also calculated phone calls answered per minute as a measure of
labor productivity for these workers.

We have daily performance measures of all employees in the airfare and hotel booking departments
from January 1st, 2010 onwards as well as daily minutes on the phone for order takers. We also
collected data on different types of promotion by September 2012, almost 2 years after the
experiment commenced. The firm ran internal surveys of the employees during the experiment on
work exhaustion and on positive and negative attitudes (see details in Appendix A3). We conducted
two rounds of surveys, in November 2010 and August 2011, to collect detailed information on all
the employees in the two departments including basic demographics, income, and attitudes toward
the program, and ran extensive interviews and focus groups with the employees. Finally, in May
2012 we conducted interviews with managers and with employees who had chosen not to work
from home to learn about the reasons for this choice.


                               III. IMPACT ON THE FIRM

We analyzed the effect of home-working both in terms of its impact on the firm, which we cover in
this section, and the impact on the employees, which we cover in the next section. The data and
Stata do-files to replicate all results are available on www.stanford.edu/~nbloom/WFH.zip.

III.A. Individual Employee Performance
We first estimated the intention to treat effect on weekly employee performance prior to and during
experimental period data via equation (1)

                                     ,                                           ,    (1)

where Treati is a dummy variable that equals 1 if an individual belongs to the treatment group
defined by having an even-numbered birthday; Experimentt is a dummy variable that equals 1 for
the experimental period December 6th to August 15th; and Employee Performancei,t is one of the key
measures of work performance. This includes the log of weekly phone calls answered, log of phone
calls answered per minute on the phone, log of weekly sum of minutes on the phone, and an overall
performance z-score measure (performance score normalized to mean=0 and standard-deviation=1
based on pre-experiment performance for each task). Finally, reflects a full set of weekly time
dummies to account for seasonal variation in travel demand, such as the World Expo in 2010 and
the Chinese New Year, and reflect a full set of individual fixed effects.

                                                                                                10
To make performance of different types of workers comparable, we use performance z-scores. For
each individual we subtract the pre-experiment mean for the set of individuals holding the same job
(“worker type”) and divide by the pre-experiment standard deviation for the worker type. Hence,
this normalized z-score measure has a mean 0 and standard deviation 1 across all employees within
each type of worker during the pre-experiment period. We do this both for individual performance
measures and for the pair of measures for the order takers, in which case the z-scores on the
individual measures are used to create an overall z-score.

In column (1) of Table 2, overall performance of the treatment group is found to be 0.232 standard
deviations higher than the control group after the experiment started, significant at the 1% level.
Column (2) limits the sample to only performance data during the experiment and compares the
treatment group to the control group without controlling for individual fixed effects. The coefficient
is slightly smaller but similar.10 If we limit the sample to the 134 order-takers, we can use phone
calls answered as the key performance measure. The z-scores of phone calls account for different
volume and average length of phone calls in two departments. In column (3), we look only at the
phone calls performance measure and find it is 0.248 standard deviations higher in the treatment
group. In column (4), we look at the log of phone calls and find a coefficient of 0.120, meaning that
treatment employees were making 13% (noting that 13%=exp(0.120)) more phone calls per week.

We can also see these results in Figure 3 where we plot the raw number of phone calls per week for
the treatment and control groups from Jan 1st 2010 until the end of the experiment in August 15th
2011. Before the experiment started, the treatment group trended closely together with the control
group, both of which bounced around due to seasonal fluctuations in demand. But once the
experiment began, the treatment group started to outperform the control group, answering about 40
more phone calls per person per week.

Interestingly, the difference in performance was greatest during the middle of the experiment, from
about 2 to 6 months. The smaller rise in improvement during the first 2 months was due to
installation and learning effects. It took several weeks for all the IT and logistical bugs to be
addressed. The gradual decline in the performance gap from 6 months onwards reflects two trends.
First, poorly performing employees in the control group were more likely to quit than those in the
treatment group (see section IV.B and Table 8), boosting the control group’s performance. Second,
from focus groups and interviews we learned that some employees in the treatment group felt
lonely working at home after a few months and wanted to return to the office but could not because
of the experiment’s design. This potentially affected their motivation.

Figure 4 plots the cross-sectional distribution of performance for treatment and control groups at 3
months into the experiment, displaying a broad distributional improvement from working-from-
home (rather than the results being driven by a few outliers).

10
   Because we have a randomized intervention we can examine either the difference between treatment and control
(evaluated over the experimental period), or the difference of differences (evaluated as the change in performance
between treatment and control over the experimental period versus the pre-experimental period). Since employees have
large pre-existing cross-sectional variations in performance we obtain more accurate estimations from using the
difference in difference specification, estimated using the panel with employee fixed effects. However, comparing
columns (1) and (2) we see the estimators are quantitatively similar and within one-standard deviation of each other.

                                                                                                                  11
We further decomposed the difference in performance observed in column (4) into phone calls
answered per minute on the phone (a measure of productivity), and minutes on the phone (a
measure of high-frequency labor supply). In column (5), we found treatment employees were
making 3.3% (note that 3.3%=exp(0.032)) more phone calls per minute, which the employees
attributed to home being quieter than the office. They told us this meant it was easier to hear the
customers, so they did not have to ask them to repeat themselves as often and could process the
orders more quickly. This suggestion matches the psychology literature, which has shown that
background office noise can reduce cognitive performance (see, for example, Banbury and Berry,
1998).

The largest factor increasing the home-workers performance is that, as shown in column (6), they
worked 9.2% (9.2%=exp(0.088)) more minutes per day. This was despite the fact that home and
office workers both worked the same nominal shift. The reason home-workers could increase
minutes on the phone was that, within their shifts, they were available to take calls for more time,
meaning they were taking less time off during their shifts.

III.B. Individual Employee Labor Supply
In Table 3, we investigate the factors driving this increase in minutes worked within each shift.
Column (1) repeats the results from the final column of Table 2. Columns (2) and (3) break this
difference in minutes on the phone down into two pieces. In column (2), we look at whether
treatment workers spent more minutes on the phone per day worked, and column (3) looks at
whether they worked for more days.

Column (2) shows that about three quarters of the difference in the time on the phone was
accounted for by the treatment group’s spending more time on the phone per day worked. This is
because: (a) they started work more punctually, a phenomenon which they attributed to avoiding
the effects of events that disrupted commuting like bad traffic or the heavy snow in Shanghai in
February 2011;11 (b) they could schedule personal matters, like doctor’s appointments, in the time
they saved by not commuting (rather than having to leave early); and (c) they took shorter breaks
during the day. In column (3) we see that the other one-quarter of the difference in time worked
between treatment and control was explained by treatment employees’ working more days because
they also took fewer sick-days. Employees explained this was because they continued to work at
home when they felt somewhat ill but would not have felt up to commuting into work.

To investigate this further we interacted the WFH treatment dummy with a long commute indicator.
Individuals with long commutes should be more likely to increase their hours when WFH since
they are more likely to suffer commuting delays. Indeed looking at columns (4) to (6) we see this:
the differences in the weekly time on the phone as well as time on the phone per day worked are
larger for employees with a commute times of above 120 minutes per day.12 We also tried other
interactions with marital status, children, education and tenure (the variables that predicted WFH in
Table 1) and found no significant interactions.



11
     CTrip is strict with punctuality of its workers. If a worker comes to work late, it is recorded as taking time off.
12
     21.3% of employees commute for more than 120 minutes per day (the includes the commute to and from work).

                                                                                                                           12
III.C. Quality, Spillovers
One question is whether quality of the service was compromised for the increase in output in the
treatment group. We constructed two quality measures: conversion rates and weekly recording
scores. Conversion rates were calculated as the percentage of phone calls answered that resulted in
orders, while the weekly recording scores came from the 1% of phone-calls that were randomly
evaluated by an external monitoring team. In summary (with the full details in table A4 in the
appendix), we find no impact of working from home on quality using either measure.

Another related question is whether the improvement associated with working from home came
from an improvement in the treatment group or from a deterioration in the control group. Perhaps
the gap between treatment and control was caused not by the treatment group performing better but
by the control group performing worse after they “lost” the randomization lottery. The group
winning the treatment lottery saved themselves 9 months of commuting time and costs, a
substantial gain worth about 17% of their salary, evaluated at their CTrip wage rate.13

We collected data on two other “quasi” control groups to answer this question. The first group was
the employees in the Nan Tong call center who would have be eligible under the selection rules for
the experiment. This call center also had airfare and hotel departments, and calls were allocated
across the Shanghai and Nan Tong call centers randomly from the same central server. The second
group was the 190 employees in the Shanghai call center who did not volunteer to participate in the
WFH experiment but met the eligibility requirements to work from home. We think these two
groups were comparable to the treatment and control groups for two reasons. First, all four groups
faced the same demand for their services. Second, they all met the requirements for eligibility to
participate in the experiment.

Comparisons of these alternative control groups are also reported in Table 4. Results in the top
panel of Table 4 compare the Shanghai treatment and control groups to Nan Tong, revealing no
significant differences in overall performance between Nan Tong and the control group. The bottom
panel compares treatment and control group to the eligible non-experimental group in Shanghai.
Again, we find no significant difference between the control group and the eligible non-
experimental group. These results suggest that the gap between the treatment and control group
reflects an improvement in the performance of the treatment group rather than any deterioration of
the control group. That is, although the control group and the treatment group work in the same
team, we find – perhaps surprisingly – no evidence of the control group’s having been discouraged
by losing the working-from-home lottery. 14

III.D. Potential Hawthorne Effects
Another explanation for the superior performance of the treatment group are Hawthorne effects,
which suggest that the employees were motivated by the experiment, possibly deliberately so that
the firm would roll out WFH permanently. We should note three things, however, that make this

13
   The average employee made about $100 per week for a 40 hour week. The average commuting time was 40 minutes
each way and the corresponding out-of-pocket commuting cost averaged $0.50. Hence, the saving in time is about $13 a
week in time costs and about $4 per week in out–of-pocket costs.
14
   Alternatively, we could compare the performance of treatment and control group during the days treatment group
work at home with the days they work in the office. Unfortunately, they were not comparable because team leader often
scheduled weekly team meetings during the day treatment group worked in the office.

                                                                                                                  13
appear unlikely. First, there were 131 employees working from home, so each individual employee
had little impact on the overall evaluation of the experiment, and thus little incentive to try to
manipulate it. Second, the gap between home-based employees and office-based employees
widened after the experiment ended, as we shall see in the next section. Finally, the firm was itself
so convinced that the success of the experiment was not due to Hawthorne type effects that it rolled
out WFH to the entire airfare and hotel divisions.

III.E. Post-Experiment Selection
In August 2011, the management estimated that each working from home employee saved CTrip
about $2,000,15 so they decided to extend the option to work from home to the entire hotel and
airfare departments. Employees in these departments were notified that the experiment had ended
and they were entitled to choose their location of work (conditional on being eligible), so control
employees who still wished to could move home, and treatment employees who wanted to return to
the office could do so.16

As shown in Figure 5 – which plots the difference in normalized phone-calls between home and
office workers – post-experiment selection substantially increased the performance impact from
working from home. The reason is that workers that had performed relatively badly at home
returned to the office. This increased the increase in performance z-scores from home-working from
about 50 calls per week during the experiment to more than 100 calls per week 9 months after the
end of the experiment. This is also evaluated in Table 5, which estimates the performance impact of
working-from-home during and after the experiment.

In Table 5 column (1) repeats our baseline results for z-scores. In column (2) we see that the
average z-score rose by 28.5% after the experiment. Once we control for quits by using a balanced
panel we find even larger increases in performance, of 34% for z-scores in column (3). In column 4
we examine instead our direct performance measure, which is the number of phone calls again
repeating our baseline specification. Column (5) is the key result – the post experiment effect of
WFH rises to 24.6%17, almost double the 13% increase in the baseline. Finally, in column we again
control for quits with the balance panel and the increase in performance after the end of the
experiment is 105% of the baseline.18 The fact that the balanced panel results show an even larger
increase in performance indicates that it is sorting of employees between home and the office
(rather than differential attrition) that drove the further improvement from WFH during the post-
experiment, roll-out period.

This sorting effect was driven by treatment workers who had performed relatively badly at home
returning to the office. This is shown in Table 6, top panel, columns (1) to (4), which runs probits
on whether a treatment worker returned to the office. The results show that treatment workers who
performed relatively worse at home versus the office returned to the office. This was despite the
fact that all treatment workers had initially volunteered to work from home, suggesting that many of

15
   See Section V.A for the derivation of this figure.
16
   Treatment group employees who were working at home and wanted to come back to work in the office full-time were
allowed to come back on September 1st, 2011, 2 weeks after the announcement of the roll-out. Control group employees
who wanted to work at home started to do so gradually from the beginning of November 2011.

them subsequently discovered home working was not as attractive as they initially believed it would
be. In the bottom panel we find no significant evidence of differential sorting in the office-based
control group, suggesting less learning occurred in this group who did not get to experiment with
home-based working.

These results are similar to those of Lazear (2000) and Bandiera, Barankay and Rasul (2007) who
find the introduction of performance related pay improves performance both by motivating
individual employees to work harder, but also sorting higher ability employees into work. In our
case the selection effect is over the location of work, suggesting the impact of many management
practice changes may have these additional selection effects if they are introduced as voluntary.



                             IV. IMPACT ON THE EMPLOYEES

III.A. Employees’ self-reported outcomes
CTrip management was also interested in how employee self-reported wellbeing was affected by
the program. They thus ran two sets of surveys: a satisfaction survey and a work attitude survey.
Details of survey questions and methodology are listed in Appendix A3. In summary, these were
standard employee satisfaction tests developed by Berkeley psychologists Christina Maslach and
Susan Jackson in the 1970s. The satisfaction survey was conducted five times throughout the
experimental period: once in early November, before the randomization took place, and four times
after the experiment had started. The first three columns of Table 7 show three different satisfaction
measures. The treatment group reported no difference in satisfaction levels from the control group
at the first survey, but the treatment group reported statistically significantly higher satisfaction
once the experiment began.

The work attitude survey was conducted every week. The first weekly survey was conducted in late
November 2010, before the experiment began but after the randomization had occurred.
Interestingly, the treatment group already reported higher positive attitude (significant at the 10%
level), less negative attitude and less exhaustion from work. This group had yet to move home, so
this difference was presumably due to the control group’s learning they lost the working from home
lottery while the treatment group learned they had won. This highlights the importance of
comparing our treatment group with other control groups like Nan Tong and the eligible non-
experiment group. After starting the experiment, the gap between the treatment and control group
rose further, so that the treatment group reported statistically significantly higher positive attitude
and less work exhaustion.

IV.B. Attrition
One of the key initial reasons CTrip was interested in running the experiment was to lower their
rate of employee attrition. The turnover rate among CTrip call center representatives had
historically hovered around 50% per year, which was typical of the call center industry in China.19
Training a new worker cost about six weeks salary, and there were also costs of identifying,

19
  2010 Report on Chinese Call Center Operation and Management. Note that CTrip could in principle fire employees,
but this was rare and no employees in these two divisions were fired over this period (as far as we are aware).

                                                                                                              15
screening and hiring new employees. Figure 6 plots the cumulative attrition rate of treatment and
control group separately over the experimental period. Shortly after the commencement of the
experiment, cumulative attrition rates diverged between the two groups and the difference was
statistically significant. By the end of the experiment, the total attrition rate in the treatment group
(17%) was less than half of that in the control group (35%) during the 9 months period.20

We further tested whether selective attrition existed by running probit regressions in Table 8. The
dependent variable is whether an employee quit the job during the experimental period between
December 6, 2010 and August 15, 2011. Column (1) confirms the finding in Figure 6 that treatment
employees’ rate of attrition was about half that of the control group. In column (2), we tested
whether employees with worse performance were more likely to leave the firm from the treatment
group compared to the control group. To measure performance we used the average individual
weekly performance z-scores during the experimental period (from December 6th 2010 until August
15th 2011) or, for employees who quit, their performance until their last full week. We found that
low performers were significantly more likely to quit, particularly in the control group.

In columns (3) and (4), we estimated the impact of experimental period performance on quitting in
the treatment and control groups separately. We found a large and strongly significant impact in the
control group and smaller, but still weakly significant impact in the treatment group. Interviewing
the employees, we heard that control group employees who underperformed tended to quit for other
similar call center or office jobs, which were easy to find. Treatment employees, however, were
much less likely to quit because no other comparable home-working jobs existed, substantially
reducing selection from the treatment group.

This differential attrition, of course, also raises the question of whether our estimated impact of
WFH is biased. Specifically, the concern is that the estimated impact is mainly driven by
differential attrition. We note that this is unlikely, because in Table 7 we see that employees with
worse performance in the control group were more likely to quit. This suggests that the observed
control group performance level was larger than it would have been, hence generating a smaller
performance gap between treatment and control than if no attrition had occurred. In other words,
our estimated treatment effect is actually biased downwards.21

To address this issue more formally, we used the Lee (2008) bounds estimator. This provides upper
and lower bounds on the effect of differential selection on performance across groups, assuming
that attrition is monotonically driven by the performance variable. This allows us to generate two
bounds – the upper bound that assumes that the extra attrition in the control group is based on a
negative correlation between performance (as we saw in Table 7), while the lower bound assumes a
positive correlation (the reverse of what we see in Table 7, but included for completeness). These
bounds are shown in Appendix Figure A1. We see that the upper bound lies above the actual
treatment-control estimated impact, suggesting that the actual treatment effect on attrition is, if
anything, larger than we estimated, because the attrition of the worst performers from the control


20
   These figures are dependent on the market circumstance: the fact that no other call centers offered home-working in
Shanghai was likely to CTrip’s practice particularly effective in reducing attrition.
21
   Of course, to the extent that lower-performing employees quit, the firm is less concerned with their loss, although the
firm still would have rather kept them because of the substantial costs of recruitment and training.

                                                                                                                      16
group biases our results down. Hence, even our large estimated positive impact of WFH is likely to
be underestimated by attrition bias.

IV.C. Promotions and career concerns
One possible negative effect from working at home is that long-run career opportunities could be
damaged by less on-the-job training from team leaders and less “face-time” in the office. To
investigate this, we collected promotion data on the 249-employee experimental sample. We
defined promotion as either being promoted to team leader or being moved to a more advanced
function (i.e., switch to the quality-control team), which often occurred shortly before promotion to
team leader. Both would require a formal evaluation by team leaders and departmental managers.
During the period from the start of the experiment in December 2010 until the end of September
2012, a total of 17 employees from the treatment group received promotions or more advanced job
functions and 23 from the control group.

In Table 9 we show the results from running probit regressions on performance before the
experiment, performance during the experiment, as well as some demographic controls. We see in
column (1) that working from home has no overall impact on promotion. However, we see in
column (2) that once we controlled for their performance during the experimental period WFH had
a negative and weakly significant impact on promotion. It appears that WFH improved performance
– increasing the probability of promotion – but this was offset by a roughly equal negative effect
from being home based. In column (3) we add demographics and the story is very similar. Finally,
in column (4) we interact WFH with the performance measure and find a negative coefficient in
addition to a negative WFH levels effect.

One story that is consistent with this is that home-based employees are “out of sight, out of mind.”
As a result supervisors did not notice their performance as much and were less likely to promote
them. We heard anecdotal evidence for this from employees and managers during focus groups and
interviews, and it was one factor that led some employees to return to the office to avoid what they
perceived as a WFH promotion ‘discrimination’ penalty. Another possibility is that WFH
employees lack opportunities to develop the interpersonal skills to succeed in managerial jobs and
therefore are less likely to be promoted. Either way, it is clear that WFH comes with a promotion
penalty.



               V. PROFIT, PRODUCTIVITY AND FIRM LEARNING

One of the most interesting aspects of the experiment was the learning process for both the firm and
the individual employees on the costs and benefits of working from home. Both groups were
initially unsure about these, because no other Chinese call center had ever offered this option
before. However, we were able to monitor both management’s and employees’ learning over the
course of the experiment because of our extensive access to the CTrip’s management team and
frequent employee surveys and interviews. Before discussing this we first present the estimated
impacts on firm profits and productivity from allowing employees to work from home.



                                                                                                  17
V.A. Profit and productivity impact
The firm saw working from home as a way to save on office costs, but was worried that employees
would shirk at home or that call quality would decline due to multi-tasking on other activities which
are prohibited in the office, like playing computer games or watching TV. While managers had
previously been allowed to work from home on an ad hoc basis, no non-managerial level employees
had been allowed to home work. The research literature provided very little guidance on what might
happen, with what little evidence there was suggesting that typically routine jobs were, if anything,
less effectively carried at home.22

Running the experiment revealed, however, that working from home actually generated an
improvement in employee performance, worth about $375 per employee per year (evaluated at the
13% performance improvement from the Table 3). In addition, the firm estimated office cost
savings of about $1250 per employee and reduced turnover savings of about $400 per employee per
year. Hence, given the annual saving of about $2000 per employee, the firm rolled the program out
in August 2011, accompanied by an aggressive poster campaign to persuade employees to take up
the home working option.

A related question is what was the impact on total factor productivity (TFP)? We estimate TFP
would increase by about 30% from moving every employee home, using the methodology adopted
on US Census data in, for example, papers like Foster, Haltiwanger and Syverson (2008) and
Syverson (2011).

This 30% rise in measured TFP comes from three sources. First, output (as measured by the number
phone calls) increased 13% from working from home. While 9.5% of this increase comes from
employees’ working more hours, this increase in attendance would not be identified in US Census
survey data, since the Census collects information on shift-hours (i.e. 40 hours per week), not actual
hours worked. Second, the reduction in attrition from 50% to 25% would reduce steady-state labor
hours lost to training by 3%, since new employees need 6 weeks of training.23 Finally, the capital
per employee is comprised of about $5k of desktop IT equipment, $10k of central IT equipment
(servers and the network) and $24k of office space (total office capital divided by the total number
of employees). Moving employees home for 4 days a week reduces the office space required by
80%,24 although it increases the desktop IT requirement by 20% (equipment lies idle at home for 1
day a week). On aggregate this reduces capital by 48%. Assuming a production function coefficient
of 1/3 on capital and 2/3 on labor, this yields an estimated TFP increase of 30%. Given that the
cross-sectional standard-deviation of TFP reported in Foster, Haltiwanger and Syversson (2008) is


22
   For example, Dutcher (2012) ran lab experiments on routine and non-routine tasks with and without remote
monitoring, and found the more routine ones were negatively affected by mimicking a home-based environment. He
conjectured that the lack of peer and manager effects, which that have been shown to be important in low-level tasks in
field environments by Falk and Ichino (2006), Bandiera, Barankay and Rasul (2005) and Mas and Moretti (2009), could
explain this.
23
   Training costs 6 weeks of employee time, which given a 50% rate of employee turnover, has to be amortized over 2
years, meaning in steady state about 6% of employee output is lost from training. Hence, reducing attrition by 50%
reduces training time by 3%. This ignores the labor savings from a smaller central recruitment team, as it only focuses
on the lost output from training.
24
   Note that since employees hot-desk (share desks), and because teams come in on different days of the week, the firm
can reduce the numbers of desks in line with the reduction in the number of days spent working in the office.

                                                                                                                    18
26%, this highlights how differences in the adoption of WFH across firms could potentially account
for quite large differences in measured productivity.

V.B. Firm learning
The firm learned four important results from running the formal experiment versus the non-
randomized pilot that they had initially been considering. First, they learned that WFH improves
performance. Without running a formal experiment, their view was that they could have interpreted
the drop in treatment performance shown in Figure 3 as a negative treatment effect. The period of
the experiment (December 2010 to August 2011) coincided with a business slow-down for CTrip
due to a combination of the (predicted) end of Shanghai Expo 2010 and an (unpredicted) increase in
competition from other travel agencies. As a result, the difference in performance for the treatment
group relative to their pre-experiment baseline was negative, and is only positive when evaluated as
a difference of differences against the control group. This highlights the importance of having a well
matched (ideally randomized) control group to strip out these kinds of seasonal and demand effects.

Second, ex ante there was very little discussion of selection effects on employee performance, but
by running the experiment and then rolling it out it became clear that allowing employee choice
generated a far greater effect than requiring working from home. The impact of working from home
was positive, on average, but appears to have a large variance, so that employee choice led to a
much higher effect, as shown in Figure 5.

Third, having the large sample of treatment and control employees allowed the firm to evaluate the
impact on different types of employees. Somewhat surprisingly, they found a very homogeneous
impact across all types of employees. For example, in Figure 7, we plot the impact on the top half
of the treatment versus control distribution and the bottom half of the treatment vs control
distribution. To calculate this, both groups were split in half by the pre-experiment median
performance and then compared. What we see is a similar improvement in performance for both
groups. CTrip’s ex ante expectation was that the bottom half of employees were the less motivated
ones, and they would perform far worse at home. Table A5 shows a similar result, that the impact
of WFH was homogeneous across a range of other characteristics, including gender, commute time,
age, prior experience and living arrangements. In other words, in the current context observed
characteristics are not good predictors of who will benefit more from work from home. These
results have led CTrip to offer WFH to all employee groups rather than any selected sub-samples
(such as high-performers), which they initially intended to target.

Finally, management were surprised by the dramatic drop in attrition that highlighted how many of
their employees valued working-from-home. They anticipated a reduction, but nothing like the 50%
drop they observed.

V.C. Employees’ learning
One direct measure of the extent of employee learning is the number of employees who changed
their minds about working from home. Figure 2 shows that after the experiment about 50% of the
initial treatment and control volunteers changed their minds and decided to work in the office after
the end of the experiment, while 10% of the initial non-volunteer group opted to work from home.




                                                                                                   19
We also designed a survey to inquire into employees’ evolving views toward the Program from
across all 994 airfare and hotel department employees. We administered the same survey with the
help of the CTrip management in November 2010 and August 2011. Employees were asked
specifically whether they were interested in participating in the Work-at-Home Program if they
were eligible. They could choose from three answers: “yes”, “no” or “undecided”. We find of the
568 employees that took part in both surveys, that only 303 (53%) maintained their views, while the
remaining 47% changed their minds. Of those, 24% went from “yes” or “undecided” to “no”, while
12% went from “no” or “undecided” to “yes”, with the remainder switching from “yes” or “no” into
“undecided”.

In follow-up interviews, most of the interviewed employees who had decided they no longer
wanted to work from home cited social reasons. Another group who had thought working from
home would be attractive found that it was troublesome for the people with whom they lived (often
parents), especially if they were called to work outside normal business hours. In reverse, a number
of employees switched to working from home because they saw the success of their peers who
worked from home..

V.D. Why did the firm not introduce working from home before?
Finally, one question that arises is why CTrip (or any other similar firm) did not introduce working
from home earlier, given it was highly profitable? From extensive discussion with the senior
management team there seemed to be two reasons.

First, there was the classic free-rider problem that arises with all forms of process innovation where
the absence of intellectual property makes it hard to prevent imitation. CTrip believed that the
private benefits of home-based working would be short-lived (if it was successful), as rivals would
copy the scheme and use it to drive down commission margins in the travel agent market, while the
costs of experimentation would be borne entirely by CTrip. Hence, they viewed themselves as
paying the full cost of experimentation but only capturing part of the benefits because of imitation
based on knowledge spillovers.

Second, within CTrip the senior management had incentives that provided limited upside and
extensive downside from the experimental outcomes. Senior managers were primarily motivated by
career concerns, with limited bonus or equity compensation. As a result, their incentives to
experiment were muted – they gained little from a successful experiment, but risked major career
damage if the experiment was unsuccessful. James Liang, the Chairman and co-founder, had more
balanced incentives to promote the experiment since he owned extensive CTrip equity and had no
firm-level career concerns. He played a major role in persuading the CTrip executives to run the
experiment.

Both factors – the threat of imitation and risk-aversion from the career concerns of senior managers
– are likely to represent forces deterring process innovations in most large firms. This suggests
these could lead to under-experimentation in managerial and operational practices.




                                                                                                   20
                                      VI. CONCLUSIONS

The frequency of working from home has been rising rapidly in the U.S. and Europe, but there is
uncertainty and skepticism over the effectiveness of this, highlighted by phrases like “shirking from
home”. We report the results of the first randomized experiment on working from home, run in a
16,000 employee, NASDAQ-listed Chinese firm, CTrip. Employees who volunteered to work from
home were randomized by even/odd birth-date into a treatment group who worked from home four
days a week for nine months and a control group who were in the office all five days of the work
week. We found a highly significant 13% increase in performance from home-working, of which
9% was from working more minutes of their shift period (fewer breaks and sick days) and 4% from
higher performance per minute. We found no negative spillovers onto workers who stayed in the
office. Home workers also reported substantially higher work satisfaction and psychological
attitude scores, and their job attrition rates fell by over 50%. Further, when the experiment ended
and workers were allowed to choose whether to work at home or in the office, selection effects
almost doubled the gains in performance.

This experiment highlights how complex the process of learning about new management practices
is. For CTrip, having no precedent in terms of similar Chinese firms that had adopted working from
home for their employees led them to run this extensive field experiment. Given their success, other
firms are now likely to copy this practice, generating the type of gradual adoption of a new
management practices that Griliches (1957) highlighted. More generally, given the large impact of
this practice on employee performance – a $2000 per employee reduction in costs and a 30%
increase in TFP – this also provides a management-practice based explanation for heterogeneous
firm performance.

While our results suggest a promising future for working from home, we should note that several
distinctive factors at CTrip contributed to the success of the experiment and the implementation of
the practice. First, the job of a call center employee is particularly suitable for telecommuting. It
requires neither teamwork nor in-person face time. Quantity and quality of performance can be
easily quantified and evaluated. The link between effort and performance is direct. These conditions
apply to a range of service jobs such as sales, IT support, and secretarial assistance, but they are far
from universal. Second, the firm can closely monitor the performance and labor supply of the
employees thanks to its extensive centralized database. Team leaders managers could generate a
report from the database of the performance of the team members daily and easily detect problems
in individual employees’ performance. Third, the extent of WFH was limited, so that it did not
require a significant reorganization at the workplace. Because the participation rate ranged between
15% and 25%, team leaders continued to supervise their teams with a mix of home and office
workers without any major reshuffling of team membership.

While these features arguably favored successful implementation of working from home at CTrip,
we believe the practice of working from home is worth further exploration. After all, much of the
research for this paper and its writing were done by the authors working from home.

Appendix A3: Explanations of the Work Satisfaction Survey
Work Exhaustion: CTrip’s in-house psychology counselors used an adapted excerpt from the Maslach
Burnout Inventory (MBI) Survey to measure the emotional exhaustion of the employees from work. The
MBI survey was developed by Berkeley psychologist Christina Maslach and Susan Jackson in the 1970s (see
Maslach and Jackson, 1981). Each employee was asked to evaluate his or her “emotional exhaustion” at the
end of the work week. The survey contained 6 questions. Each employee was asked to report how often he or
she felt the way described at work during the week: feel this way every day, almost all the time, most of the
time, half of the time, a few times, rarely, never. The survey questions are listed below:
    1. I feel emotionally drained from my work.
    2. I feel used up at the end of the work day.
    3. I dread getting up in the morning and having to face another day on the job.
    4. I feel burned out from my work.
    5. I feel frustrated by my job.
    6. I feel I am working too hard on my job.
Positive and Negative Attitudes: CTrip’s in-house psychology counselors used an adapted 16-item Positive
and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) developed by Clark and Tellegen (1988) to measure the positive
and negative attitudes of the employees.

The survey comprised two mood scales, one measuring positive affect and the other measuring negative
affect. Each item was rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 = very slightly or not at all to 5 = extremely to
indicate the extent to which the employee felt this way the day he took the survey. To evaluate the positive
affect, psychologists summed the odd items. In cases with internally missing data (items not answered), the
sums were computed after imputation of the missing values: # items on scale / # actually answered,
multiplied by the sum obtained from the answered items. A higher score indicates more positive affect, or
the extent to which the individual feels enthusiastic, active, and alert. The negative affect is evaluated
similarly by summing up the even items. The 16 items were (1) Cheerful, (2) Jittery, (3) Happy, (4)
Ashamed, (5) Excited, (6) Nervous, (7) Enthusiastic, (8) Hostile, (9) Content, (10) Guilty, (11) Relaxed, (12)
Angry, (13) Proud, (14) Dejected, (15) Active and (16) Sad.

Notes: The performance z-scores are constructed by taking the average of normalized performance measures (normalizing each individual measure to a mean of zero and standard
deviation of 1 across the sample). The sample includes data from January 1, 2010 to August 15, 2011. “Young” equal 1 if an employee is under 24. “Short prior experience” equals
1 if an employee with less than 6 months of experience before joining CTrip. “Short tenure” equals 1 if an employee has worked in CTrip for less than 24 month by December 2010.
“Pre-exper. performance” is the average z-score of performance between Jan 1, 2010 and Oct 1, 2010 for each employee. Individual clustered standard errors. *** denotes 1%
significance, ** 5% significance and * 10% significance.

Notes: The regressions are all probits at the individual level of the decision to work from home. Marginal effects calculated at the mean are reported. The total
sample covers all CTrip employees in their Shanghai airfare and hotel departments. Willingness to participate was based on the initial survey in November 2010.
Employees were not told the eligibility rules in advance of the survey (own room, 6+ months tenure, broadband internet connect). Gross wage is calculated as a
monthly average of salary from Jan 2010 to Sep 2010 (note that 1 Yuan is about 0.15 Dollars). Robust standard-errors are reported.
+
  denotes the coefficients and standard errors have both been multiplied by 100 for scaling purposes.

Notes: The regressions are run at the individual by week level, with a full set of individual and week fixed effects. Experiment*treatment is the interaction of the
period of the experimentation (December 6th 2010 until August 15th 2011) by an individual having an even birthdate (2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th etc day of the month). The pre
period refers to January 1st 2010 until December 5th 2010. Pre-experiment and during the experiment period started on Jan 1st, 2010 and ended on August 15th,
2011. During the experiment period started on December 6th, 2010 and ended on August 15th, 2011. Overall performance is the z-score for each employee on their
main task. The z-scores are constructed by taking the average of normalized performance measures (normalizing each individual measure to a mean of zero and
standard deviation of 1 across the sample). Since all employees have z-scores but not all employees have phonecall counts (because for example they do order
booking) the z-scores for overall performance covers a wider group of employees than for phonecall. Minutes on the phone is recorded from the call logs. Three
employees have been excluded because they lack pre-experimental data. Standard errors are clustered at the individual level. *** denotes 1% significance, ** 5%
significance and * 10% significance.

Notes: Nan-Tong is CTrip’s other large call center, located in Nan-Tong, a city about 1 hour drive outside of Shanghai. This call center also had airfare and hotel
departments, and calls were allocated across the Shanghai and Nan Tong call centers randomly. The “Eligible non-experimental group” are the individuals that
were eligible for the experiment (own room, 6+ months of tenure and broadband) but did not volunteer to participate in the WFH experiment in the two
departments in Shanghai. The regressions are run at the individual by week level, with a full set of individual and week fixed effects. Experiment*treatment is the
interaction of the period of the experimentation (December 6th 2010 until August 15th 2011) by a Shanghai based individual having an even birthdate (2nd, 4th,
6th, 8th etc day of the month), while Experiment*control is the interaction of the period of the experimentation by a Shanghai based individual having an odd
birthdate. All performance measures are z-scores (constructed by taking the average of normalized performance measures, where these are normalizing each
individual measure to a mean of zero and standard deviation of 1 across the sample). Standard errors are clustered at the individual level. *** denotes 1%
significance, ** 5% significance and * 10% significance.

Notes: The regressions are all probits at the individual level. Marginal effects calculated at the mean are reported. Pre-experiment performance is the average of
individual weekly performance z-score during the pre-experimental period from January 1st 2010 to December 5th 2010. During experiment performance is the
average of individual weekly performance z-score during the post-experimental period from December 6th 2010 to August 15th 2011. Sample for returning to the
office includes the 110 treatment workers still at CTrip at the end of the experiment in September 2011; 27 petitioned to come back to the office, yielding a 24.5%
return rate. The sample for moving home includes the 74 control group employees still in the experiment by September 1st, 2011. Out of 74 control workers, 27
petitioned to work at home, yielding a 36.5% join rate. Robust standard errors: *** denotes 1% significance, ** 5% significance and * 10% significance.

Notes: The satisfaction survey used in columns (1) to (3) was conducted five times throughout the experimental period: once in early November before the
randomization took place and four times after the experiment had started. Treatment defined as having an even birthdate. See details of survey questions and
methodology in Appendix A3. The emotion survey used in columns (4) to (6) was conducted every week. The first week was conducted in late November 2010,
before the experiment began but after the randomization so that individuals had been informed of their status in the treatment or control groups. All the
dependent variables are logged values. The regressions are run at the individual level with a full set of time-dummies. Experiment*treatment is the interaction of
the treatment group with the period of the experimentation. Announcement*treatment is the interaction with the treatment group with the period of post-
announcement but pre-experiment. Standard errors are clustered at the individual level. *** denotes 1% significance, ** 5% significance and * 10% significance.

Notes: The regressions are all probits at the individual level. Marginal effects calculated at the mean are reported. The dependent variable is whether the employee
quit over the experimental period between December 6th 2010 and August 15th 2011. During this period, control group has an attrition rate of 35.0%, compared to
17.0% in the treatment group. Treatment defined as having an even birthdate. Performance is the average of individual weekly performance z-score during the
post-experimental period from December 6th 2010 to August 15th, 2011 (or the week before they quit in the case of quitters). Performance*treatment is the
interaction of the performance measure by an individual having an even birthdate. Cost of commute is measured at daily level in Chinese Yuan (note that 1 Yuan
is about 0.15 Dollars). Standard errors are clustered at the individual level. *** denotes 1% significance, ** 5% significance and * 10% significance.

Notes: All regressions are with the dependent variable being whether promoted to team leader or more advanced job function during a 22-month period between
Dec 6th, 2010 and Sep 30th, 2012. During this period, a total of 40 employees were promoted, resulting in a 15.9% promotion rate. Performance during the
experiment is the average of individual weekly performance z-score during the post-experimental period from December 6th 2010 to August 15th, 2011. For
probits, marginal effects evaluated at the mean are reported. Performance*treatment is the interaction of the performance measure by an individual having an
even birthdate (2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th etc day of the month). Robust standard errors. *** denotes 1% significance, ** 5% significance and * 10% significance.

  Note: PUMS census data for 2010. We classify workers as mainly working from home if they answer “work from home” to the census question “How did you get
  to work last week?” All employees are divided into 10 deciles by wage. Share of workers working at home is then calculated within each wage decile.

Note: Data from January 4th 2010 until June 1st 2012. Percentage of workers working at home = (number of workers working at home / number of workers still
employed) calculated separately for treatment (even-numbered birthdays), control (odd-numbered birthdays) and non-volunteer workers (those did not volunteer
to work from home). First red line indicates the beginning of the experiment on December 6, 2010 and the second red line indicates the end of the experiment on
August 15, 2011, after which the option to work from home was available to all employees. There is about a two week transition lag in returning to the office.
There is also some WFH before the start of the experiment due to the installation period (the IT department had to set up computer terminals in every
employee’s home). The sample is all employees in airfare and hotel departments in Ctrip’s Shanghai headquarters who were employed on December 6, 2010.

Note: Data from January 4th 2010 until October 1st 2012. Phone calls in z-scores (normalized so the pre-experiment values are mean zero and standard
deviation 1) shown as the difference between home and office workers. The drop in performance before the start of the experiment is due to the disruption
from the transition from office based to home based working for the treatment group. The dip at the end is similarly the disruption for home based employees
that are moving back to the office (who until they are fully office based are coded as home workers).

Note: Cumulative attrition rate equals number of employees attrited by week x of the experiment divided by total number of employees at the beginning of the
experiment, calculated separately by treatment and control group. Dashed lines represent 95% point-wise confidence intervals calculated by bootstrap.
Experiment started on week1 and ended on week 38.

Note: Data from January 4th 2010 until August 15th 2011. Phone calls in z-scores (normalized so the pre-experiment values are mean zero and standard
deviation 1). Calculated separately for the difference between the top half of the treatment and control groups and the bottom-half of the treatment and
control groups, where performance halves are based on pre-experiment performance.

Note: Data from January 4th 2010 until August 15th 2011. Performance in z-scores (normalized so the pre-experiment values are mean zero and standard
deviation 1; performance measures used depend on the type of employees). Upper bound is calculated assuming the worst performers of the treatment
group would quit to create a equal attrition rate between treatment and control each week. Lower bound is calculated assuming the best performers for the
treatment group would quit to create an equal attrition rate between treatment and control. Approach follows Lee (2008).
