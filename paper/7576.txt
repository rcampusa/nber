                                           ABSTRACT

        This paper explores the links between two phenomena of the past two decades: striking

increase in the inequality of pre-tax incomes, and the failure of tax-and-transfer progressivity to

increase. We emphasize the causal links going from inequality to progressivity, noting that optimal

taxation theory predicts that growing inequality should increase progressivity. We discuss public

choice alternatives to the optimal progressivity framework. The paper also addresses the opposite

causal direction: that it is changes in taxation that have caused an apparent increase in inequality.

Finally, we discuss the “non-event-study” offered by the large changes in the distribution of income--

with no major tax changes-- since 1995, and discuss its implications for the link between

progressivity and inequality.

1.       Introduction

         Over at least the past two decades the average real income of the bottom four

deciles has stagnated, while the real income of those at the top of the income distribution

has grown sharply. Income inequality has sharply increased.

         During the same period, the progressivity of the tax-and-transfer system has not

increased, and has arguably declined. In the decade of the 1980’s the progressivity of the

federal tax system first declined, and then increased, so that in 1990 it was not

substantially different from what it was in 1980.1 Arguably, the top rate increases of

1990 and 1993 increased progressivity, but the expansion of capital gains tax preferences

in 1997 and, possibly after, offset the higher top rates. The generosity of transfers to the

poor has declined, too.

         This paper explores the links between these two phenomena. We emphasize the

causal link going from inequality to progressivity, noting that optimal taxation theory

predicts the opposite of what has occurred -- that growing inequality should increase

  The Congressional Budget Office has calculated a consistent series of tax distribution for about two
decades. This series uses a definition of income somewhat broader than adjusted gross income, includes all
federal taxes, and assumes that the burden of the corporate income tax falls on capital income generally.
Under these assumptions, the average tax rate on the top 1 percent of income earners fell from 34.9 percent
to 26.2 percent between 1980 and 1985, rose to 36.5 percent by 1995, and then fell slightly to 34.4. percent
by 1999. Average tax rates were changed very little between 1980 and 1999 for most of the rest of the
income distribution. The average rate on the second lowest quintile fell slightly from 15.0 percent to 13.7
percent between 1980 and 1999. In the middle quintile, the average rate edged down from 19.1 percent to
18.9 percent. In the second highest quintile, the average rate was 22.2 percent in both 1980 and 1999. The
rate for the top quintile went from 28.2 percent to 29.1 percent. The bottom quintile did experience a
substantial decline in average federal tax rates, from 7.7 percent to 4.6 percent, largely due to an increased
personal exemption and standard deduction after 1986, and expansion of the earned income tax credit.
However, this does not take into account reductions in transfers such as food stamps and welfare payments.
The combined tax and transfer system is thus probably not much different in its progressivity in 1999 than
it was in 1980. Source: Kasten, Sammartino, and Toder (1994), and Congressional Budget Office (1998c).

progressivity. We discuss public choice alternatives to the optimal progressivity

framework. The paper also addresses the opposite causal direction -- that it is changes in

taxation that have caused the (apparent) increase in inequality -- and also the possibility

that the two phenomena are causally unrelated, but caused by a common set of exogenous

factors.

           In Section 6, we make two empirical contributions to this debate. First, we argue

that standard measures of income distribution ignore the implications of the large recent

run-up in stock prices, and attempt a crude calculation of what this impact might be. We

calculate the distribution of income taking account of the stock market runup, and

compare it to more standard measures that ignore it. In addition, the effective tax rate on

these gains is arguably quite low, reducing the progressivity of the tax system much

below what standard measures suggest. Finally, we investigate the “non-event study”

offered by the large changes in the distribution of income beginning in 1996, and discuss

its implications for the issues addressed by this paper.



2.         Should Increased Inequality Reduce Tax Progressivity?

2.1        Optimal Progressivity Theory


           The modern theory of optimal progressivity accepts, for the sake of argument, the

right of government to redistribute income through the tax system (and other means),

sidesteps the ethical arguments about the value of a more equal distribution of economic

outcomes, and instead investigates the implications of various value judgments and

parameters of the economic system for the design of the tax system. Front and center

comes the fact that greater redistribution of income requires higher marginal tax rates,

which may provide disincentives to work, save, take risks, and invest in human and
                                                                                               2
physical capital. The essential problem, then, is to describe the inherent tradeoffs

between the distribution of income and economic performance.

         Mirrlees (1971) initiated the modern literature formalizing this tradeoff. In his

formulation, the government must choose an income tax schedule to raise a given amount

of total revenue, with the goal of maximizing a utilitarian social welfare function. This

function implicitly trades off the welfare of individuals at different income levels, but

assumes that social welfare increases when any member of society (including the richest)

is better off, holding others’ welfare constant. It therefore precludes envy as the basis of

tax policy.2 Mirrlees first investigated what characterizes the optimal income tax3 for any

set of assumptions about the social welfare function, the distribution of endowments, and

the behavioral response (utility) functions. He concluded that in this general case only

very weak conditions characterize the optimal tax structure, conditions that offer little

concrete guidance in the construction of a tax schedule.

         In the absence of general results, the approach has been to make specific

assumptions about the key elements of the model, and then to calculate the parameters of

the optimal income tax system. This approach is meant to suggest the characteristics of

the optimal income tax under reasonable assumptions and to investigate how these

characteristics depend on the elements of the model. Mirrlees also pioneered this

approach in his 1971 article, and concluded that the optimal tax structure is

approximately linear (that is, it has a constant marginal tax rate and an exemption level

below which tax liability is negative) and has marginal tax rates which were quite low by

then current standards, usually between 20 and 30 percent and almost always less than 40


2
 Feldstein (1976) offers an excellent review of these issues.

 Because a tax schedule may feature rebates rather than taxes at some levels of income, it is really the
optimal tax-and-transfer system that is at issue in the optimal progressivity literature.
                                                                                                           3
percent.4 This was a stunning and unexpected result even, it seems, to Mirrlees himself,

and especially in an era where top rates of 70 percent or more were the norm.

         Subsequent work investigated the sensitivity of the optimal income tax to the

parametric assumptions. Of particular interest to the topic at hand, Mirrlees presented an

example in which widening the distribution of skills, assumed equal to wage rates,

increased the optimal marginal tax rates, though he considered the dispersion of skills

necessary to imply much higher rates to be unrealistic. In his baseline numerical

simulation he set the value of σ (the standard deviation of the associated normal

distribution) in the assumed logarithmal distribution of skills to be equal to 0.39, derived

from Lydall’s (1968) figures for the distribution of income from employment for various

countries. When Mirrlees repeats the simulation with σ=1.0, a much wider dispersion of

ability, he reports (p. 207) that the optimal tax schedule

         is in almost all respects very different. Tax rates are very high: a large
         proportion of the population is allowed to abstain from productive labour.
         The results seem to say that, in an economy with more intrinsic inequality
         in economic skill, the income tax is a more important weapon of public
         control than it is in an economy where the dispersion of innate skills is less.
         The reason is, presumably, that the labour-discouraging effects of the tax
         are more important, relative to the redistributive benefits, in the latter case.

Stern (1976), examining only flat-rate tax systems, corroborates Mirrlees finding. For his

base case featuring an elasticity of substitution between goods and leisure of 0.4, when

σ=0.39, the optimal marginal tax rate is 0.225, but it rises to 0.623 when σ=1. Cooter

and Helpman (1974) perform a variety of numerical simulations, and find that for all of




4
 Note that, although the marginal tax rate is approximately constant, the average tax rate (tax liability
divided by income) increases with income due to the presence of the positive exemption level. Mirrlees
assumed that the government needed to raise 20% of national income in taxes.
                                                                                                            4
them the optimal marginal tax rate increased as the constant-mean ability distribution

spreads out.5

         The dispersion of skills is not the only determining parameter. Atkinson (1973)

explored the effect of increasing the egalitarianism of the social welfare function. Even

in the extreme case of Rawls’ (1971) “maximin” social welfare function, where social

welfare is judged solely on the basis of how well off the worst-off class of people is, the

model generated optimal tax rates not much higher than 50 percent. Stern (1976) argued

that Mirrlees' assumption about the degree of labor supply responsiveness was excessive,

and thereby overstated the costs of increasing tax progressivity. This is true because the

larger the responsiveness, the larger will be the social waste (in this case, people whose

labor productivity exceeds their valuation of leisure, but do not work) per dollar of

revenue raised. Stern showed that when what he considered to be a more reasonable

estimate of labor supply responsiveness is used (an elasticity of substitution of 0.4,

instead of 1.0), the value of the optimal tax rate exceeds 50%, approximately twice as

high as what Mirrlees found.

         In sum, simple models of optimal income taxation do not necessarily point to

sharply progressive tax structures, even if the objective function puts relatively large

weight on the welfare of less well-off individuals. This conclusion does, though, depend

critically on the sensitivity of labor supply to the after-tax wage rate and the subject of

this paper, the distribution of endowments.




5
  Helpman and Sadka (1978) claim that this result is not general, but offer only a trivial counter-example,
with a Rawlsian (maximim) social welfare function and a fixed lowest ability level of zero. They argue
that there should be counter-examples with more general social welfare functions, but admit they were
unable to identify such an example.
                                                                                                              5
       The last point suggests an apparent inconsistency between the theory of optimal

income taxation and actual U.S. income tax-and-transfer policy of the past two decades:

the degree of progressivity has hardly budged, may have decreased, and certainly has not

increased substantially in the face of apparently massive increases in the degree of pre-

tax income inequality. There are many, not mutually exclusive, ways to reconcile this

inconsistency. It could be that the optimal progressivity models are not rich enough to

give accurate predictions about appropriate tax-and-transfer policy. It could be that other

changes in the U.S. economy, either unrelated to the increasing inequality or structurally

related but distinct from it, can explain the policy response. Finally, it could be that the

political system produces outcomes in a way that is unrelated, or even opposite, from

what would be predicted by the artificial construct of constrained social welfare

maximization. In what follows we consider further each of these possible explanations of

the inconsistency between the theory and practice of income tax progressivity. We begin

by looking more closely at the models of optimal progressivity.



2.2    “Richer” Models of Optimal Tax Progressivity

       In the standard formulation of the optimal progressivity problem, the rich are

different from the poor in only one way: they are endowed with the ability to command a

higher market wage rate, which is presumed to reflect a higher real productivity of their

labor effort. In fact there is a variety of other reasons why some people end up affluent

and others do not, with vastly different policy implications.

       The rich may have been lucky. The influential study of Jencks et al (1972)

concluded that, in addition to on-the-job competence, economic success depended




                                                                                               6
primarily on luck,6 but that “those who are lucky tend, of course, to impute their success

to skill, while those who are inept believe that they are merely unlucky.”7 (p. 227)

         If there is income uncertainty which is uncorrelated across individuals and for

which private insurance markets do not exist, then taxation becomes a form of social

insurance; a more progressive system, by narrowing the dispersion in after-tax income,

provides more social insurance than a less progressive tax system. The optimally

progressive tax system then balances the gains from social insurance (and perhaps also

redistribution) against the incentive costs. Varian (1980) argued that, in the presence of

substantial uncertainty/luck, the optimal marginal tax rate should in all likelihood be

high, because high realized income is probably due to a good draw of the random

component of income, and taxing an event probably largely due to luck will have

minimal disincentive effects.

         The rich may have different tastes, either for goods compared to leisure (working

harder), or for future consumption. In the former case, even with homogenous wage

rates, some people will have higher incomes by virtue of working more, but the higher

income is offset by less leisure time. In this case a progressive tax system is not

necessarily redistributing from the better off to the worse off, but capriciously according

to tastes. Sandmo (1993) investigates the model with heterogeneous tastes, but offers no

unambiguous conclusions about optimal progressivity.

         The rich may have inherited more, either in terms of financial resources or in

terms of human capital. If inherited endowment is the principal source of inequality (so

that, inter alia, people do not differ in what they make of their endowments), from a one-


6
  The authors of this study admit, though, that their conclusions do not apply to the “very rich,” defined as
those with assets exceeding $10 million (of 1972 dollars).
7
  Thurow (1975) offers a similar view.
                                                                                                                7
generation perspective there is little potential economic cost from a tax system that

redistributes the fruits of this endowment. A longer horizon is required, however,

because the incentive of parents to leave an endowment would arguably be affected by

such taxation, and so could affect the incentive of potential bequeathors to work and to

save.

        The rich may have different skills than everyone else, rather than more of the

same kind of skills. This characterization certainly rings true, as the affluent tend to

supply “skilled” rather than “unskilled” labor, i.e., entrepreneurs, professionals, or

“symbolic analysts” in Reich’s (1991) terminology.

        Why does this matter for optimal progressivity? For one thing, as Feldstein

(1973) first investigated, when there are two distinct types of labor the relative wage rate

will depend on the relative supply to the market of the two kinds of labor, which in turn

depends on the tax system chosen. Thus, the tax system redistributes income directly

through differential tax liabilities, but also indirectly by altering the wage structure.

Although Feldstein argued that this did not substantially alter optimal progressivity, Allen

(1982) disagreed, arguing that it could be important enough that an increase in the

statutory progressivity of an income tax system could actually make members of the

lower-ability, lower-income group worse off, because it reduces their before-tax wage

rate.

        But what if the affluent offer to the economy a particularly essential ingredient?

Gilder (1990, p. 245) certainly thinks so, arguing that “a successful economy depends on

the proliferation of the rich, on creating a large class of risk-taking men [sic] who are

willing to shun the easy channels of a comfortable life in order to create new

enterprise…” If entrepreneurial talent is priced appropriately by the market, then the

                                                                                               8
standard optimal progressivity framework still applies: the extent that taxes discourage

its supply is a social cost. But there may be more to it than this if there are important

spillovers of information from entrepreneurial activity whose social value cannot be

captured by the entrepreneurs themselves. In economics jargon, there are positive

externalities of innovation. These kinds of externalities are the building blocks of many

“new growth” theories, propounded by Romer (1990) among others, who argue that

policy can have persistent effects on economic growth rates, not just on the level of

economic performance. Gilder appears to believe this, asserting that “most successful

entrepreneurs contribute far more to society than they ever recover, and most of them win

no riches at all” (p. 245).

       To the extent that the activities of the affluent have positive externalities because

of their entrepreneurial nature, this argues for lower taxation at the top than otherwise.

But the argument is not crystal clear. Although it is true that, compared to the overall

population, a larger fraction of the rich classify themselves as professional or managerial

(48.5% versus 27% in 1982, according to Slemrod, 1994), it is also true that a larger than

average fraction (12% versus 1%) are lawyers and accountants, professions that some

have argued are detrimental to economic growth, because they are concerned with rent-

seeking rather than income creation. Magee, Brock, and Young (1989) present evidence

that countries with more lawyers grow more slowly.



2.4    The Reason Behind Increased Inequality and Why it Matters for Optimal
       Progressivity

       This discussion suggests that the cause of the increased inequality matters in

determining the appropriate policy response. Alas, no one knows for sure why the

dispersion of pre-tax incomes has surged. Changing inheritance patterns or tastes are
                                                                                               9
unlikely to be important and, as we discuss in Section 4, the weight of the evidence

suggests that labor supply changes are not a major factor, either.

       That leaves a change in the relative return to skills and luck as the two relevant

factors to consider. The two are not necessarily mutually exclusive factors. After all, the

widening dispersion of the return to skills -- often summarized as the return to education

-- was not completely anticipated, and so to some extent the extraordinary recent earnings

of those endowed with the right skill type is just a good draw. If so, the taxation of these

earnings will have a relatively small efficiency effect. Of course, looking forward any

such tax will have an (inefficient) impact on skill acquisition decisions. In any event, a

progressive tax system does provide some degree of social insurance against uncertainty

in the distribution of the return to skill, whether caused by unpredictable technological

advances or developments in the global economy. We return to this issue in Section 5,

when we discuss the implications of globalization.



3.     Does Increased Inequality Reduce Progressivity? The Public Choice Perspective

       Up to this point we have addressed the appropriate, or optimal, degree of

progressivity, given a specified social objective function and a characterization of how

the economy works. In this section we put aside this normative question and focus on a

public choice question: given the political institutions and social choice mechanisms in

the U.S., does an increase in inequality trigger the kinds of policy changes that would

increase progressivity?

       According to the standard theory of optimal progressivity, a more disperse wage

distribution should increase the amount of redistribution because it increases the weight

placed on the equity gain from redistribution relative to the efficiency losses. This is also

                                                                                             10
the prediction of the "rational" (public choice) theory of the size of government proposed

by Meltzer and Richard (1981), in which increased inequality increases mean income

relative to the income of the decisive voter, and thus makes redistribution more attractive

to him or her. Persson and Tabellini (1994) and Alesina and Rodrik (1994) incorporate

versions of this result in constructing models of why greater pre-tax-and-transfer

inequality is bad for economic growth.

       Peltzman (1980), stimulated by his observation that in practice greater inequality

seemed to lead to less redistribution, constructed a model in which the total support for

redistribution increases if income differences among beneficiaries narrow. Because

inequality tends to increase both within-group and between-group inequality, its net

effect on redistribution is indeterminate. Kristov, Lindert, McClelland (1992) develop a

pressure-group model of individuals with "social affinity" (i.e., in which people care

more about the well-being of people like themselves), which predicts that progressive

redistribution is fostered by greater proximity and inter-mobility between the middle and

poorest income ranks, and reduced by greater proximity and inter-mobility between the

middle and top income ranks. They also suggest that economic growth affects the

political will to provide income support for the poorest: depressions awake sympathy for

persons with low income and reinforce the return that poverty arises because of bad luck.

Lindert (1996) explains this “Robin Hood paradox” as occurring because greater

inequality between lower and middle-income classes means less commonality of identity,

weakening the inclination of middle-class voters to redistribute toward lower-income

families.

       In sum, models of public choice do not speak with one voice as to how policy will

actually respond to an increased dispersion of earnings. Empirical investigation has not

                                                                                            11
yet succeeded in identifying which set of conceptual models best captures the key

features of the U.S. political system with regard to fiscal progressivity.



4.     Did Tax Changes Cause the Increased Inequality?

       Maybe it works the other way around. Maybe it is changes in the tax system

which have driven the increase in inequality. The reduced tax rates on high-income

families may have induced them to expend more effort, which increases measured

incomes (as opposed to income net of the value of foregone leisure). The reduced tax

rates may also have caused a whole host of other behavioral responses, ranging from

substitution away from tax-preferred activities such as charitable contributions,

investment in tax-exempt bonds, and receiving compensation as fringe benefits to less

investment in tax avoidance strategies, to less tax evasion. The labor supply response to

increased progressivity would show up as increased inequality of labor income, and all of

the responses would show up as increased inequality of taxable incomes.

       There is now a sizable empirical literature trying to measure the magnitude of

these responses. With some exceptions, the profession has settled on a value for the

compensated labor supply elasticity close to zero for prime-age males, although for

married women the responsiveness of labor force participation appears to be significant.

Overall, though, the compensated elasticity of labor appears to be fairly small. In models

with only a labor-leisure choice, this implies that the efficiency cost of income taxation is

bound to be low, as well.

       There is intriguing evidence that the response to taxes of total reported income

may not be small, at least for high-income families. Lindsey (1987) was one of the first

to point out that the 1981 top rate cut in the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, or

                                                                                           12
ERTA, from 70% to 50% coincided with a very large increase in the share of income

reported to the IRS by the top 1% of the income distribution. He argues that the tax cut

was a principal cause of this increase, as it reduced the penalty for receiving (or, to be

precise, reporting) taxable income, and estimates the elasticity of taxable income with

respect to the net-of-tax share to be between 1.6 and 1.8.

         Feenberg and Poterba (1993) use tax return data to calculate a time series of

inequality measures that focuses on high-income households. Using interpolations of

published SOI aggregated data, they calculate the share of adjusted gross income (AGI)

and several components of AGI that were received by the top 0.5% of households

arranged by income. After being approximately flat at about 6.0% from 1970 to 1981, it

begins in 1982 to increase continuously to 7.7% in 1985, then jumps sharply in 1986 to

9.2%. There is a slight increase in 1987 to 9.5%, then another sharp increase in 1988 to

12.1%.

         Feenberg and Poterba argue that this pattern is consistent with a behavioral

response to the reductions over this period in the tax rate on high-income families. They

also report that among the top income earners, the largest increase in share could be

attributed to the top one-fifth of one percent. This fact, they assert, “casts doubt on the

view that the factors responsible for the increase in reported incomes among high-income

taxpayers, especially in the 1986-1988 period, are the same factors that were responsible

for the widening of the wage distribution over a longer time period.” (p. 161) Rather,

they argue, “it reflect[s] other factors including a tax-induced change in the incentives

that high-income households face for reporting taxable income.” (p. 170).

         It is well known that there are serious problems with comparing cross-sectional

slices of income distributions, because it entails comparing different groups of

                                                                                              13
households across years. The potential hazards of inferring behavioral response from

comparing the behavior of two distinct groups of taxpayers can be mitigated by analyzing

longitudinal, or panel, data on an unchanging set of taxpayers. Thus, analysis of panel

data characterized the next wave of investigations of the taxable income elasticity.

       Feldstein (1995a) investigates the high-income response to the Tax Reform Act of

1986 (TRA86) using tax return panel data that follows the same set of taxpayers from

1979 to 1988. Feldstein analyzes married couples for whom both 1985 and 1988 tax

returns were available. He groups taxpayers by their 1985 marginal tax rate, calculates

group means for taxable income and the net-of-tax rate for each group, and then

calculates the percentage change in the mean between the years, using the difference in

the difference of these percentages to obtain elasticities. After making several

adjustments to the data, he concludes that the 1985-1988 percentage increase in various

measures of income (particularly taxable income excluding capital gains) was much

higher, compared with the rest of the population, for those high-income groups whose

marginal tax rate was reduced the most. Based on this finding, he estimates that the

elasticity of taxable income with respect to the net-of-tax rate is very high, between 1 and

3 in alternative specifications. To put this into perspective, an elasticity greater than

(1 − t )
         , where t is the tax rate, will produce a Laffer-type inverse revenue response; thus,
   t

the upper-end range of Feldstein’s estimates suggests the possibility that tax increases

would decrease revenue collected.

       Unfortunately, Feldstein’s data set contained only a very small number of high-

income observations; for example, the top income class on which Feldstein focuses most

of his attention (non-elderly couples in the 49 to 50 percent tax brackets in 1985) contains

only 57 observations. Because of the wide variation among this group in financial
                                                                                             14
situation and in income changes over time, generalizing from such a small sample is

problematic.

        Auten and Carroll (1998) make use of a much larger longitudinal data set,

consisting of 14,102 tax returns for the same set of taxpayers for 1985 and 1989. The

sample observations are stratified, so that high-income taxpayers are over-sampled,

resulting in 4,387 taxpayers in the 49% or 50% tax rate bracket in 1985. Rather than rely

on group means, they employ a multivariate regression approach, regressing the change

in AGI between 1985 and 1989 against the change in marginal tax rate and a set of

demographic variables. The regression approach allows them to control for occupation

as a proxy for demand-side, non-tax factors that affected the change in compensation

over this period. They conclude that changes in tax rates appear to be an important

determinant of the income growth of the late 1980’s, although the results are somewhat

sensitive to the choice of sample and weighting. Their central estimate of the net-of-tax

price elasticity is 0.6.

        Moffitt and Wilhelm (1998) also investigate behavioral response to TRA86, but

they make use of panel data from the 1983 and 1989 Survey of Consumer Finances.

Because of data limitations, they study an income concept closer to AGI than to taxable

income. They replicate the sizable tax elasticities for AGI found by Feldstein, and

conclude that the elasticities arise from the behavior of the extreme upper tail of the

income distribution.

        All of the studies discussed so far focused on the effect of ERTA or TRA86 on

taxpayer behavior. For reasons elaborated on below, study of tax changes which

increased tax rates would be especially helpful. Carroll (1998a) uses a panel of taxpayers

spanning the tax increases of the 1990 and 1993 Acts to consider to what extent taxpayers

                                                                                            15
change their reported incomes in response to changes in tax rates. The tax rate response

is identified by comparing the change of higher income taxpayers to those of moderate

income taxpayers in the face of the change in the relative taxation of these two groups,

controlling for many non-tax factors such as the taxpayer’s age, occupation, and industry.

Carroll concludes that the taxable income price elasticity is approximately 0.4, smaller

than the earlier studies of the tax reductions in the 1980’s, but nevertheless a response

that is positive and significantly different from zero.

       There are a number of methodological problems with measuring and interpreting

taxable income elasticities, which are discussed at length in Slemrod (1998a). A key

issue is the difficulty of controlling for underlying trends in income inequality that are

unrelated to the tax changes. In both ERTA and TRA86 the largest rate cuts applied to

the highest tax brackets, so that a positive taxable income elasticity implied larger

increases in reported taxable income among affluent Americans, and thus an increase in

the apparent inequality of income. One obvious methodological problem is to separate

out the influence of the tax changes from non-tax factors affecting the steadily increasing

dispersion of (taxable) income. A voluminous literature (much of it summarized in Levy

and Murnane (1992)) has documented an increase in inequality in the U.S.. Karoly

(1994) presents Census Bureau data showing that inequality among families, after

reaching a post-war low in 1967-68, began to increase during the 1970s and continued to

rise through the 1980s. Although the trend toward greater inequality began in the late

1960s, about two-thirds of the increase in the Gini coefficient between 1968 and 1989

occurred between 1980 and 1989. Although these basic facts are now widely

acknowledged, the origin of the increase in inequality remains highly controversial. The

two leading explanations, which are not mutually exclusive, are technological change that

                                                                                             16
increased the relative return to skilled labor, and increased globalization of the U.S.

economy, which increased the effective relative supply of unskilled labor and thereby

lowered its relative return.

       For the most part, what we know about this phenomenon comes from data sets

that are either top-coded or include few of the highest-income families, so that the

evidence is generally about the growing percentage differential in the earnings of people

at, say, the tenth percentile compared to the ninetieth percentile. However, tax return

data is neither top-coded and in fact oversamples high-income people, and it suggests a

similar trend since 1970. As discussed earlier, Feenberg and Poterba (1993) document

that the share of income reported by the top 0.5% of the population increased slowly but

steadily beginning in 1970, accelerated around 1980, and shot up in 1986. They contend

that this trend is consistent with the pattern of declining effective tax rates on affluent

Americans that began in 1970 and picked up steam with the rate cuts of 1981 and 1986.

Indeed, the top individual marginal tax rate has been monotonically declining since the

early 1960s, so there is an a priori case that tax changes are a factor in the growing

inequality.

       Slemrod (1996) attempts to separate out the tax and non-tax causes of inequality

by performing some time-series regression analyses of the Feenberg and Poterba high-

income shares for 1954 to 1990, with the data for the post-1986 years adjusted to

correspond to a pre-TRA86 definition. (This adjustment reduces the measured increase

in the shares after 1986, but the increase remains substantial.) Included as explanatory

variables are the contemporaneous, lagged, and leading tax rate measures, a measure of
                                   th        th
earning inequality between the 90 and 10 percentiles, and some macroeconomic

variables that might differentially influence incomes at different percentiles. Based on

                                                                                              17
the evidence up to 1985, the “demand-side,” earnings inequality variable is the dominant

explanation. However, the regression using data up to 1990 assigns almost all the

increase in the high-income share of AGI to be associated with the decline in the top tax

rate on wage income. These findings imply one of two things: (i) that in the mid-1980s

there was a break in the relationship between the non-tax factors affected the top 0.5% of

the population and the factors affecting earnings dispersion more generally, or (ii) that the

increase in the taxable income of the high-income families was primarily tax-driven. I

suspect that the second explanation applies, although Fullerton (1996) argues that,

because TRA86 involved extensive tax definition as well as rate changes, it is difficult to

confidently conclude that the change in rates was the critical factor.

        Another post-TRA86 empirical strategy was to pray for tax increases on the rich,

in the hope that whatever biases were creeping into estimates of the taxable income

elasticity based on the 1981 and 1986 tax cut experience would be offset in analyses of

tax increases. Of course, these prayers were answered in the tax increases of 1990 and

1993, and Carroll (1998a) has emphasized the possibility that his lower estimates of the

taxable income elasticity are at least partly due to this offsetting bias.

        Another empirical strategy used by both Auten and Carroll (1998) and Carroll

(1998a) is to include variables that measure the non-tax factors that might have

differentially affected income growth over the period spanning the tax change. Dummy

variables for Census regions are an uncontroversial example. More problematic is the

use of dummy variables for occupation. The idea is that a differing occupational mix

may explain why a given income group may have experienced a different percentage

change in taxable income. As Auten and Carroll discuss, this is a sensible strategy to the

extent that the dummy variables account for relative increases in labor productivity due to

                                                                                           18
technological advances or higher demand due to more global integration. However, to

the extent that they reflect differences in the flexibility to alter work schedules or

compensation arrangements in response to tax rate changes (i.e., different elasticities),

inclusion of these variables may bias downward the estimated elasticity. This problem

could be avoided by replacing the occupational dummies with independent estimates of

wage rate growth for the taxpayer’s occupational category; this would restrict the

explanatory power of occupation to demand-side factors.

       Goolsbee (1998) notes that the analyses of both the 1981 and 1986 tax cuts look

across samples where the stock market increased dramatically, corporate profits rose and

GDP growth increased, and that these factors are associated with relative increases in the

compensation of top executives, holding tax influences constant.

       In sum, there is now a considerable body of evidence which supports the notion

that the changes in the pattern of marginal tax rates did induce behavioral responses

which would make the distribution of reported taxable incomes more unequal. To the

extent that this is true, the increased inequality of taxable incomes overstates the growth

in inequality of welfare, because much of it is a substitution away from untaxed and

generally unmeasured welfare-producing activities by those who formerly had much

higher marginal tax rates. However, the extent of these induced behavioral responses

remains controversial. Especially in light of new developments discussed in Section 6.2,

it is highly unlikely that tax changes are responsible for all or most of the observed

increased inequality of income.




                                                                                              19
5. Changing Third Factors

         The correlation between changing inequality and progressivity might, of course,

be purely coincidental.8 That assertion is unproveable. A more interesting (and

falsifiable) possibility is that both trends are caused by the same third factor. An

intriguing candidate for this factor is the increasing globalization of national economies.

That globalization is an important cause of the increased inequality in the U.S. and other

industrialized countries is taken quite seriously, although it is highly controversial; we

have nothing to add to this debate. Instead, we are interested in its implications. Suppose

that globalization is at least partly responsible for the growth in inequality: can it also

explain the flight from progressivity?

         For this question, the prediction of optimal taxation models is fairly clear: absent

the ability of national or supernational governments to tax individuals on a worldwide

basis, openness increases the cost of government and of progressivity, because it

increases the elasticity of taxed activities. In particular, capital has more alternatives than

to locate within a country's own borders, people have more opportunities to purchase

goods outside their country of residence, and some firms and groups of people have

increasing flexibility about what their country of residence is. The higher the elasticity of

taxed activities, the greater is the social cost per dollar raised.

         If countries react to the increasing cost of government that globalization causes,

then the size of government and the extent of progressivity should be shrinking. Thus, in

principle, globalization could explain both the trend increase in inequality and the decline




8
 For example, the declining progressivity might simply be due to declining aversion to inequality, at least
as expressed through the political system.
                                                                                                          20
in progressivity. The problem is that this line of reasoning flies in the face of empirical

studies that claim that, across countries and across time within countries, greater

openness has led to larger, not smaller, governments. This relationship was first

discovered by Cameron (1978), who found that openness, measured as exports and

imports of goods and services as a percent of GDP in 1960, was the best single predictor

of the growth of public revenues relative to output from 1960 to 1970 for 18 OECD

nations. Rodrik (1997) has updated this finding, with a 100-plus country sample,

establishing a strong and robust association between an economy’s exposure to trade and

the size of its government in both cross-sectional and longitudinal settings.9 This had

been predicted by Myrdal (1960, p. 702), who argued that “all states have felt compelled

to undertake new radical intervention” in response to more chaotic economic relations

following openness, and Lindbeck (1995, p. 56), who observed that overt social insurance

and tax systems represent built-in stabilizers that maintain full employment in spite of the

uncertainties of demand inherent in an open economy.

         Thus, it may be that globalization increases both the cost and the benefits of (at

least some kinds of) government: both the supply and demand curves shift upwards.

Interpreting progressivity as one aspect of government, this implies that the change in

progressivity is indeterminate, but the price of progressivity certainly increases. Some of

this cost increase will occur because tax revenues are more difficult to raise in a world of

mobile tax bases, but some of it will be because citizens are more willing to tolerate a

costly social insurance in a world that is vulnerable to economic forces generating

uncertainty and inequality. The consequence for progressivity is thus not entirely clear.



9
 Although note that Lindert (1996) argues that openness fails to explain patterns of social spending for
OECD countries from 1960 to 1981.
                                                                                                           21
       The leading alternative to globalization as an explanation for growing inequality

is skill-biased technological change. What is its impact on taxation? On the tax

collection side, it has facilitated computer checks of tax returns against information

reports provided to the IRS by employers, banks, and other financial institutions,

lowering the cost of collecting revenue in an equitable way. On the other hand, the

growth of electronic commerce and diffusion of sophisticated financial instruments has

also undoubtedly facilitated certain kinds of tax avoidance. In principle, technological

change could be a third factor affecting both inequality and progressivity, but we are a

long way from having any quantitative understanding of this relationship.



6.     Two Recent Developments

       Two recent developments shed some fascinating new light on the growth in

inequality and its relationship to the tax system.



6.1    The Impact of the Stock Market Runup on Inequality and Progressivity

       Between January 1, 1995 and December 31, 1997, broad-based indices of the

stock market more than doubled. Accounting for this phenomenon certainly increases the

measured inequality of income, in particular the share of total income received by the top,

say, 1% of families ranked by income. Depending on the incidence assumptions one

makes, it can also sharply decrease the measured degree of tax progressivity.

       The impact of this extraordinary burst of accrued income is illustrated in Table 1,

which shows the results of three alternative methodologies for computing the distribution

of income. All three are based on the 1995 Survey of Consumer Finances, which

includes detailed income and wealth information for 4,299 households. The sample is

                                                                                           22
stratified, with a heavy over-sampling of high-income and high-wealth households. A

non-response-adjusted weight provided by the SCF is used to make the results nationally

representative.10

        Three different definitions of income are used to illustrate the distribution of

income in the U.S, each corresponding to an alternative assumption about the income

derived from the ownership of corporate equities. The first definition, what we call "self-

reported income," is the answer to: "how much was the total income you received in

1994 from all sources, before taxes and other deductions were made?" This is generally

equal to the sum of answers to questions about the various components of income, which

treat capital income on a nominal, realization basis. For instance, the survey asks about

capital gains from sales of assets such as stocks and real estate, but does not ask about

accrued capital gains on assets that were not sold during the year.

        We also construct two other income definitions to approximate an accrual-based

measure of income, under two different assumptions about the rate of return to corporate

equity. For each definition we replace reported realized nominal capital income (except

for closely-held business income) with imputed accrued capital income. The capital

income imputations are derived by applying uniform real rates of return to publicly-

traded corporate equities and non-business net worth. All other income items are

included as reported. These include wages and salaries; income from a closely-held

professional practice, business, or farm; pension income; social security income;

unemployment insurance benefits; public assistance such as AFDC, food stamps, and

SSI; and other miscellaneous forms of income such as gains from gambling. Reported


10
  In the case of missing or incomplete answers to certain questions, SCF imputes answers based on other
information in the survey. Several different "replicates" of the data are included in the SCF, each
representing a different set of imputations. We use the first replicate.
                                                                                                          23
dividends, realized capital gains, interest income, and rent, trust, royalty income are all

excluded from income, and replaced with imputed measures of capital income. No

attempt is made to replace reported income from closely-held businesses with an imputed

measure based on accrued capital income, because closely-held business income cannot

be reliably divided into returns to labor and capital in the data. The real rate of return to

non-business net worth is assumed to be 3 percent, which is the rate used by the Treasury

Department's Office of Tax Analysis for interest-bearing assets and debts in its

distributional tables (Cilke et al,1994, pp. 3-26).

       For our first alternative definition, the real rate of return to publicly-traded

corporate equities is assumed to be 6.4 percent, which is intended to approximate the rate

of return implied by corporate earnings in 1995. The 6.4% figure was calculated by

dividing the National Income and Product Accounts measure of corporate profits after

inventory valuation, capital consumption adjustment, and profits taxes for 1995, $371.8

billion (August 1998 Survey of Current Business Table 1.16), by total corporate equity

holdings in the 1995 SCF, $5.85 trillion. The $5.85 trillion denominator includes all C-

and S-corporation equity held either directly or through IRA, Keogh, or defined

contribution pension accounts. For the second alternative definition, we use a rate of

return to publicly-traded corporate equities of 28 percent. This is the annualized total real

rate of return on the S&P 500 index between December 1994 and December 1997, with

monthly reinvestment of dividends (Economic Report of the President, 1996, 1997, and

1998). The CPI-U is used to deflate the total S&P 500 return to a real rate of return. Our

measure of publicly-traded corporate equities includes both equities held directly, and




                                                                                              24
those held in IRA, Keogh, and defined-contribution pension accounts (such as 401(k)s).11

Table A-1 in the appendix shows the distribution of net worth and equity holdings, by the

alternative definitions of income.

         Table 1 shows the results of this exercise. Comparing the columns labeled "self-

reported income" with those labeled "income definition (1)" reveals that replacing

realized corporate-source income with a constant 6.4 percent accrual rate of return does

not materially affect the estimated distribution of income. Also shown for comparison

purposes is the income distribution under the Treasury Department's "family economic

income" concept, which follows a similar approach to our "income definition (1)," but

makes more detailed imputations using a variety data sources, including tax return data.

The distribution of income in the Treasury calculations is also quite similar to that found

in the SCF under either "self-reported" income or "income definition (1)." However, as

the columns labeled "income definition (2)" indicate, using the actual 1995-7 rate of

return to publicly-traded equities of 28 percent causes dramatic changes. Relative to

"income definition (1)", the share of income received by the top 1% of the weighted

sample goes from 14.3% to 17.8%, an increase of almost one-fourth; the share of the 95-

99th percentile group increases by about one-sixth, from 14.6% to 17.0%. Conversely,

when the actual accrual rate of return is imputed to be 28%, the share of the bottom


11
   For the retirement accounts, the SCF does not provide exact information on the share of the account held
in each type of asset, but does ask what combinations of assets are held in the accounts. Respondents who
reported investing their IRA and Keogh accounts “mostly in stocks or mutual funds” are assumed to keep
100% of their IRA or Keogh assets in corporate equities. Those who report investing their IRA or Keoghs
in a combination of stocks and bonds, a combination of stocks and interest-bearing accounts, or in a
brokerage or cash management account, are assumed to keep 50% of their IRA or Keogh assets in equities.
Those who report a combination of stocks, bonds, and interest-bearing accounts are assumed to keep 33%
of their IRA or Keogh assets in equities. For defined contribution accounts, respondents who report that
the account is “mostly or all stock” are assumed to have 100% of their defined contribution pension assets
in equities. Those who report keeping a “split between stock and interest earning assets” are assumed to
have 50% of their defined contribution assets in equities. Only very limited information on defined benefit
pension plans is available in the 1995 SCF, so these plans are excluded from all measures of net worth and
equity holdings.
                                                                                                         25
quintile falls from 2.7% to 2.2%, and that of the second lowest quintile declines from

7.9% to 6.7%.

        We do not mean to imply that the rate of accrued capital gain during this period is

likely to persist, making the more dispersed income distribution a steady state. But

neither should it be ignored, as it represents a very large amount of income that is, in

spite of the recent diffusion of stock ownership, highly skewed. Ranked by income

definition (2), households in the top percentile of the income distribution owned $1.5

million in publicly-traded corporate equities, on average, in 1995. At an annual real rate

of return of 28 percent, these households received an extra $1.2 million in income, on

average, over the course of three years due to the stock market boom.12

        Depending on what tax burden one attributes to the income accrued by

shareholders from 1995 to 1997, the runup also may have had a substantial impact on the

progressivity of the tax system. If one attributes to this income only an accrual-

equivalent capital gains tax, arguably only about 5% once one accounts for the benefit of

deferral and the carryover of basis at death, the effective progressivity is much lower than

official estimates would suggest.

        If, though, the stock market runup is due to an increased expected present value of

corporate earnings, then this would normally be accompanied by a concomitant increase

in corporate tax payments, so that the effective tax rate on this income is the average

corporate tax rate plus any additional tax due at the individual level on dividends and

capital gains. If one attributes this tax in proportion to either the owners of corporate

6.2        The "Taxpayer Didn't Notice" Act of 1995, and the 1996 and 1997 Surge in
           Inequality: A Non-Event Study

           Most of the recent evidence concerning how taxes affect taxpayer choices as

reflected in reported taxable income comes from analyses of the 1981, 1986, 1990, and

1993 tax changes. The first two lowered the top marginal tax rate, and the latter two

increased it. Because one of the most difficult empirical tasks is to separate out the effect

of the tax changes from non-tax-related trends in income inequality, the fact that the latter

two tax changes increased rather than decreased rates is helpful.

           It is also insightful to analyze trends in income inequality over periods when there

is no important tax change. One fascinating period began in 1996, immediately after the

passage of an exceptionally uneventful tax bill of 1995, which among things, did not

change the tax rate structure. This non-event was soon followed by some striking

developments.

           The first sign that something extraordinary was happening was the unexpected

surge in federal individual income tax revenues. Individual income tax receipts for fiscal

year 1997 turned out to be $61 billion, or about 9%, higher than the Congressional

Budget Office had estimated in January of 1997.13 About half of this increase was due to

capital gains realizations. Roughly $20 billion was due to an unexpectedly high level of

capital gains reported on returns for tax year 1996. Another $14 billion represented

unexpectedly high estimated tax payments for 1997, much of which also probably was

due to capital gains. Total capital gains realizations increased by 45% between 1995 and



13
     This episode is described in Congressional Budget Office (1998a).
                                                                                             27
       1996, and preliminary estimates suggested another 45% increase in 1997.

Although the higher 1997 estimated tax payments may have partly reflected a response to

the capital gains rate cut implemented on May 7, 1997, the 1996 realizations would have

been expected to be lower due to anticipation of the following year's rate cut. Another

factor was the increasing share of income reported by higher-income, and therefore

higher marginal tax rate, individuals. The CBO calculates that the effective income tax

rate (total income taxes paid divided by total adjusted gross income) increased from

13.7% to 14.0% from 1994 to 1995, and to 14.6% in 1996. Taxpayers with income of

$200,000 or more (in 1996 dollars) accounted for 17% of total AGI in 1996, up from

16% in 1995 and 14% in 1994. In a July, 1998 report, the CBO (1998b) discusses that

actual revenues for 1998 were also running higher than anticipated, but did not yet have

enough information to discuss what its sources were.

       In its January, 1998 report the CBO speculated that another component of the

surge of incomes at the top is bonuses and stock options. Rapid growth in both stock

prices and grants of employee stock options have caused the taxable value of exercised

options to increase dramatically. The CBO refers to data which suggest that the taxable

value of exercised options doubled in 1995, doubled again in 1996, and continued to

grow rapidly in 1997.

       Carroll (1998b) documents that the share of total income reported by taxpayers

with over $200,000 (in 1989 dollars) in total income jumped from 14.0% in 1995 to

16.0% in 1996. Even more strikingly, the share received by those with over $1 million

jumped from 5.1% to 6.4%, or by more than one quarter.

       Table 2 gives a seven-year perspective on the recent surge in incomes at the top.

In this table the income figures are based on a concept of modified adjusted income,

                                                                                           28
which excludes realized capital gains. It shows that the share of total income received by

those returns with over $200,00 (1991 dollars) of income increased from 11.47% to

14.32%, or over one-fourth, between 1994 and 1997. Even more striking, the share

received by those with income over $1 million increased from 3.37% to 4.92%, or nearly

50%! Some of this increase is certainly due to a larger number of returns in this category,

but certainly not all.

        The increase between 1994 and 1997 in the share of income received by high-

income taxpayers is of at least the same order of magnitude as the increase between 1985

and 1988 which convinced nearly all observers, including Slemrod (1996), that, because

this surge could not be explained by non-tax factors, the Tax Reform Act of 1986 must

have been a major influence. It is less convincing to ascribe such a role for the Taxpayer

Didn't Notice Act of 1995, or any tax change passed in 1994.

        The sources of income growth between 1995 and 1996 are explored in greater

detail in Table 3 (detailed data on 1997 is not yet publicly available). Here, taxpayers are

ranked by Adjusted Gross Income (AGI), which includes capital gains. In just one year,

the number of returns with incomes over $1 million increased by 27.5 percent, while AGI

going to millionaires increased by 38.1 percent. Although in this case, capital gains was

the fastest-growing source of income (71.2 percent) for this group, there was also

tremendous one-year growth in all other forms of income, such as a 29.9 percent increase

in wages and salaries. By contrast, there was only a 1.6 percent increase in the total

number of returns for people at all income levels, and a 5.1 percent increase in overall

AGI.

        Detail on higher slices of the income distribution is not yet available for the U.S.

for these years, but some fascinating information from state income tax returns is

                                                                                            29
obtainable. Table 4 comes from 1995 and 1996 New Jersey income tax returns. While

overall growth in New Jersey gross income was 7.6%, it was double-digit for all annual

income classes over $250,000, and was nearly 50% for those families fortunate enough to

have over $3 million in gross income! To be sure, much of the growth in the income of

the highest class can be traced to the fact that the number of tax returns increased by over

40%, from 689 to 987, but the increase in the size of this group itself is a remarkable

phenomenon.14

           The source of the large gains at the top of the income distribution is also of

interest. The total gross income increase of returns over $250,000 was $5.93 billion. Of

that, almost none was in the form of interest and dividends. A total of 46.0% was

employee compensation, 24.9% was capital gain, 9.5% was in partnership income, and

11.1% was in S corporation income.


7.         Conclusions

           "There's something happenin' here.
           What it is ain't exactly clear."

           Our analysis of Section 6 suggests an extraordinary increase in the income, both

realized and unrealized, of the already affluent beginning around 1996. What new light

does this development shed on the chicken-and-egg ruminations of the first part of this

essay?

           First of all, it casts some doubt on the hypothesis that the top tax rate cuts of 1981

and 1986 were the key factor in generating the increases in measured inequality of the



14
     The income groups are defined in nominal dollars, but there was little inflation in this period.
                                                                                                        30
last two decades. A decade passed between 1986 and 1996, with two top tax rate

increase episodes in between, so it is difficult to link the recent surge in incomes at the

top to tax policy. If the 1996 surge is not tax-related, it makes more plausible the case

that the surge of 1986, of a similarly large magnitude, was not primarily tax-driven.

       More importantly, the recent evidence suggests that the increase in inequality that

began in the 1980's has not abated. If anything, the rate of increase dramatically

accelerated in the mid-1990s. Standard models suggest that the appropriate response to

this development is an increase in the progressivity of the tax-and-transfer system.

Models of public choice suggest that this may not happen.

       In closing we note that during the preparation of this paper there were times in

1998 when we worried that our analysis of the stock market runup would seem

anachronistic, or even quaint, by the time of this conference. As of this writing (in early

January, 1999), this worry has proven unfounded. But the uncertainty in the economic

situation, and in particular the severe recessions in several Asian countries, remind us that

the demand for progressivity as social insurance has not abated, and may be increasing.

"Family economic income" is the income concept used by the Treasury Department in
its distributional tables. It is based on the Haig-Simons definition of income, and
imputes accrued capital income to tax return and Census data using a variety of data
sources.
"Self-reported income" is the response to the SCF question on income,
which counts income on a realization basis.
(1) Replaces reported capital income with a 6.4% real return to publicly-traded
corporate equities, and a 3% real return to net worth other than business equity,
but includes closely-held business income as reported.
(2) is the same as (1) but assumes a 28% real return to publicly-traded corporate
equities.
