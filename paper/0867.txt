                        "Some Unpleasant Monetarist Arithmetic"


                                      ABSTRACT


     Sargent and Wallace (S—W) show that, even when inflation is prima
fade a strictly monetary phenomenon —— prices are flexible, markets
clear and velocity is constant —— inflation is, in the long run, a
fiscal phenomenon. This follows from the government budget constraint
and the existence of an upper bound on the real per capita stock of
interest bearing public debt held by the private sector. Together
these ensure that in the long run the growth of the money stock is
governed by the fiscal deficit, if we assign to the fiscal authorities
the role of Stackelberg leaders and to the monetary authorities that of
Stackelberg followers.

     The discussion of the formal S—W model focuses on the distinct
roles of public spending and explicit taxes in their model and on the
possibility that optimal policy involves public sector surpluses and a
net credit position of the public sector vis—a—vis the private sector.
It is also argued that the specification of the demand for and supply of
money is ad hoc, a weakness shared by most existing macro models.

     Finally    it is shown that if we adjust the published government
deficit figures for the effect of inflation on the real value of the stock
of nominal government debt (as should be done to obtain a deficit measure
appropriate to the S—W model), the inflation—adjusted government deficit
has been in balance or surplus in the U.K. in recent years. If the
deficit is in addition adjusted for the cycle (as it should be to relate
it to the full employment S—W model), the government has been a
sizeable net lender. If we then also subtract net public sector
capital formation from total public spending (assuming implicitly that
the real rate of return on public sector investment equals the real
rate of return on public sector debt), we get the inflation—corrected,
cyclically adjusted government current account deficit. This is the
deficit measure of the S—W model. This "deficit" has been a sizeable
surplus in recent years and is likely to remain so in the future.
The inflation tax implied by extrapolation of the past and present
stance of fiscal policy is therefore a "deflation subsidy." The
credibility of the Thatcher government's anti—inflationary policy should
therefore, if  the S—W framework is correct, not have been undermined by
large inflation—corrected, cyclically adjusted current account surplus.

1.      Introduction

        The paper by Sargent and Wallace [1981], (henceforth S-W),

establishes the proposition that in the long run inflation is always

and everywhere a fiscal phenomenon.      This result is derived by

constructing a model in which inflation is a strictly monetary

phenomenon   and showing, through the government budget constraint
and the existence of an upper bound on the real per capita    stock   of
interest—bearing   public sector debt held by the private sector, that,

in the long run, the rate of growth of the money stock is governed

by the fiscal deficit.     My comments on the paper fall into three

parts.     Section 2 takes as given the formal specification of the

model      and discusses some features of the model and its solution

that were not emphasized by S-w.     This includes the need to emphasize

the distinct roles of public spending and explicit taxes and the

possibility that the government will run surpluses and/or be a net

creditor to the private sector.


     Section 3 scrutinizes the specification of the model, which is

argued to be ad hoc in the sense that    it provides no acceptable
microfoundations for the demand for and supply of money and does not

offer a satisfactory account of the role of money in the economy.

While it is no worse on this account than alternative ad hoc models

of money and growth, it is also no better.


     Section 4 discusses three adjustments that must be made to the

commonly published public sector deficit figures in order to relate


1/ only the constant velocity version of the model is considered.
                                 - 1A   -


them to the deficit in the sense of the S-W model.          First a

correction must be made for the effect of inflation on nominal

interest rates (and hence on the debt service component of the

deficit) and on the real value of outstanding stocks of nominal

public sector interest-bearing debt.          Second, a cyclical correction

is required to eliminate trarsitory increases and decreases in the

deficit that will cancel each other out over a full cycle.            A third

correction is necessary because the S—W deficit is a deficit on the

public sector consumption or current account.          Published deficit data,

such as the public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) in the U.K.

include borrowing for public sector capital formation.


     It is shown that the inflation-adjusted government deficit,

obtained by subtracting from the measured deficit the reduction due to

inflation in the real value of the outstanding stock of nominally

denominated interest—bearing public sector debt, has been in balance

or in surplus in the U.K. during recent years.          If the deficit is in

addition adjusted for the cycle (as it should be to relate it to the

full employment S-W model), the government has been a sizeable net

lender to the private sector (and the rest of the world) in the past

few years.    Data on net public sector capital formation are hard to

come by and estimates of the real rate of return on public sector

investment are highly speculative.          The sign of the adjustment

required   to get from the PSBR to the government current ac.ount deficit
                               —2—
is hardly in doubt, however.    On the assumption that net public

sector capital formation has been positive and that the real rate

of return on such investment has also been positive, the public

sector current account surplus (deficit) will have been larger

(smaller) than the PSBR.    Given the favourable prospects for

North Sea oil tax revenues (and barring massive changes in the

stance of fiscal policy), the long-run prospect for the inflation-

corrected, cyclically adjusted public sector deficit suggests large

and continuing surpluses.   The past, present and prospective

future stance of fiscal policy is therefore conducive, in the S—W

framework, to a sizea.ble and sustainable reduction in the rate of

inflation.   The problems of the Thatcher government in achieving

a rapid and significant deceleration of inflation can therefore

not, following the logic of the S-W approach, be attributed to a

failure to support monetary stringency with an appropriate fiscal

policy and the "credibility" of the Medium Term Financial Strategy

(MTFS) cannot have been undermined by large inflation-adjusted

cyclically corrected public sector current account surpluses.




2.   Some technical aspects of the S—W model

     It is instructive to make one change in the presentation of the

S-W model.   From the paper it isn't very clear what the separate roles of
                                               —3—

public    spending, G, and           explicit taxes, T,         are, as the          analysis is
conducted almost entirely in terms of the defit, 0 = G — T.                                  In

fact all variations in the deficit in the paper are due to variations

in G, since after-tax per capita endowments                              and S       are   constant

and   real income is assumed to grow at the constant rate of population
growth n      .     The   analysis also appears to be conducted on the
asst.unption that 0 and B are positive —-                         a.n   unnecessary restriction.

        Let r1(t) be the per capita                    tax on   the young poor        and r2(t)
the per     capita tax     on   the young rich.                 and S are the per capita

endowments        (before tax) of the young poor and the young rich
respectively.            Thus i = — t1(t) and 5

                                                                     —
                                                                         - r 2 (t)

       Iote    that    public spending is intrinsically useless in          the   model,

as it does not enter as an argument in private utility functions and

plays   no role elsewhere in the model.                Any   efficient solution   will

therefore require G(t) = o                 for all t         This can be seen by noting,

from equation (6) that G(t)                simply reduces the total amount        of
resources      available for consumption or capital formation.               Changes in
public financing methods (borrowing, money creation and explicit
taxation) for a given trajectory of public spending, will alter the
time paths of private consumption and capital formation in ways that
cannot necessarily be ranked by the Pareto criterien.                    Consider on
the other hand two trajectories for public spending, {G'(t) I                          and

{G3(t)}            t   o, 1, ....     with Ct(t)        G(t) for all t and
G(t) >    G3(t)         for some t .         It will always be possible to use the
taxation,      borrowing and money creation mechanism in            order to achieve

a   Pareto-superior solution trajectory (starting from the                same initial

conditions) with the public spending programme (G3(t)}

        The meaning of optimal      policy is        not unambiguous          in    a model which
 has such      important distributional features, both between and within

 generations, as the S-W model.             It is, however, easy to show that it

 is possible for the authorities to replicate the solution that would

be    generated if     there were no government            and     both   rich and poor had
access       to the productive storage technology and                 the   capital market.

        Without government (B(t)            G(t) =         r1(t)      r2(t)   =    0(t)   =   0 for
all t ), and with equal access of both rich and poor to the storage

technoltgy and the capital market, the solution, which is stationary,

would be as follows:

                      N(t) . + P12(t)

        In the S-li model, described by equations Cl) -                     (7),   where the

poor have no access to the storage technology or the capital market,

this solution can be       duplicated as        follows.

Set     t(t)       o for   all    t ,   i   —   1,   2 .      Choose a negative rate of

monetary growth       given by:

the private sector as a whole.



The rich are indifferent between holding bonds-cum-capital and holding
 money when the rate of inflation is — R.                For convenience we assume
 that in that case they in fact choose to hold bonds and capital.                   If
 we don't make        this   assumption, the rate of decline of the general price
 level merely needs to be an arbitrarily small amount less than R
 Note that a rate of deflation greater than R would cause both poor and
 rich to want to hold only money as a store of value. No solution would
 exist, since rich private agents would wish to borrow infinite amounts
 from the government (at a rate R) to invest in money balances.

        This simple example can be generalized in many directions.

It is clear that Pareto—optimal policies wifl. always involve a

proportional rate of decline in the price level of R               ,   thus making
available     to all private agents intertemporal market terms of trade

equal to the technological intertemporal terms of trade for the
economy as a whole.  Also, with the capital market imperfection
and    technological constraint imposed on      the poor   in the      model,   there
typically will be too       little accumulation of physical        capital.
From equation (3) this can be remedied either by the government
actingas a net lender (B (t) < o)             and/or by making transfer
payntents to the rich (t2(t) c 0) .           Government spending is always

wasteful -- a significant shortcoming of the model.                It   is
surprising that the analysis in the paper is focussed              on deficits,

public sector debt, taxes and inflation, when the logic of the model
                 surpluses,
suggests public sector1credit, subsidies and deflation. Apparently
the    government is the only agent in the model that        isn't      optimizing.

       in   the S-W paper

       ta spite of its pri4,ia   facie foundation on iaicroeconcmic optimizing
behaviour, the S-W    model    is   ad hoc.   For   optimizing foundations to be
acceptable, both     the   objective functions and the constraint sets
must   make sense.    The authors do not comait the cardinal, sin in

 monetary   theory of   including money as an argument       in   the   direct
 utility function. Money in their model is wanted not for                 its own
 sake but for the purchasing power over commodities that
                                                         it               represents.
 Since   they   do not model a transactions role for money -—           which   is the

only   way to represent what is meant     by     a monetary economy and     the

only way    to make monetary theory different       from standard portfolio
 theory — they are faced with the problem of generating a demand                     for

money    as a store of value only.     By not including nominally
denominated     interest-bearing debt in the portfolio available to

private agents,     they   avoid creating a situation in which money            is
always dominated as a store of value.            However, money will be a

dominated asset whenever the rate of decline in the price level is

lessthan R.

purchase of government bonds by the poor.       Basically, the poor

hold money because the government tells them they cannot hold
anything else.      If such arbitrary restrictions on exchange are

acceptable, disequilibrium macroeconomics of the Barro-Grossman

variety would be safe from the criticism of ad hocceryf


     A further difficulty arises when one tries to relate the properties

of the asset H (high-powered money) in the model to money in the real.

world.      Money is whatever is generally acceptable as a medium of

exchange.      It is a property of assets, and not to be identified in a

permanent or policy-invariant way, with the particular asset or class of

assets that possess this property (to a greater or lesser degree) in a

given time and place.     In the model money is controllable because money is

H and H is controllable.        In the real world the set of assets representing

money varies across time arid space in respone to the optimizing choices

of households, corporations, financial institutions and governments.

Sometimes such choices are conscious public choices, as when a certain

class of objects is declared legal tender, but more often the

"moneyness of existing assets changes gradually and spontaneously and

new monies are created in response to perceived changes in profit

opportunities.

     Whether one measures the inflation tax as the increase in the

monetary base or as the rate of inflation times the outstanding

monetary   base    -—   the   two will, only be equivalent          if money is

neutral in the short run -—,        the   inflation tax   is   a very minor source

of government revenue.


     It is essential to be very       careful    about the     identification of
the real world counterparts of the theoretical construct H (or                   M   )


in macroeconomic models.         I do not for one moment believe that

inflation would be   cured     permanently by tight control over the rate of
growth of the monetary base and a compatible fiscal deficit               .   It
flies in the face of what we know about the profit-seeking behaviour
of private financial institutions and the transactions costs

minimizing behaviour of private households and firms.                The Lucas

critique applies to the supply of and demand for money as much as to

other aspects of economic behaviour.

4.      The inflation—corrected, cyclically adjusted public sector current
        account deficit


        The    formal model is specified              in terms of   real    debt and   real rates
of return.              Since all of U.S. government interest-bearing debt and most
of the U.K. 's government bonds are not indexed, we must adjust the
nominal government deficit for the effect of inflation on nominal
interest       rates.           In terms   of   equation (la), the deficit becomes


                        -   T =
                                     - M_1           B - B1 (       +

                                                               Pt


        For simplicity all bonds are assumed to be one period bonds with

a fixed money price of unity. B                        is   the nominal    stock   of bonds

issued    at time t and              due in period        t+]. .    R1 is     the   nominal.

        It is clear    that   the   interest payments due to inflation


B1                      are   exactly matched by the reduction in the real

                1
value    of the stock of outstanding nominal,           interest-bearing        public

debt   due to inflation.            The flow of funds accounts, of which the
public sector deficit is a part, record the higher government
interest     payments associated with higher inflation but do not record

the capital gains accruing to the government on its outstanding debt.


        It   is the   inflation-corrected deficit that       will,   as Sargent and

Wallace point out, have         to    be financed in the long run by the

infLation tax.          That part of the measured deficit that         merely      reflects

the effect of higher inflation on nominal interest rates does not

represent a real burden to be financed either by explicit or implicit

taxes.       By noting that the real stock         of   bonds is   given   by


        — , we immediately obtain Sargent and Wallace equation (3) from
our equation (16): the behaviour of the real. pox' capita stock of
government bonds is independent (in this perfect foresight classical
model) of whether the bonds are indexed or not.                When th. rate of
inflation is positive, the measured deficit overstates the aaunt of
financial "crowding out", i.e. the extent to which the public sector
competes with       the private sector for invastibla resources.                 In a
steady state, when all real. par capita asset StOCkS are constant, we

inflation into the par     value (not the       market value)     of the outstanding

stock of interest-bearing nominal debt.                Par   values rather than market

values are used because some of the variation in market values will be

due to changes in real     interest     rates.!' The adjustmenare crude and

somewhat sensitive to the choice of price index, time                period etc.        The

orders of magnitude are       bound   to be correct, however.           The inflation

correction is large and suffices in most years to turn a measured

deficit   into an inflation-corrected surplus. 2_'               Even   in   1980 the

inflation-corrected bidget was roughly in balance.                  Table 2 seems to

suggest that it isn't easy for any government to run a "real" deficit.

The same picture of a long sequence of inflation—corrected surpluses

emerges from Table 3 which shows         the   behaviour of the debt-income ratio

 (the ratio of public     sector interest-bearing debt to           national     income).
Some of the variation in the debt—income ratio is attributable to

cyclical deviation of output from capacity output.                  This is e.g. likely

to be the case in 1981.


     The S-W   model is   a   classical "full employment" model.               The

relevant deficit figure is therefore not           merely      inflation-corrected

but also cyclically adjusted.           Given   spending progranues and tax and

transfer   schedules, a cyclical departure of output below its full

employment or normal capacity utilization level will be associated

with an increase in the PSBR above its average value over the cycle.

Provided policy remains unchanged and upswings and downswings alternate

in cycles of roughly equal length and emplitude, a cyclical increase in

the PSBR relative to trend during the downswing will be matched, as

regards its effect on the outstanding stock of public sector debt, by

a cyclical decrease relative to trend during the upswing.     If we take

the financial years 1978/79 and 1979/80 as representing periods of

normal capacity utilization, the deep slump during financial year

1980-81 may well have been associated with a £7 billion cyclical

increase in the PSBR.        Again, while one may quibble with the exact

magnitudes, there can be no reasonable doubt that the inflation-

corrected, cyclically adjusted PSBR has been in quite substantial

surplus during the first two years of the Thatcher experiment.


     Government borrowing in the S-W model all consists of public "consumption

loans".    There is no public sector capital formation.   If instead

part of G consistituted public sector investment and if public sector

capital formation yielded the same rate of return R as private

investment and government debt, then borrowing to finance such

investment would not increase the deficit.    The debt incurred to finance

the investment can be serviced exactly from the returns generated by the

public sector investment.    While in the S-W model public borrowing

still "crowds out" private sector capital formation On a one—for—one

     The relevant deficit in the S..W model is therefore the public

sector cons.mption or current account deficit.         To obtain this we

should subtract from the PSBR the amount of net public sector capital

formation.


     Figures for gross public sector capital formation in recent years

are given in Table 4.         Even with the gross figures there are well-known

problems.    Some expenditure classified as current in fact belongs (in

part) to the economic category of capital formation, e.g. education.

Errors in the opposite direction also contaminate the data.         Even if

we take the gross investment figures at face value, it is very difficult

to come up with an acceptable figure for depreciation.   Finaria1

financial   year 1980/81 the corresponding figure is 32%.   To get some

idea cf plausible magnitudes I arbitrarily assume that net investment

is two-thirds of gross investment.     This is probably rather conservative.

The resulting guestimates for net public sector capital formation are in

Table 4, column 4.     Net public sector capital formation even in 1979

accounted for 56% of the PSBR.     In 1977 there even was a small current

account surplus. If we simply subtract the figure for net public

sector capital formation from the inflation corrected, cyclically

adjusted deficit we get very sizeable "real", full-employment current

account surpluses for all recent years; the "true" surplus for 1979 is

of the order of £8 billion, and for 1980 amounts to well over £10 billion.


      Clearly governienth can borrow to finance public sector

capital formation without the resulting deficit holding any long-run

inflationary threat, as long as the rate of return on the public sector

investment (net of the proportional rate of depreciation) is no less than

the rate of return on the debt issued to finance the investment.     To

argue   against netting the full amount of public sector capital formation
out   of the PSBR is to argue that the net rate of return on public sector

investment is less than the marginal cost of borrowing.     Indeed, if the

net marginal product of public sector capital is zero, public sector

investment is exactly the kind of wasteful expenditure represented by

G in the S-W model.      While the calculation of the net social rate of

  adjusted.

 return    on public sector investment is a very important issue, it is

 clearly beyond the scope of this paper.


      Note that it doesn't matter whether the government directly

 appropriates the returns on its investment through charges etc.      If

 the returns to the public sector investment accrue to the private

 sector (as is the case with much social overhead capital) the goverment

 could simply levy taxes (in the least distortionary manner) to service

the debt that financed the investment.       Provided the net social yield

on the public investment equals the marginal cost of public sector

borrowing, there will be no monetary and inflationary consequences of

such bond—financed public sector investment.


     Even if the past behaviour of the "real", full employment government

current account deficit (or "true" deficit) was consistent with a policy

of achieving a substantial and sustainable reduction in the rate of inflation,

anticipations concerning the future "true" deficit might still have

prevented such a policy from being successful.      It is clearly very hard

to make reasonable conjectures concerning the course of the future "true"

deficit.      If after the next election, the incoming government were to

implement a dramatic fiscal reflation there could be a five year period

of substantial "true" deficits.     In the absence of such a major policy

reversal, the prospects would seem to favour large "true" surpluses.         The

reason is the coming on stream of North Sea oil tax revenue.      As the companies

loose the ability to offset their capital costs against tax liabilities,

a major increase in the share of North Sea oil rents appropriated by
                                 — 24 —

government is building up)'


     Given the past record of inflation-corrected, full employment

government current account surpluses and with reasonable prospects

for continuing future surpluses the logic of the S-W approach suggests that the

credibility of the MTFS could not have been undermined by a budgetary stance

that is inconsistent with a sustainable reduction in the rate of inflation

as has been argued e.g. in Sargent [1981].       Implied in the current plans

for spending and taxation is a large future deflation subsidy, not an

inflation tax.    To draw practical implications from the insights

provided by the S-W model we must consider both sides of the public sector

balance sheet: its assets as well as its liabilities.       These assets

include the stock of physical public capital and the government's share

of North Sea oil wealth.

Conclusion

       The S-W paper is a useful reminder of the interdependence of

fiscal and monetary policy through the government budget constraint.

Especially transparent is their modelling of the long-run

implications of the government budget constraint once it is

recognized that there is an upper bound on the real pr capita

stock of interest-bearing public sector debt that the private sector

is willing and able to hold: the "permanent" or long—run real

government current account deficit must be financed by the inflation

tax.    The point is of analytical interest even if it is of no

relevance for explaining the persistence of inflation in spite of

restrictive monetary policies in the U.K. (and the U.S.) where recent

and anticipated future inflation—corrected, cyclically government

current account deficits have been negative.



       A potential danger of the del is that by       focussing exclusively
on the minor role of monetary policy as a revenue—raising mechanism, it

ignores   the much more important   stabilization role of monetary     policy.
In an economy   Like   the U.K. or the U.S. where   a significant   degree of
nominal   "stickiness"   exists and persists in wage and price setting
behaviour, conditional or contingent monetary policy rules      can help to
                                              — 26   —




stabilize the economy in the face of nominal and real, external and
internal shocks.          Such rules can be automatic stabilizers relating
monetary aggregates or interest rates to current, decentralized information
(Buiter (1981 a)) or feedback rules relating monetary instrumants to
past information.         While it is possible to construct models in which
deterministic and known monetary feedback rules (but not automatic
monetary stabilizers)       have no real effects, the accumulation of

special assumptions required to produce such invariance results

suggests that      in   less rarified representations of the economy a

stabilization      role exists for monetary feedback policy.           (Buiter

[1981 b]).


        An   especially unfortunate scenario in a Neo-Keynesian world
would be      the following.      In an economy with a high underlying rate

of inflation,      monetary    deceleration creates a slump because of

sluggish "core" inflation and         other   sources of nominal    inertia.     As

there is no immediate significant effect on the rate of inflation,

nominal      interest   rates (at least at the short     end of   the market) stay

high.    Indeed, with a predetermined general price level, nominal
      rates
interestL may well increase in the short run.   The measured deficit

now overstates the inflation-corrected, cyclically adjusted deficit

both    because   of the persistence of inflation and because of the cyclical
                                  — 27 —

decline   in real economic activity. Incorrect extrapolation of the

current measured deficit suggests incompatibility between the fiscal

stance and a significant and sustained reduction in the rate of

inflation. As a result spending programmes are curtailed and taxes

raised. This further worsens the slump. This scenario may well

be helpful in understanding the U.K. experience since mid—1979.
