Does Inflation Targeting Matter?

                                             ABSTRACT
This paper asks whether inflation targeting improves economic performance, as measured by the
behavior of inflation, output, and interest rates. We compare seven OECD countries that adopted

inflation targeting in the early 1990s to thirteen that did not. After the early 90s, performance improved
along many dimensions for both the targeting countries and the non-targeters. In some cases the
targeters improved by more; for example, average inflation fell by a larger amount. However, these

differences are explained by the facts that targeters performed worse than non-targeters before the early
90s, and there is regression to the mean. Once one controls for regression to the mean, there is no
evidence that inflation targeting improves performance.

“The performance of inflation-targeting regimes has been quite
good. Inflation-targeting countries seem to have significantly
reduced both the rate of inflation and inflation expectations
beyond that which would likely have occurred in the absence of
inflation targets.” (Mishkin, 1999, p. 595)

[The U.K. data show] “that not only has inflation been lower
since inflation targeting was introduced, but that, as measured
by its standard deviation, it has also been more stable than in
recent decades. Moreover, inflation has been less persistent –
in the sense that shocks to inflation die away more quickly –
under inflation targeting than for most of the past century.”
(King, 2002, p. 2).

“[O]ne of the main benefits of inflation targets is that they may
help to “lock in” earlier disinflationary gains, particularly in
the face of one-time inflationary shocks. We saw this effect,
for example, following the exits of the United Kingdom and Sweden
from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism and after Canada’s 1991
imposition of the Goods and Services Tax. In each case, the re-
igniting of inflation seems to have been avoided by the
announcement of inflation targets that helped to anchor the
public’s inflation expectations and to give an explicit plan for
and direction to monetary policy.” (Bernanke et al., 1999, p.
288).



I. INTRODUCTION

    Economists have long sought the ideal framework for monetary

policy.   Since the early 1990s, many have come to believe they

have finally found the right approach: inflation targeting.

Proponents of this policy cite many benefits.   Inflation

targeting solves the dynamic consistency problem that produces

high average inflation.   It reduces inflation variability, and if

“flexible” it can stabilize output as well (Svensson, 1997).

Targeting locks in expectations of low inflation, which reduces


                                 1
the inflationary impact of macroeconomic shocks.      For these

reasons, many economists advocate inflation targeting for the

Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank.

    This paper attempts to measure the effects of inflation

targeting on macroeconomic performance.      We examine twenty OECD

countries, seven that adopted inflation targeting during the

1990s and thirteen that did not.       Not surprisingly, economic

performance varies greatly across individual countries, both

targeters and non-targeters.   But on average, there is no

evidence that inflation targeting improves performance as

measured by the behavior of inflation, output, or interest rates.

    If we examine inflation-targeting countries alone, we see

that their performance improved on average between the period

before targeting and the targeting period.      For example,

inflation fell and became more stable, and output growth also

stabilized.   However, countries that did not adopt inflation

targeting also experienced improvements around the same times as

targeters.    This finding suggests that better performance

resulted from something other than targeting.

    For some performance measures, both inflation targeters and

non-targeters improve over time, but the improvements are larger

for targeters.   For example, average inflation fell for both

groups between the pre-targeting and targeting periods, but the


                                   2
average for targeters went from above that of non-targeters to

roughly the same.    Similar findings have led authors such as

Neumann and von Hagen (2002) to argue that inflation targeting

promotes “convergence”: it helps poorly-performing countries

catch up with countries that are already doing well.   Our

results, however, do not support even this modest claim of

benefits from targeting.   For many measures of performance, we

find strong evidence of generic regression to the mean.     Just as

short people on average have children who are taller than they

are, countries with unusually high and unstable inflation tend to

see these problems diminish, regardless of whether they adopt

inflation targeting.   Once we control for this effect, the

apparent benefits of targeting disappear.

    The rest of this paper comprises eight sections.    Section 2

describes the countries and sample periods that we study, and

Section 3 describes our methodology for measuring the effects of

inflation targeting.

    Sections 4 and 5 present our results concerning inflation

and output growth.   We estimate the effects of inflation

targeting on these variables’ average levels, variability, and

persistence.   There are occasional hints that targeting has

beneficial effects and occasional hints of adverse effects, but

overall it appears that targeting does not matter.


                                  3
    Section 6 turns to the behavior of interest rates, and

presents two main findings.   First, inflation targeting has no

effect on the level of long-term interest rates, contrary to what

one would expect if targeting reduces inflation expectations.

Second, targeting does not affect the variability of the short-

term interest rates controlled by policymakers.      At least by this

crude measure, central banks respond neither more nor less

aggressively to economic fluctuations under inflation targeting.

    Section 7 investigates the effects of targeting on several

bivariate relations: the slope of the output-inflation tradeoff,

the inflationary effect of supply shocks (specifically changes in

commodity prices), and the effect of inflation movements on

expectations (as measured by OECD inflation forecasts).      Here the

results are imprecise, as it is difficult to estimate these

relations over the short periods for which we have observed

inflation targeting.   However, the results suggest again that

targeting has no important effects.

    Section 8 compares our results to previous cross-country

studies of inflation targeting.       Finally, Section 9 interprets

our results.   To be clear, we do not present a case against

inflation targeting.   We do not find that targeting does anything

harmful, and we can imagine future circumstances in which it

might be beneficial.   Our results suggest, however, that


                                  4
no major benefits have occurred so far.



II. THE SAMPLE

    This section describes the countries in our sample and the

inflation-targeting and non-targeting periods that we examine.

    A. Targeters and Non-Targeters

    We examine major developed, moderate-inflation economies.

Specifically, we start with all members of the OECD as of 1990

(thus excluding the emerging-market economies that have joined

since then).   We delete countries that lacked an independent

currency before the Euro (Luxembourg) or have experienced annual

inflation over 20% since 1984 (Greece, Iceland, and Turkey).    We

are left with twenty countries, which are listed in Table I.

Previous macroeconomic studies using the same sample of countries

include Layard et al. (1991) and Ball (1997).

    Seven of the countries in our sample adopted inflation

targeting before 1999: Australia, Canada, Finland, Spain, Sweden,

U.K., and New Zealand.   For each country, we define the beginning

of targeting as the first full quarter in which a specific

inflation target or target range was in effect, and the target

had been announced publicly at some earlier time.   This

definition of targeting is more stringent than that of previous

authors, such as Bernanke et al. (1999) and Scheater et al.


                                 5
(2000).   These authors often date the start of targeting at the

point when targets were first announced, even if they were

implemented with a delay.   In other cases, targeting is said to

begin when the central bank retrospectively said it did, even

though it was not announced at the time.   Our view is that many

of the intended effects of targeting, such as those working

through expectations, depend on agents knowing that they are

currently in a targeting regime.

    As an example of our dating, consider Sweden.   Sweden

announced its shift to inflation targeting during 1993, so

Bernanke et al. and Scheater et al. date the regime from then.

However, the first announced target was 2 percent for inflation

over the twelve months to December 1995.   We choose the first

quarter of this period, 1995:1, as the beginning of the targeting

regime.   Table I gives the starting dates of targeting for the

other countries along with brief explanations for our choices.

The starting dates range from 1990:3 for New Zealand to 1995:2

for Spain.

    The targeting period lasts through 2001 for all countries

except Finland and Spain, where it lasts through 1998 because of

the advent of the Euro.   For each country, we compare the

targeting period to two pre-targeting periods, a longer one that

begins in 1960 and a shorter one that begins in 1985.   The last


                                   6
quarter of the pre-targeting period is the last full quarter

before targeting began (either the quarter before the start of

the targeting period or two quarters before, depending on whether

targeting began at the start of a quarter or in the middle).

    Throughout, we compare the seven inflation targeters to the

other thirteen countries in the sample.   Two of these countries

have adopted inflation targeting recently: Switzerland in 1999

and Norway in 2000.   We exclude these countries’ brief targeting

periods from our sample and treat Switzerland and Norway as non-

targeters.   Following our approach for targeters, we compare pre-

targeting periods starting in 1960 and 1985 to post-targeting

periods.   For the non-targeters, we define the post-targeting

period as starting at the mean of the start dates for targeters,

which is 1993:3.   The post-targeting period ends in 1998 for Euro

countries and 2001 for non-Euro countries besides Norway and

Switzerland.    Table II gives details of our dating.

    Of the thirteen non-targeting countries, eight joined the

Euro in 1999.   Previously, these countries were part of the

European Monetary System, so their monetary policies focused on

fixing exchange rates and meeting convergence criteria.   Two of

the non-targeters, Germany and Switzerland (one also in the EMS),

followed policies based on money-supply targets.   The remaining

four countries did not follow any announced rule – they pursued


                                  7
the policy of “just do it” (Mishkin, 1999).          In the results we

report, we lump all non-targeting countries together and compare

them to targeters.     We have checked, however, whether there are

systematic differences in performance among the non-targeting

groups, and fail to find any.       We have also performed our

comparisons of targeters and non-targeters excluding all Euro

countries (which leaves five targeters and five non-targeters).

This produces no noteworthy changes in results.1

     B. Constant Targeting

     In addition to studying inflation-targeting periods, we

examine periods in which countries are constant inflation

targeters, meaning they have an unchanging target or target

range.   In some countries the target is always constant, but in

others the constant-targeting period is preceded by a

transitional period in which the target exceeds its final level.

We examine constant-targeting periods because some benefits of

targeting might not arise if the target changes.           For example,

proponents of targeting argue that it reduces the persistence of




     1
        In addition, we tried adding a Euro dummy to all of our cross-country
regressions. This variable is usually insignificant. The only exception is
that Euro countries experienced larger falls in the standard deviation of
output growth between the pre- and post-targeting periods. Including the Euro
dummy never changes our findings about the effects of inflation targeting.

                                      8
inflation movements, but a changing target causes permanent

changes in inflation.2

      Throughout this paper, we compare inflation targeters (IT)

to non-targeters (NIT), and constant-inflation targeters (CIT) to

non-constant-targeters (NCIT).        Spain is an inflation targeter,

but its target fell throughout its targeting period; when we

split countries into CIT and NCIT, we put Spain in the second

group.    For both CIT and NCIT countries, we examine periods

before and after the start of constant targeting.            The start date

of the post-targeting period for NCIT countries is the average

start date for constant targeting in CIT countries.

    Table II lists sample periods for each of the twenty

countries.    We call the two pre-inflation-targeting periods,

those starting in 1960 and 1985, samples 1 and 2 respectively.

Sample 3 is the post-targeting period.          Samples 4 and 5 are pre-

constant-targeting periods, and sample 6 is the post-constant-

targeting period.     While the distinction between IT and CIT is

important in principle, our findings about economic performance




      2
        For New Zealand, we date the constant-targeting period from 1993:1 to
the end of the sample even though the target range was widened from 0-2% to 0-
3% in 1997. The half-point change in the midpoint was smaller (and of the
opposite sign) than the target changes during transitional periods in other
countries. In our judgement the 1997 episode was not a substantial change in
policy.

                                      9
in the pre- and post-targeting periods are similar in the two

cases.



III. METHODOLOGY

    We want to determine how inflation targeting (or constant

targeting) affects dimensions of economic performance such as

inflation, output growth, and interest rates.   We examine each

aspect of performance in turn, using a consistent methodology to

measure the effects of targeting.    Here we describe the

methodology.

    Suppose we are interested in how targeting affects a

variable X -– for example, X might be the average level of

inflation or the variance of output growth.   We first calculate

X for each of our 20 countries in each of our six sample periods.

Then, for each period, we calculate the average value of X for

inflation targeters and non-targeters (or, for samples 4 through

6, constant targeters and non-constant targeters).   These

averages show whether X differs systematically across periods or

across targeters and non-targeters.

    As we have mentioned, many measures of economic performance

improved on average between the pre-inflation-targeting and post-

targeting periods.   In most major economies, the period since the

early 1990s has seen low and stable inflation and stable output


                                10
growth.   If we examine inflation targeting countries alone, there

are clear economic improvements that one might be tempted to

attribute to targeting.    However, to learn the true effects of

targeting, we must compare improvements in targeting countries to

improvements in non-targeting countries.

     As a first pass at this comparison, we use a standard

“differences in differences” approach.       For our sample of twenty

countries, we run the regression

   (1)           Xpost – Xpre   =   ao + a1D + e ,

where Xpost is a country’s value of X in the post-targeting

period, Xpre is the value in the pre-targeting period, and D is a

dummy variable equal to one if the country is a targeter.         We run

several versions of this regression corresponding to different

start dates for the pre-targeting period (1960 or 1985) and

whether targeting means IT or CIT.       The coefficient a1 is meant

to measure the effect of targeting on the variable X.

     This regression can be misleading, however.       For some

versions of the variable X, the initial value, Xpre, is

substantially different on average for inflation targeters and

non-targeters.   For example, average inflation in the pre-

targeting period is higher for targeters.       This fact is not

surprising: a switch to targeting was most attractive to

countries with poor performances under their previous policies.


                                    11
However, a problem arises because of regression to the mean.

Poor performers in the pre-targeting period tend to improve more

than good performers simply because initial performance depends

partly on transitory factors.        If inflation targeters are poor

initial performers, they will improve more than non-targeters,

even if targeting does not affect performance.           The coefficient

on the targeting dummy can be significant, producing a spurious

conclusion that targeting matters.

      As an analogy, consider the behavior of Major League batting

averages.    Suppose a crackpot sports consultant suggests that a

hitter will perform better if he sleeps next to his bat at night.

In reality, this idea does not work.         Most .300 hitters merely

chuckle at the consultant, but .220 hitters are desperate enough

to try anything, and start taking their bats to bed.            Because of

regression to the mean, the low-average hitters who sleep with

their bats will tend to improve more than the high-average

hitters who leave their bats in their lockers.           If the sports

consultant regresses the change in a player’s average on a bat-

in-bed dummy, he will find a significant effect.            He will claim

incorrectly that the evidence supports his theory.3

 Baseball statistics exhibit substantial regression to the mean. This fact
explains the well-known “sophomore slump”: the tendency of players with strong
rookie years to do less well during their second years (e.g. Gilovich, 1984).
                                      12
     For readers who prefer math to baseball, the Appendix to

this paper formalizes our argument.          We assume that the variable

X depends on a country effect, a period effect, a country-period

effect, and possibly an inflation-targeting dummy.         The presence

of the country-period effect generates regression to the mean.

If Xpre is correlated with the targeting dummy, as happens in

practice, then regression (1) produces a biased estimate of the

dummy coefficient.

     Fortunately, there is a simple way to eliminate this bias:

add the initial value of X to the differences regression.          That

is, we run

   (2)       Xpost – Xpre   =   ao + a1D + a2Xpre + e .

Including Xpre controls for regression to the mean.        The

coefficient on the dummy now shows whether targeting affects a

country’s change in performance for a given initial performance.

If a1 is significant, then a targeter with poor initial

performance improves more than a non-targeter with equally poor

initial performance.        This difference implies a true effect of

targeting.

     Once again, the Appendix formalizes our argument.           Under the

assumptions we make there, regression (2) produces an unbiased

estimate of the dummy coefficient.




                                       13
IV . INFLATION

    In a recent speech, the next Governor of the Bank of England

posed the question “Ten Years of the Inflation Target: what has

it achieved?”    As quoted at the start of this paper, he suggests

that targeting has reduced the average level, variability, and

persistence of U.K. inflation.    In contrast, we find little

evidence in cross-country data that targeting has any of these

effects.

    A. Average Inflation

    Table III presents our results concerning the average level

of inflation.    Inflation is measured by the annualized percentage

change in consumer prices from the IMF’s International Financial

Statistics.     In Panel A of the table, we show average inflation

in each of our twenty countries and six sample periods.     For each

period, we also show the averages across targeting and non-

targeting countries.    Panel B reports our estimates of equations

(1) and (2) above.

    Not surprisingly, there is considerable cross-country

variation in average inflation.    In sample 2, for example (1985

to start of inflation targeting), average inflation ranges from

double digits in New Zealand and Portugal to less than two

percent in Japan and Netherlands.      In almost every country,

average inflation is lower in the targeting periods (samples 3


                                  14
and 6) than in the pre-targeting periods.   The cross-country

variation is smaller in the targeting periods, as all inflation

rates are under four percent.

       Turning to cross-country averages, we see that the IT group

had higher inflation than the NIT group before targeting was

introduced.   (Here and elsewhere, the comparison between the CIT

and NCIT groups is similar.)    For the shorter pre-targeting

sample, average inflation is 5.8% for IT countries and 3.7% for

NIT.   In the targeting period, by contrast, average inflation is

close to 1.9% for both groups.   On average, targeters converged

to the lower inflation levels of non-targeters.

       This convergence result is echoed in the first part of Panel

B, where we regress the change in average inflation on the

targeting dummy.   For the shorter pre-targeting sample, the

coefficient on the dummy is -2.2: average inflation fell by 2.2

points more in targeters than in non-targeters.   This coefficient

is the same as the difference in differences of means between

samples 2 and 3.   The regression reveals that this inflation-

targeting effect is statistically significant (t=2.5).

       Inflation targeting is important if it really reduces

average inflation by more than two percentage points.    However,

most of this apparent effect is illusory: it reflects the facts

that targeters had high initial inflation, and there is


                                 15
regression to the mean.   Panel B shows that regression to the

mean is strong: when initial inflation is included in the

inflation-change equation, its coefficient is -0.78.     Controlling

for this effect, the estimated effect of targeting is only -0.55,

and its statistical significance is weak (t=1.57, p-value=0.14).

Looking ahead, however, we will see that this result is one of

our more positive findings about inflation targeting!

     Note how much of the variation in inflation changes is

explained by initial inflation: including this variable raises

the R2's from 0.2 or below to 0.9.     Figure 1 illustrates this

point by plotting the change in inflation from sample 2 to sample

3 against the level in sample 2.      The Figure shows a tight

relationship, confirming the strong role of regression to the

mean.   The targeting countries tend to have high initial

inflation and large decreases, but the decrease for a given

initial level looks similar for targeters and non-targeters.

     B. Inflation Variability

     Tables IV and V examine the variability of inflation, using

the same format as the average-inflation table.     Table IV

presents standard deviations of quarterly inflation, and Table V

presents standard deviations of “trend inflation,” defined as a

nine-quarter moving average.    We examine trend inflation because




                                 16
targeters might stabilize this variable even if they cannot

smooth out higher-frequency inflation shocks.4

     There is no evidence whatsoever that inflation targeting

reduces inflation variability.        The standard deviations of

inflation and trend inflation fall for all groups of countries

during the targeting period.       At all times, the standard

deviations are lower for non-targeters than for targeters.

Equation 1 suggests that targeters experience larger falls in

standard deviations, but this result disappears when equation 2

controls for regression to the mean.

         In fact, Table IV suggests that, controlling for

regression to the mean, inflation targeting raises the standard

deviation of inflation.      This effect is sometimes statistically

significant.    Nonetheless, this perverse result is likely a fluke

(given the number of regressions we run, our tests should produce

some Type I errors).      Our robust finding is that inflation

targeting has no beneficial effects.

     C. Inflation Persistence

     Finally, we examine the persistence of inflation movements.

For each country and sample period, we estimate an AR-4 model for

quarterly inflation.      Then, for each period, we average each AR



     4
       In analyzing trend inflation, we include a quarter in a sample only if
all quarters that contribute to the nine-quarter average are in the sample.

                                     17
coefficient across targeting and non-targeting countries.            Using

these average coefficients, we compute impulse response functions

showing the effects of inflation shocks on future inflation.

     Figure 2 presents some of our results.          We use solid lines

for the impulse responses functions in targeting countries and

dashed lines for non-targeters.        For each group, we present

results for the long pre-targeting periods (samples 1 and 4) and

the targeting periods (samples 3 and 6).         We omit responses for

the short pre-targeting samples, which always lie between the

responses that we show.

     The Figure shows that inflation persistence has decreased

over time – inflation has become more “anchored.”           In the pre-

targeting periods, a unit inflation shock in quarter t raises

inflation at t+1 by more than 0.4 points, and this effect dies

out slowly.    For the targeting period, the effect is around 0.2

at t+1, and it disappears in a few quarters.          Crucially, this

pattern holds for both targeting and non-targeting countries.

Once again, there is no evidence that targeting affects inflation

behavior.5

 Note that the impulse responses for targeters in samples 3 and 6 are
negative at some lags. We have checked the statistical significance of the
negative responses with Monte Carlo experiments, following Sheridan (2001).
The only response that is significantly negative is the response for CIT
countries in period t+4. We are inclined to dismiss the negative responses as
a fluke, because they are not plausible theoretically.

V. OUTPUT GROWTH

    We now ask whether inflation targeting affects output

behavior.   We examine the mean and standard deviation of real

output growth, using the same methods we applied to inflation

behavior.   We use annual output data, as reliable quarterly data

are not available for all countries in our sample.   For each

country, we include a year in a given sample period only if all

four quarters of the year belong to the sample under our

quarterly dating.

    A. Average Growth

    There is no obvious theoretical reason that inflation

targeting should affect average output growth.   (It might if it

affected inflation behavior and inflation affects growth, but see

our negative findings about inflation.)   Nonetheless, Mishkin

(1999) suggests

“A conservative conclusion is that, once low inflation is
achieved, inflation targeting is not harmful to the real economy.
Given the strong economic growth after disinflation was achieved
in many countries that have adopted inflation targets, New
Zealand being one outstanding example, a case can be made that
inflation targeting promotes real economic growth in addition to
controlling inflation.” (p. 597)

Here we examine this idea, with inconclusive results.

    Table VI presents our results about average growth rates.

Average growth increased in inflation targeting countries after

targeting began, and it decreased slightly in non-targeting


                                19
countries.    When we control for regression to the mean, our point

estimates imply that targeting raises average growth by a

substantial amount: from 0.7 to 1.3 percentage points, depending

on the specification.   However, all the t-statistics are below

1.5, and three of four are below 1.2.   Thus the point estimates

do not mean much.

      Our estimates are imprecise because growth rates vary

greatly across individual countries.    In our short samples,

average growth depends on economies’ cyclical positions when the

samples start and end as well as growth in potential output.     We

need to observe inflation targeting over longer periods to see

whether it affects average growth.

    B. Output Variability

   Some economists argue that “flexible” inflation targeting

stabilizes output as well as inflation.   Others, such as

Cecchetti and Ehrmann (1999), suggest that targeting makes output

more variable.   Once again, we find that targeting simply does

not matter.

    Table VII presents results about the standard deviation of

annual output growth.   These results mostly echo our findings

about the standard deviation of inflation.   In the short pre-

targeting periods and the targeting periods, output is more

stable for non-targeting countries than for targeters.   For both


                                 20
groups, output becomes more stable during the targeting period.

When we control for regression to the mean, our estimates suggest

that targeting raises output variability, but this effect is not

statistically significant.



VI. INTEREST RATES

    We next examine the level of long-term interest rates, which

should reflect inflation expectations, and the variability of

short-term rates, which might indicate the activism of monetary

policy.

    A. Average Long-Term Rates

    We have seen that inflation targeters and non-targeters have

experienced similar reductions in inflation since the early

1990s.    Targeting proponents argue, however, that targeting locks

in low inflation permanently, while adverse events might reignite

inflation under “just do it” policies.   If the public believes

this argument, then targeting should reduce both expected

inflation and inflation uncertainty.   As discussed by King

(2002), both effects should reduce long-term interest rates.

    We look for this effect in OECD data on ten-year government

bond rates.   The data are annual, so we date our sample periods

by years, as in our work on output behavior.   The data start in

1970, so we begin samples 1 and 4 in that year rather than 1960.


                                 21
     Table VIII presents our results, which are highly

reminiscent of our inflation and output results.           If we define

better performance by lower interest rates, then non-targeters

always do better than targeters; both groups improved during the

targeting period; the improvement is somewhat larger for

targeters; but the effect of targeting disappears when we control

for regression to the mean.

     B. The Variability of Short-Term Interest Rates

     In addition to examining economic outcomes, we would like to

know whether inflation-targeting central banks move their policy

instruments differently from non-targeters.          In principle, one

can address this issue by estimating reaction functions for

short-term interest rates (i.e. Taylor rules).           In practice, it

appears difficult to get meaningful estimates of these equations

with the short samples at hand.        We therefore examine a cruder

measure of policy behavior, the standard deviation of short-term

rates.   Differences in policy rules should affect this statistic.

For example, if inflation targeters respond more strongly to

inflation movements, then short-term rates should become more

volatile (unless targeting stabilizes inflation, an effect we

fail to find).6

 Neumann and von Hagen and Kuttner and Posen (1999) estimate Taylor rules for
inflation targeters. For a critique, see Mishkin’s (2002) discussion of
Neumann and von Hagen.
                                     22
    We examine the volatility of short-term rates at the

quarterly frequency.    Our data are interbank rates from the IFS

(Line 60b).   We examine only the shorter of our pre-targeting

samples, the ones starting in 1985, because consistent data are

not available before then.   For once, we throw out a few

troublesome outliers.    For all countries, we delete the three

quarters of the ERM crisis, 1992:3 through 1993:1, when interest

rates jumped to very high levels.

    The results, in Table IX, follow the pattern we have seen

again and again.   Interest-rate volatility is lower for non-

targeters than for targeters and falls over time for both groups.

The decrease appears larger for targeters if we ignore regression

to the mean, but not if we control for it.



VII. BIVARIATE RESULTS

    So far we have examined the univariate behavior of

inflation, output, and interest rates.   In principle, we would

like to look more deeply at whether inflation targeting changes

the structure of the economy.   For our short samples, however, it

is impractical to estimate sophisticated structural equations.

Here we take one step beyond our univariate analysis by examining

several bivariate relations.

estimated changes in coefficients.         We do not add estimates of

initial coefficients to the right-hand sides of our regressions,

because the measurement error in the coefficients would create

bias.8

      B. Results

      Table X presents our bivariate results.          For the final time,

we find that economic behavior has changed over time, but the

changes are similar for inflation targeters and non-targeters.

      There are two significant changes over time: expectations

respond less to inflation movements, and inflation responds less

to commodity prices.      Both results suggest a greater anchoring of

inflation.    Strikingly, the commodity-price coefficients fall by

an order of magnitude.      For example, the average coefficient in

sample 1 (1960 to the start of IT) is 0.05 for non-targeters.

This means that a ten percent rise in the relative price of

commodities raises inflation by five tenths of a percentage

point.   For the IT period (sample 3), the coefficient is 0.006.

      In contrast, there is no evidence that inflation targeting

affects the coefficients that we consider.          In the twelve



8
  In principle, the optimal estimators of the group means and equation (1) use
weights that depend on both the variances of the coefficient estimates and the
variances of true coefficients across countries in a group. Using the
residuals from our cross-country regressions, we have estimated the variances
of true coefficients, and find they are small. We therefore set these
variances to zero and derive the optimal weights based on the variances of
coefficient estimates. These weights are the ones described in the text.

regressions in Table X, the targeting dummy is never significant

at the ten percent level.



VIII: COMPARISON TO OTHER STUDIES

    The closest study to ours is that of Neumann and von Hagen.

Their paper and ours have the same title.   Part of their paper,

like this one, compares the volatility of inflation, output, and

interest rates across time periods and groups of countries.    But

Neumann and von Hagen’s conclusion differs from ours: “Taken

together, the evidence confirms the claim that IT matters” (p.

144).

    Our study differs from Neumann and von Hagen in many

details, but the crucial difference may be our treatment of

regression to the mean.   After the sentence quoted above, they

continue: “Adopting this policy has permitted IT countries to

reduce inflation to low levels and curb the volatility of

inflation and interest rates; in so doing, these banks have been

able to approach the stability achieved by the Bundesbank”

(Neumann and von Hagen’s main example of a non-inflation

targeter).   We, too, find that targeters have caught up with non-

targeters along some dimensions, but this convergence was not

caused by targeting.




                                27
        A number of other studies report evidence that inflation

targeting matters.        For example, researchers report that

targeting steepens the Phillips curve (Clifton et al., 2001);

that it dampens movements in expected inflation (Sheridan, 2001);

and that it increases the predictability of inflation (Corbo et

al., 2002).9      Some of these results may again reflect regression

to the mean rather than a true effect of targeting.               This

possibility is suggested by Corbo et al.’s conclusion that

“Inflation targeters have consistently reduced inflation forecast

errors (based on country VAR models) toward the low levels

prevalent in non-targeting industrial countries” (p. 263).

        It is difficult to compare our results directly to previous

work, as the methodologies are quite different.              We believe,

however, that our results cast doubt on earlier findings that

inflation targeting affects economic behavior.              It seems unlikely

that targeting would affect the relationships studied by previous

authors and yet, as we find, have no effects on the means or

standard deviations of inflation, output, or interest rates.

IX. CONCLUSION

    We find no evidence that inflation targeting improves a

country’s economic performance.    How should one interpret this

result?

    One possibility is that targeting and non-targeting

countries pursue similar interest-rate policies.   Research

suggests that the policies needed to implement inflation

targeting are similar to the Taylor rules that fit the United

States and other non-targeters (e.g. Svensson, 1997; Ball, 1999).

Indeed, observers have suggested that the U.S. is a “covert

inflation targeter” (Mankiw, 2001).    This view is supported by

our finding of similar interest-rate volatility for targeters and

non-targeters.   If targeting does not change the behavior of

policy instruments, it is not shocking that economic outcomes do

not change either.   This result suggests, however, that the

formal and institutional aspects of targeting – the public

announcements of targets, the inflation reports, the enhanced

independence of central banks – are not important.   Nothing in

the data suggests that covert targeters would benefit from

adopting explicit targets.

    Our results do not provide an argument against inflation

targeting, for we have not found that it does any harm.    In

addition, there may be benefits that we do not measure.    First,


                                  29
aspects of inflation targeting may be desirable for political

rather than economic reasons.   Bernanke et al. argue that

targeting produces more open policymaking, making “the role of

the central bank more consistent with the principles of a

democratic society” (p. 333).

    Second, inflation targeting might improve economic

performance in the future.   The economic environment has been

fairly tranquil during the inflation-targeting era, and so many

central banks have not been tested severely.   Perhaps future

policymakers will face 1970s-size supply shocks, or strong

political pressures for inflationary policies.   At that point, we

may see that inflation targeters handle these challenges better

than policymakers who “just do it.”

    Thus a paper that replicates this study in 25 or 50 years

may find ample evidence that targeting improves performance.     The

evidence is not there, however, in the data through 2001.
