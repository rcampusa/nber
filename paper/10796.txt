The Changing Association Between Prenatal Participation in WIC and Birth Outcomes in New
York City

NBER Working Paper No. 10796
September 2004
JEL No. I12

                                           ABSTRACT

We analyze the relationship between prenatal WIC participation and birth outcomes in New York

City from 1988-2001. The analysis is unique for several reasons. First, we restrict the analysis to

women on Medicaid and or WIC who have no previous live births and who initiate prenatal care

within the first four months of pregnancy. Our goal is to lessen heterogeneity between WIC and non-

WIC participants by limiting the sample to women who initiate prenatal care early and who have no

experience with WIC from a previous pregnancy. Second, we focus on measures of fetal growth

distinct from preterm birth, since there is little clinical support for a link between nutritional

supplementation and premature delivery. Third, we analyze a large sub-sample of twin deliveries.

Multifetal pregnancies increase the risk of anemia and fetal growth retardation and thus, may benefit

more than singletons from nutritional supplementation. We find no relationship between prenatal

WIC participation and measures of fetal growth except among a sub-sample of US-born Blacks

between 1990-1992. A similarly sporadic pattern of association exists among US-born Black twins.

Our finding that the modest association between WIC and fetal growth is limited to a specific racial

and ethnic group during specific years and even specific ages suggests that the protective effect of

prenatal WIC on adverse birth outcomes in New York City has been minimal.

                                         Introduction

       Over seven million women, infants and children participated in the Special Supplemental

Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) in 1999, up from 4.1 million in

1989. Over the same period expenditures in 1999 dollars grew from 2.6 to 4.0 billion dollars

(U.S. House of Representatives 2000). A large body of published research suggests that

prenatal participation in WIC increases birth weight and lowers the incidence of low and very

low birth weight births. Based on the results from these studies, the General Accounting Office

concluded that every federal dollar spent on prenatal WIC participants returned an estimated

$3.50 in savings in primarily reduced health care costs (General Accounting Office 1992).

Since then, the general conclusion among policy makers has been that “WIC works.”

       In a recent review of previous research, however, Douglas Besharov and Peter Germanis

(2001) challenge the widely held belief that WIC is a highly successful program. They contend

that research on the association between WIC participation and improved birth outcomes suffers

from outdated estimates and poor designs. Moreover, the results pertain to only 12 percent of

WIC participants. At best, they conclude, WIC may have a small positive effect on birth

outcomes of pregnant women at high risk for nutritional deficiencies.

       In this study we use New York City birth certificates from 1988 to 2001 to address

several of the concerns raised by Besharov and Germanis (2000; 2001). For example, Besharov

and Germanis argue that the composition of WIC participants has changed significantly over the

past decade, which in turn may make earlier estimates of the effect of WIC on birth outcomes

less relevant. The growth in WIC coincides with the expansion in Medicaid eligibility

thresholds that occurred in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Women on Medical Assistance are

automatically eligible for WIC, even if the income thresholds for Medicaid exceed those for




                                                1
WIC (Lewis and Ellwood 2000). As a result, the growth in WIC among pregnant women is

likely to include proportionately fewer women at risk for adverse birth outcomes. With 14

years of data and almost 900,000 births to women on Medicaid in New York City, we examine

the composition of women on Medicaid and WIC from the period before the Medicaid eligibility

expansions through the most recent expansions for pregnant women under State Children’s

Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). We also test whether the association between WIC and

birth outcomes has changed over time, and if so, whether the changing composition of

participants can explain the difference.

        The second contribution of our study is the focus on measures of fetal growth as

outcomes by which to assess the effectiveness of WIC. Many previous studies have found large

and statistically significant associations between WIC participation and very low birth weight

births (VLBW < 1,500 grams (3.3 lbs)). Indeed, approximately two-thirds of the savings

associated with WIC in the report by the General Accounting Office (GAO) resulted from a

decrease in VLBW (GAO 1992). But such an association is highly implausible. Nationally,

ninety-five percent of all VLBW births are preterm (< 37 weeks gestation) but only 10 percent of

VLBW births are also small for gestational age. However, interventions to prevent preterm

births remain elusive. An editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine summarizes

clinicians’ frustration,

        “Trials measuring the effect of interventions at eliminating a single risk factor are
        numerous; uterine contractions have been suppressed, cervixes have been sewn shut,
        microorganisms have been eliminated, and social support, better nutrition, and prenatal
        care have been provided. When these factors have been studied in isolation, not one has
        resulted in a decline in preterm birth” (Iams, J. 1998, p. 54).




                                                2
If WIC is unlikely to affect the probability of a preterm birth, then the often-reported relationship

between WIC and VLBW is highly suspect. We contend that measures of fetal growth are more

appropriate outcomes by which to evaluate WIC.

         Third, many studies report that improvements in birth outcomes associated with WIC are

greater among women at medical risk such as smokers, teenagers and those with a previous

premature delivery. Such results are interpreted as evidence that WIC is more beneficial for

women in need of nutritional assistance. Even Besharov and Germanis (2000; 2001) concede the

possibility of such heterogeneous effects. However, these risk factors tend to be correlated with

other hard to measure determinants of birth outcomes such as substance abuse, sexually

transmitted disease, and stressful home environments. Thus, effects associated with WIC among

a sample of women that smoke, for instance, may reflect greater unobserved heterogeneity

between WIC and non-WIC participants than is found among lower-risk groups such as non-

smokers.     As a cleaner test of whether the association between WIC and birth outcomes is

greater among women at nutritional risk, we compare outcomes between WIC and non-WIC

participants who deliver twins. Multiple gestations represent a random health shock that

increases the risk of anemia, inadequate weight gain and adverse birth outcomes, but should be

orthogonal to other risky behaviors.1

         Finally, a universal concern among analysts of WIC has been selection bias. Do women

that participate in WIC differ from non-participants in ways that are hard to measure but that are

also correlated with the outcomes of interest? We take several approaches. In the first, we

exploit our large sample size and stratify the analysis into more homogenous groupings. For


1
  An exception would be multiple gestations that resulted from assisted reproductive technology (ART). However,
eighty-nine percent of women that receive ART are 30 years of age or older and 77 percent have no previous live
births (Schieve et al. 2002). Women that receive such treatment are likely to be older, better educated and of zero or
low parity---a group with a low probability of WIC participation.


                                                          3
example, we analyze the association between WIC and fetal growth among foreign-born

Hispanics on Medicaid, with no previous live births, all of whom who initiate prenatal care early.

As an additional refinement, we use propensity score matching within strata and we drop cases in

which there is not a common support between WIC to non-WIC participants. Propensity score

matching does not solve the problem of selection on unobservable factors, but it may further

improve the quality of our comparison group. Lastly, we estimate, but do not emphasize,

estimates based on instrumental variables. We use New York State’s Medicaid eligibility

expansion in 1990 as an instrument for prenatal WIC participation.



                                           Background

       The conclusion that “WIC works” became conventional wisdom after the widely cited

report by the GAO (GAO,1992). Based on 17 studies, the GAO concluded that prenatal WIC

participation lowered the rate of low birth weight (LBW < 2,500 grams (5.5 lbs)) by 25 percent

and the rate of very low birth weight by 44 percent. These improvements in newborn health

generated immediate savings of $2.89 per dollar invested in WIC in the first year of life and

$3.50 in savings if estimated over 18 years. Five of the 17 studies were based on the influential

analysis conducted by researchers at the Mathematica Policy Research, Inc. In that study,

researchers linked birth certificates to WIC administrative files in 1987 and 1988 in five states:

Florida, Minnesota, North Carolina, South Carolina and Texas (Devaney, Bilheimer and Schore

1992). Researchers reported that mean birth weight was 87 grams greater and the incidence of

low birth weight was 3.8 percentage points less among WIC relative to non-WIC participants.

       Similar results based on equivalent methods were obtained from a national sample of

births in1988 from the National Maternal and Infant Health Survey (NMIHS). The NMIHS is a




                                                 4
national sample drawn from natality files with more extensive information on maternal

characteristics and behaviors than was available from state-specific linkages of administrative

data to birth certificates (Gordon and Nelson 1995). The national sample increased the

generalizability of the findings and the additional covariates lessened the potential of omitted

variable bias.



Appropriate Outcomes

        An important consideration when evaluating the findings of the previous research on

WIC is whether there is a plausible mechanism for the relationship between WIC and the

outcome of interest. Most studies have emphasized the association between WIC and the

probability of a low birth weight birth. However, low birth weight can be broadly divided

between preterm births—those that occur before the 37th week of gestation—and those that are

small for gestation age (SGA). The latter is an indication of fetal growth retardation. As noted

above, the causes of preterm birth are largely unknown and few interventions, if any, appear

effective. Thus, the incidence of very low birth weight, 95 percent of which are preterm, would

seem an inappropriate outcome with which to assess the effectiveness of nutritional education or

supplementation.2 A stronger case can be made for an association between fetal growth

retardation and prenatal supplementation, since the latter is more closely linked to nutritional

intake and maternal weight gain (Institute of Medicine 1990).

        There is little doubt, for instance, that extreme nutritional deprivation in the prenatal

period affects fetal growth. The Dutch Famine of 1944-45, for example, was associated with a

300 gram decrease in mean birth weight (Stein and Susser 1975). However, the association


2
 Indeed, in the Dutch Famine study, severe nutritional deprivation had a major effect on birth weight but was
unassociated with gestational age.


                                                         5
between nutritional supplementation and birth weight in developed countries is less clear. In a

randomized trial of poor women in New York City, there was some evidence that prenatal

supplementation increased maternal weight gain, but supplementation was unrelated to birth

weight (Rush, Stein and Susser 1980). Similarly, in the National WIC Evaluation researchers

found no association between WIC participation and birth weight, despite significant increases in

the intakes of 4 out of the 5 nutrients that were analyzed (Rush et al. 1998). And in the only

randomized trial of WIC participation, researchers found no effect of WIC participation on birth

weight except for among a subset of maternal smokers (Metcoff et al. 1985).

       Importantly, studies that show an association between WIC and low birth weight or mean

birth weight report statistically insignificant associations or small effects of WIC on proxies for

fetal growth. In the Mathematica study, differences in mean birth weight fall from 87 grams

averaged across the five states to 25 grams when gestational age is included in the birth weight

specification (Devaney, Bilheimer and Schore 1992 ). The same is true in a detailed assessment

of WIC based on the NMIHS. A statistically significant mean difference in birth weight of 68

grams falls to a statistically insignificant difference of 25 grams when adjusted for gestational

age (Gordon and Nelson 1996). Kotelchuck et al. (1984) find that participation in WIC in

Massachusetts is associated with a 1.8 percentage point decline in low birth weight, but WIC is

not associated with infants that are small for gestational age (SGA), a standard indicator of fetal

growth retardation. Stockbauer (1987) and Buescher and Horton (2000) obtain similar results in

Missouri and North Carolina respectively. In none of these analyses, however, do the authors

interpret the lack of a substantive association between WIC and fetal growth as inconsistent with

the inference that WIC improves infant health. Instead, researchers conclude that WIC has a

strong indirect effect on birth weight or low birth weight through prolonged gestation.




                                                  6
        The recent paper by Bitler and Currie (2003) is a case in point. The authors use the

Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) to analyze the association between

prenatal WIC participation and a host of birth outcomes. PRAMS links a postpartum survey of

recent mothers with information from the birth certificate. The authors use an unbalanced panel

of 19 states from 1992 to 1999. The sample contains information on over 60,000 birth outcomes

to women on Medicaid, 49,000 of which participated in WIC. They find that WIC is associated

with a 54 percent decrease in the odds of a very low birth weight birth and a 53 percent decrease

in the odds of very premature infants (< 32 weeks gestation). Effects for teens are substantially

larger. Since both outcomes are rare the coefficients can be interpreted as changes in the relative

risk, which suggests that WIC lowers the probability of extreme prematurity by more than half

for all women on WIC and by two-thirds for teens. Such effects are implausible given that

prenatal interventions reported in the clinical literature have not been effective at preventing

preterm birth (Goldenberg and Rouse 1998).3

        Significantly, Bitler and Currie (forthcoming) also find that WIC is associated with only a

13 percent decline in the odds that a newborn is small for gestational age (SGA); moreover, the

coefficient is statistically insignificant in two of the three high-risk subgroups that they analyze

separately. They also report that WIC is associated with an increase of slightly over a pound in

maternal weight gain during pregnancy, which provides some corroboration for the modest

increase in fetal growth.

Selection Bias

       An additional concern with previous research on WIC is that the estimates of the effect of

WIC are subject to selection bias. A number of approaches such as the use of statistical controls,

matched samples or instrumental variables have been used to attempt to minimize this bias, but

none of them are ideal. Selection bias occurs if women that participate in WIC are more

motivated to deliver a healthy baby or more risk averse than their counterparts who choose not to

participate. If motivation or risk aversion is negatively correlated with other hard to measure

factors that increase the risk of preterm delivery or fetal growth retardation (i.e, the intensity of

smoking, illegal drug use, vaginal infection), then omitted variable bias will cause the estimated

effect of WIC to be overstated. There has been only one randomized trial involving WIC and

results were equivocal (Metcoff et al. 1985).

       In most observational studies researchers use statistical controls or matched samples to

lessen contamination from selection bias. One criticism is that the set of covariates from

administrative data and birth certificates is limited, which makes inferences vulnerable to

omitted variable bias (Devaney, Bilheimer and Schore 1992; Schramm 1985; 1986; Stockbauer

1986; Stockbauer 1987; Kotelchuck et al. 1984). Studies with much more detailed information

on maternal behavior and socio-economic status have obtained similar findings to studies with

many fewer covariates (Gordon and Nelson 1996; Bitler and Currie forthcoming). However,

even the use of detailed covariates may not be adequate to deal with selection bias.

       Studies that match pregnant women on WIC to eligible pregnant women on waiting lists

for WIC or to women in counties without WIC programs have reported mixed results. Women

who applied for WIC in Massachusetts, but who were not certified due to a lack of openings, had

infants with lower mean birth weights than infants of women enrolled in WIC (Kennedy et al.




                                                   8
1982). An alternative matching strategy has been to use two births to the same woman. During

one pregnancy the mother participated in WIC and in the other she did not (Kowaleski-Jones and

Duncan 2002). The advantage of models with “individual fixed effects” is that they remove

confounding from time-invariant characteristics of the mother. Yet, at the same time they raise

the question of why a woman participated in WIC once and not again. If she became ineligible

because of an increase in income, or was not at nutritional risk, then potential problems of

selection bias are re-introduced if these other changes are not adequately controlled. Finally,

sample sizes tend to be small and arguably unrepresentative. In the study by Kowaleski-Jones

and Duncan (2002), the estimated effects of WIC on birth weight are very large, but are based on

the experience of only 71 women whose experience with WIC varied between pregnancies.

        Econometric approaches to selection bias have yielded highly unstable results due to the

lack of a credible identification strategy (Fraker et al. 1995; Brien and Swann 1999).

Researchers have yet to find a variable that predicts WIC participation, but that has no direct

effect on birth outcomes. Brien and Swann (1999), for instance, use indicators of WIC clinics,

AFDC guarantees and Medicaid expenditures per family to predict WIC participation.

However, they do not include state fixed effects and thus rely on between-state variation in social

policies to identify WIC participation. The exogeneity of the instruments is not convincing

since differences in social policy across states may reflect unmeasured state-level factors that

affect infant health.

        Selection or omitted variable bias may also be exacerbated by the common practice of

obtaining separate estimates of the effect of WIC on infant health for women with elevated risks

of adverse birth outcomes (Kennedy and Kotelchuck 1984; Stockbauer 1986,1987; Schramm

1985, 1986; Buescher et al. 1993). The empirical strategy is based on WIC eligibility criteria




                                                 9
that use characteristics such as smoking, teen pregnancy, short birth spacing and high parity as

markers for nutritional risk (Institute of Medicine 1996). Many researchers have reported, for

example, that differences in mean birth weight between WIC and non-WIC smokers are greater

than between nonsmokers or between WIC and non-WIC women more generally (Metcoff et al.

1985; Schramm 1985,1986; Stockbauer 1986). This is interpreted as evidence that women with

greater “nutritional” need benefit more from WIC than women with less need. But differences

between WIC and non-WIC participants that smoke may simply reflect differences in actual

smoking intensity or differences in other unobserved behaviors that are correlated with smoking

and not heterogeneous treatment effects.

       In summary, there are many concerns with the previous research on WIC. With few

exceptions, studies pertain to women who gave birth in the 1970s and 1980s, but a doubling of

WIC enrollment over the past 12 years undermines the relevancy of these earlier studies. In

addition, some of the outcomes used to evaluate WIC lack a clinical link to nutritional

supplementation. Finally, selection bias remains a threat to the validity of received work and the

conclusion that WIC is more effective among women at elevated risks of adverse birth outcomes

may be a further manifestation of omitted variables bias. In this study we present the first

attempt to look at the average treatment effect of WIC over time. We use proxies for fetal

growth and maternal weight gain as outcomes and we take two approaches to limit

contamination from selection bias. Finally, we present results from an analysis of WIC and fetal

growth among 11,000 twins as a test of whether WIC has a greater association among infants of

women with exogenous increases in the risk of anemia, inadequate weight gain and intrauterine

growth retardation.




                                                10
                                                Data

       We analyze the relationship between prenatal WIC participation and birth outcomes in

New York City from 1988-2001 women on Medicaid and/or WIC as recorded on birth

certificates. New York City is a separate vital registration area. Its birth certificate is arguably

the most detailed in the country. Since 1988 it has included the method of finance (Medicaid,

other third party, HMO, and self pay) and whether the mother was enrolled in WIC during

pregnancy. There are also indicators of smoking, illicit drug use, as well as the standard set of

socio-demographic characteristics of the mother available from all birth certificates.

       The indication of WIC participation is a dichotomous variable. Thus, we lack information

on how long the mother has been enrolled or when she enrolled during pregnancy. We are also

concerned about accuracy of the indicator given that it is largely self-reported. To investigate the

quality of the data, we compare the proportion of women on WIC in New York City as obtained

from birth certificates to other sources with similar information. We summarize the results in

Table 1. The most significant and convincing comparison comes from a 1990 analysis conducted

by the New York State Department of Health (1990). Researchers for the State linked the WIC

History File to New York State birth certificates in 1988. The match rate was 96 percent. This

matched file was then linked to the state hospital discharge data set (SPARCS). Summary

statistics are presented for New York City and Upstate New York. As shown in Table 1, the

State reported that 21.3 percent of births to New York City residents in 1988 were enrolled in

WIC during pregnancy. The figure from the New York City birth certificate was 21.0 percent.

As an additional check we compared data from two other sources: the 1988 National Maternal

and Infant Health Survey or NMIHS

(http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/elec_prods/subject/mihs.htm) and 1993 Pregnancy Risk




                                                  11
Assessment Monitoring System or PRAMS (http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/drh/srv_prams.htm).

NMIHS does not identify the state of residence on the public use file and thus we compared New

York City to the northeast region. Similarly, the PRAMS data from New York does not include

births to women from New York City. Although PRAMS does not include births for New York

City, we used the City and Upstate distribution of WIC participation in 1988 and the total figure

for upstate New York State in 1993 to approximate participation in New York City. As is

evident from Table 1, WIC participation based on New York City birth certificates is consistent

with other surveys.

        Finally, WIC is not an entitlement program. If demand for WIC exceeds the allocated

funds, then eligible candidates may not receive benefits. Pregnant women, however, are among

the eligible groups with the highest priority for WIC services and the prenatal WIC program has

been fully funded in New York State over the study period.4

Outcomes

        We present results for birth weight and low birth weight so that our results can be

compared to previous work. We use the standard definition of low birth weight, which is infants

born less than 2500 grams. We use three measures of fetal growth. The first is birth weight

adjusted for gestational age. The second measure is a dichotomous indicator of infants below

the 10th percentile in weight for gestation based on all singleton births to US residents in 1995

(Alexander et al. 1998). They are referred to as small for gestational age (SGA). Our final

measure of fetal growth is an indicator of infants that are term, low birth weight (> 36 weeks

gestation and < 2500 grams).

time. Moreover, the only change in New York State in the availability of food that we were able to establish was the

        We use maternal weight and net maternal weight gain during pregnancy as intermediate

outcomes that may be related to nutritional supplementation. Net maternal weight gain is total

weight gain less the weight of the newborn. Net maternal weight gain removes spurious

association related to what epidemiologists refer to as part-whole correlation (Institute of

Medicine 1996). However, weight gain is not reported consistently over time in our data. In

1988-90, for example, weight gain was unknown for 27 percent of WIC participants but 67

percent of non-WIC participants with no previous live births and who initiated prenatal care in

the first four months of pregnancy (see Table 2). By 1999-2001, the percent unknown had fallen

to approximately six and nine percent, respectively. Thus, for maternal weight gain during

pregnancy, we limit the analysis to 1999-2001.

Analysis of twins

        A novel aspect of this study is a subset of analyses based on the outcomes of multifetal

pregnancies that result in twins. There were over 40,000 deliveries to twins in New York City

between 1988 to 2001, of which approximately 11,000 were to women on Medicaid and/or WIC.

Thus, we analyze the association between WIC participation and birth outcomes to women on

Medicaid or on WIC without Medicaid who delivered twins over the study period. Although

twin deliveries represent less than two percent of all live births, the rate of low birth weight is

                                         Empirical Methods

Analysis of singleton births

        The composition of women that gave birth in New York City has changed significantly

over the 14 years of our study period. In 1988, for example, 39.0 percent of all births in the City

were financed by Medicaid as compared to 55.8 percent in 2001. Similarly, the percent of births

to foreign-born women increased from 40.1 in 1988 to but 53.0 percent in 2001. To adjust for

such shifts in the distribution of births by maternal characteristics, we estimate regressions of the

form:


             (1)          G it = α 0 + α1 WICit + x' it β + ∑ yrt + e it


        Let Git be the fetal growth in grams adjusted for gestational age of infant i in year t; let

WICit be one if the mother participated in WIC during pregnancy in year t, let xit be a vector of

maternal characteristics and let yrt be an indicator of the year. The coefficient on WIC, α1,

estimates the average treatment effect of WIC on fetal growth under two assumptions: first, that

the decision to participate in WIC, conditional on X, is uncorrelated with fetal growth in the

absence of participation; and second, that the expected gains to participation are constant across

individuals (Heckman 1997; Wooldridge 2002). Both assumptions are clearly strong. To

illustrate, Figures 1 and 2 show the rate of low birth weight births and mean birth weight,

respectively, for singleton births to women on Medicaid by WIC and non-WIC participants in

New York City from 1988 to 2001. In 1988, the difference in the rate of low birth weight



                                                    14
between WIC and non-WIC participants was 3.5 percentage points and differences in mean birth

weight was 95 grams. Both estimates are quite consistent with much of the literature of the

1980s. As is apparent in both Figures, however, mean differences diminish overtime. There are

also large differences by race, ethnicity and nativity, as we show below. Consequently, we

interact WIC with the year dummies and we estimate separate models by race, ethnicity and

nativity. With these specifications the assumption of constant average treatment effects may be

less problematic, since it pertains to more homogenous groups at a specific point in time.

       The other key assumption is that WIC participation is uncorrelated with fetal growth in

the absence of participation. In other words, do women select into WIC because they have

strong preferences for health and are highly risk averse (favorable selection); or, is the opposite

true: women that participate in WIC have underlying health problems that are not observed by

researchers (adverse selection). We take two approaches to mitigate selection bias. First, we

estimate models that are limited to women of zero parity who initiate prenatal care in the first

four months of pregnancy, a standard definition of early prenatal care (Kotelchuck 1994). The

idea is to compare outcomes among a sample of women whose preferences, motivation, and

experience with pregnancy are similar. For example, data from the NMIHS indicate that in

1988, 67 percent of prenatal WIC participants who had at least one previous live birth had been

enrolled in WIC during a preceding pregnancy (Gordon and Nelson 1995). Women previously

enrolled in WIC may be more likely to register for early prenatal care. They may be better

informed about nutrition and other risk factors and have stronger preferences for healthy

behavior. By restricting the sample to women with no previous live births, we eliminate the

possibility of differential experience with WIC between current participants and non-

participants. Similarly, early prenatal care may be another marker for favorable selection. The




                                                 15
first prenatal care visit is initiated by the woman. Subsequent visits may be in response to the

prenatal protocol. Thus, the timing of the first visit as opposed to an index of prenatal care may

better reflect a mother’s attitude and access to prenatal care.

        To illustrate the difference in risk factors by the timing of prenatal care in our sample, we

display the percent of births exposed to cocaine or heroin from 1988 to 2001. We also display

these differences by race, ethnicity and nativity. Figure 3 pertains to women on Medicaid and or

WIC who initiated prenatal care in the first-four months of pregnancy. Figure 4 shows the same

series but for women who initiated prenatal care late. We stratify the four series in each figure

by WIC and non-WIC participants. Two observations are salient. First, differences in exposure

by nativity are huge. Foreign-born women, and in particular Hispanics, have very low rates of

exposure to illicit drugs regardless of when they begin prenatal care.5 Second, differences in

exposure vary by year, WIC participation, and the timing of prenatal care among U.S. born

blacks. Exposure is greatest between 1988-90, roughly the peak years of the crack/cocaine

epidemic in New York City, and it declines substantially by 2001. Given these patterns, we hope

to lessen heterogeneity between WIC and non-WIC participants by estimating separate models

by race, ethnicity, nativity, parity and the timing of prenatal care.

        An important limitation of our identification strategy is that our results will only

generalize to primaparas who initiate prenatal care early. We consider this an acceptable

tradeoff. The danger of omitted variable bias in program evaluation with observational data is

clearly profound. The strength of our analysis is the large number of observations over a 14-year

period. This allows us to define relatively homogenous groups and to test whether treatment

effects vary over time. If the composition of our samples is constant over the study period


5
  This is not specific to New York City. Vega et al. (1993) analyzed the urine of over 29,000 women who delivered
in California in 1992 and found similar differences by race and ethnicity.


                                                       16
(based on observables), then time-varying treatment effects would be consistent with some form

of selection into WIC.

        We take two other approaches to estimate the association between WIC and birth

outcomes. We use propensity score matching with the selected sample of first births to women

who begin care early. We use nearest neighbor matching after balancing characteristics between

WIC and non-WIC participants by blocks of propensity scores. We also drop observations that

lack a common region of support (Becker and Ichino 2002). We appreciate that neither

stratification nor matching guarantees that selection bias is minimized. Thus, we also obtain

estimates based on instrumental variables (IV). The results from propensity score matching and

IV models are presented in Appendix II. The estimates obtained by propensity score matching

differed little from those obtained by OLS. The IV estimates of the relationship between WIC

and fetal growth outcomes are not significant. However, we choose not to focus on these results

because the variables we use as instruments are not ideal. We present a fuller discussion of these

results in Appendix II.



Analysis of Twins

       As noted above, researchers often estimate equation (1) separately for groups at greater

“nutritional” risk, such as smokers and teens. The objective is to allow for interactions between

need and participation. To illustrate, we re-write equation (1) and drop the vector of covariates




                                                17
and time dummies to simplify notation.



(2)         G it = α 0 + α1 WIC it + α 2 δ it + α 3 (WIC * δ it ) + π it + e it


let δit be a measure of nutritional risk. Common measures of nutritional risk (δit) include

smoking, teen pregnancy and high parity. Let πit be unobserved behaviors related to adverse

birth outcomes such as heavy smoking, illicit drugs and risky sex that increases exposure to

sexually transmitted disease. Estimates based on equation (2) are likely to exacerbate problems

of omitted variables since characteristics of nutritional risk (δit) are likely correlated with πit.

        The use of twins as a measure of δit offers two advantages to previous measures of

nutritional risk. First, multifetal pregnancies increase the risk of anemia and fetal growth

retardation, conditions that should be more sensitive to nutritional supplementation than preterm

birth. Second, twinning is randomly assigned and thus unlike smoking, for example, twinning

should be orthogonal to other risky behaviors (πit). Thus, a comparison of outcomes between

WIC and non-WIC participants all of whom delivered twins should be a more legitimate test of

whether WIC has a greater effect among women at increased nutritional risk.

        One potential weakness in this design is that some women may enroll in WIC after the

diagnosis of multiple pregnancies. Thus, even if twinning is orthogonal to πit prior to diagnosis,

women with stronger preferences for health, higher motivation, or who are more knowledgeable

may seek out WIC in response to their condition, a form of favorable selection. In an attempt to

lessen such selection, we limit the sample to women who initiate prenatal care in the first four

months of pregnancy. As with the analysis of singleton births, the idea is to restrict the analysis

to a sub-sample of women with similar motivation and access as reflected in their prompt


                                                          18
initiation of prenatal care. We do not stratify initially by previous live births because of possible

recording errors in the measure of parity among twin deliveries.6

         Another concern is that the exogeneity of twinning will be compromised if multifetal

conceptions resulted from assisted reproductive technologies (ART).                   Women who use ART are

likely to be highly motivated about achieving a healthy birth outcome and may self select into

WIC. Age and year of birth, however, are important correlates of ART and twinning (Ventura

et al. 1999). Eighty-nine percent of women that receive ART in 1996-1997 were 30 years of age

or older and the number of infertility clinics and the use of ART have also grown rapidly over

time (Schieve et al. 2002; Jain, Missmer and Hornstein 2004). To lessen the potential bias from

women who use ART, we re-estimate the models for twins and limited the sample to women less

than 30. We also allow the effect of WIC to vary by year since the impact of ART should be

less in the late 1980s and early 1990s.



                                                      Results

Singleton births

         Summary statistics for WIC and non-WIC participants are displayed in Table 2 at three

points in time: 1988-90, the period roughly prior to the Medicaid expansion in New York State,

the years 1994-1996, the years prior to welfare reform and then 1999-2001. Our sample in Table

2 includes only singleton first births to women on Medicaid or on WIC without Medicaid

participation who initiate prenatal care in the first four months of pregnancy.                  Differences in


6
  The birth certificate indicates which twin is the first. If a woman had no previous live births, then parity for the
first twin should be zero and the second twin should have a parity of one. This appears correct for approximately
80 percent of twin deliveries, except in 1994 and 1995 in which it is only true for 20 percent of deliveries. In our
sensitivity analysis we do the following: we assume all twins with the same parity of zero, regardless of which twin
was delivered first, are parity zero. We then combine these with the consistent indications of parity zero and re-
estimate the models for twins whose mothers initiate care early and who have no previous live births.


                                                          19
birth outcomes by WIC participation are qualitatively consistent with the literature between

1988-1990, but of a smaller magnitude. There are statistically significant differences in mean

birth weight (28 grams), low birth weight (1.3 percentage points), preterm birth (1.8 percentage

points) and infants that are small for gestational age (0.7 percentage points). The characteristics

of women in WIC between 1988-90 are marginally more favorable with respect to education,

prenatal care visits and illicit drug use than their non-WIC counterparts. By 1994-1996 there are

no meaningful differences in birth outcomes and women in WIC are now more disadvantaged,

albeit modestly, than their non-WIC counterparts with respect to education, marital status and

teen motherhood. These modest disadvantages increase slightly by 1999-2001.

       However, the racial and ethnic distribution of WIC and non-WIC participants change

more substantially over the study period. For instance, the proportion of births to Asians on

Medicaid but not on WIC rises from 3.6 percent in 1988-1990 to 25.8 percent in 1999-2001

while the proportion of Puerto Ricans and Black non-Hispanics falls 9.5 and 17.8 percentage

points respectively. The racial and ethnic composition among WIC participants changes

similarly, but not as dramatically. These shifts would appear responsible in part for the

narrowing of birth outcomes between WIC and non-WIC participants as displayed in Figure 1,

since Asians and other Hispanics have lower rates of adverse birth outcomes than do Puerto

Ricans and non-Hispanic Blacks. Thus Besharov and Germanis were correct that the Medicaid

eligibility expansions altered the distribution of characteristics among WIC and non-WIC

participants in New York City. Yet dichotomous controls for race and ethnicity might not

adequately control for the myriad of differences among these groups and their possible

interactions with observed characteristics.   This is a major reason why we stratify our analyses

by race, ethnicity and nativity.




                                                 20
Multivariate analysis

       In order to provide a point of comparison with previous research, we start our analysis

with a consideration of the relationship between WIC and birth weight. We also explore how the

use of one of our main sub-samples of interest (first time mothers with singleton births who

initiated prenatal care early) may influence these results.

       The first column of Table 3 presents mean differences in birth weight between WIC and

non-WIC Medicaid participants with singleton births unadjusted for any covariates as shown in

Table 3. We then show the estimates of α1 in equation (1) followed by estimates of the

interaction between WIC and the year dummies. The last two columns in Table 3 display

estimates for the sub-sample of women who initiate prenatal care early and who have no

previous live births. The unadjusted difference in mean birth weight between WIC and non-WIC

participants is 46 grams over the 14 years of the sample. After adjustment, mean differences fall

by 44 percent to 25.9 grams. However, among women who initiate care early, mean differences

are smaller still at 18.0 grams, and if we restrict the analysis to those who begin care early and

who have had no previous live births, and thus no experience with WIC, adjusted mean

differences fall to 10.5 grams.

        The same pattern persists across specifications when we allow average treatment effects

to vary by year. The adjusted estimate for 1988 among all women, 55 grams, is broadly

consistent with the literature (Devaney, Bilheimer and Schore 1992). Other researchers have

also found that average treatment effects are smaller for women who enrolled in WIC earlier in

pregnancy (Devaney, Bilheimer and Schore 1992; Gordon and Nelson 1996).

       One interpretation of the results in Table 3 is that the treatment effects associated with

WIC are small or inconsequential among men who begin care early and who have no previous




                                                 21
live births. These women are arguably the most homogenous group available from these data

and thus, provide the least contaminated test of WIC. An alternative interpretation is that women

who present for prenatal care early in pregnancy are the least likely to need nutritional

supplementation and thus the gains to WIC are expected to be less. The diminution of effects

over time, however, regardless of the sample, suggests that problems of omitted variables persist.

As demonstrated in Table 2 there has been a significant change in the composition of women

both on Medicaid and WIC. And despite the inclusion of controls for race and ethnicity, there

could be important interaction effects for which we do not account. We turn, therefore, to the

next set of analyses in which we stratify by race, ethnicity and nativity.

       Table 4 presents regression estimates of equation (1 ) for all women on WIC or Medicaid,

who initiated prenatal care early and who had no previous live births. There are six birth

outcomes. The first three pertain to various measures of birth weight; the second set contains

proxies for fetal growth, outcomes that we contend are more appropriate for assessing the effect

of nutritional supplementation and counseling. As before, we first show estimates for all years

and then estimates from the interaction of WIC and year.

       There is modest evidence at best of an association between WIC and measures related to

birth weight. Moreover, the statistically significant results that do exist are limited to the late

1980s and early 1990s. There is little association between WIC and measures of fetal growth.

For instance, the coefficients on WIC in the regression of birth weight adjusted for gestational

age are either small and statistically insignificant or they have the wrong sign. In other words,

the positive association between WIC and birth weight reflects prolonged gestation. The same

point is made if we compare estimates from the regression of low birth weight on WIC with the

regression estimates from term low birth weight on WIC. In the few years in which there is a




                                                  22
significant association between WIC and low birth weight, there is no equivalent relationship for

term low birth weight. The association between WIC and low birth weight, therefore, is driven

by the correlation between WIC and preterm birth, an association for which there is little clinical

support. The third measure of fetal growth pertains to infants born small for gestational age

(SGA). The coefficient on WIC averaged across all years has the wrong sign (0.003) and is

statistically insignificant.

         To further explore the question of omitted variables bias, we re-run the regressions in

Table 4 for two subgroups: US-born non-Hispanic blacks and foreign-born Hispanics. One

objective is to lessen heterogeneity due to the changing composition of WIC participants over

time. In addition, the two groups had very different exposure to crack cocaine. Numerous

studies of prenatal cocaine use have documented much higher prevalence among blacks than

Hispanics and among US-born as compared to foreign-born women.7 Figure 3 shows a similar

pattern. If differential exposure to cocaine in the early years of our study period is driving the

results, we would expect to see larger differences in birth outcomes by WIC for US-born Blacks

than for all women. The opposite should occur among foreign-born Hispanics.

         Regression estimates for US-born Blacks and foreign-born Hispanics are shown in Tables

5 and 6, respectively. Again the sample pertains to only Medicaid or WIC recipients who initiate

prenatal care in the first four months of pregnancy and who have no previous live births. For

US-born Blacks there are large and statistically significant differences in rates of low birth

weight in 1988-1991 by WIC (Table 5). On average, WIC participants are 2.7 percentage points

less likely to experience a low birth weight birth over this period. After 1991, the average

7
  In the largest prevalence study of prenatal exposure to illicit substances ever undertaken, researchers in California
tested the urine of almost 30,000 mothers at delivery in 1992. Seven and a half percent of all blacks tested positive
for cocaine whereas only 0.5 percent of Hispanics. Important differences by nativity have also been demonstrated.




                                                          23
difference falls and in only three of the 10 subsequent years are differences statistically

significant. Importantly, however, there are few statistically significant differences in fetal

growth between WIC and non-WIC participants. A comparison of the treatment effects between

WIC and low birth weight with those of WIC and term low birth weight again suggests that the

association between WIC and low birth weight reflects primarily an association between WIC

and preterm birth.

        The results for foreign-born Hispanics provide an important point of contrast to those of

US-born Blacks. As shown in Table 6 there is only one statistically significant coefficient with

the expected sign out of a possible set of 84. Nor is the result due to a lack of power. Few of

the coefficients are of a clinically meaningful magnitude.

        We draw two tentative conclusions from this exercise. First, if we lessen confounding

from compositional changes in WIC participants by looking within race, ethnicity and nativity,

we find little evidence of any substantive association between prenatal WIC participation and

fetal growth over the study period. Second, there are relatively large differences in low birth

weight between WIC and non-WIC participants among US-born Blacks but not among foreign-

born Hispanics.      Moreover, the differences are largely concentrated between 1988-1992. The

pattern of results is consistent with the interpretation that unobserved heterogeneity related to

crack-cocaine epidemic, and not treatment effects associated with WIC, is the most plausible

explanation for the association between WIC and low birth weight. This is difficult to prove,

since information on exposure is undoubtedly underreported on birth certificates. Nevertheless,

relative differences in exposure to cocaine and heroin by race, ethnicity and nativity as shown in




In a prevalence study in New York in 1988, 24 percent of US-born Blacks but only 4 percent of foreign-born blacks
tested positive for cocaine at delivery (authors’ calculations based on figures in McCalla et al. 1991).

Figures 3 and 4 and from rigorous studies of prenatal exposure (Vega et al. 1993) are consistent

with this interpretation.



Analysis of Twins

        The notion that WIC should have a greater impact among women at greater nutritional

risk remains an important rationale for the existence of supplemental nutrition and nutritional

counseling. In this section we present results of the association between WIC and birth

outcomes for a sample of twins. As before, the sample is limited to all women on WIC and or

Medicaid who initiated prenatal care in the first four months of pregnancy. Summary statistics

by WIC are presented in Appendix I, Table IA. As is immediately apparent, the rate of adverse

birth outcomes is much greater among twins than singletons. Fifty-seven percent of twins not on

WIC are low birth weight as compared to 52 percent for those on WIC in 1988-90.       By 1999-

01, differences in low birth by WIC have reversed.    The same is true for SGA.    Note that we

include two measures of SGA. The first uses a singleton norm (SGA-S) and the other uses

norms for all US born twins (SAG-T) in 1995 (Alexander et al. 1998).8

        As with singletons, the composition of women on Medicaid and or WIC who delivered

twins changed over the sample period. By 1999-2001 WIC and non-WIC participants have more

education, more prenatal care visits, smoke less and are more likely to be foreign-born than their

counterparts in 1988-1990. However, the improvements are relatively greater among non-WIC

participants.

        In Table 7 we show adjusted mean differences in birth outcomes by WIC for the sample

of twins obtained from the estimation of equation (1).   We present estimates for the entire 14-




                                                25
year period and then separately by various years. As before, we analyze three samples: all

women, US-born Blacks and foreign-born Hispanics. The pattern of results for all women and

foreign-born Hispanics largely reflects those of singletons. We show a modest association

between WIC participation and infants that are small for gestational age among all women, but

no association with birth weight adjusted for gestation or term low birth weight.                    There is no

association between WIC and fetal growth among foreign-born Hispanics.                         For US-born

Blacks, we find that WIC is associated with an increase of 55 grams in birth weight adjusted for

gestation and a decline of 3.9 percentage points in the rate of SGA (p<.01). The effects are

concentrated in the 1993-1997 period.

          We next allow estimates to vary by the age of the mother (Table 8). We are concerned

that estimates for older women may be contaminated by self-selection associated with assisted

reproductive technologies. A notable finding is that WIC participation is related to birth weight

adjusted for gestational age and term low birth weight among US-born Blacks 24 years of age or

less. For US-born Blacks 30 years of age or older, the pattern of results across the fetal growth

outcomes is less consistent with an effect of WIC. There is little evidence that WIC is effective

among all women and the subgroup of foreign-born Hispanics. As a further check of the results,

we limited the sample to first birth twins based on our algorithm described earlier and re-

estimated the results in Tables 7 and 8. The results for young black women become somewhat

stronger (available upon request). Overall, the exercise based on twins suggests that the

association between WIC and fetal growth is limited to US-born black women less than 25 years

of age.

Specification checks

         We have included in our analyses the sub-sample of women who participated in WIC but

who were not on Medicaid. We are concerned that women on WIC but not on Medicaid may

differ in unobserved ways that are associated with birth outcomes, especially before 1990 when

income eligibility thresholds for WIC were higher than Medicaid. We dropped these women,

and re-estimated the models in Table 4-6. The results changed inconsequentially (available

upon request).

         Another limitation of the analysis to this point has been the omission of information on

pre-pregnancy weight and maternal weight gain during pregnancy.        As noted previously, there

is a large proportion of missing data for these variables in the early and middle years of the study

period. Reporting improves significantly after 1998 (see Table 2). Thus, we re-estimated

equation (1) the years 1999-2001 with pre-pregnancy weight included. We continue to find no

association between WIC and fetal growth for all women including US-born Blacks with and

without pre-pregnancy weight included. We also regressed maternal weight gain during

pregnancy and net weight gain on WIC and pregnancy weight. The coefficient on WIC

generally had the wrong sign (negative) and was relatively small in magnitude (less than half a

pound). The results for weight gain are consistent with the lack of any meaningful association

between WIC and fetal growth among singletons.9

                                           Conclusion

       We use New York City birth certificates from 1988 to 2001 to analyze the association

between prenatal participation in WIC and birth outcomes. If we limit the analysis to the years

1988-1990, our results are consistent with much of the literature. We find that WIC participants

have lower rates of low birth weight and greater mean birth weights than non-participants.

However, upon further analysis we find that differences in birth outcomes between WIC and

non-WIC participants are not uniform across race and ethnicity, pertained primarily to

differences in preterm birth and not fetal growth, and become inconsequential and statistically

insignificant over time. Moreover, with the exception of US-born Blacks less than 25 years of

age, we find no meaningful association between WIC and fetal growth among twins despite their

elevated risk of anemia and adverse birth outcomes. We conclude that participation in WIC has

had a minimal impact on infant health in the City over the past 14 years.

       We speculate that the association found between 1988 and 1990, especially for US-born

Blacks, resulted from unobserved heterogeneity related to differential rates of exposure to crack

cocaine between WIC and non-WIC participants. As evidence, we show that exposure to

cocaine and heroin was much greater among US-born Blacks than foreign-born Hispanics as

recorded on New York City birth certificates. Although the birth certificate likely underreports

exposure, relative differences by race and ethnicity are consistent with more rigorous studies of

prenatal cocaine use. Moreover, differences in low birth weight by WIC among blacks

diminished overtime as did reports of exposure to cocaine and heroin. Second, there are no birth

weight differences by WIC between 1988 and 1991 among foreign-born Hispanics, a result

consistent with their minimum exposure. Third, the convergence in rates of low birth weight

between WIC and non-WIC participants results from a substantial decline among non-WIC

participants, which is again consistent with the declining prenatal exposure to cocaine.

       We anticipate that many will question the generalizability of our results, since they

pertain to one city, albeit the most populous in the nation and one with an exceedingly large

caseload of WIC participants. However, our results are quite consistent with the literature with

respect to the generally weak association between WIC and fetal growth. This includes the

recent study by Bitler and Currie (forthcoming) based on PRAMS in 19 states, as well as

Gordon and Nelson’s (1995) national analysis of WIC using the NMIHS. We emphasize the

results for fetal growth because the link between nutritional supplementation and preterm birth in

a developed country such as the US appears implausible given the lack of any effective

interventions for preterm birth. Indeed, the seminal work on the Dutch famine is instructive.

Despite dramatic nutritional deprivation relative to that which exists in the US today, there was

no increase in preterm birth, but a large decrease in birth weight adjusted for gestation.

       Our analysis was unique in that we had sufficient observations to stratify analyses by

race, ethnicity, nativity, parity as well as the timing of prenatal care initiation. We believe this

goes a long way towards lessening unobserved heterogeneity, which may explain differences

between our results and those of others. However, by limiting the analysis to women with no

previous live births and who initiate prenatal care early, we may have eliminated participants

who were at greater nutritional risk and who might have benefited from WIC. Our response was

to undertake a separate analysis of twins, since multifetal pregnancies are at greater nutritional

risk than single gestations and yet twinning is more plausibly exogenous than are other risk

factors such as late prenatal care, smoking and teen pregnancy. We believe that the analysis of

twins is a meaningful contribution to the literature on WIC.




                                                  29
       Finally, we want to emphasize that women and infants represent roughly half of all WIC

participants and that birth outcomes are only one outcome of interest. The fact that many

women participate in WIC over multiple pregnancies implies a continuity that may have

important pediatric benefits. Moreover, the lack of an association between prenatal WIC

participation and adverse birth outcomes should be seen as a challenge to find more effective

interventions such as smoking cessation programs, than as a reason to withdraw from the

struggle to understand and ameliorate the high rate of low birth weight among poor and near-

poor women in the US.

 All models include dummy variables for race/ethnicity (6), marital status (1), parity (2), mother’s education (4), mother’s age (3), heroin or cocaine
use (2), smoking (1), health center districts (29) and years (13). The six birth outcomes are mean birth weight, a dichotomous indicator of birth
weight less than 2500 grams (LBW) or less than 1500 grams (VLBW), mean birth weight adjusted for gestational age, a dichotomous indicator for
infants that are small for gestational age (SGA), and a dichotomous indicator for low birth weight births born after 36 weeks gestation (Term
LBW). All estimates are obtained by ordinary least squares with robust standard errors.

 All models include dummy variables for race/ethnicity (6), nativity (2), marital status (1), parity (2), mother’s education (4), mother’s age
(3), heroin or cocaine use (2) and smoking (1), health center district (29) and years (13). The six birth outcomes are mean birth weight, a
dichotomous indicator of birth weight less than 2500 grams (LBW) or less than 1500 grams (VLBW), mean birth weight adjusted for
gestational age, a dichotomous indicator for infants that are small for gestational age (SGA), and a dichotomous indicator for low birth
weight births born after 36 weeks gestation (Term LBW). All estimates are obtained by ordinary least squares with robust standard errors.

                  Appendix II – Instrumental Variables and Propensity Score Estimates

                  We can write our IV model as follows:



                                                     ˆ
                  (1a)             G ijt = α 0 + α1 WˆIC ijt + x' ijt β + ∑ yrt + ∑ HD j +e jit



                  (2a)             WIC ijt = θ 0 + x' ijt γ + ∑ yrt + ∑ HD j + ϕWIˆC ijt +v jit


                  (3a)             WICijt = φ 0 + x' ijt λ + ∑ yrt + ∑ HD j + ∑ ( yrt * HD j ) +v jit


Continue with the same notation from equation (1) in the text. The new variables, HDj, are

indicators of the woman’s health district of residence. New York City is divided into 30 health

districts. Our instruments are interactions of year and district (equation 3a). The year dummy

pertains to New York State’s Medicaid eligibility expansion, which became effective on January

1, 1990. The expansion increased the income eligibility threshold for pregnant women from

approximately 100 to 185 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL). Importantly, there was no

change in the eligibility criteria for WIC. The income eligibility threshold for WIC was 185

percent of the FPL before and after the Medicaid expansions.10 However, as more pregnant

women received Medicaid, more were made aware of complementary social services (Joyce

1999). As a result, the expansion in Medicaid appears to have generated a large increase in

WIC enrollment. Figure 1A (below) shows the percent of births to women on Medicaid and

WIC as well as the percent of births to women on WIC but not Medicaid. As is evident, almost



10
  Although income eligibility thresholds are similar, Medicaid’s is actually more generous since it refers to net
income whereas WIC eligibility is based on gross income.
all the increase in WIC has occurred among women on Medicaid. The percent of births to

women on WIC but not Medicaid has remained relatively flat over the entire period.

        The second assumption underlying our instrument is that take-up in Medicaid varied with

the social service infrastructure of the district. We lack data on the social service infrastructure

by health district. As an alternative, we use health district dummies to proxy time-invariant

differences between districts. What is clear, however, is that uptake in WIC varied directly with

the uptake in Medicaid. As evidence, we regressed the change in the proportion of births on WIC

(∆%WIC) by health district on the change in the proportion of births on Medicaid (∆%MED)

between 1988-89 and 1991-92 (n=30). The coefficient on ∆%MED was 0.85 with a t-ratio of

3.62. Thus, every one-percentage-point increase in the proportion of women on Medicaid in a

health district is associated with a .85 percentage point increase in WIC participation. Thus,

New York State’s Medicaid eligibility expansion for pregnant women appears to have resulted in

a plausibly exogenous increase in prenatal WIC enrollment.

        The other less typical aspect of the model in equation (1a)-(3a) is that we use a generated

instrument to predict WIC participation instead of the actual instruments. Specifically, we

estimate equation (3a) by a probit, predict WIC participation for each individual, and use the

predicted values as an instrument for actual participation in equation (2a). The advantage is that

the asymptotic properties with the generated instrument are arguably more robust and equation

(4) allows for the binary nature of the endogenous variable (Wooldridge 2002).11

        Finally, we restrict the instrumental variables analysis to births to women on Medicaid

between 1988 and 1992. Our purpose is to limit the uptake in WIC to the years in which the

change in Medicaid enrollment is arguably more exogenous. We drop women in WIC but not

11
  Loosely, we can ignore the fact that predicted WIC in equation (1a) is based on estimated parameters in equation
(2a). Moreover, we also do not need the correct functional form for equation (3a) for consistency.
Medicaid because we don’t want to confound the two changes. We interpret the instrumental

variables estimate as a local average treatment effect (LATE). As such, the estimated gains

pertain only to women whose participation in WIC was a result of the Medicaid expansions

(Angrist, Imbens and Rubin 1996).



Instrumental Variable Estimates and Propensity Score Matching

       Results from the estimation of equations (1a)-(3a) are displayed in Table 3A. The

sample is limited to the years 1988-1992. The first-stage estimates are displayed in Appendix

2A. In Table 3A, we show estimates of average treatment effects obtained by OLS, propensity

score matching, and IV for all first births to women on Medicaid or WIC who initiated prenatal

care in the first four months of pregnancy. We show the same for the sub-samples of US-born

Blacks and foreign-born Hispanics. Regardless of the estimating method, we find no association

between WIC participation and fetal growth. In all but a few cases, estimates of average

treatment effects obtained by propensity score matching are smaller in absolute value than

estimates obtained by OLS, but the differences are not meaningful. The other noteworthy

finding is the strikingly different results for birth weight and very low birth weight between US-

born Blacks and foreign-born Hispanics. Among US-born Blacks, average treatment effects

more than double when estimated by IV, although only one of the four estimates is statistically

significant (marginally). Nevertheless, a LATE interpretation of the IV estimates suggests that

WIC has a substantial protective effect on birth outcomes among the participants who enrolled as

a result of the Medicaid expansions. The opposite occurs among foreign-born Hispanics: the

IV estimates reverse sign and are relatively large. Indeed, among foreign-born Hispanics, the
IV estimates imply that participation in WIC worsens birth outcomes among those who

participated as a result of the changes in Medicaid.

       We are skeptical that the IV estimates represent causal effects. First, it is unclear why

average treatment effects should vary drastically by race, ethnicity and nativity. All the women

in our sample are relatively poor, few have any education beyond high school and most are

unmarried. Second, the size of the effects among US-born Blacks are an order of magnitude

greater than their OLS counterparts, which is not credible given the literature on prenatal

nutrition and birth outcomes. One interpretation, therefore, is that the IV exacerbates as opposed

to corrects the omitted variable problem. It is not inconceivable that the uptake in Medicaid and

WIC is greatest in the health districts in which the decline in crack-cocaine use is the greatest.

Second, it is difficult to isolate the effect of WIC in the context of the Medicaid eligibility

expansions. Other changes occurred at this time. The State rolled its prenatal care assistance

program (PCAP) into Medicaid. PCAP paid greater reimbursement to providers that offered

augmented prenatal care services. One such service was nutritional counseling in which WIC

enrollment was a measure of compliance. Other services included referrals for substance abuse.

Joyce (1999) presents a more detailed analysis of PCAP in New York City. The upshot is that

there are potentially several initiatives that may be driving the variation in WIC, which renders

interpretation difficult and which undermines exogeneity.

 The sample is limited to women on Medicaid and or WIC who delivered a live birth between 1988 and
1992. PSCORE refers to estimates obtained by propensity score matching based on the nearest neighbor
algorithm (see Becker and Ichino 2002). Note that the following variables are not balanced in the analysis
of all women (Panel A): marital status, high school education, black non-Hispanic See equations (2)-(4)
in the text for a description of the IV model. The list of covariates is described in the footnote to Table 4.
Standard errors in OLS and IV regressions have been adjusted for cluster at the health district level.
