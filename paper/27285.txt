                                           ABSTRACT

We determine the environmental benefit of using electric buses rather than diesel or CNG for
urban transit. For diesel and CNG we calculate air pollution damages by combining emission
rates with damage valuations from the AP3 integrated assessment model and the social cost of
carbon. For electric buses we calculate air pollution damages by combining the damage
valuations with estimates of the marginal increase in emissions from electricity usage. The
environmental benefit is positive on average across all counties in the contiguous U.S. when
comparing electric to either diesel or CNG. The environmental benefit of operating an electric
bus fleet (rather than diesel) is about $65 million per year in Los Angeles and above $10 million
per year in six other MSAs. Including the environmental benefit, we calculate the net present
value (NPV) of bus investment. Relative to diesel, the NPV benefit of an electric bus is positive
in about two thirds of urban counties. Relative to CNG, the NPV benefit is negative in all
counties.

1         Introduction
In the United States, as in many parts of the world, the surface transportation fleet is in
the early stages of electrification. To date, much of the innovation and market penetration
of electric vehicles has occurred in the light-duty vehicle market. Accordingly, research ex-
ploring the relative environmental impacts of internal combustion and electric technology
typically focuses on light-duty vehicles.1 However, cars are only one aspect of the surface
transportation infrastructure that could be electrified. Some city buses, trolleys, and trains
currently rely on overhead power lines or electrified rails. Elon Musk recently unveiled plans
for a Tesla long-haul semi-truck. Broadly based technological change (further advances in
battery technology, wireless charging, and autonomous driving) may open new possibilities
for buses and trains as well as for short-haul delivery, commercial and heavy-duty truck-
ing, and other transportation modes. As alternative technologies develop and mature, the
possibilities for electrification in the transport sector are vast.
        In light of these emerging possibilities for electrification into the transportation sector,
the present analysis examines buses used for mass-transit.2 We compare traditional diesel,
compressed natural gas (CNG), and electric buses. We determine the environmental benefit
of bus electrification by comparing the damages from local air pollution and greenhouse gas
emissions from the electric buses to the corresponding damages from the forgone internal
combustion-powered buses. (Because there are still thousands of older diesel buses in use,
we also demonstrate that any one of the new bus technologies is a vast improvement over the
antiquated models.) We also conduct a net present value (NPV) comparison of new buses
inclusive of capital costs, operations and maintenance expenditures, and external costs due to
pollution damages. We focus on the case of urban buses for three reasons. First, proponents
of mass-transit claim that it is a means to reduce individual vehicle use and hence, total
urban emissions. Our assessment of air pollution damages could affect the merits of this claim
moving forward. Second, buses are relied on heavily in cities where local air pollution causes

     See Tong et al. (2017) for a review of previous studies of air pollution from various alternative fuel buses.
Tong et al. (2017) analyze electric buses but use average damages from electric power plants rather than
marginal damages.



                                                        1
large damages. In this context, identifying the least cost technology, inclusive of external
costs, stands to yield potentially large net benefits per vehicle. Third, this vehicle class lies
at the electrification frontier. Thus, guidance in the form of a comparative policy analysis
between internal combustion buses and electric buses may help states and metropolitan areas
prioritize investment in electrification.
      Conceptually, it is straightforward to calculate the environmental benefit of switching
from natural gas or diesel powered modes of transportation to the substitute electric powered
mode of transportation. One simply compares the damages from emissions from the tailpipe
to the damages from the emissions from the smokestack of the power plant providing energy
to charge the electric vehicle. In practice, there are several difficulties to carrying out this
calculation, some of which have not been satisfactorily addressed by the previous literature.
      First, both electric and conventional transportation produce emissions of a variety of pol-
lutants. A complete assessment must analyze these multiple pollutants. A multipollutant
framework necessitates a modeling apparatus that tracks both local air pollutants and green-
house gases. For local air pollution, we employ the AP3 model (Clay et al., 2019; Holland et
al., 2019) which is an updated version of the AP2 model (Muller, 2014; Holland et al., 2016).
For greenhouse gases, we use the social cost of carbon from the federal government inter-
agency working group meta-analysis (USIAWG, 2016). This distinction among pollution
types raises the second empirical challenge; transportation emissions occur at different loca-
tions. While greenhouse gases have the same effects regardless of their location, the effects
of emissions of local pollutants, e.g., particulate matter, depend on where they are emitted.
Thus, we use AP3 to calculate impacts ($/mile) by county using spatially tailored estimates
of the marginal damage of emissions.3 These values reflect heterogeneity in exposure (e.g.,
whether emissions occur in cities or rural locations) and variation in atmospheric conditions
which dictate the fate and transport of emissions. Crucially, even in a counterfactual simu-
lation comparing conventional buses to electric ones in which use of the vehicle takes place
in the same county, emissions are produced in different locations because the regional power
grid supplies energy for the electric bus, whereas diesel emissions are released from the ve-
hicle itself. This consideration leads to the third challenge: assessing emissions from electric
  3
      See the Appendix for details on AP3.


                                                 2
transportation requires assigning emissions at power plants to electricity use at various lo-
cations. We tackle this problem using a reduced-form regression approach similar to that
in Holland et al. (2018). Specifically, plant-level hourly damages (emissions times damage
valuation) are aggregated across power plants in an interconnection and then regressed on
hourly electricity demand to give the marginal damages from an increase in demand.
       Putting these three pieces together yields the first complete county level comparison of
electric vs non-electric transit buses.4 On average across the counties, electric buses create
less air pollution damages (11 cents/mile) than CNG buses (12 cents/mile) which in turn
create less air pollution damages than diesel buses (15 cents/mile). These averages mask
considerable heterogeneity, however. There are counties in which diesel is cleaner than
electric, and counties in which CNG is cleaner than electric. And there are some counties in
which the benefits of electric buses are quite large (damages are 63 cents/mile less than diesel
in Los Angeles). We also calculate the air pollution benefit at the metropolitan statistical
area (MSA) level rather than the county level. For this analysis, we consider replacing the
entire current fleet (which is essentially a mix of new and old diesel buses) with a brand new
fleet of either electric, diesel, or CNG buses. Comparing a fleet of electric buses to a fleet of
new diesel buses generates annual benefits of $65 million in the Los Angeles MSA and more
than $10 million in six other MSAs. Our final set of calculations determine the NPV benefit
of an investment in an electric bus rather than a non-electric bus. Electric buses are more
expensive to purchase, but tend to have lower ongoing costs. On average, the NPV benefit
of such an investment is positive if the forgone bus is diesel and negative if the forgone bus is
CNG. Again there is significant heterogeneity, but the NPV benefit of electric versus CNG
is negative in all counties.
       Both the transport and the power generation sector face considerable environmental
regulation. In the United States, traditional measures to mitigate pollution from the trans-
portation sector are a mix of technology and performance standards. Most relevant to the
present analysis is the requirement, phased in between 2006 and 2010, that heavy-duty
on road vehicles (inclusive of transit buses) use diesel fuel with a very low sulfur content.
   4
     Previous studies of alternative fuel buses include Cooney et al. (2013), Noel and McCormack (2014), Shi-
razi et al. (2015), Aber (2016), Lajunen and Lipman (2016), Mahmoud et al. (2016), and Tong et al. (2017).



                                                     3
Numerous regulations apply to stationary point sources, including fossil fuel-fired power sta-
tions. These policies required or induced firms to adopt pollution abatement technology and
to use less pollution intensive fuels such as low sulfur coal and natural gas. Hence, both
internal combustion vehicles and, by virtue of extant rules governing emissions from power
stations, electric vehicles face environmental policy constraints. As such, the comparison
between these technologies reflects the current regulatory landscape. Importantly, as new
policies emerge, and enforcement of existing policies changes over time, the outcome of such
a comparison will also change. This is an especially important point considering meaningful
efforts to mitigate future climate change are also likely to affect both sectors.



2         Environmental benefits of electric buses
The environmental benefits to air pollution of bus electrification depend on the damages
from the forgone non-electric bus relative to the damages from the electric bus. Air pollution
damages from non-electric buses come from emissions of a variety of pollutants directly from
the tailpipes of the buses. As described below, we calculate emissions rates (grams per
mile) and then multiply these by location-specific damage valuations ($ per gram) of each
pollutant. Summing across pollutants gives the air pollution damages for a non-electric bus.
Air pollution from electric buses comes from the power plants that generate the electricity
to charge the buses. To assess these damages, we first determine the marginal damages
from consuming a unit of electricity ($ per kWh). Multiplying the marginal damages by the
electricity consumption (kWh per mile) gives the location-specific air pollution damages for
an electric bus.
        For consistency in the comparison between electric and non-electric buses, we utilize data
from the testing protocols at the Altoona testing facility that tests both types of buses.5
The facility tests fuel economy on a test track and tests emissions on a dynamometer for
simulated transit duty cycles.6 The tests are detailed and accurate and are likely to well

     The Altoona testing facility is the Larson Transportation Institute's Bus Research and Testing Center,
located in Altoona, Pennsylvania. This testing center was established in 1989 with funding provided by the
Federal Transit Administration under the the Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance
Act (STURAA; Public Law 100-17) of 1987.

     The facility also tests safety, structural integrity, durability, performance, maintainability, and noise.

represent comparable fuel use and emissions from actual driving of both non-electric and
electric buses.


2.1       Non-electric bus damages

Lowell (2013) aggregates fuel economy and emissions tests from the Altoona facility for a
variety of non-electric buses. The buses met the latest federal emissions standards (last
revised in 2010) and thus are reflective of emissions of newly purchased buses. Table 1 shows
average fuel economy and emissions rates from Lowell (2013) for two types of buses: "Diesel"
and compressed natural gas "CNG" buses. The emissions rates for NOx , PM2.5 , and VOCs
(volatile organic compounds) come directly from the emissions tests while SO2 and CO2
emissions rates are calculated from the fuel economy. The SO2 emissions assume ultra low
sulfur diesel (15 parts per million sulfur) for Diesel and negligible SO2 emissions for CNG.
The CO2 emissions assume 22.38 lbs of CO2 per gallon of diesel fuel. CNG buses have lower
emissions than Diesel for all local pollutants except VOCs. Natural gas has lower carbon
content than diesel fuel, but this advantage is offset by lower fuel economy leading to similar
MPGe and CO2 per mile for CNG and Diesel.
       The environmental benefit of a new electric bus depends on the forgone new non-electric
bus. However, approximately 35 percent of buses cataloged in the 2018 National Transit
Database are 10 years or older.7 To calculate the benefit of replacing these older buses,
we collect data on emissions from the existing bus fleet from the meta analysis in Cooper
et al. (2012). Table 1 shows the "Old Diesel" fuel economy and emissions rates. The SO2
emissions rates are not substantially higher, because we assume the Old Diesel buses also
use low sulfur diesel. However, the NOx emissions are dramatically higher so there will be
substantial benefits from replacing the Old Diesel buses in regions where NOx emissions are
particularly harmful. Of course, these benefits would accrue whether the Old Diesel bus
were replaced by a new non-electric or electric bus.
       Damages depend not only on emissions of each pollutant but on the relative harm of
the various pollutants which may differ by location. For the local pollutants, we use the

buses.

AP3 integrated assessment model to determine the county-specific damage valuations ($ per
gram) for each pollutant (Clay et al. 2019). AP3 uses annual average meteorological data to
map the flow of emissions over space, chemistry to specify how primary pollutants interact
in the atmosphere to create ambient concentrations of secondary pollutants, epidemiology
to map pollution concentrations into increased mortality, and finally economics to assign
dollar values of damages using the value of a statistical life. For CO2 , the damage valuation
is the social cost of carbon (SCC) adjusted to 2017 of $43.50 per ton of CO2 from the US
inter-agency working group meta-analysis (USIAWG, 2016). The county-specific damage
valuation per mile of each bus type is the product of the damage valuation and the emission
rates in Table 1 summed across the five pollutants.
   Figure 1a-1c show the air pollution damages from driving a non-electric bus one mile in
each of the 3109 counties in the contiguous U.S. Figure 1a shows the air pollution damages
from driving a new diesel bus. Damages are largest in counties that contain large urban
areas, and there is significant spatial heterogeneity despite the fact that a large share of the
damages are from CO2 , a global pollutant. Figure 1b shows the air pollution damages from
driving a new CNG bus. CNG buses generally have lower damages than Diesel buses almost
everywhere and also have significant spatial heterogeneity. Figure 1c shows the air pollution
damages from driving an Old Diesel bus. As we would expect from their emission rates,
damages from old diesel buses are quite large almost everywhere.


2.2     Electric bus damages

Our comparable electric bus to the Diesel and CNG buses above is the Proterra Catalyst FC
battery electric bus. Proterra is the largest manufacturer of electric buses in the US, and

this bus used an average of 2.185 kWh per mile in the Altoona test facility in 2018.8 Because
it is expected that electric buses will consume more electricity per mile in very hot and very
cold weather, we apply the temperature correction used by Holland et al. (2016) to adjust
the electricity consumption per mile according to the average monthly temperature in each
county.9 , 10 Using this correction, the average electricity consumption increases to 2.33 kWh
per mile.
       The air pollution damage from bus electricity consumption is the marginal damage from
consuming a unit of electricity ($ per kWh). Following Holland et al. (2018)'s methodology,
we first calculate damages from emissions of the main four pollutants, SO2 , NOx , PM2.5
and CO2 at each power plant in the contiguous U.S for every hour in the year 2017.11
Hourly emissions of SO2 , NOx , and CO2 are reported by the EPA's Continuous Emissions
Monitoring System (CEMS) for approximately 1500 power plants. Hourly emissions of PM2.5
are imputed from the emissions rates in the National Emissions Inventory and from hourly
electricity generation from CEMS. Multiplying emissions by the SCC or by power plant
specific damage valuations per unit of emissions from the AP3 model gives damages for each
hour at each power plant. We then determine marginal damages by regressing total damages
on electricity usage.
       To determine the level of aggregation for the regressions, it is helpful to consider the
structure of the U.S. electricity grid. The grid is divided into three interconnections: East,
West, and Texas. Very little power flows across the interconnection boundaries, and some
studies use the interconnection as the unit of analysis for determining marginal damage
(Holland et al. 2018). Although it is technically feasible for electricity to flow freely within an
   8
      The test procedure is based on simulated driving routes. Two NREL studies analyze Proterra electric
bus use over actual transit routes over longer time frames in southern California (Eudy and Jeffers, 2017)
and Seattle, WA (Eudy and Jeffers, 2018) and find efficiencies of 2.15 to 2.36 kWh per mile. Other buses
tested in the Altoona test facility (and their efficiencies) include: Gillig (2.268 kWh per mile) in 2018; Nova
L920 (2.024 kWh per mile) in 2018; Proterra Cat E2 (2.203 kWh per mile) in 2017; Proterra BE40 (1.70
kWh per mile) in 2015; Proterra BE35 (1.73 kWh per mile) in 2012, BYD K7 (1.36 kWh per mile for a 30
ft. bus) in 2017, and BYD Ebus (1.99 kWh per mile) in 2014.
    9
      The test facility holds temperature constant at 73°. The NREL studies report slightly higher kWh per
mile in Seattle than in southern California, possibly due to temperature differences.
   10
      The temperature correction assumes no penalty at an average daily temperature of 68°. For each month,
the kWh per mile is penalized based on the difference between 68°and the average daily temperature of the
month. We then average across months.
   11
      Holland et al. (2018) document a substantial decline in marginal damages so we focus on their most
recent year.


                                                      8
interconnection, it is likely that congestion in the transmission network would lead marginal
damages to differ across locations within an interconnection at least during some hours of
the day. In response to this, some studies disaggregate electricity usage by North American
Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) regions (Holland et al. 2016) and others drill down
further into NERC sub regions (Sexton et al. 2019). Ideally, we would like to use as small
a geographic region as possible to measure marginal damages. But there is a trade-off.
Due to correlation of electricity usage across NERC regions, and particularly sub-regions,
it is difficult to precisely estimate regression models at these spatial scales (Callaway et al.
Forthcoming). Here we aggregate damages and electricity usage to the interconnection level
and estimate marginal damages for the interconnection.
      Specifically, let Dt be the total damages in the interconnection from emissions in hour
t. This variable is the sum of damages from all four pollutants and all power plants in the
interconnection. The main estimating equation is


                                    Dt = Loadt + mh + t ,                                   (1)


where Loadt is electricity usage in the interconnnection in hour t and mh are month of
sample times hour fixed effects (1 year * 12 months * 24 hours fixed effects). The coefficient
of interest is  , which is the marginal damage from an increase in electricity usage. We
specify units such that marginal damages are in cents per kWh and estimate Newey-West
standard errors using 48 hour lags.12 The regressions are unweighted which assumes an equal
probability of charging the buses across all hours of the year.
      The results from estimating (1) are shown in Table 2. The "Total" column shows the main
results. Marginal damages from electricity consumption range from 2.8 cents per kWh in the
West to 5.3 cents per kWh in the East. These marginal damages are substantial relative to
retail electricity prices.13 The other columns decompose the estimates into marginal damages
from global (CO2 ) and local (PM2.5 , SO2 , NOx ) pollutants by replacing the total damages in
(1) with damages from a single pollutant or a subset of the pollutants. The decomposition

into global versus local pollution shows that global pollutant marginal damages are highest in
the East but are similar across the regions. Local pollutant marginal damages are substantial
in the East with the bulk of the marginal damage from SO2 emissions. The West has the
lowest local pollutant marginal damages primarily due to lower marginal damages from SO2
emissions. Thus the geographic variation in marginal damages of electricity consumption
arises from variation in marginal damages from both global and local pollution.

Regressions include month of sample by hour fixed effects.


    The air pollution damages from driving an electric bus in each county is the product of
the temperature-adjusted electricity consumption per mile and the interconnection-specific
marginal damage per kWh. Figure 1d shows the air pollution damages from driving an
electric bus one mile for each county in the contiguous U.S. There are significant differ-
ences across the interconnections. In particular, damages per mile from electric buses are
substantially lower in the West and Texas than in the East. The figure also illustrates the
electricity consumption penalty from extreme temperatures, which results in higher damages
in northern counties.


2.3     Comparisons and Environmental Benefits

The maps in Figures 1a-1d show the air pollution damages from driving non-electric and
electric buses in each county. Comparing the maps for Diesel and Electric shows that the
environmental benefits of bus electrification relative to diesel are likely to be most significant


                                                     10
in urban areas and in the West and Texas. However, electric buses would result in higher
damages in some counties primarily in the northern Midwest and Plains states. Comparing
the maps for CNG and Electric shows a similar distribution of environmental benefits of bus
electrification relative to CNG. Comparing the maps for Old Diesel and the new buses shows
that there would be substantial environmental benefits from replacing old diesel buses with
any of the new buses.
       Although maps are useful for illustrating the geographic distribution of environmental
benefits, they may not capture the locations where buses are actually used and needed.
Table 3 presents summary statistics for damage and environmental benefits weighted by
estimated bus miles for each county from the US EPA MOVES model.14 The mean damage
for the Diesel bus is $0.151 per mile and ranges from a minimum of $0.106 per mile, which
largely reflects the CO2 damages, to a maximum of $0.696 per mile, which reflects the high
damages of local air pollution in Los Angeles. To put these damages in context, multiplying
by the MPGe implies a mean damage of $0.70 per gallon with a range from $0.50 to $3.30
per gallon. Mean damage from CNG buses ($0.123 per mile) is lower than Diesel and the
range of damages is smaller reflecting the lower damages from local pollutants particularly
NOx and SO2 . The Old Diesel bus is about seven times more damaging than the other bus
types and has a maximum damage of a remarkable ten dollars per mile. The Electric bus has
the lowest mean damage ($0.112 per mile) and the narrowest range of damages suggesting
the potential for environmental benefits from bus electrification.
       Although electric buses have lower damages on average, this does not imply that they
would yield environmental benefits in each county. The bottom rows of Table 3 show sum-
mary statistics of the environmental benefit (the difference in damages) of an electric bus
relative to the non-electric alternatives. On average electric buses generate a positive en-
vironmental benefit relative to both diesel ($0.039) and CNG ($0.011 per mile). In a few
counties, e.g., Los Angeles county, this benefit is quite large (up to 63 cents per mile). A few
counties would see negative environmental benefits from bus electrification, but the environ-
mental benefit relative to Diesel is positive in the majority of counties (the 18th percentile
  14
    The MOVES model estimates VMT for each US county for a variety of vehicle categories. The bus miles
category includes both transit and school buses.

is positive) and relative to CNG is positive in a substantial minority of counties (the 57th
percentile is positive). Relative to Old Diesel, the environmental benefit of electrification is
substantial and positive in all counties emphasizing again the importance of replacing older
diesel buses.
   To understand these environmental benefits, Table 4 decomposes the air pollution dam-
ages from each bus into damages from CO2 , SO2 , and other local pollutants. Electric buses
cause less damage from CO2 than any other bus type, but they cause more damage from
SO2 than the non-electric buses. This is due to sulfur emissions from coal-fired power plants
and the use of low sulfur diesel in both old and new diesel buses. Even though the electricity
generation from coal-fired plants has decreased in recent years, they still generated about
30% of electricity in the U.S. in 2017.

   Because bus use is concentrated in urban areas, we aggregate damages and environmental
benefit to the MSA and analyze the total fleet of buses within the MSA. Table 5 shows


                                                 12
damages at the MSA level based on estimated fleet bus miles from the MOVES model. The
top twenty MSAs are ranked by the annual benefit, which is the difference between the
damages from an all diesel fleet in the MSA and the damages from an all electric fleet. This
benefit is highest in Los Angeles where air pollution damages from a new diesel bus fleet
would be $71.4 million per year, but the air pollution damages from a new electric bus fleet
would be only $6.4 million, which yields an annual benefit of $65 million. This large benefit
is driven by the large benefit per mile of $0.634, which is the largest in the country. Other
MSAs in the West also have large benefits per mile, e.g., Santa Ana, CA and San Diego, CA,
and sixteen MSAs have benefits which exceed $0.10 per mile.15 Cities in the East tend to
have a smaller benefit per mile but can still have substantial annual benefits. For example,
Chicago, IL has a benefit of $0.08 per mile and has an annual benefit of $16 million from
adopting an electric bus fleet relative to a new diesel fleet. For comparison, the table also
reports damages from running the MSA's bus fleet entirely as old diesel buses and as new
CNG buses. There are substantial damages from old diesel and hence substantial benefits
from replacing pre-2010 buses. CNG buses are cleaner than Diesel in all MSAs, but, with
the exception of Warren, MI, a fleet of CNG buses has higher damages than a fleet of electric
buses for each MSA in Table 5.16



3      Net Present Value Benefit of Bus Electrification
In the previous section, we compared the air pollution damages from an electric bus and
a forgone non-electric bus. The forgone bus, the bus which would have been purchased
instead of the electric bus, would be determined by economic considerations: how much each
bus costs to purchase and operate. Importantly, decision makers may or may not consider
the external costs from air pollution in their decisions. To illustrate the cost calculations,
we consider the investment decision for a new bus of each type. Because the bus types
have different purchase costs and ongoing operating costs, we compare the net present value

where Pb is the initial purchase price of the bus, Operbi is the annual operating costs, Extbi
is annual externality cost, r is the discount rate, and            is the operating lifetime of the bus.
The annual operating cost, Operbi depends on mileage, m, maintenance costs, cb , and fuel
costs which vary by location.18 The externality cost, which also varies by location, is bi m
where bi is the damage per mile in location i as calculated in Section 2.
       The parameters for the net present value calculations are summarized in Table 6. For
parameters that do not vary by location (not indexed by i), we use the mean value from
different studies for our baseline calculations. In a sensitivity analysis, we analyze high and
low values one standard error above and below the mean values. Electric buses are expected
to have a purchase price premium above diesel of approximately $250,000. However, they are
expected to be considerably cheaper to maintain, with an expected savings of 40 cents per
mile. Relative to diesel, the purchase price premium of CNG buses is considerably smaller
than that of electric buses. The expected lifetime of a bus, , is assumed to be 12 years with
an expected usage, m, of 35,605 miles per year. The consumption of electricity for electric
buses, ei , varies by county due to the temperature correction. The prices of natural gas,
electricity, and diesel fuels vary by state, and the values for these prices are equal to the
average prices over the period from 2017-2019.

county. The table first breaks out the net present value into the purchase cost and the

The top rows of the table show the results for the three different bus types and the bottom
two rows show the NPV benefit of the Electric bus (i.e., the net present value reduction in
costs from the electric bus) relative to the Diesel or CNG bus. Relative to Diesel, the table
highlights the substantially higher purchase cost (about $250,000 higher) of the electric bus
as well as the substantially lower operating and damage costs (about $25,000 lower per year).
Because the upfront cost must be offset by gains over time, the NPV benefit of the Electric
bus depends on the discount rate. At a high discount rate, the NPV benefit of the Electric
bus is negative (indicating that the Diesel bus has lower overall costs) but at lower discount
rates the NPV benefit of the Electric bus is positive. Relative to CNG, the Electric bus
again has a higher purchase cost but lower operating costs. However, in this case the mean
NPV benefit of the electric bus is never positive even at a very low discount rate. In fact,
the NPV Benefit is negative in every county.

   The county-level NPV benefits of an Electric bus are illustrated in Figure 2a and 2b for
r = 0.03. Relative to Diesel, the mean NPV benefit is $8,000. However the map in Figure 2a
shows the distribution of this NPV benefit across counties. There are a substantial number
of counties with large, positive NPV benefits. Due to the combination of large damages
from diesel buses and the clean electricity grid, the NPV benefit is over $200,000 per bus
in Los Angeles. However, there are also a substantial number of counties with negative
NPV benefits, particularly in the upper Midwest and New England. This emphasizes the

significant spatial heterogeneity in the NPV benefit of the Electric bus relative to the Diesel
bus.
   Relative to CNG, the mean NPV benefit of the Electric bus is negative (-$59,900). The
map in Figure 2b shows heterogeneity in this NPV benefit but also shows that it is negative
in each county. Although the Electric bus has a positive environmental benefit relative to the
CNG bus and lower expected maintenance costs, the large upfront purchase price premium
of the electric bus leads to the negative NPV benefit.
   The types of transit buses we are considering are typically used in urban areas. So it is
useful to trim the data shown in Figure 2a and 2b to exclude non-urban counties. A kernel
density plot for the distribution of the NPV Benefit of the Electric bus relative to Diesel
across urban counties is shown in the blue line in Figure 3a. The NPV Benefit is positive
in about two thirds of urban counties. The distribution is skewed to the right because of
a small number of counties, like Los Angeles, in which the NPV Benefit is very large. A
similar plot for the distribution of the NPV Benefit relative to CNG is shown by the blue
line in Figure 3b. The NPV Benefit is negative everywhere (i.e., CNG buses have lower costs
in all urban counties) and the distribution is skewed to the left.
   The NPV formula fully captures all of the costs to society, including the external costs
due to damages from air pollution. However, decision makers may not fully incorporate all
the relevant costs in their decisions. For example, the decision maker may ignore external
costs or may include some external costs but ignore others. The effect on the NPV Benefit of

the Electric bus is not entirely obvious since ignoring external costs affects the costs of both
the Electric bus and the alternative non-electric bus. To illustrate, we show kernel densities
across urban counties of the NPV Benefit of the Electric bus when decision makers include
or ignore some external costs.
   The red dashed lines in Figure 3a and 3b show the kernel densities for the case where the
decision maker ignores all external costs. Relative to Diesel, the distribution of NPV Benefit
is positive in about one third of urban counties, and the distribution tightens considerably
because the decision maker is ignoring the substantial environmental benefits in some urban
counties, e.g., Los Angeles county. Relative to CNG, ignoring external costs shifts the density
left, i.e., the NPV benefit is reduced by ignoring external costs. However, the shift is more
modest since the environmental benefit is not as large especially on the right tail.
   Figures 3c and 3d show the kernel densities for three additional NPV Benefit calculations,
each reflecting a different perspective on the relevance of external costs to the decision maker.
The green dashed line shows the NPV Benefit in which only the global damages from CO2
are considered. Many popular discussions of the benefits of electrification only focus on
these damages, ignoring the damages from local pollution. Relative to Diesel, accounting for
only global damages leads to a NPV Benefit that has a narrower distribution because the
right tail of benefits from local damages is ignored. Relative to CNG, accounting for only
global damages does not shift the NPV Benefit substantially due to the lesser importance
of local damages. Conversely, incorporating only local damages in the NPV calculation and
ignoring global damages (the dashed teal lines) shifts the distribution to the left, such that
the NPV Benefit relative to Diesel is negative in the majority of urban counties and the NPV
Benefit relative to CNG is even more negative. Finally, our local damages include damages
which may occur far from the source of the pollution. For example, our calculations of SO2
damages include damages that occur in the county where the bus is driven as well as in all
other counties to which the pollution is carried by air currents. Native damages are defined
by Holland et al. (2016) as only those local damages that accrue to the county where the bus
is driven. These damages may be the most politically relevant for a local decision maker.
Accounting for only native damages (the dotted gray lines in Figures 3c and 3d) shows that
the NPV Benefit relative to Diesel or CNG is higher than when only local damages are


                                               20
considered, but not as high as when only global damages only are considered. Overall, the
NPV Benefits of bus electrification tend to be highest when including all damages from both
local and global pollutants.
   We conclude this section with a sensitivity analysis of the NPV Benefits. Seven parame-
ters in Table 6 do not depend on location: the miles driven per year: m; the purchase price of
the diesel, CNG, and electric buses: Pd , Pc and Pe ; and the annual maintenance costs of the
diesel, CNG, and electric buses: cd , cc , and ce . For each of these parameters, we determine a
high and low value (one standard error above and below the average value). The results of
using the high and low values for each variable, keeping the other variables at baseline, are
shown in Table 8. First consider the NPV Benefit of the Electric bus relative to Diesel in
Panel A. Because the Electric bus has a higher purchase price but lower operating costs, the
NPV Benefit shifts left or right depending on how the parameter affects the purchase price
or operating costs. For example, higher annual miles, m, increases the NPV Benefit because
the Electric bus has lower operating cost per mile. Similarly, lower electric bus maintenance
costs or higher diesel bus maintenance costs increase the NPV Benefit because of the lower
relative operating costs. On the other hand, a lower Electric bus purchase price or a higher
Diesel bus purchase price increases the NPV Benefit by making the relative purchase price
lower. Across the range of relevant parameters, favorable parameters can make the NPV
Benefit positive for all counties, but even unfavorable parameters do not make the NPV
Benefit negative for all counties.
   Relative to CNG buses (Panel B), electric buses again have a purchase price disadvantage
but a (smaller) operating costs advantage. Compared to the baseline mean NPV Benefit
of -$59,900, higher annual miles, a higher CNG bus purchase price, a lower electric bus
purchase price, higher CNG bus maintenance costs, and lower electric bus maintenance costs
all increase (shift right) the NPV Benefit of an electric bus. Across the range of relevant
parameters, favorable parameters can make the NPV Benefit positive in some counties and
can make the mean NPV Benefit positive, but they do not make the NPV Benefit positive
in all counties.
   Up to now, we have assumed in the NPV calculations that marginal damages from
electricity generation stay constant over the lifetime of the bus. But Holland et al. (2018)


                                              21
document that marginal damages from electricity generation have decreased approximately
five percent per year over the last decade in the East interconnection. Assuming that this
rate of decline continues into the future in all interconnections gives the results in the last
row of Panel A and B of Table 8. The Cleaner Future Grid gives a modest increase in the
NPV Benefit of electric buses relative to both Diesel and CNG.

    Taken as a whole, the results in this section show that there is considerable heterogeneity
in the NPV benefit of the three types of buses. It is critical that decision makers evaluate
local costs and environmental conditions when evaluating the lowest cost investment.



4     Conclusion and Policy Implications
Advances in electric motors, battery technology, wireless charging, and autonomous driving
open new possibilities for electrification of transportation. Whether market forces can result
in efficient electrification depends on the extent to which pollution can be adequately regu-
lated. Understanding the benefits and costs of regulation is thus crucial to assessing public
policy toward electrification.
    Our location-specific calculations of the environmental benefits of bus electrification show
positive benefits to electrification on average relative to each of the three alternatives. Rel-
ative to old diesel buses, which are quite dirty, the environmental benefit of electrification is
positive everywhere and can be quite large. When compared to new diesel or CNG buses, the
average of the per-mile benefit of an electric bus is $0.04 and $0.01, respectively. However,
the average benefit masks significant spatial heterogeneity across counties. At one extreme,
the electric buses produces $0.03 greater damage per mile than either a diesel or CNG bus.
At the other extreme, the electric bus yields large benefits of $0.63 per mile, relative to a
new diesel bus in Los Angeles. The environmental benefit of electrifying the entire bus fleet
in Los Angeles (relative to a new diesel fleet) is $65 million per year. Other MSAs also
have substantial environmental benefits from electrification relative to both diesel and CNG
buses.
    The value of an investment in an electric bus depends not just on the environmental
benefit but also on the economic costs and benefits. Because electric buses are costlier
to purchase but have lower operating and maintenance costs as well as lower environmental
damages, we calculate the net present value (NPV) benefit of an electric bus, i.e., the present
value of the reduced costs of purchasing and operating an electric bus over its lifetime.
Relative to a diesel bus, the average NPV benefit of an electric bus is about $8000 per bus
at a 3% discount rate. This NPV benefit is positive in most counties and is quite substantial


                                               23
in some counties (over $200,000 per bus in Los Angeles). This calculation provides strong
support for bus electrification relative to diesel for much of the country.
   What about CNG buses? While these buses are cleaner than diesel buses on average,
they are dirtier than electric buses on average. On the other hand, their purchase price
premium is considerably smaller than that of electric buses. According to our calculations,
the NPV benefit of an electric bus relative to a CNG bus is negative in every county. This is
evidence in support of CNG bus adoption. However, several caveats should be noted. First,
conversion to an electric or CNG fleet requires substantial investment in either charging or
refueling infrastructure. These costs are not modeled here. Second, as battery technology
improves, the electric bus price premium is likely to decrease, and this can make the NPV
benefit of electrification relative to CNG positive on average. Third, as electricity generation
continues to de-carbonize it is possible that the future environmental benefit of the electric
bus could increase more substantially than indicated by our sensitivity analysis of a changing
grid. A dynamic investment model could better capture these considerations.
   Urban bus systems rely on substantial public support. Ridership fares generally only
cover a proportion of the costs of operating a municipal bus system and the remainder is
primarily made up by a combination of local and federal support. This public support could
be used to encourage adoption of cleaner bus alternatives, and our calculations illustrate
where and what those alternatives are.



Appendix

AP3 Model Details

This paper uses the AP3 integrated assessment model (IAM), (see Clay et al., 2019; Holland
et al., 2018 for recent applications) which is an updated version of the AP2 model (Muller,
2014; Jaramillo and Muller, 2016; Holland et al., 2016). The model links emissions of local
air pollutants to concentrations, population exposure, physical health effects (premature
mortality risk), and monetary damages.




                                              24
   The AP3 model begins by using the 2014 National Emissions Inventory (NEI) which is
the most recent comprehensive inventory of air pollution emissions for the U.S. economy.
AP3 matches reported emissions to the location of release. So-called area source emissions
(vehicles, residences, and small businesses) are allocated to the county in which they are
reported to have occurred. AP3 attributes point source emissions to facility location for
nearly 700 large industrial emission sites (many of which are power stations). Discharges
from other point sources are allocated to the county in which the NEI reports that they
occurred.
   A reduced complexity air quality model then links emissions to annual average concen-
trations. Crucially, for releases of nitrogen oxides (NOx ), sulfur dioxide (SO2 ), ammonia
(NH3), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), AP3 models their contribution to ambi-
ent fine particulate matter (PM2.5 ). AP3 also models the dispersion of primary (emitted)
PM2.5 . Central to the formation of secondary PM2.5 are the processes associated with the
nitrate-sulfate-ammonium equilibrium. While formation of ammonium sulfate is modeled in
the same fashion as in AP2, AP3 employs a new regression-based approach to estimating
the formation of ammonium nitrate from NOx emissions. Specifically, in a series of offline
regression analyses, a polynomial is fitted to the process linking nitrate, free ammonia, along
with controls for temperature and humidity, to ambient ammonium nitrate (which is a con-
stituent of PM2.5). The model is fit to daily predictions from the CAMx chemical transport
model. The resulting fit of PM2.5 predicted by the AP3 model, by major species, is reported
in Sergi et al., (2019).
   Population and mortality rate data is gathered from the U.S. Census and the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention by age-group and county to estimate exposures in 2014.
Then, peer-reviewed concentration-response functions linking exposure to changes in adult
mortality rates are used to estimate the mortality risk consequences of emissions (Krewski et
al., 2009; Lepeule et al., 2012). These studies comprise the most recent updates to the two
most widely used epidemiological studies on the air pollution-mortality linkage in the policy
analysis literature. Changes in mortality risk are valued using the Value of a Statistical Life
(VSL) approach (Viscusi and Aldy, 2013). In this study, we employ the USEPA's preferred
VSL of $7.4 million ($2006) which we inflate to year-2014 USD.


                                              25
   As in prior applications, AP3 is used to calculate the marginal ($/ton) damage from emis-
sions of the five pollutants listed above. This computation is made by county (or source) of
emission. The process of making this tabulation begins by running AP3 with baseline emis-
sions (as reported by the USEPA in the 2014 NEI) to estimate associated baseline damages.
Then, one (U.S. short) ton of emissions of a particular pollutant, perhaps NOx , is added to
reported emissions at a given site. AP3 is used to calculate the change in concentrations,
exposure, physical health effects, and monetary damage. This change, of course, manifests
across many locations receiving pollution. The total marginal damage is the spatial sum
across receptor counties resulting from this additional emission of NOx . Emissions at the
chosen site are reset to baseline, and AP3 moves to the next source and repeats this cal-
culation. This algorithm is repeated over all sources and pollutants. This process yields
estimates of the ($/ton) marginal damage for all source locations and pollutants covered by
AP3.

Age of Buses in the Fleet

From data in the National Transit Database (2018), we determined the age distribution of
transit buses. There are 53,798 buses owned by entities in the database, and, of this total,
18491 are 10 years or older. The geographic distribution of these 10 years or older buses is
shown in Figure A.19 Large urban areas throughout the country have significant numbers of
these old buses.




                                                                                           Old

   The National Transit Database delineates buses by city name. We use data from https://simplemaps.
com/data/us-cities to merge the city names into counties.

Diesel Fuel Costs

The Energy Information Administration (EIA 2020a) reports diesel fuel costs by PADD
regions (New England, Central Atlantic, East Coast, Midwest, Gulf Coast, Rock Mountain,
West Coast, California). The states that comprise a given region have the same color in
Figure B. To determine diesel fuel costs, we first average the monthly prices in each PADD
over 2017-2019. We then take 2019 average monthly state level prices from AAA (2020) and
determine the state level premium above (or below) the average price within a PADD. The
final diesel fuel cost in each state is equal to the average PADD price over 2017-2019 plus
the state level premium minus a state diesel fuel tax exemption for government entities, if
applicable.

Environmental benefit of a fleet swap for all MSAs

In the main text we presented the annual benefit of a complete fleet swap from diesel buses
to electric buses. Table A shows this information for all of the MSAs in the contiguous U.S.
The environmental benefit is greater than one million dollars per year in about 50 MSAs.
The "Old Diesel" column shows that a fleet of old Diesel buses leads to annual damages in
excess of ten million dollars per year in a number of MSAs.
