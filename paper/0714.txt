                Risk Sharing Through Breach of Contract Remedies



                                    ABSTRACT



     This paper examines the sharing of risk under three different remedies

for breach of contract. The risk considered arises from the possibility

that, after a seller and buyer have entered into an agreement for the

exchange of some (not generally available) good, a third party who values

the good more than the original buyer may come along before delivery has

occurred; the seller will want to breach. It is shown that this risk is

optimally allocated by the expectation damage remedy if the seller is

risk neutral and the buyer is risk averse, by the fic performance

remedy if the opposite is true, and by a liquidated damage remedy if

both parties are risk averse. The level of damages under the liquidated

damage remedy is also shown to be bounded by the expectation measure of

damages and a "damage equivalent" to the specific performance remedy.

By means of a numerical example, it is shown that use of the prevailing

remedy for breach of contract——the expectation damage remedy——may plausibly

cause a welfare loss of as much as 20% due to inappropriate risk sharing.

 1.     Introductj_o
        Whenever parties enter into a contract they realize
that circumstances may change and that one of them may want
to breach the contract.    The remedy available against a
breaching party will, of course, influence each pnrtys
decision whether to breach. The remedy will also affect
each party s investment in "rel iance"——expenditures made in
anticipation of performance (e.g., building a warehouse to
store the goods to be delivered). These effects of contract
remedies have been thoroughly examined by Shavell (1980a,
198Db), Rogerson (1980), and others. The remedy for breach
will, as well, allocate the risks among the parties due to
changed circumstances.          This effect,     which   has not been
examined    as systematically    as the   others, is the   subject of
this paper.1

        The risk allocation effects of three contract remedies
will be analyzed in the context of an          example    a buyer and
a seller of a good (not generally available in the market)
who    both know that some third party who values the good       more
than    the original buyer may come along before delivery
occurs. Under the PxjectnUon dnmaqp remedy, if a third—
party   offer materializes and the seller breaches, the buyer
can sue the seller for his lost profits (the parties are
assumedto be firms) . Under the pcific rformance
remedy, the buyer can sue the seller for delivery of the
good.     And under a liqjidated dnmae remedy, the          buyer can
sue the seller for an     amount agreed to by the parties in
                                                                  PAGE L4

advance,    which may exceed the lost profits of the buyer.2
        The conclusions reached in this paper may be easily
summarized.         Under the expectation damage remedy, the buyer
is, by definition, made indifferent between performance and
breach.    Thus, since this remedy insures the buyer against
the risk of nonperformance and leaves the beneficial risk of
selling to the third party entirely on the seller,                    it
optimally allocates the contract risks only when the buyer
is risk averse and the seller is risk neutral.
      In terms of risk allocation, the specific performance
remedy is the mirror image of the expectation damage remedy.
If the higher third—party of for material ies , the buyer will
demand performance in order to resell to the third party.
Thus, the seller's profits do not depend on the possibility
of a thi rd—party offer and the buyer bears this beneficial
risk.      This remedy optimally allocates the contract            risks

only    when the seller is risk averse and the buyer is risk
neutral.
        Before   considering the       risk allocation    effects of a
liquidated damage remedy,           it will   be useful   to reinterpret
the specific     performance remedy. Assume for simplicity that
there is an      upper bound   to    what a third party might offer
for     the good. Then the specific performance remedy is
equivalent to a damage remedy in which the amount paid to
the buyer if breach occurs equals this upper bound——the
seller will always perform.
        A liquidated damage remedy may now be viewed as a
                                                      PAGE 5
compromise between the extremes of the other two remedies.
The  liquidated damage amount can be greater than the
expectation damage award——so that the buyer bears some of
the beneficial risk of a third—party of±er——but less than
the damage equivalent to the specific performance remedy——so
that the seller also bears some of this beneficial risk. It
will   be shown that a liquidated damage agreement optimally
allocates the contract risks when both the buyer and the
seller are risk averse and that the optimal liquidated
damage award is bounded by the expectation measure of
damages and the damage equivalent to specific performance.
A numerical example is also developed to illustrate
concretely how the optimal liquidated damage agreement
varies with the risk aversion of the parties.
       As far as risk sharing is concerned, the preceding
discussion suggests that a liquidated damage remedy should
be the normal remedy if, as I assume, parties are generally
risk averse at least to some extent. In practice, however,
the expectation damage remedy is the normal remedy.3 The
loss of welfare due to inappropriate risk sharing from
relying on the expectation damage remedy rather than a
liquidated damdge remedy (or the specific performance remedy
when the buyer is risk neutral and the seller is risk
averse) is calculated from the numerical example. The loss
ranges in this example from 2% of the value of the contract
(when the buyer is much more risk averse than the seller) to
20% of the value of the contract (when the buyer is risk
                                                                   PAGE 6
 neutral       and the seller is very risk averse).      Reasons why
the expectation damage remedy might still be preferred,
despite the generally superior risk sharing effects of a
liquidated damage remedy, are discussed in a concluding
section of the paper.




2.   The       tic'dei


     The contract        situation described here is the simplest
one imaginable which still allows discussion of the risk
sharing issues.           A   seller and a buyer enter into an
agreement in which the seller promises to produce a good for
delivery to the buyer at some price paid in advance. Both
parties are assumed to know the probability that a third

party will come along and the amount that would be offered.
In the event of breach,  the buyer's remedy is either
expectation damages——the benefit to the buyer if the
contract were completed——or specific              performance or a
liquidated damage payment agreed to by the parties in
advance.   '




     The following       notation will be used:
      utility of the seller (U > 0, Ii"           0, U(0) =   0)
V(.) utility of the buyer        CV' > 0, V" 0)
c     seller's production cost
y     buyer's benefit if contract completed Cy >         c)
k     contract price
p     probability of third—party offer
                                                                             PAGE 7
         amount   of third—party offer (z > y)
          damage payment to buyer if breach occurs
         It is obvious (since z > y) that the first—best outcome
 is for the good to end up in the possession of the third
party if       third—party offer materializes. This will
                the

occur regardless of the remedy used. Thus, the only issue
here is how to bcst allocate the beneficial                          risk of the
third—party offer between the buyer and the seller. 6
       The buyer's expected utility EV is:
(1)        EV         (1—p ) V ( y—I:) +   pV ( —k)

The   first     term reflects the       outcome if the third—party offer
does not      occur,     while    the second term represents the outcome
if the     offer      c1os occur and           the seller      breaches and pays
damages.         (In     the     case of specific performance,                  in

equation (1) is the            "damage oquivalent"——see below.)
      Similarly, the seller's expected utility EU is:
(2)        EU      ( 1—p)U(k—c) +          pU(z+k—c—).
      The optimal contract terms——the contract price and the
damage payment——can be determined by maximizing the                       expected
utility     of the         buyer subject to the              constraint   that the
expected    utility of the            seller equals some constant, say
zero:7

(3)        Maximize EV subject to EU                   0.



      Formulating (3) as a Lagrange multiplier problem, the
first—order conditions                (a unique             interior solution is
assumed) with respect to hand                       are, respectively:
(4)       —( 1—p)Vt (y—k) —         pV'    (3 —k)

whore Xis the Lagrange                        multiplier.          Solving (5)    for Xand
substituting this into (ti)                         leads,    after some simplification,
to:
 6)         V'       y—k )            U   ' ( k—c
                 C            =
            V'(—k)
This condition can be                      given a     familiar interpretation:        the

marginal rates of substitution between the "goods" of
"incomeif Performance occurs" and "income if breach occurs"
must be the same for both parties. The remaining first—
order condition, with respect to A, is of course the
constraint that the seller's expected utility is zero:
(7)   ( 1—p)U(k--c) + pU(z+k—c—)                             0.
Conditions (6) and (7) together determine the optimal damage
payment, *, and the optimal contract price, k*.
     The optimal breach of contract remedy will be said to
be the expectation damage remedy if * y, the specific
performance remedy if *        z  (this is the "damage
equivalent" to specific performance),° and a liquidated
damage remedy if y <                          <

      The             the remedies when at least one of the
             analysis of
parties is risk averse'0 is presented in this section in the
form of three propositions. Since the intuition behind
these results has been                               discussed in the introductory
                                                                                     PAGE 9.
 section, no further comments will be made here about the
 optimal remedies.                 However,      following each proposition,
 there     will     be a brief discussion of the optimal contract
 price.

    Proof: Since the seller is risk neutral,                               Ti' ( .   )        =

constant.         Thus,      (6)   reduces to:
(8)          V'(—k)          V'(y—k).
Since V' declines continuously,                      (8)    implies that                 =   y.
Q. E. D.

        In   this case, the optimal contract                price    is:
(9)          k c           p(z—y) <      c.12
The seller is willincT to accept a contract                         price below his
production        cost    since, under the          expectation      damage remedy,
he receives more than his production cost if the third—party
offer materializes. To be precise, he is willing to accept
a contract price less than production cost to the extent of
the expected gain from the third—party offer, p(—y).

       Proof:     Since the        buyer   is risk    neutral,     (6) becomes
(10)         U'(k—c) =

which implies that                  z.     Q.E.D.
        In this    case,      the optimal contract price is:

 (11)                   0.1
 The seller demands a contract price equal to his production
 cost since, under the Specific performance remedy,                                      he
 receives none of the benefits of a third—party of for.

       Proof:          This will be proved by contradiction.                     Suppose
       y.      Then, by the declining marginal utility of V and U,
Vt (y—k)/V' ( —k)             1        and   U' (k—c)/U' (+k-c—) >          1.      This

contradicts (6). Similarly, if                            z, then   V'(y—k)/V'(—k)       >

land U'(k—c)/U'(+k—-)                               1, again contradicting (6).
Thus, y <              <.     Q.E.D.
        In this cése, the optimal                       contract price is bounded by
the    contract prices under the                    expectation     damage remedy and
the    specific        performance remedy:
(12)           c   —
                       p(—y)      <   k < c.16
The    exact       contract price depends, of               course, on the optimal
liquidated damage payment.                        The    higher the damage payment,
the  higher the contract price demanded by the seller since
his expected gain from the third—party offer is less.17



4.      An Fxample

        The way in          which the optimal damage                   payment   and the
                                                                            PAGE 11
 optimal contract price vary with                  the risk   aversion of       the
 parties        can be illustrated by an            example.      The utility
 functions       of the seller and of the buyer are assumed to be
 of the quadratic form:
 (13)           U(x)     x    sx2,
  1I)           V(x)     x — hx2,

where s         0 and b      0 are risk aversion         parameters.        A 2ero
value     of the parameter corresponds to risk neutrality,                     and
the higher the value, the more risk averse is the party. 18
The remaining data for the example are:19
        $500           seller's production cost
   $1,000              buyer's benefit if contract         completed
          .05          probability   of third—party offer
  $10,000              amount of third—party offer
Thus,     the    expectation     measure of     damages is     $1,000   and    the
damage equivalent to specific performance is $10,000.
        Table    1 shows the opt imal damage payment,             *,    and the
optimal contract price, k*, for different degi-ces of risk
aversion of the seller and the buyer. The values of the
risk aversion parameter are chosen so that the certainty
equivalent of a           50—50 chance of     zero or $10,000 is        $5,000,
$L,500, etc.2° For the first column in Table 1, in which
the buyer is risk averse and the seller is risk neutral,
Proposition       1 and (9)      imply that *        =   $1,000 and    k*      $50
(the    expected gain to the seller           of     the third—party offer,
p(z—y), is $L5Q)             For the first row, in which the buyer is
risk neutral and the seller is risk averse, Proposition 2
                                                                           PAGE 12
and     (11)     imply that      *       = $10,000 and k* =      $500.     For the
remaining cases,            in which both         parties   are risk averse,

ranges between $1,000 and $10,000 (the low and high                         values
are $3, 152 and $7,6tfl) and k* ranges between $50 and $500
(the low and high values are $195 and $395),                           as expected
from Proposition 3 and (12). Note that, holding the buyer's
risk    aversion constant, both the damage payment and the
contract         price rise              as the        seller's risk
                                                    aversion
increases——thereby reducing the (beneficial) risk imposed on
the seller.    Conversely, holding the seller's risk aversion
constant, the damage payment and contract price both fall as
the buyer's risk aversion increases.
     As mentioned in the introduction, the expectation
damage remedy is the normal remedy in practice. However,
only when the seller is risk neutral does this lead to the
optimal allocation of the contract risk. In every other
case, use of the expectation remedy lowers at least one of
the party's expected utility below what it otherwise could
be.      Since the     seller's          expected utility is held constant,
this welfare loss can be calculated as the difference
between the       value to the buyer, w*,               of the optimal contract
and the value to the buyer, e,                          of a contract with the
expectation       remedy,        =       y,   and the corresponding contract
price(9). In other words, the welfare loss is w —                              we,
where w* and e are defined implicitly by:
(15)           V(w*)   (1—p)V(y—k*) +
(16)           v(LJe) = V(y—[c       —
                                          p(z—y) 1).

     Table 2 shows the absolute welfare loss, as well as the
welfare loss as a percentage of the value of the optimal
contract,     w*,   from using the expectation damage remedy
rather than a liquidated damage remedy (or the specific
performance remedy when the buyer is risk neutral and the
seller is risk averse). In the case most favorable to the
expectation damage remedy——when the buyer is most risk
averse (certainty equivalent of $3,000 in Table 2) and the
seller is only slightly risk averse (certainty equivalent of
$4,500)——the welfare loss represents a 2Y reduction in the
value of the contract. In the case least favorable to the
expectati on damage remedy——when the buyer is risk neutral
and the seller is most risk averse——the welfare loss
corresponds to a 20 reduction in the value of the contract.
Thus, the example suqgests that in plausible circumstcinces
the inappropriate allocation of contract risks under the
expectation damage remedy can be of some importance.




5.   Concluding Remnrkr,

     Assuming that parties to a contract are risk averse to
some extent——even if       only slightly——the analysis in     this
paper argues for use of a liquidated damage remedy.         Why is
it then that the normal remedy imposed by the     courts is the
expectation   damage remedy?     Considerations of information,
breach,     and reliance——not included in      the model used
here——might   explain this.

     The specific    performance remedy requires no information
in order to be implemented by a court, while      the expectation
damage remedy only requires the        court    to know (or to
estimate)      the buyer's benefit if the contract had been
completed.      A liquidated damage remedy, however, encourages
the parties to take into account every facet of the contract
when negotiating the damage payment in advance, including
their relative aversion to risk and the likelihood and
magnitude of thi rd—party offers.
     If the parties can renegotiate (including with a third
party) when circumstances have changed, then all of the
remedies will lead    to efficient breach   decisions.     However,
when renegotiation is impossible (or very costly), Shavell
(l9SOa, p. 433) has 3hown that only the expectation damage
remedy will induce efficient breach decisions. It is clear
from the results presented here that a liquidated damage
remedy would lead to too few breaches since damages are
higher than under the expectation remedy, and that the
specific performance remedy would be even worse.
     Ii    the parties negotiate over all terms of    a contract,
including    each other's reliance decisions,     then all of the
remedies will       lead to    efficient reliance        decisions.
However,  when it is too costly to include the reliance
decision as one of the terms of the contract, Shavell
(1980a, p. 473) has shown that the expectation damage remedy
leads to too much reliance, while Rogerson (1980, pp. 47—48)
has demonstrated that the sPecific performance remedy is
                                                          PAGE 15
better,    and that a liquidated damage remedy is best.
     When     these additional     considerations are taken   into
account,      it is clear that no one remedy for breach of
contract is best in    every     respect.   It may be that, all
things considered,      the expectation clamaqe remedy usually
will come    out on top,    although one can imagine pnusib1e
situationsin which risk sharing considerations may be of
primary importance and in which one of the other remedies
may be preferable.

Science Foundation through a grant (SOC 78—20 159) to the Law
and Economics Program of the National Bureau of Economic
Research.       Any opinions expressed are those of the author
and not those of the NBER. I am grateful to Thomas Jackson,

helpful comments and to Raymond Squitieri for assistance in
computing     the   examples.

        1)   The studies which have emphasized the role of risk
allocation in contract law have focused on the doctrines of
excuse, impossibility and foresecability rather than, as
here,    the remedies    for breach. See, for example, Posner and
Rosenfielcl (1977),         Joskow   (19),   and Perloff (1981,
forthcoming). Several studies have also considered the risk
allocation effects of breach of contract remedies, although
not in the way developed here. The ones which are most
closely related to the present analysis are by Kornhauser
(1980, 1981), Rogerson C 1980), and Shavell ( 1980a,      1980b)
See also Goetz and Scott (1977).         These will be discussed
further below.

         It will be shown below that the liquidated damage
        2)
payment agreed to by the parties will never be less than the
buyer's lost profits.
        3) See, for example, Farnsworth (1970).
                                                               PAGE 17

        ) In practice, the           expectation   damage and specific
performance remedies are imposed upon the parties by a
court,      whereas a   liquidated damage remedy is determined by
the    parties   themselves.    This distinction will not be of
concern here.


       5)     It will be shown below that the damage payment
under the expectation and liquidated damage remedies will be
less thzin the third party's offer.      Thus, under these
remedies the seller will breach and resell to the third
party. Under the specific performance remedy, the buyer
will demand performance and then resell to the third party.
       6)   Alternatively, one could motivate the risk
alloction problem by assuming that there is some detrimental
risk, such as the possibility that the value of performance
to the buyer decreases (say because the good is defective).
Results analogous to the ones developed here could be
generated. See !<ornhauser (1981, pp. 15—17).

       7)   There is a   natural interpretation of the constraint
that   the seller's expected utility is 2ero.           Suppose there
are many potential sellers who compete         for the contract to
produce a custom—made good for the buyer.              Thus,   if all

sellers had the same utility function,              competition would
lead to the same expected utility for each seller.             And ii

sellers have an option of earning zero profits in a riskiess
activity then, since U(O)        =   0,   EU = 0 is the appropriate
                                                                          PAGE 18
    common level of expected utility.


           8)     If      =    z,    the seller would be indifferent between
    performance          and        breach     if    the   thi rd—party     offer
materializes.              It will be assumed that performance will
occur in this            ease. Obviously, any      > z would also be
equivalent         to specific performance.

           9)     In principle, a            liquidated damage agreement could
lead       to     < y.         It   is shown   below that, in fact, this would
never occur.

         10)      When        both parties are risk neutral, all three
remedies are equally desirable (which is not surprising
since the          only problem considered in this paper            is how to
optimally allocate risk).

         H) This result has been                noted by several others.      See
Kornhauser         (1981, pp.          15—18), Rogerson (1980, pp. 4—5),
and Shavell (1980a, pp. 487—88; 198Db, p. 13).

         12) Without loss of generality, assume U(x) = x.                    Then
(9) follows directly from (7).

         13)      This result has been suggested by Shave].l (1980b,
p.        33).      In a different model (see footnote 6                  above),
}ornhauser (1981, pp.                 16—17) has stated an analogue to this
r   es u 1 t.

         1t)     Given S =      , the        seller's expected utility is U(k—
c). Then (11) follows from U(0) = 0.
                                                                                PAGE 19

          15)       Nornhauser (1980,         Pp.    12—19;       1981,   PP.     16—19)
discusses the               desirability      of a   liquidated damage remedy
when both parties to a contract are risk averse, but does
not       relate the optimal liquidated damage payment to the
expectation damage or specific performance remedies. Goet
and Scott (1977)  also advocate use of a liquidated damage
remedy,             but their primary concern is with protecting
'idiosyncratic" and other difficult to measure losses, which
is not an issue here.
         16)        Since the seller is risk averse, his expected
pfits must be positive when his expected utility                            is zero:
          (   1—p)(k—c) +       p(+k—c—)      > 0.

The first inequality In (12) follows directly from this
condition.   If k    c, the seller's expected utility is
positive since U(k—c) 0 and U(+k—c—ó) >                             0.    The second
inequality in (12) follows from the fact that                             this would
contradict          the zero expected utility constraint.
         17)    Totally differentiating (7) with              respect     to      shows
t h at
          dk    =                pU'(2+k—c—)                  >   0.
                       (1—p)U'(k—c) + pU'(z+k—c—ó)
         18)     The       values    of s   and b are limited to ranges such
that U' (x) =          1
                           —   2sx > 0 and V' Cx)      1 — 2bx > 0.            Although
the      quadratic utility function does not exhibit decreasing
absolute risk aversion,                     this does not lead to peculiar
results in the             present   application.

     19) These values guarantee that the seller will produce
the good and enter into a contract with the buyer (rather
than,    for exanple,  producing the good solely for the
possibility   of selling it to the third party).
