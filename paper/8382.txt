I.     INTRODUCTION

       The 1990s have seen a series of radical changes in the funding of social insurance

programs, including a movement away from federal entitlements and towards increasing

state and local responsibility for the maintenance of a social safety net and other public

spending. In 1997 the state of Florida sued the U.S. government in an effort to recover

funds for SSI and food stamp benefits for legal immigrants cut by the 1996 Welfare

Reform Act. The mayor of Dade county alleged that “the new federal law is likely to

cost Dade County $300 million a year” (Morgan, St. Petersburg Times, 1997). In nearby

Pinellas County officials want to ensure that the state of Florida picks up the tab (as most

other states do) for the children’s health insurance program to offset the more than

$800,000 the local agency has contributed in matching funds since 1996 (Krueger, St.

Petersburg Times, 2001). Localities face a related problem when federal funds for

ongoing programs such as increased police forces dry up. The $8.8 billion federal

Community Oriented Police Services program that funded 100,000 additional police

officers is expiring, and finding funds to maintain the expanded force puts a great strain

on local budgets (Ortega, Columbus Dispatch, 1997).

       In order to understand the likely consequences of such a movement on the

distribution of public spending, it is necessary to understand how fiscal distress affects

state and local budgets. How will local jurisdictions react to budget shocks? Will they

cut back welfare spending or capital projects, or will they raise taxes? If taxes are raised,

on whom does the burden of those increases fall? Will housing prices change? Will this

affect mobility between localities? How will neighboring jurisdictions react? How long




                                             1
do these changes persist? What are the implications of these changes for the well-being

of residents?

       This research builds on several strands of the public economics literature,

including the effect of fiscal institutions on states’ ability to respond to shocks (see

Poterba, 1994, Hines and Thaler, 1995 and Rueben, 1998), the effect of one state’s

spending on the spending of neighboring states (see Case, Hines, and Rosen, 1993,

Besley and Case, 1995, Figlio, Van Kolpin, and Reid, 1999, and Baicker, 2000), and the

effect of selective migration and population composition on the public bundle (see

Poterba, 1997, Borjas and Hilton, 1996, Meyer, 1998, and Levine and Zimmerman,

1999). Together this research suggests that the shift in control of funds from the federal

government to the states and localities will have a profound effect on the landscape of

public spending.

       When control of funds is shifted from the federal to the state or local level, fiscal

institutions and demographics may play a much larger role in the distribution of

resources, and externalities or spillovers between jurisdictions may create very different

regional equilibria. Therefore the effect of fiscal shocks and the ability of states and

localities to shift funds between categories will be of increasing importance in

determining the distribution of social spending both within and between jurisdictions. It

is unclear, however, whether or not the effects documented in this literature are peculiar

to state budgets or to fiscal shocks originating in welfare programs themselves. Will

shocks to other parts of the budget be accommodated by decreases in welfare spending

too? Are local budgets fundamentally different from state budgets? The next logical step

in this line of research is to examine other sources of fiscal distress at the local level.




                                             2
This is important not just for understanding the implications of welfare reform, but for

understanding the interplay among all state and local spending categories and the effect

of other financial reforms. Other kinds of fiscal stress and stress at the local level may

produce different budget spillovers, both between budget categories and between

jurisdictions.

        Trying capital crimes is an increasing source of fiscal distress for counties, and

the cost of paying for these very expensive convictions has fueled a public debate about

their effectiveness in deterring crime and on whom the burden of paying for them should

fall. The estimated cost of a death penalty case is over $2 million (Dieter, 1994).

Documenting the ultimate incidence of the cost of these trials would be a valuable

exercise in and of itself, but they also provide a particularly apt setting in which to study

the intra- and interjurisdictional effects of local fiscal distress. As shown below, capital

trials are unexpected (most counties, even in states with capital punishment provisions,

saw no such convictions between 1983 and 1997), they represent a significant expense to

the county relative to its budget, they are likely to be uncorrelated with prior spending

and revenue decisions, and they offer no localized change in services associated with

living in a particular county. This paper takes advantage of the shock these trials impose

to investigate these questions empirically. I explore this source of variation first to

determine which areas of local budgets absorb the shocks, the spillover effects of the

budget changes, and where the ultimate incidence of capital convictions lies.           The

optimal financial design for public programs depends crucially on how each jurisdiction

absorbs shocks and on how shocks affect the total bundle of resources available to

different sectors of the population.




                                             3
II.     EMPIRICAL STRATEGY

        In order to investigate the effects of fiscal distress on program spending we need

to identify some exogenous source of budgetary stress not generated within these

programs.     It is insufficient (and potentially misleading) merely to examine the

relationships between different categories of spending without abstracting from economic

and political conditions. In order to uncover causal relationships, rather than correlations,

it is necessary to find shocks to local budgets that are unexpected and uninfluenced by

things like local economic conditions. Capital crime trials provide just such a source of

financial stress.



Background on Capital Crime Trials

        Trying capital murder cases can pose a significant financial burden on localities

(see Dieter, 1994, for a review).      An Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental

Relations report (1993, p. 24) notes that court systems in most states “receive less than a

third of their budgets from the state. In most systems, counties provide the remaining

funds.” Costs for seeing a case through to a death sentence are estimated at more than $2

million, with some estimates ranging as high as $7 million to execution (Burnett, 1999).

This is as much as 10 times more than life in prison, and most of these costs accrue at the

trial level, contrary to much public discourse about the cost of “endless appeals” (Dieter).

Since nine out of ten defendants in capital crime trials are indigent, counties must often

pay legal costs for both prosecution and defense (Moneyline, 1995). The median county

spent $12 million in 1997 while the tenth percentile spent $2 million. The distribution of



                                             4
county spending is shown in Figure 1. In 1991 NJ spent $16 million to impose the death

penalty, and the next year the state laid off 500 police officers because they could not

afford to pay them (Dieter).

       Counties in many states complain of the financial hardships the trials impose.

Jasper County, Texas claims to have already raised property taxes by 8 percent to pay for

the trial of the three men accused of killing James Byrd, and will have to delay new

computer purchases and construction (Burnett). One Texas county tried to raise taxes to

pay for a high-profile capital trial and the taxpayers revolted and voted for a tax rollback,

which forced the county commissioners to cut funding to fire and ambulance services in

the county, while another case caused a border dispute between counties trying to avoid

the cost of a particular trial (Dieter). Jasper County, Mississippi (no relation) spent three

times more on a capital trial in 1995 than it spent on its libraries, and, lacking even

parking meters to raise revenue, had to increase property and automobile taxes to raise

the funds (Moneyline). Dieter reports several more examples:

       Sierra County CA’s D.A. says ‘If [we] didn’t have to pay . . . for murders
       [we] would have an investigator and the sheriff would have a couple of
       extra deputies and we could do some lasting good . . . The sewage system
       at the courthouse is failing, a bridge collapsed, there’s no county library,
       no county park . . .’ The county’s auditor said that if death penalty
       expenses kept piling up, the county would soon be broke . . . another death
       penalty case would likely require the county to lay off 10% of its police
       and sheriff force. (p. 5)

       Quitman County, the poorest in Mississippi . . . had to raise taxes and
       borrow money to try [two cases]. [The county clerk says] ‘I’m thinking
       we’ll become even poorer and I’m also thinking that a lot of people are
       going to move out of the county because of the increased tax burden and
       move over to other counties where the taxes are not quite as high.’

       In Lincoln County, Georgia . . . the county commissioners refused to pay
       the defense costs when the attorney won a new trial for a death row inmate
       [and] were sent to jail. [The] chair of the County Commission explained:



                                             5
       “We’re a rural county of 7,500 people with a small tax base. We had to
       raise taxes once already for this case when it was originally tried, and now
       we are going to have to raise taxes again. It’s not fair.” (p. 6)


       While these cases are quite expensive, contrary to the impression given by much

media coverage they are fairly uncommon. Over the period used in this analysis, 1983 to

1997, 80% of counties saw no such convictions. This seems like an insurable risk, and

we might expect some form of intergovernmental risk sharing. Indeed, several states

(such as Texas, Idaho, Wyoming, Washington, and Mississippi) are currently considering

legislation to offset local costs, but (perhaps because of lags in adapting to the increasing

financial burden) during the period of study few such reimbursements occurred.

       This anecdotal evidence suggests that the effects of paying for these trials should

be discernable in county budgets. It also suggests that we pay particular attention to local

taxes, and to capital and police protection expenditures. By examining the effects of

paying for these extraordinary and often unexpected expenses on local finances, we may

gain valuable insight into the effects of exogenous increases in local expenditures and

taxes, as well as a better understanding of the incidence of this expensive policy.



Estimation Framework

       A simple economic model would predict that the cost of a negative windfall

would be borne based on the marginal propensity to consume public goods and private

goods out of income. Given the low fraction of personal income devoted to county

budgets (less than 3 percent in this period), we would expect the bulk of the costs to be

borne by increased taxes, and potentially smoothed over time by borrowing. (See Hines

and Thaler, 1995, for evidence that many shocks tend to be absorbed disproportionately



                                             6
within closely related budget categories, known as the “flypaper effect.”) I estimate the

effect of paying for a capital crime conviction on total revenues, total spending, and

spending on specific public goods.

       Several different models are estimated here, but each includes county effects (αi),

time effects (βt), demographic and economic controls including population (Xit), and

some also include a state-specific time trend (statei* t).            The dependent variable is

spending on a particular category or tax revenue from a particular source, and the

independent variable of interest is the presence of a capital conviction.



           spending it = α i + β t + X it γ + statei * tλ + δ capital convictionit + ε it   (1)

           taxationit = α i + β t + X itγ + statei * tλ + δ capital convictionit + ε it     (2)



We might want to limit the analysis to counties with few of these trials (so that they are

least expected), to counties in states with the death penalty (using just counties in death-

penalty states, as opposed to all counties without a case, as controls), or to smaller

counties (who may have less of a cushion and potentially even higher variable costs). I

also present analysis using a log specification, but since we would like to put a dollar

price tag on the cost of capital convictions I begin with this model.




III.   DATA

County Budgets

       County budget data comes from two sources.                   The first is the Census of

Governments, conducted every 5 years by the Bureau of the Census, and the second is the



                                                 7
Annual Survey of Government Finances, conducted most years on a sample of county

governments. County government data is used, rather than aggregations of all sub-

governments to the county-area level. There are several logistical difficulties involved in

using this data, some of which can be overcome and some of which cannot.

Disaggregation in the early years is limited, and in some years missing observations and

0 values are indistinguishable. The number of counties in the survey is around 2100 for

years before 1992 and 1500 in the years after.



Capital Convictions

         The National Corrections Reporting Program surveys all inmates admitted to

correctional facilities and is available annually from 1983 to 1997.                              It includes

information on the county and date of conviction as well as the severity of the sentence.

From this information I have compiled the number of prisoners admitted to prison under

sentence of death by county by year. Because the survey is limited to inmates, those

acquitted in capital trials will be omitted from the analysis. The source of variation I use

is therefore the presence of a capital conviction. While the survey has much detail on the

individual prisoners and their sentences, it has only sentencing dates, not the time span of

the trial itself. Capital trials can often take more than a year, so a prison admission in

year t may very well affect county budgets in year t-1. While we can use the data to help

inform us about the proper time horizon, this noise is likely only to bias results towards

zero.1


1
 One possible concern with the use of capital trials as an exogenous shock is that a prosecutor may have
discretion over whether or not to charge a defendant with a capital crime, and that his or her decision may
be influenced by the financial circumstances of the jurisdiction. The anecdotal evidence cited above
suggests that this is not the case, and while this proposition is difficult to test, capital convictions do not
appear to be predictable with the observed local conditions. For example, a regression of the capital crime


                                                       8
        Data is summarized in Table 1. As the first panel shows, there is a great deal of

variation between counties in the number of prisoners convicted of capital crimes. Over

the 18 years sampled, most counties (more than 80 percent) had no death penalty

convictions and more than 10 percent had exactly 1 year with a death penalty conviction

between 1983 and 1997. Thus, for the vast majority of counties these convictions are

rare occurrences. Of course, some large counties have several convictions each year.

While costs for frequent capital conviction counties may still be variable, they are bound

to be more anticipated. Furthermore, the (relatively fixed) cost is likely to be a bigger

shock to smaller counties, which have a smaller tax base and are less likely to have the

requisite personnel already on staff.          Even for relatively large counties (those over

75,000) these events are relatively rare: 53 percent had none, and 17 percent had only 1.

(Fortunately, from our perspective, they are still common enough to provide ample

observations for estimation: more than 1,300 county-years saw at least one capital

conviction.)


Covariates

        County covariates are available from several sources. The County and City Data

Book, published annually by the Bureau of the Census, includes variables at the county-

year level such as median age, personal income, land area, population, unemployment,

and employment by sector (such as within government or construction).                          Further

demographic breakdowns (such as population by race) are available only in the decennial

census years. The Statistical Abstract of the United States provides some useful state-



dummy on the county unemployment rate and the budget deficit or surplus explains only .0064 of the
variation in capital convictions.


                                                   9
level data. County-level crime rates come from the Department of Justice Uniform Crime

Reports.




IV.      RESULTS

Capital Convictions and Spending

         Table 2 presents estimates of equation (1) above. Reported budget categories at

the county level are sufficiently heterogeneous and inconsistently aggregated that it is not

clear exactly where the expenditures associated with the trials would appear. I report

disaggregated categories and include judicial and corrections spending, but this category

is not always available and even when it is may not capture the entire financial burden.

The dependent variables in Table 2 are thus both total spending and judicial and

corrections spending. Capital convictions appear on the right-hand side as a dummy

variable indicating the presence of an admission in year t or year t+1.2 The presence of a

death penalty conviction has a significant effect on expenditures, coming through judicial

and corrections spending. The presence of such a conviction increases judicial and

corrections spending (and total spending) by more than $1.5 million, which is quite

consistent with outside estimates of the cost of a death penalty case. Controls in columns

(1) and (2) include population, state and year fixed effects, and state-specific time trends.

Other controls, such as the unemployment and crime rates, have insignificant coefficients

and do not change the results in the presence of fixed effects, so are omitted here.

Column (3) excludes the state-specific time trend. Column (4) includes only counties in


2
  This functional form is suggested by the data, as described above. While including a series of leads and
lags forces the dropping of several years of data, the cumulative effect is the same as the coefficient
presented here, and the most significant years are t and t+1.


                                                    10
state-years with death penalty legislation in place, effectively excluding non-death

penalty states as controls. Each produces similar results: capital convictions impose a

significant burden on county budgets, consistent with previous estimates of their total

cost.

        We might be concerned that we are not adequately controlling for population in

this specification. If population ought to appear in a non-linear form, and if population

(positively) affects both the probability of having a death penalty case and the amount a

county spends, then the coefficient on death penalty convictions might be biased up. In

this case, it might be more appropriate to examine per capita spending and cases:



                     spending                          capital conviction           
                                 = f  α i , β t ,                      , ε it           (3)
                      population  it                      population        it      
or

          ln (spending )it = α i + β t + δ (capital conviction )it + γ ln ( population )it + ε it   (4)




        Table 3 estimates equation (4), with different categories of spending and revenues

as the dependent variable (and robust standard errors in parentheses). The top panel uses

all counties. Here, too, total expenditures and revenues increase significantly with the

presence of a capital conviction. The presence of a trial increases spending by 1.8

percent and revenues by 1.6 percent, while decreasing police and highway expenditures

by 3.3 percent. At the mean, this implies an increase in spending of $1.2 million and

increase in revenues of $1.1 million. Applying these elasticties to the total number of

convictions during this period implies an increase in county budgets of more than $1.6

billion between 1982 and 1997.


                                                     11
         Columns (3) through (7) estimate equation 4 for several subcategories of

spending. While there is much more noise in the individual categories, judicial and

corrections spending increases significantly (although not as much as total spending or

revenues), while police and highway expenditures decrease significantly (about $275,000

together). Why would police protection and highways in particular face cuts? The fact

that this spending decreases is consistent with the stories told by local officials and the

anecdotal evidence above, and may be driven by the fact that these funds are either on

hand and more easily accessible (police) or more easily delayed (capital spending on

highways). Delaying capital projects is akin to borrowing against future revenues. There

may also be political factors driving these decisions – a reduction in services most visible

to taxpayer-consumers may be the best way to motivate future tax increases. These

decreases are only about 20% of the increase in total spending at the mean: the main way

in which the trials are financed is through increased revenues to offset the increase in

total expenditures.3

         While previous research suggested that negative shocks to the welfare budgets of

states resulted in cutbacks in other welfare spending, that does not seem to be the case

here. Spending on welfare, hospitals, and the like may be difficult to adjust in the short-

run, because of more complex rules and legislation. This negative finding suggests that

welfare programs are most at risk when jurisdictions face increases in spending on

similar programs such as Medicaid.



3
  This analysis does not incorporate the dynamics of the budget adjustment process. The analysis discussed
above suggests that the biggest impact of these trials is in the first two years and that spending then returns
to pre-trial levels, but a more sophisticated econometric approach is required to separate out noise in the
timing of the expense from a dynamic adjustment process. Unfortunately, adding additional leads or lags
of the death conviction variable reduces the number of years available, making a more dynamic analysis
difficult with the current limited time span.


                                                      12
       The lower panel presents the same estimations with the sample of counties limited

to those with fewer than 100,000 residents and capital convictions in 2 or fewer years.

Results look quite similar. If anything, spending on police declines by more, which is

consistent with the idea that smaller counties have a smaller tax base and thus a limited

ability to accommodate the shock entirely by raising taxes. These events are at least as

binding on local budgets when the jurisdiction is small and the event less anticipated.

       Thus, the observed local reaction to these shocks is consistent with the predictions

of the theory: taxes increase in the short run, offset in part by a delay in capital

expenditures. The next section examines the broader ripple effects of this shock to

revenues.



Spillovers Between Counties

       The “cost” of obtaining a capital conviction may extend well beyond the

prosecuting county’s borders.      There are many reasons to think that one county’s

spending might influence another’s, such as tax competition and selective migration (see

Case, Hines, and Rosen, 1993, and Besley and Case, 1995). If one county raises its taxes

it may enable the voters of a neighboring county to raise taxes (and thereby expenditures)

without fear of high-income taxpayers moving out of the jurisdiction. Thus, estimating

the full budgetary implication of these trials requires an examination of spillovers to other

counties.

       These spillovers are difficult to estimate, however, because an OLS regression of

one county’s spending on that of its neighbors could be biased by omitted controls for

local political and economic conditions, correlated mismeasurement, and the like. If




                                             13
capital convictions significantly increase spending and tax rates, we can use this as an

exogenous source of variation to examine the jurisdictional spillover effects.

       Table 4 presents both OLS estimates and IV estimates where neighboring

counties’ revenues are instrumented with the presence of neighbors’ capital convictions.

In this table a county’s “neighbor” is the population-weighted average of geographically

contiguous counties, but there are certainly there are other measure of “neighborliness”

that would be equally reasonable.       (Similar results are obtained when neighbors’

spending is used, instead of neighbors’ revenues.)

       The OLS regressions in columns (1) and (3) suggest that a 10 percent increase in

neighbors’ revenues induces a 1.8 percent increase in both own spending and own

revenues. These results are slightly lower than most estimates of state-to-state spillovers

discussed above, but are consistent with the literature in general. The IV results are very

similar, with elasticities of .23 for taxes and .21 for revenues, and are measured quite

precisely. The inclusion of these terms does not substantially change the estimated

effects of a county’s own capital convictions.

       From this analysis we learn that county spending and revenue decisions have

significant spillovers to neighboring jurisdictions, even when the potential endogeneity of

neighbors’ budget decisions is taken into account. It seems that a shock to one county’s

taxes, even in the absence of an accompanying increase in services, loosens a constraint

on taxes and spending in neighboring counties. The extent to which this change in

neighboring behavior is a “cost” of a capital conviction depends on the extent of other

inter-county externalities.




                                            14
V.       CONCLUSION

         This project explores the effects of the large negative shock to county budgets

posed by the presence of a capital crime trial, first to understand the real incidence of

these capital conviction costs and second to analyze the effects of local fiscal distress on

the level and distribution of public spending and revenues. Analysis shows that counties

bear the large and unexpected burden of capital convictions in part by raising taxes and in

part by decreasing expenditures on police, and highway spending, while health and

welfare spending seem to be maintained.           The estimated increase in taxes and

expenditures is significant, amounting to more than $1.6 billion over a 15-year period.

This is true for large and small counties alike. These convictions have effects beyond

county borders, consistent with the literature on local spillovers and “yardstick

competition”:    using capital convictions as an instrument for neighboring counties’

spending and revenues shows the presence of significant inter-jurisdictional spillovers

(while abstracting from correlated economic conditions and the like). These results

imply that the implementation of state programs to help offset these costs would be

welfare enhancing.

         This analysis suggests several interesting extensions. First, we could see which

factors, such as demographics, affect the ways in which counties respond to such shocks.

Second, the presence of a capital conviction could be an instrument for several

endogenous right-hand side variables of interest. For example, since the convictions

appear to affect taxes and police expenditures, they could serve as an instrument to

examine the effect of property taxes on inter-county mobility or the effect of policing on

crime.




                                            15
       As states and localities are given greater control over public funds, the

distribution of spending and the well-being of residents will increasingly depend on the

way states and localities accommodate shocks, their ability to shift funds between budget

categories, and on the spillover effects of shocks within and between jurisdictions. Only

through understanding the reactions of state and local governments to different fiscal

conditions can we gauge the effectiveness and equity of the local provision of important

safety net programs and infrastructure, both in terms of the distribution and the stability

of resources.
