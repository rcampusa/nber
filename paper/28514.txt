Permanent and Transitory Responses to Capital Gains Taxes: Evidence from a Lifetime Exemption
in Canada

                                            ABSTRACT

Using panel data on a 20% random sample of Canadian taxpayers, we study behavioral responses
to the cancellation of a lifetime capital gains exemption that resulted in increased capital gains
taxation for some individuals. The unique setting allows us to distinguish between short-term
avoidance responses and permanent responses to capital gains taxes. We show that the exemption
did not change the number of taxpayers reporting positive capital gains, and thus unlikely resulted
in increased participation in capital markets. However, the exemption cancellation slightly
increased capital gains realizations of the existing traders.

      How does taxation affect the realization of capital gains? The answer to this
question is central to several ongoing debates about the equity-efficiency tradeoff
of taxing capital gains income. For example, the elasticity of capital income with
respect to the net-of-tax rate is an input into formulas for optimal tax rates on
capital (Saez and Stancheva (2018)). The elasticity of capital gains realizations
with respect to taxes is also important for estimating the impact of tax reforms
on government revenues (Gravelle (2020); Agersnap and Zidar (2020)). In spite
of its importance, evidence on the responsiveness of capital gains realizations to
changes in taxation is mixed, largely due to limitations in data and identifying
variation.
      In this paper, we exploit the unexpected cancellation of a $100,000 CAD
(nominal) lifetime capital gains exemption in 1994 and longitudinal tax return
data on a 20% sample of Canadian tax filers to estimate the effect of taxes
on short-run and long-run capital gains realizations. Introduced in 1985, the
lifetime capital gains exemption (hereafter the LCGE) resulted in an effective
marginal tax rate on capital gains of zero up to the $100,000 threshold. Broadly
speaking, the abrupt elimination of the LCGE in February 1994 affected tax
filers in one of two ways depending on their expected path of lifetime capital
gains realizations and past behavior. For individuals whose expected lifetime
capital gains realizations were less than $100,000, the elimination of the LCGE
led to both an increase in the effective marginal tax rate on capital gains income
and a negative shock to expected lifetime wealth.1 On the other hand, individuals
who had already exhausted their $100,000 exemption limit were unaffected by the
1994 reform.
      We adopt a difference-in-differences research design that exploits the dif-
ferences in remaining exemption space at the time the LCGE was cancelled to
partition tax filers into one of several treatment groups and a comparison group.
In particular, we assign individuals to treatment and control groups based on the
sum of their 1985-1993 capital gains realizations that counted towards the LCGE
   1
      The increase in the effective marginal tax rate on capital gains from 1994 to 1995 meant that
the after-tax real return to earning capital income fell sharply from 1995 onwards. Furthermore,
the fact that realizations up to $100,000 were subjected to taxation meant that lifetime wealth
fell by an amount proportional to the tax filer's remaining exemption space multiplied by their
marginal tax rate on capital gains income.

limit. Tax filers that exhausted their LCGE space by 1993 are assigned to the
control group. By construction, this group is unaffected by the 1994 reform. We
assign tax filers whose 1985-1993 realizations were below the LCGE threshold to
one of three treatment groups, depending on how far below the $100,000 limit
their pre-reform realizations were. While all tax filers with unused LCGE space
experienced an immediate increase in their effective marginal tax rate, those with
more remaining exemption space at the time of the exemption cancellation were
arguably less likely to eventually reach the $100,000 limit (conditional on covari-
ates).2 As a result, the removal of the LCGE should have led to an increase in the
medium- and long-run effective marginal tax rates for this group. Partitioning
treated tax filers into three groups thus allows us to investigate how the cancel-
lation of the LCGE affected individuals differently, depending on the extent to
which their long-run incentives to realize capital gains income changed.
     Our analysis generates two main results. First, we find that the removal
of the LCGE led to a large increase in realizations in 1994, the last year it
was available, for all treatment groups. Compared to the control group, the
unconditional realized capital gains of treated tax filers approximately doubled,
increasing by 0.9 to 1.1 log points from 1993 to 1994.3 Furthermore, we show that
this short-term increase in unconditional capital gains realizations is driven by
responses along both the extensive (i.e. the likelihood of reporting capital gains)
and the intensive margins (i.e. the amount of realized capital gains conditional
on reporting positive gains).
     Second, although responses by all three treatment groups are quantitatively
similar in the short-run, our estimated medium to long-run responses (i.e. 3-5
years later) differ significantly across groups. For treated filers whose 1985-1993
realizations were close to $100,000, and who were more likely to eventually exceed
   2
      In Online Appendix F, we show that the all three treatment groups and the comparison
group have similar time-invariant characteristics (e.g. age, gender) and that their time-varying
covariates (e.g. marital status, broad income and taxable income) evolve similarly over time.
This is reassuring and suggests that our estimated responses are unlikely to be driven by
differences in life-circumstances and individual characteristics between groups. See Section 4.3
for a more detailed discussion.
    3
       While all individuals with remaining exemption space had an incentive bring forward and
report capital gains in 1994, only those with paper gains at the time of the announcement were
able to take advantage of this opportunity. Since we do not observe investors' portfolios and,
therefore, their unrealized gains, we cannot test the optimality of the behavior of tax filers.


                                               3
the limit in the absence of the elimination of the LCGE, we find that the 1994
reform had a small, statistically insignificant effect on 1995-1999 realized capital
gains. However, for treated individuals whose 1985-1993 realized capital gains
were far below the $100,000 limit, we find that the elimination of the LCGE
increased (unconditional) capital gains realizations by approximately 0.25 log
points (i.e. 25 percent). We show that this increase is primarily due increases
along the intensive rather than extensive margin.
     Taken together, our results suggest that the short-run elasticity of capital
gains realizations with respect to the net-of-tax rate is large and positive (2.85
to 3.61), while the medium and long-run elasticities are much smaller and even
negative in some cases (-0.16 to -1.12). Our short-run estimates likely represent
an upper bound on the potential magnitude of re-timing responses for two rea-
sons. First, tax filers were able to take advantage of the expiring exemption and
crystalize existing unrealized capital gains without selling their assets by filling
out a form when completing their 1994 tax return. Since filling out this form was
essentially costless compared to the potential tax savings, our estimated 1994 re-
timing responses are likely larger than what would be observed for a typical tax
reform. Second, some taxpayers may have inflated their crystalized capital gains
on assets that are not third-party reported (e.g. certain non-financial assets),
since doing so would reduce their future tax liabilities without increasing their
tax burden in 1994.4
     Our negative estimate of the long-run elasticity of capital gains realizations
with respect to the net-of-tax rate is consistent with the wealth effect arising from
the elimination of the LCGE being relatively important in our setting. This may
not be surprising given that the sudden elimination of the LCGE represented
a large negative shock to the lifetime wealth for tax filers that did not expect
to exceed the $100,000 limit and because the elimination of the LCGE was not
viewed as a transitory tax change (Richardson and Moore (1995)). Our estimates
suggest that this wealth effect is particularly important for young tax filers with
substantial unused LCGE space at the time the cancellation was announced.
To contrast, our estimates of the long-run elasticity for those with little unused

    During this time period, capital gains realizations through banks and brokerage accounts
were third-party reported to Canada Revenue Agency.



                                             4
exemption space are small and statistically insignificant.5
     Our interpretation of the estimated responses for tax filers with modest 1985-
1993 realizations as being consistent with a negative wealth effect is grounded in
economic theory. Generally speaking, the capital gains realization behavior of
tax filers depends on responses along three margins: (i) savings/consumption
decisions that affect the acquisition of assets that may generate capital gains, (ii)
portfolio asset allocation decisions that determine the fraction of wealth allocated
to assets that may generate capital gains and (iii) the decision about when to
realize paper gains (i.e. timing decisions). In Online Appendix C, we develop three
simple theoretical models that isolate each of these decisions margins. Along all
three decision margins, we show that the effect of higher capital gains tax rates
on capital gains realizations is theoretically ambiguous.6
     We benchmark our empirical estimates against a number of sensitivity checks
and find that our results are robust. In particular, we address three potential con-
cerns with our empirical strategy and argue that our estimated null and positive
long-term responses to the elimination of the LCGE are unlikely to be affected
by estimation bias. One potential concern is that our estimates of the medium
and long-run response to the LCGE are biased downwards because treated tax
filers brought forward capital gains realizations to 1994, leading to mechanically
lower realizations in subsequent years. However, to the extent that the realiza-
tions of tax filers in the treated group are lower than they otherwise would be
in the 1995-1999 period because of a 1994 re-timing response, this would suggest
the `true' long-run response of capital gains realizations to taxes is even more
positive than we find.
     Another potential concern is that we misclassify individuals with pre-reform
realizations below $100,000 who would have eventually exceeded the limit in the
   5
       Strictly speaking, interpreting differences in elasticity estimates between treatment groups
as being driven by the relative importance of the wealth effect requires an assumption that tax
filers in these groups have similar underlying structural elasticities. This assumption is plausible
in our setting since all groups have similar demographic characteristics and income. If this is not
the case, however, differences in the response to the elimination of the LCGE between groups
may represent differences in underlying structural elasticities (e.g. due to different preferences
or discount factors) rather than the relative importance of the wealth effect.
    6
      Section 5 contains a detailed discussion of these theoretical results and their applicability
to our setting.



                                                 5
absence of the elimination of the LCGE as treated. While the elimination of
the LCGE created an incentive to bring forward future expected realizations to
1994 to avoid taxation, the removal of the exemption would not have affected
the long-run effective marginal tax rate on capital gains or the expected lifetime
wealth for these individuals. This misclassification reduces our ability to identify
long-run responses and will tend to attenuate our estimates towards zero. We
address this concern in a number of ways . First, we estimate the causal effect of
the elimination of the LCGE separately for three different treatment groups that
vary in their 1985-1993 realizations and, therefore, their likelihood of being mis-
classified. In particular, tax filers with relatively low 1985-1993 realized capital
gains (and substantial unused exemption space) are much less likely to be mis-
classified. Second, we check the sensitivity of our baseline results by estimating
regression specifications on the sub-sample of tax filers over age 65. Arguably,
our pre-reform proxy for lifetime capital gains is more accurate for this group
given that they face less uncertainty about future earnings and retirement in-
come needs. Finally, we drop individuals whose 1994 realization response pushes
them over the $100,000 LCGE limit. Reassuringly, our estimates are similar for
all of these sensitivity checks.
     A third potential concern is that we define treatment and control group status
based on past behavior and this may introduce bias if capital gains are mean-
reverting. We argue that this concern is unlikely to materially affect our estimates
because we define our treatment and control groups based on a long series of
capital gains realizations (9 years). Furthermore, our event study estimates show
no evidence of diverging pre-trends between the treatment and control groups,
suggesting that mean-reversion is unlikely to drive our results.
     An important feature of our setting is that the LCGE limit of $100,000 was
relatively low and did not affect the incentive to save or take risk (on the margin)
for the most affluent Canadians. In spite of this, we argue that our estimates
are informative for both researchers and policy makers because our treatment
and control groups collectively earn between 30% and 60% of all capital gains
income in Canada in a given year. By comparison, the share of capital gains
income earned by those with extremely large capital gains realizations (who are
excluded from our analysis) is typically between 20% and 40%. Thus, while our


                                         6
estimates may not be externally valid for tax changes that primarily affect top
earners, they are economically relevant.
     Our results contribute to several active literatures in public finance. A num-
ber of papers study individual responses to capital gains taxes (Feldstein et al.
(1980); Minarik (1981); Auten and Clotfelter (1982); Lindsey (1987); Poterba
(1987); Auerbach and Poterba (1988); Auten et al. (1989); Slemrod and Shobe
(1990); Gillingham and Greenless (1992); Burman and Randolph (1994); Bogart
and Gentry (1995); Auerbach and Siegel (2000), Landsman et al. (2002); Dowd
et al. (2015); Bakija and Gentry (2014); Dowd and McClelland (2019); Buhlmann
et al. (2020); Agersnap and Zidar (2020)).7 Compared with prior work, our set-
ting allows for an arguably cleaner identification of both short-run and long-run
responses to capital gains taxes. In particular, the elimination of the LCGE led
to an increase in the effective marginal tax rate on capital gains income that
was very salient, affected a large fraction of the population and was relatively
simple for tax filers to understand. Moreover, the tax change we study is very
large compared to typical tax reforms: the elimination of the LCGE reduced the
net-of-tax rate on income from realized capital gains from 1 to 1 minus 75% of a
tax filer's effective marginal tax rate. To contrast, most prior work estimates the
impact of changes to statutory tax rates that are small and often mean-reverting
(Agersnap and Zidar (2020)).
     A key feature of our setting is that we are able to estimate long-run responses
to capital gains taxes without having to rely on potentially subjective measures
of transitory and permanent tax changes, unlike prior work. The legislation to
eliminate the LCGE was introduced as part of the Government of Canada's 1994
Budget as a way to help lower the federal budget deficit and was reaffirmed in the
1995 Budget. This reinforced the perception that the elimination of the LCGE
was not a transitory policy change. Moreover, the fact that the elimination of the
LCGE had no effect on individuals whose prior capital gains realizations exceeded
the $100,000 limit also allows us to construct a natural comparison group. This is
advantageous because it allows us to assign treatment status based on immutable
past behavior rather than endogenous marginal tax rates. Finally, the elimination
   7
     For a recent summary of the literature, see Stantcheva (2020). Also, a growing literature
estimates the effects of capital gains taxes on investors' trading behavior and portfolio asset
allocations (Alan et al. (2010); Buhlmann et al. (2020)).


                                              7
of the LCGE was the only policy that affected the tax treatment of capital gains
and other investment income during the 1990-1999 period we study. This reduces
the likelihood that our estimates are contaminated by other policy changes.
     The expected effects of the introduction of the LCGE on savings and risk
taking was discussed in a special issue of the Canadian Public Policy journal in
1995 (Mintz and Richardson (1995)).8 Our paper contributes to the small set of
papers in this special issue by presenting estimates of the casual effect of capital
gains taxes on capital gains realizations using a representative panel of Canadian
tax returns.
     Our findings also contribute to a literature that aims to understand individ-
ual savings responses to financial incentives (Bernheim (2002)). While our data
do not allow us to observe changes in an individual's overall financial position
(e.g. home equity and net debt are not observed), the absence of substantial
long-run realization responses makes it less likely that individuals adjusted their
savings along other margins. This is consistent with the results from several re-
cent papers which find that contributions to tax-preferred savings accounts do
not respond strongly to tax incentives (Chetty et al. (2014); Manoli and Weber
(2016); Messacar (2018)).9
     The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 1, we discuss
the features of the Canadian personal income tax system and the tax treatment of
capital gains that are relevant for our setting. Section 2 describes the longitudinal
dataset of individual tax returns we use in the paper. In Section 3, we present
descriptive time series evidence on capital gains realizations in Canada from 1982
to the present. In Section 4, we describe our empirical strategy for estimating the
   8
     Notably, the papers in the special issue were presented at a symposium jointly sponsored
by the federal Department of Finance and the Institute for Policy Analysis at the University
of Toronto held on January 27-28, 1994. This event was held just a few weeks before the
February 1994 budget that announced exemption's cancellation. As discussed by the editors of
the special issue, the cancellation of the LCGE was completely unexpected at the time of the
symposium.
   9
     Our administrative tax return data contains information on annual contributions to tax-
deferred retirement savings accounts as well as income from dividends and interest at the
individual level. We use this information to investigate the extent to which the elimination of
the LCGE affected income from sources other than realized capital gains. We find that these
other forms of income were not significantly affected by the change in the tax incentive for
saving caused by the elimination of the LCGE.

causal effect of the elimination of the LCGE, present the main results and discuss
several robustness checks. Section 5 concludes and discusses some promising
avenues for future research.


1      Institutional Setting
Table 1 summarizes the tax rules applicable to income from realized capital gains
and the top federal and provincial marginal income tax rates for the years we
study. The tax rules for other years, as well as the tax treatment of other invest-
ment income (i.e. dividends and tax-deferred savings accounts) are summarized
in Appendix Tables A.1­A.2.
     In Canada, the tax unit is the individual (rather than the couple or family)
and the period of taxation is the calendar year; and both the federal government
and the provinces set income tax rates. Realized capital gains have been included
in the tax base since 1972.10 An individual's taxable capital gains income is equal
to their net (of losses) realized gains in a calendar year multiplied by a fixed
parameter, called the inclusion rate. The inclusion rate was 50% from 1972 to
1987, 66.7% from 1988-1989, 75% from 1990-2000 and 50% from 2001 until the
present (see column 2 of Table 1). Increases (resp. decreases) in the inclusion
rate push the tax base more towards (resp. away from) a comprehensive income
definition and increase (resp. decrease) the effective marginal tax rate on capital
gains income.
     Tax filers with net capital losses in a given year can use these losses to
reduce their taxable capital gains income in any of the 3 preceding years or in
any future year. Capital losses cannot be used to offset regular income (e.g.
earnings). Realized capital gains from certain sources are exempt from taxation.
Most notably, realized capital gains from the disposition of a tax filer's primary
residence do not count towards taxable income (and were not even recorded on
  10
     In 1962, Prime Minister John Diefenbaker set up a commission to study the entire federal
tax system and recommend changes for Parliament to enact. The resulting Report of the Royal
Commission on Taxation (often referred to as the Carter Commission) of 1966 recommended
broad changes, most notably a shift towards a comprehensive definition of income as the base
for taxation. A more detailed review of the history of the taxation of capital income in Canada
can be found in Richardson and Moore (1995).



                                              9
tax forms until 2016). Since 1985 the proceeds from the sale of a qualified farm
property or a qualified small business property are also exempt from taxation, up
to a lifetime limit of $500,000. Finally, in Canada, a tax filer's death results in a
"deemed disposition" and, therefore, a capital gains liability on any appreciated
assets. Married couples can avoid or delay tax liabilities from deemed dispositions
from one spouse through a "spousal rollover," which defers the disposition until
the death of the second spouse.
     The Lifetime Capital Gains Exemption (LCGE) was introduced by the fed-
eral government in 1985 with the goal of encouraging risk taking and competi-
tiveness. The LCGE exempted from taxation the realized capital gains from the
disposition of property other than farm property and small business property up
to a lifetime limit. Examples of income eligible for the LCGE included realized
capital gains from the sale of financial assets such as stocks, bonds and mutual
funds and the proceeds from the sale of secondary residences and rental proper-
ties. The LCGE limit was phased in gradually from $20,000 in 1985, to $50,000
in 1986-1987 and $100,000 in 1988 onwards.11
     The LCGE was unexpectedly cancelled in February 1994 as part of the deficit
reduction plans of the newly elected federal Liberal government. In fact, the
cancellation was so unanticipated, that it was never discussed at a symposium
on capital gains taxation jointly sponsored by the federal Department of Finance
and the Institute for Policy Analysis at the University of Toronto that was held
on January 27-28, 1994, just a few weeks before the February 1994 budget that
announced exemption's cancellation (Mintz and Richardson (1995)). Although
the planned reduction in the deficit was mostly achieved by reductions in the level
and growth rate of federal spending, the LCGE was eliminated on the grounds
that many of its beneficiaries were high income earners who should participate
in the austerity effort (Richardson and Moore (1995)).12 The elimination of
the LCGE was reaffirmed in subsequent federal Budgets, further reinforcing the
  11
     Note that the use of LCGE reduced the remaining exemption space for the sale of qualified
property. In other words, the $500,000 exemption discussed earlier applied to the sum of all
capital gains realizations.
  12
     The announcement that the LCGE was being eliminated was made as part of the 1994
federal Budget presented to Parliament by Minister of Finance Paul Martin on February 22,
1994.



                                             10
perception that the policy change was permanent. To ease the transition, the
federal government allowed individuals to take advantage of any unused LCGE
space in 1994 without having to sell their assets on a one-time basis. In particular,
tax filers were able to crystalize unrealized capital gains (up to their remaining
LCGE limit) by filling out a form (Form T664) when filing their 1994 return.13
Even though individuals did not have to sell their assets, the crystalized capital
gains generated by this one-time opportunity were recorded as realized capital
gains income on tax returns and in our data.
     Tables 1 and A.2 summarize the tax treatment of other forms of capital
income. Interest income (both from assets held in Canada and overseas) and div-
idends received from foreign firms are taxed at an individual's ordinary marginal
tax rate. In contrast, dividends from domestic firms (referred to as `eligible div-
idends') receive preferential treatment. Taxable dividend income is equal to an
individual's nominal dividend payment multiplied by one plus a gross-up factor.
At the federal level, the gross-up factor has ranged from 25% to 50% over the past
several decades but was constant at 25% during the 1990-1999 period we focus
on. To compensate for the fact that dividend income is grossed-up, individuals
may also claim a (non-refundable) dividend tax credit. This tax credit for eligible
domestic dividends was stable at 13.3% during the 1990-1999 period.14 Together,
the gross-up factor and tax credit system is designed to offset the prepaid taxes
on corporate profits.
     The Canadian personal income tax system also features tax subsidies for
retirement saving through Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RRSPs) and
employer-sponsored Registered Pension Plans (RPPs). RRSPs are similar to
Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) in the U.S. in that contributions are
deductible from taxable income, investment income accumulates tax-free and
  13
      Form T664 allowed individuals to crystalize their unrealized capital gains by artificially
and appropriately increasing the cost base of their assets up to their unused LCGE space. The
untaxed crystalized (unrealized) capital gain is the difference between the new artificial cost
base and the original cost base.
   14
      To illustrate how the gross-up and tax credit work, consider a tax filer with $100 in

individual's federal taxable dividend income is $125 (= $100 × 1.25); their federal dividend tax

withdrawals are taxable. Individual contributions to RRSPs cannot exceed an
annual limit: a certain percentage of the tax filer's annual earnings (18%-20%
during our period of study) up to a maximum amount. The nominal value of
the maximum RRSP contribution limit increased in recent decades from $5,500
in 1982 to $27,830 in 2020; since 1991 unused contribution from one year can
be carried forward to future years. Annual contributions to employer-sponsored
RPPs reduce an individual's RRSP contribution room.


2      Data
This paper uses individual tax return data from the Longitudinal Administrative
Databank (LAD).15 The LAD is a representative panel of 20% of Canadian tax
filers. Each year, 20% of new filers are selected into the sample. Once in the
LAD, individuals are followed each year they file a return and are linked across
years using their Social Insurance Number (SIN).16 Although the most recent
version of the LAD spans the 1982-2016 period, most of our analysis below will
be based on the 1990-1999 window around the elimination of the LCGE. Unless
stated otherwise, all dollar amounts we report are in 1993 dollars, the year before
the LCGE was eliminated.17
     The LAD contains information on a tax filer's realized net capital gains and
taxable net capital gains in all years. For 1994, reported capital gains include
the unrealized crystalized gains claimed by tax filers taking advantage of the
expiring LCGE. In other words, net realized capital gains in 1994 are the sum of
realized capital gains for that year and the "deemed" realizations from the filing
of Form T664. Unfortunately, the LAD does not contain a detailed breakdown
  15
     See https://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p2SV.pl?Function=getSurvey&SDDS=4107.
  16
     Changes over time in the number of individual-year observations in the LAD reflect in-
creases in the Canadian population and the fraction of individuals filing a return. Though
unlikely to affect our estimates, two tax policy changes in the late 1980s increased fraction of
individuals at the bottom of the income distribution that file a return. In Online Appendix B,
we discuss these tax changes and show that they led to a very small increase in the number of
low-income tax-filers.
  17
      From 1993 to 2016 (the last year of our data), the Canadian Consumer Price In-
dex increased by 49.02 percent. Thus, to convert 1993 dollars to 2016 dollars, multi-
ply 1993 dollar values by approximately 1.5 (see the Bank of Canada Inflation Calculator
(https://www.bankofcanada.ca/rates/related/inflation-calculator/)).


                                              13
of capital gains by asset/security. This means that some of the capital gains
we observe may be due to distributions from mutual funds or other investments
that are outside of an individual's control.18 However, unless individuals in our
`treated' groups systematically began receiving more (or less) capital gains from
these distributions after 1994 compared to the control group, the income from
these passive sources simply adds noise to our dependent variable of interest.
     Starting in 1986, the LAD also contains information on the capital gains
exemptions claimed by the tax filers. Notably, we cannot distinguish whether
these exemptions are claimed under the $100,000 LCGE or the $500,000 qualified
small business exemption.19 The LAD also contains information on the capital
losses claimed to offset current gains, though we do not observe the stock of losses
tax filers have accumulated.
     The LAD allows us to observe income from other sources including earnings,
dividends (domestic/eligible and foreign/ineligible) and interest, as well as basic
demographic characteristics (age, sex, family composition) and, where applicable,
immigration status (e.g. year of landing in Canada, origin country). Further-
more, for all individuals selected into the LAD, some information on their spouse
and children is available (if applicable). We use this information to investigate
whether the response to the change in tax incentives affects tax filers differently
depending on their marital status and family composition.
     For the purposes of this study, we make a number of sample restrictions.
First, we drop tax returns filed on behalf of deceased persons. As mentioned
earlier, the realized capital gains for individuals that pass away during a calendar
year may be due in part to the required deemed disposition at death. Second,
to avoid bias from extreme observations, we drop year-person observations with
realized annual capital gains exceeding $762,367 in 1993 dollars (equivalent to
just over $500,000 in 1982 dollars or $1.1 million in 2016 dollars).
     Finally, Statistics Canada requires that all researchers working with the LAD
  18
      Most mutual funds and exchange traded funds (ETFs) are organized as trusts that are
owned by unit holders. Any gains from trading activity generate capital income that is taxable.
Since the trust is not taxable, any gains are distributed to the unit holders, regardless of whether
or not the unit holder buys/sells units throughout the year.
   19
      The elimination of the LCGE is clearly observable in the data with both the fraction of tax
filers claiming an exemption and the mean exemption claimed falling by more than 80 percent
after 1994.

abide by statistical confidentiality rules. These rules do not allow the release
of raw summary statistics for variables measured in dollars.20 Consequently, all
summary statistics (both figures and tables) presented in this paper are calculated
using the following two-step procedure. First, a small amount of noise is added
to the variable underlying the summary statistic. Second, the resulting statistic
(e.g. mean, median) is rounded according to the following rules. Dollar values
of less than $1000 are rounded to the nearest $10, while dollar estimates above
$1000 are rounded to the nearest $100. All sample size counts are rounded to
the nearest 5. The counts shown are inflated to represent the full population of
Canadian tax filers from the 20% LAD random sample.


3      Time Series Evidence
In this section, we present time series evidence on the evolution of realized capital
gains in Canada from 1982 to 2016. We also compare this series to the perfor-
mance of the Canadian stock market over the period we study. Figure 1 plots the
unconditional mean of net realized capital gains (in 1993 dollars) from 1982 to
2016 on the left axis. The right axis plots the (inflation-adjusted) performance
of the Standard and Poor's Toronto Stock Exchange Composite Index (TSECI).
The shaded green area indicates the 1985-1994 period when the LCGE was in
place. Average net realized capital gains increased during the first few years the
LCGE was in place before falling back to prior levels by 1990. The absence of
strong long-run response to the introduction of the LCGE cannot be attributed to
poor conditions in financial markets since the stock market performed well during
this period. The large spike in realized capital gains that is clearly observed in
1994 is a multiple of the average gains for any other year in the sample.21
     Figure 2(a) plots the fraction of tax filers who report positive net capital
gains each year from 1982-2016. The fraction of Canadian tax filers reporting
  20
      To contrast, output based on regression models does not require that noise be added to
the data or the resulting estimates.
   21
       Appendix Figure D.2 breaks down responses by the amount of reported capital gains
and suggests that the spike in 1994 realizations was not due to a large number of very small
realizations. Most of the spike in 1994 can be attributed to an increase in the number of tax
filers reporting large capital gains.

Notes : The green shaded area marks the period of time (1985-1994) when the LCGE was
available. The red vertical lines indicate the years where the capital gains inclusion rate
changed (from 50% to 66.6% in 1988, from 66.6% to 75% in 1990 and from 75% to 50%
in 2000). The dashed grey line shows evolution of the inflation-adjusted values of the
Standard and Poor's Toronto Stock Exchange Composite Index over the same time period.


positive capital gains has increased substantially over time, from approximately
2.5 percent of all filers in 1982 to nearly 10 percent in recent years. With the
exception of a large spike in 1994, the fraction of tax filers reporting positive
capital gains did not increase materially during the years the LCGE was available.
In the years since the LCGE was eliminated, the fraction of Canadians reporting
positive capital gains has tended to be positively correlated with the performance
of the TSECI.
     Figure 2(b) plots the average realized capital gains (in 1993 dollars) among
tax filers reporting positive gains. After falling from 1982-1984, the average
realized capital gain increased substantially from 1985-1990, before leveling off.
One interpretation of this increase is that the introduction of the LCGE led to
increased realizations among those reporting positive gains. However, another
interpretation is that part of the observed increase may be due to a change in
the composition of those reporting positive gains. Indeed, the fraction reporting

Notes : The green shaded area marks the period of capital gains exemption, 1985-

a positive capital gain fell from about 5 percent in 1984 to just over 2.5 percent
in 1990. Furthermore, the average realized gain by positive contributors fell
substantially after the elimination of the LCGE just as the fraction reporting
positive gains began increasing.
     The series in Figure 2(a) also exhibit small declines in 1988 and 1990, corre-
sponding to the years the inclusion rate increased from 50% to 66.67% and from
66.7% to 75%, respectively. Similarly, there is a clear spike in the series in 2000
when the inclusion rate decreased from 75% to 50%.
     Attributing the annual fluctuations in the series in Figures 1 and 2 to changes
in the tax treatment of capital gains is challenging because of fluctuations in the
business cycle and stock market, changes in the composition of tax filers reporting
capital gains and the fact that there were multiple tax changes in the late 1980s.
This motivates our choice to focus on the 1990-1999 period around the elimination
of the LCGE when the policy environment was otherwise stable. Furthermore,
focusing on this reform allows us to construct a credible comparison group with
which we can compare those affected by the elimination of the LCGE. This is the
focus of our analysis in Section 4.


                                                                                                                                17
4     Causal Analysis
4.1    Identification Approach
The introduction and subsequent elimination of the LCGE dramatically changed
the effective marginal tax rate on capital gains income for most tax filers. The
majority of tax filers report relatively small amounts of capital gains over the
life-cycle (see Figure D.1 in the Online Appendix). For these filers, the $100,000
LCGE limit did not bind so its elimination in 1994 led to a large increase in
the effective marginal tax rate on capital gains income. On the other hand, for
the minority of tax filers with large capital gains, the LCGE created a one-time
windfall that did not change their marginal incentives to realize capital gains.
Our identification strategy exploits the different incentives faced by these groups
around the 1994 elimination of the LCGE. Importantly, there were no other
federal tax changes during this period.
     In our setting, an ideal experiment would involve comparing the annual cap-
ital gains realizations of individuals who, in absence of the cancellation of the
LCGE, would realize less than $100,000 worth of capital gains during their life-
time, to those who would realize more than $100,000. Unfortunately, the lifetime
capital gains of individuals are not observed until they are deceased and tax fil-
ers face uncertainty about their lifetime capital gains (including the uncertainty
about net financial returns which may be affected by changes in tax policy).
Furthermore, the observed realizations of tax filers in the years after 1994 are en-
dogenous to the elimination of the LCGE. Consequently, our empirical strategy
relies on a proxy for lifetime capital gains and, in turn, the likelihood that an
individual was affected by the cancellation of the LCGE.
     We use the sum of reported 1985-1993 capital gains as a proxy for lifetime
capital gains. Let CGit denote tax filer i's reported net capital gain in year t.
Our proxy for lifetime capital gains is P roxyi = 1993
                                                     t=1985 CGit . Our choice of this
proxy is driven by several considerations. First, our proxy is based on pre-1994
capital gains and, therefore, is based on immutable pre-cancellation behavior.
Second, capital gains exhibit strong mean-reversion so proxies based on just a
few years of capital gains realizations are likely to rank individuals incorrectly.
Relying on a large number of years gives us the greatest predictive power for


                                         18
lifetime capital gains.
      We assign tax filers to the comparison group or one of three treatment groups
based on the variable P roxyi . Our control group consists of tax filers whose
1985-1993 capital gains realizations were between $100,000 and $133,333 (1993
dollars).22 The pre-elimination realizations of this group exceeded the LCGE
limit and, therefore, they should be unaffected by the 1994 reform. Tax filers
with values of P roxyi less than $100,000 include both individuals whose ex-
pected future capital gains realizations would see them exceed the LCGE thresh-
old and those whose expected future capital gains realizations would not see
them exceed the LCGE threshold. Since the elimination of the LCGE may
have affected the long-run incentives of these individuals differently, we parti-
tion tax filers whose values of P roxyi are less than $100,000 into three groups:
(i) P roxyi  [$66, 667; $100, 000), (ii) P roxyi  [$33, 334; $66, 667), and (iii)
P roxyi  [$16, 667; $33, 334). We exclude individuals with very small capital
gains in 1985-1993 period from our analysis because they are substantially dif-
ferent from the tax filers in the other treatment and control groups.23 Our treat-
ment groups includes individuals whose 1994 capital gains bring them above the
$100,000 LCGE limit. We intentionally include these individuals in our treat-
ment groups because the decision to report large 1994 gains is endogenous to the
exemption cancellation. Nevertheless, in a robustness checks described in Section
4.3, we show that dropping these filers does not change our results materially.
      The average age of tax filers in all three of our treatment groups is similar
to the average age of tax filers in the comparison group (see Online Appendix
F). This suggests that individuals in all groups are at similar points in the life-
cycle. Consequently, those with lower values of P roxyi are less likely to have
counterfactual capital gains realizations that would see them eventually exceed
the $100,000 LCGE limit. In sensitivity checks described in Section 4.3, we sup-
plement our main regression specifications by restricting the sample to different
age groups (young adults, middle age adults and senior citizens) and by adding
group-by-age fixed effects and year-by-age fixed effects. We show that our results
  22
    The 2016 dollar value of the nominal $100,000 exemption in 1993 was $150,000.
  23
     In particular, tax filers with values of P roxyi below $16,667 are, on average, 10 years
younger than those in the other groups and have annual earnings significantly below the other
groups. Estimates for this group are available upon request.

are qualitatively similar for all age groups and for various ways of accounting for
age/life-cycle differences between tax filers.
     Although we exclude individuals with both very large and very small reported
capital gains during the 1985-1993 period, our analysis sample still comprises tax
filers that account for a large share of annual capital gains. Figure 3(a) shows
that each of our treatment and control groups accounts for between 5% to 20% of
annual capital gains in Canada. Collectively, the tax filers in our analysis sample
(treatment and control) account for nearly 60% of all capital gains reported in
1985-1994, and about 25% in 1995-1999, as shown in Figure 3(b). Figure 3 also
provides indirect support for our empirical strategy: the share of capital gains
attributed to each of our treatment and control groups evolve similarly over time.
The share of national capital gains earned by these groups decreases over time as
they age (tax filers in our treatment and comparison groups were in their early
60s, on average, in 2000).24

a given year that is reported (collectively) by our treated/control groups and by two omitted
groups of tax filers: those with large capital gains and with small capital gains in 1985-1993.

      Figure 3(b) shows that the group of younger tax filers with low 1985-1993 capital gains
(i.e. the P roxyi < $17K group) accounts for an increasing share of national capital gains over
time. This is likely due to a combination of age effects and the fact that this group represents
the vast majority of tax filers in Canada.

 P ositive CGit =  +        · T reatk
                                    i   + t +             · 1t= · T reatk
                                                                        i + Xit + i + eit (2)
                                                t=1990
                                                t=1993


where P ositive CGit is equal to 1 if tax filer i reports positive capital gains in
year t and zero otherwise. Our estimates of  in both equations (1) and (2) are
unbiased if the counterfactual capital gains realizations of tax filers in the treated
groups would have followed the path of the realizations of those in the control
group after the removal of the LCGE in 1994 (i.e. parallel trends). Below, we
present evidence suggesting that this assumption is plausible in our setting.

     Estimates for specifications where the dependent variable is in levels are qualitatively
similar and are available in Appendix Figure E.1. Specifications with individual fixed effects
absorb term T reati and any time-invariant controls Xi .

Figure 4(a) plots the average values of the natural logarithm of $1 + CGit ,
separately for tax filers in the different treatment groups and the control group.
Figures 4(b) and (c) plot average capital gains for those reporting positive values
and the fraction of tax filers that report positive capital gains, respectively.
     Figure 4 confirms that, on average, individuals with higher values of P roxyi
realize more capital gains and are more likely to report positive capital gains each
year. This suggests that our proxy for lifetime capital gains correctly ranks tax
filers. Furthermore, while we see a pronounced spike in the amount of capital
gains reported by tax filers in the treated groups (i.e. individuals with P roxyi

                                                                                                                                  22
of less than $100,000) in 1994, the control group continues to follow its pre-1994
trend. This behavior is consistent with tax filers in the control group having no
tax-incentive to report large capital gains in 1994 because they already exhausted
their LCGE limit.
      Figure 4 also allows us to evaluate the plausibility of the parallel trends
assumption by comparing the evolution of the pre-1994 capital gains realizations
of tax filers in the treatment and control groups. Reassuringly, the pre-1994
trends in all three treatment groups and the comparison group are stable. Online
Appendix F provides further evidence on the plausibility of the parallel trends
assumption by showing that the demographic characteristics of tax filers in the
treatment and control groups evolved similarly around 1994.
      Having presented the raw data, we are now ready to report the estimates
from our regression specifications. The  estimates (and the resulting confi-
dence intervals) from specifications (1) and (2) are presented in Figures 5-7. The
coefficients presented are based on a specification that include the individual con-
trols (gender, age, age squared, family type, number of children, postal code fixed
effects), group fixed effects and year fixed effects but does not include individ-
ual fixed effects. Although our estimates are similar with and without individual
fixed effects, we exclude them in our baseline model because capital gains realiza-
tions are infrequent. This leads to noisier estimates, especially in specifications
that restrict the sample to tax filers with positive realizations. In our baseline
specifications, we also do not include controls for total (broad) income because it
is mechanically correlated with the dependent variable. Nevertheless, Appendix
Figures E.2 and E.3 in the Online Appendix present estimates from specifica-
tions that include the individual fixed effects and income controls, respectively.
Reassuringly, our results are robust to the inclusion of these controls.
      Figure 5 plots the  estimates when the dependent variable is the natural
logarithm of $1 plus the realized capital gains and the sample is all tax filers in
the treatment and control groups. Three things stand out in this figure. First, the
realized capital gains of tax filers in each of the treated groups evolved in a similar
way as the control group in the years leading up to the cancellation of the LCGE
(even after controlling for individual demographic characteristics). Second, the
realized capital gains of filers in all three treatment groups increases significantly

Notes : Figure 5 plots the estimates of coefficients  from estimating specification (1)
described in Section 4.1 when the dependent variable is the natural logarithm of un-
conditional realized capital gains (i.e. $1 plus CGit ). In all panels, the control group
is tax filers with values of P roxyi  [100, 000, 133, 333). The treatment group in the
left panel is tax filers with values of P roxyi  [66, 667, 100, 000). The treatment group
in the middle (resp. right) panel is tax filers with values of P roxyi  [33, 334, 66, 667)
(resp. P roxyi  [16, 667, 33, 334)). Number of observations: 289,735; 525,650; 596,595.


relative to the control group in 1994 (the omitted interaction term is for 1993).
The coefficient estimates of approximately 0.8-1.0 suggest that tax filers in the
treatment groups increased their capital gains realizations by 80 to 100 percent
relative to the control group from 1993 to 1994. Third, the  estimates during
the 1995-1999 years are either close to zero or small and positive. These estimates
suggest that the cancellation of the LCGE had no effect on the medium/long-run
capital gains realizations of tax filers in the highest treatment group (i.e. P roxyi 
[$66, 667, $100, 000)) and a modest positive effect on medium/long-run capital
gains realizations of those in the medium (i.e. P roxyi  [$33, 335, $66, 667)) and
low (i.e. P roxyi  [$16, 667, $33, 334) treatment groups.
     Our estimates of the short-run effects of the elimination of the LCGE in 1994
are consistent with prior evidence that capital gains realizations are relatively
easy to manipulate and re-time in the short-run (Burman and Randolph (1994);
Auerbach and Siegel (2000); Agersnap and Zidar (2020)). The short-run response
to the removal of the LCGE we estimate is large in magnitude. This is not
surprising because tax filers did not have to sell their assets to take advantage
of the crystallization opportunity provided by the government. In spite of this
opportunity, only 10% of all taxpayers reported positive net capital gains in
1994. A likely explanation is the fact that only those with paper gains as of
February 1994 were able to take advantage of the crystallization opportunity.


                                                                                                                                                             24
Moreover, the fact that the capital gains form financial assets were reported to
the Canada Revenue Agency by third parties (i.e. banks and brokerages) made
the false reporting of capital gains risky for certain assets. Since we do not
observe the portfolios of tax filers (and, therefore, their unrealized paper gains),
we cannot determine the extent to which indivduals left money on the table by
failing to take advantage of the 1994 crystalization opportunity.
     The estimates reported in Figure 5 suggest that the cancellation of the LCGE
did not lead to a large drop in reported realized capital gains in the medium-to-
long run. Rather, our estimates suggest a small, statistically insignificant effect
for individuals with values of P roxyi  [66, 667, 100, 000) and an approximately
25% increase for tax filers with P roxyi  [16, 667, 33, 333). All else equal, an
increase in the effective marginal tax rate on capital gains income should lead tax
filers to substitute away from reporting realized taxable gains. The fact that we
do not observe a decrease in realized capital gains for any of the treatment groups
suggests that the income/wealth effects arising from the removal of the LCGE
offset the substitution effect. The importance of income/wealth effects appears to
be especially important for tax filers with substantial unused exemption space at
the time the LCGE was cancelled. In Appendix C, we develop three theoretical
models of capital gains realization behavior and show that the income/wealth
effect affects responses to capital gains taxes along the savings, spending and
portfolio asset allocation decision margins. We discuss these models further in
Section 5.
     We also explored the extent to which our estimates on unconditional realized
taxable gains can be explained by responses along the extensive and intensive
margins. Figures 6 and 7 present estimates of the effect of the cancellation of
the LCGE on average positive capital gains realizations and the likelihood of
reporting positive capital gains realizations, respectively. Our estimates suggest
that the cancellation of the LCGE increased the fraction of tax filers in the treat-
ment groups with P roxyi  [66, 667, 100, 000) and P roxyi  [33, 334, 66, 667)
reporting positive realized capital gains by approximately 7.5 percentage points
in 1994, with no statistically significant change in the medium/long-run. Fur-
thermore, our estimates for these two treatment groups suggest that the average
capital gains among those with positive realizations fell by approximately 10


                                        25
percent relative to the control group. However, our intensive margin estimates
for these treatment groups are often not statistically significant at conventional
levels.

Notes : Notes : Figure 6 plots the estimates of coefficients  from estimating specification
(2) described in Section 4.1 when the dependent variable is equal to 1 if a tax filer reports
positive realized capital gains in a given year and zero otherwise. In all panels, the con-
trol group is tax filers with values of P roxyi  [100, 000, 133, 333). The treatment group
in the left panel is tax filers with values of P roxyi  [66, 667, 100, 000). The treatment
group in the middle (resp. right) panel is tax filers with values of P roxyi  [33, 334, 66, 667)
(resp. P roxyi  [16, 667, 33, 334)). Number of observations: 289,735; 525,650; 596,595.


     For the P roxyi  [16, 667, 33, 334) treatment group, our estimates suggest
that the cancellation of the LCGE increased the likelihood of reporting positive
capital gains by 7.5 percentage points in the short-run and by less than 2.5
percentage points after 3-5 years. Our intensive margin estimates suggest that
the average positive gains of this treatment group increased by approximately
125% in 1994 and by 25%-30% over the following 3-5 years.
     Taken together, our results suggest that in the short-run, the effects of the
elimination of the LCGE on unconditional capital gains are remarkably similar
for all three treatment groups. Moreover, the responses along the intensive and
extensive margins are similar for all three treatment groups in 1994. Over the
medium and long-run, however, the effects of the elimination of the LCGE are
heterogeneous and vary across the three treatment groups. For tax filers with
1985-1993 capital gains close to the $100,000 limit, the cancellation of the LCGE
had no effect on the likelihood of reporting positive capital gains and a modest
negative but statistically insignificant effect on the amount of realized capital
gains reported. To contrast, the cancellation of the LCGE increased both the
likelihood of reporting positive capital gains and the average positive realized

4.3                                               Robustness Checks and Heterogeneity Analysis
In this section we discuss potential threats to our identification assumptions and
present the results from a number of sensitivity checks. Broadly speaking, threats
to our identification assumptions can be separated into one of three categories:
(i) mechanical bias in our estimates due to re-timing responses, (ii) bias due to
the misclassification of some tax filers in the treatment groups, and (iii) bias due
to the presence of mean-reversion. Towards the end of the section, we discuss how
responses to the elimination of the LCGE varied with individuals' demographic
characteristics.

run effects of the LCGE are mechanically biased downwards because some in-
dividuals may have brought forward to 1994 realizations that would have been
realized in the 1995-1999 period or later. However, to the extent that our  es-


                                                                                                                                                             27
timates are mechanically biased because of this re-timing behavior, this suggests
that the `true' medium- and long-run responses to capital gains taxes are even
more positive than we find.
     Misclassification. Another potential threat to our estimates of the short-
run and long-run sensitivity of capital gains realizations to taxes is that we could
be mistakenly classifying some tax filers as treated when they should be allocated
to the control group. In particular, some tax filers with 1985-1993 capital gains
less than $100,000 might have been holding substantial unrealized capital gains
at the time of the 1994 reform. These individuals might very well have exceeded
the LCGE limit during the 1995-1999 period in the absence of the reform. For
these filers, the removal of the LCGE created an incentive to bring forward future
unrealized capital gains but did not affect their expected future effective marginal
tax rate. The presence of these individuals in our treatment groups attenuates
our estimates because some treated tax filers did not experience a change in their
long-run incentive to realize capital gains.
     We assess the importance of this potential misclassification on our baseline
estimates in three ways. First, the likelihood of misclassifying tax filers as treated
in the way mentioned above should decrease as we consider individuals with lower
values of the P roxyi (i.e. those with smaller 1985-1993 realized capital gains).
This is supported by the fact that tax filers in all three treatment and control
groups are similar in age and, therefore, are likely to be at similar points in the
life-cycle (see Figure F.1 in the Online Appendix). Provided that the control
group is a good counterfactual for those with low 1985-1993 realizations (i.e. the
P roxyi  [16, 667, 33, 334) treatment group), our empirical strategy still allows
us to identify the long-run response of realizations to capital gains taxes. Our
estimates in Figures 5 ­ 7 make clear that the medium and long-run responses
to the cancellation of the LCGE are larger in magnitude (and positive) for tax
filers with low 1985-1993 realizations, precisely those for whom we are the least
likely to misclassify.
     A second way to assess the potential misclassification of treated individuals
is to restrict the sample to tax filers whose cumulative pre-1994 realizations are a
more accurate proxy for their lifetime gains. Arguably, the pre-1994 realizations
of older tax filers are a better proxy for their lifetime gains. In Figure 8, we

scribed in Section 4.1 when the dependent variable is the natural logarithm of uncondi-
tional realized capital gains (i.e. $1 plus CGit ) and the sample is restricted to tax fil-
ers over age 65. In Panel B, the sample is further restricted to tax filers with posi-
tive realized capital gains income. In all panels, the control group is tax filers with val-
ues of P roxyi  [100, 000, 133, 333). The treatment group in the left panel is tax fil-
ers with values of P roxyi  [66, 667, 100, 000). The treatment group in the middle
(resp. right) panel is tax filers with values of P roxyi  [33, 334, 66, 667) (resp. P roxyi 
[16, 667, 33, 334)). Number of observations in Panel A (left, middle, right): 109,120; 192,410;

restrict the sample to tax filers over age 65. These filers are likely in the asset
decumulation phase of the life-cycle and are less likely to be misclassified.26 Our
results are qualitatively similar to those reported in Figures 5 ­ 7. In particular,
the cancellation of the LCGE approximately doubled the realized capital gains
of tax filers in all treatment groups in 1994. The cancellation of the LCGE had
no statistically significant effect on the realizations of tax filers with high pre-
reform capital gains (i.e. those with P roxyi  [66, 667, 100, 000)). To contrast,
the cancellation of the LCGE increased the medium- and long-run realizations of
those with low 1985-1993 capital gains.
     As a third sensitivity check against the potential misclassification concern, we

drop individuals whose 1994 capital gains bring them above the $100,000 LCGE
limit. This leads to an approximately 18% drop in the sample. Perhaps not
surprisingly, tax filers with higher values of P roxyi (and, therefore, less unused
exemption space) were more likely to be dropped than filers with modest 1985-
1993 realizations. Intuitively, by dropping filers that were easily able to exhaust
their unused LCGE space in 1994, we are left with tax filers in the treatment group
that definitely experienced an increase to their medium-run and long-run effective
marginal tax rate on capital gains income. The results from this sensitivity check
are reported in Online Appendix Figure E.4. Reassuringly, our estimates are very
similar (especially for those with modest 1985-1993 realizations).
     Mean-reversion. A third concern is that capital gains realizations are
likely to be mean-reverting. Mean reversion could be problematic in our setting
since our treatment and control groups are defined based on past capital gains
realizations. To alleviate this concern, we defined our treatment and control
groups based on capital gains over a nine year period (i.e. 1985-1993). This
relatively long horizon should reduce the likelihood that our estimates are biased
due to mean reversion. The estimates presented in Figures 5 ­ 7 support this
view. In particular, there is no evidence that the pre-trends of tax filers in any of
the treatment groups are converging or diverging from those of the comparison
group. In order for mean reversion to bias our results, it would have to be the
case that the realizations of tax filers in all treated groups (with fewer1985-1983
capital gains) began increasing compared to the control group (whose 1985-1993
gains were higher) precisely in 1994, even after following a similar path in the
preceding years.
     We present evidence from additional checks against mean reversion in the
Online Appendix. In Appendix Figure E.5, we extend the event window from
1990-1999 to 1984-2006. Recall that our main analysis focuses on the 1990-1999
period because no other tax changes occurred during these years. Our estimates
based on the wider 1984-2006 window are noisier, but provide strong evidence
against mean-reversion trends for our treated and control groups. Second, we
consider specifications that attempt to control more flexibly for age/life-cycle
effects. In Online Appendix Figure E.6, we present estimates that replace the
cubic polynomial in age with P roxyi × Age and Y ear × Age fixed effects. It is

4.3.2     Heterogeneity Analysis

Figure 9 investigates how capital gains responses vary by marital status. In
Canada, the tax unit is the individual rather than the couple or family. As a
result, capital income derived from assets that are jointly-held can can be claimed
by either spouse. This provides an additional margin along which tax filers can
respond to changes in tax rates on capital gains income.27 The left (resp. right)
panel in Figure 9 presents estimates from specification (1) when the sample is
restricted to married (resp. single) tax filers. For ease of presentation, we pool

Notes : Figure 10(a) plots the likelihood of reporting positive capital gains income over
time for two groups: tax filers that report no realizations in the past 6 years (open mark-
ers) and those that report some realizations in the past 6 years (dark markers). Fig-
ure 10(b) plots average realized capital gains income over time for the same two groups.
The green shaded area marks the period of capital gains exemption, 1985-1994. The
red vertical lines mark capital gains inclusion rate changes: increase from 50% to 66.6%
and further to 75% in 1988 and 1990; and a decrease from 75% to 50% in 2000.


     We also explore whether the 1994 re-timing response is driven by "frequent"
or "infrequent" realizers. Our definition of frequent realizers is tax filers who
report positive realized capital gains in any of the preceding 6 years (calculated
on a rolling basis). Figure 10(a) plots the fraction of tax filers that report posi-
tive realized capital gains each year from 1982-2016, separately for frequent and
infrequent realizers.29 While frequent realizers are more likely to realize capital
gains in any given year, the re-timing response is larger for infrequent realizers.
For infrequent realizers, the likelihood of reporting positive capital gains income
increases from around 1 percent in the early 1990s to approximately 5 percent
in 1994, an increase of 500 percent. To contrast, among frequent realizers, the
likelihood of reporting positive capital gains income increases only by approxi-
mately 150 percent (from about 2 to 5 percentage points) over the same period.

    We presents estimates for each treatment group separately in Appendix Figure E.8.
              29
    Figure D.3 in the Online Appendix presents similar figures for tax filers in different age
groups using the same "frequent realizer" definition.

                                                                                                           32
Furthermore, Figure 10(a) shows that frequent realizers appear to be driving the
increase in the participation in capital markets in the late 1990s and 2000s. We
find similar patterns for average realized capital gains; on average, infrequent re-
alizers experienced a larger change in realized capital gains in 1994 than frequent
realizers (see Figure 10(b)).
     A limitation of our tax return data is that it does not allow us to discern
whether the differing 1994 re-timing responses between frequent and infrequent
realizers is driven by differences in savings behavior, differences in the baseline
asset allocations or differences in the frequency of adjusting their portfolios, con-
ditional on asset allocation. The ability to crystalize gains by filling out form
T664 in 1994 made it beneficial for all investors to report capital gains in 1994.
     Finally, we also investigate whether the cancellation of the LCGE led to sub-
stitution away from capital gains income and towards other types of investment
income, such as interest and dividend income or contributions to tax-deferred
RRSPs. Appendix Figure G.2 presents the  estimates for these specifications.
The results suggest that the cancellation of the LCGE had no statistically signif-
icant effect on dividend income receipt. The estimates for investment (interest)
income are inconclusive as the pre-trends are stable for specifications with some
treatment groups but not others. Given that we do not estimate statistically
significant long-run effects of the cancellation of the LCGE for most treatment
groups, it is not surprising that we do not detect economically meaningful effects
on other dependent variables.


5     Implied Elasticities and Interpretation of the
      Results
In this section we convert our event study estimates into elasticities and dis-
cuss the results. To facilitate a comparison of our estimates with those in the
literature, we report a number of different elasticity concepts.
     Elasticity estimates. Some papers in the literature report estimates of the
elasticity of realizations with respect to the marginal tax rate on capital gains
                       log(CG)
income. Let e1 =        log(CG )
                                 denote this elasticity. To calculate this elasticity,
we need to divide our difference-in-differences  estimates by the corresponding

                                         33
percentage change in CG . However, the removal of the LCGE increased the
effective marginal tax rate on capital gains income from a baseline of zero. As
a result, log (CG ) is not defined in our setting. To overcome this, we assume
that the behavioral response to the removal of the LCGE is symmetric. In other
words, we compute e1 assuming that the response to the cancellation of the
LCGE is equal to -1 times the response to a tax decrease from CG to zero (i.e.
log (CG )  1). The second elasticity concept we report is the percentage change
in realized capital gains income in response to a one percent increase in the net-of-
tax rate: e2 =      log(CG)
                  log(1-CG )
                             . This concept is used in a recent study by Agersnap and
Zidar (2020). The third elasticity concept we report is e3 =        log(CG)
                                                                      CG
                                                                            . This semi-
elasticity measures the percentage change in realized capital gains in response to
a one percentage point increase in the effective marginal tax rate on capital gains
income.
     Table 2 reports elasticity estimates for all three concepts. We report elastic-
ities for all three treatment groups for the total (unconditional) response to the
cancellation of the LCGE, as well as the intensive and extensive margin responses.
The numerators for the total unconditional (resp. intensive margin) elasticities
use the  estimates from Figure 5 (resp. Figure 7). The numerators for the
extensive margin elasticities are the  estimates from Figure 6 and the baseline
participation rates in 1993: %P ositive CG =  /P ositive CG1993 . Standard
errors for each elasticity are calculated using the delta method.
     Table 2 reports elasticity estimates for all three treatment groups and for
three horizons: the short-run, the medium-run and the long-run. Our short-run
elasticity estimate is based on the 1994 (re-timing) response to the cancellation
of the LCGE. The medium-run (resp. long-run) elasticity estimate measures the
percentage change in 1997 (resp. 1999) realizations (i.e. 3 and 5 years after the
cancellation of the LCGE, respectively). Note that the e2 elasticity concept will
be of a different sign than the e1 and e3 concepts. This is because the former
measures the percentage change in realizations with respect to a one percent
increase in the net-of-tax rate 1 - CG , while the latter measure how realizations
change when the marginal tax rate increases. For brevity, the discussion below
will focus on the e2 elasticity concept.
     Our short-run elasticity estimates for all three treatment groups are large in

Notes : This table calculates elasticities of capital gains with respect to the marginal ef-
fective tax rate on capital income using three different concepts: e1 =  log(CG), e2 =
   log(CG)                 log(CG)
 log(1-CG ) , and e3 =      CG .      The total (unconditional) and intensive margin elas-
ticities are based on the  log(CG) =  estimates in Figures 5 and 7. Extensive
margin elasticities are calculating using the same formula but with %P ositive CG =
P ositive CG/P ositive1993 =  /P ositive1993 . %P ositive CG is calculated by divid-
ing the P ositive CG =  estimates in Figure 6 by 1993 average of P ositive CG (0.36,
0.31 and 0.30 respectively). Standard errors are calculated using the delta method.




                                            35
magnitude. For the total response to the cancellation of the LCGE, our short-run
elasticity estimates range from 2.8 to 3.6. Tax filers with low 1985-1993 realiza-
tions (i.e. those with P roxyi  [16, 667, 33, 334)) are more elastic than filers with
high pre-reform realizations. As discussed in Section 4.2, the total response to
the cancellation of the LCGE is driven by responses on the intensive and exten-
sive margins, although the former is larger in magnitude for all treatment groups.
Interestingly, the short-run elasticities we estimate in Table 2 are similar to the
short-run (i.e. 0-2 year) elasticity estimates for the United States in Agersnap
and Zidar (2020). In a recent review, Stantcheva (2020) notes that prior work
finds that the e1 elasticity ranges from -6.4 to -1.1. Our short-run elasticities for
this elasticity concept range from -1.09 to -0.89 (see column 1).
     Our medium-run (resp. long-run) e2 estimates range from -0.66 to 0.1 (resp.
-1.12 to -0.16). As noted earlier, elasticity estimates are more negative for tax
filers with low values of P roxyi and closer to zero for tax filers with relatively high
1985-1993 realizations. Using the e1 concept, our medium-run (resp. long-run)
estimates range from -0.03 to 0.2 (resp. 0.05 to 0.34). These estimates are closer
to the high end of the -1.7 to 0 range cited in Stantcheva (2020).
     Interpretation of the results. Our negative estimates of the e2 long-
run elasticity of capital gains realizations with respect to the net-of-tax rate
is consistent with the wealth affect arising from the elimination of the LCGE
being relatively important. In Appendix C, we consider three simple models,
each of which focuses on one decision margin that drives realized capital gains
income. Comparative statics from all three models indicate that that capital
gains realizations may increase or decrease following a marginal tax rate increase
due to offsetting substitution and income/wealth effects.
     The first model is used to predict the response along the savings margin. In
this model, an increase in capital gains tax rate reduces savings via a substitution
effect but increases savings via an income/wealth effect. Briefly, higher marginal
tax rates cause lifetime wealth to fall by an amount proportional to counterfactual
unrealized capital gains. This decrease in lifetime wealth may lead to increased
levels of savings and, ultimately, higher future capital gains.
     The second model focuses on spenders ­ individuals with large portfolios who
are in the process of consuming their wealth. For these individuals, an increase


                                          36
in capital gains tax makes future consumption more expensive. The substitu-
tion effect then shifts consumption into the current period, thus implying lower
capital gains realizations in the future. On the other hand, the income/wealth
effect motivates agents to decrease current consumption in order to smooth con-
sumption in the future. In this model, consumption smoothing is achieved via
lowering capital gains in the current period and increasing capital gains income
in the future. Once again, capital gains realizations may increase or decrease
depending on the relative magnitudes of the income and substitution effects.
     Finally, the third model focuses on portfolio asset allocation decisions. In this
model, capital gains realizations depend on the fraction of an agent's portfolio
that is allocated to equities versus fixed income assets (that pay interest income).
Assuming that fixed income assets are not taxed (i.e. bonds are always held un-
til maturity), higher capital gains taxes imply lower rewards to holding equities.
Holding wealth constant, this leads to less equity holding and fewer capital gains
realizations. At the same time, lower after-tax returns make it harder for indi-
viduals to achieve any desired level of consumption, necessitating an increase in
equity holding higher capital gains realizations.
     Although we don't observe the portfolios of tax filers and cannot isolate the
mechanism driving the positive response to the removal of the LCGE, the mod-
els presented in Appendix C provide a theoretical foundation for our empirical
results.


6     Conclusion
In this paper, we present estimates of the causal effect of the 1994 cancellation
of the $100,000 LCGE in Canada on realized capital gains and other types of
capital income. Comparing tax filers who did not exhaust their LCGE limit to
those that did, before and after the 1994 reform, we find that the unexpected
cancellation of the exemption led to an immediate spike in realized capital gains
in 1994 as tax filers exhausted their remaining LCGE space. We also find that
the cancellation of the LCGE increased realized capital gains in the medium
and long-run for tax filers with small pre-reform capital gains. In contrast, we
estimate that the elimination of the LCGE had no statistically significant effect


                                         37
on the realization behavior of tax filers with larger pre-1994 capital gains. Our
results are similar, qualitatively and quantitatively, when we restrict the sample
to young, middle-age and older tax filers, respectively. Moreover, our estimates
are similar for married and single tax filers.
      Taken together, our results suggest that despite increasing the marginal ef-
fective tax rate on capital gains income for most tax filers, the elimination of the
LCGE had little effect on capital gains realizations in the long run. We also find
little evidence of substitution away from capital gains and towards other types
of investment income, such as interest income and dividends.
      One interpretation of our results is that the unexpected cancellation of the
LCGE led to a large, negative wealth shock that offset the incentive for tax filers
to substitute away from capital gains income. This wealth shock was largest for
those with the most unused exemption space (i.e. those with modest pre-reform
capital gains) and it is precisely this group that experienced the largest increase
in realizations in the post-1994 period. While this explanation can reconcile our
results, we remain cautious because it is possible that individuals with different
pre-reform capital gains may have different underlying structural parameters (risk
aversion, discount factors etc.) and it is these differences that are driving the
heterogeneity in our estimates.

B     Changes in the Fraction of Individuals Filing
      a Tax Return
Section 2 of the main paper describes the Longitudinal Administrative Databank
(LAD) that we use. The LAD is a panel dataset of tax returns for a random 20
percent sample of Canadian tax filers. Each year, a randomly selected 20 percent
of new Canadian tax filers are selected into the LAD. Once selected, tax filers
are followed until they cease to file a tax return (i.e. upon death or emigration
from Canada). Thus, the size of the LAD sample grows proportionately with the
Canadian population and the fraction of residents that file a tax return.
     The introduction of two refundable tax credits in the late 1980s increased
the fraction of Canadian residents that file a tax return each year and, therefore,
the size of the LAD sample. We argue that the increase in the number of tax
filers is unlikely to have a large effect on our estimates. The Federal Sales Tax
(FST) Credit (introduced in 1986) and the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Credit
(introduced in 1989) reduce the net tax liabilities of low-income tax filers and help
to dampen the regressivity of the federal value-added tax in Canada (formerly the
FST, now the GST). Receipt of these tax credits is only available to low-income
earners that file a tax return. Figure B.1 shows that the number of tax filers in
the LAD increased sharply following the introduction of the tax credits in 1986
and 1989. Notably, the increase in the number of tax filers in these years was
immediate and the growth in the LAD sample was stable after 1990. Since our
baseline estimates are based on an event window from 1990-1999, it is unlikely
that the increase in the fraction of Canadian residents filing a tax return in the
1980s will affect our results. Furthermore, the increase in the likelihood of filing
a tax return was concentrated among those with low-incomes and not moderate
and high income earners who claim a large fraction of capital gains income.

C        Theoretical Model
In this Appendix, we set out three theoretical models that help us interpret our
empirical results. The intuition for developing three different models stems from
the desire to isolate the three economic choices that determine an individual's
realized capital gains in any given year. Generally speaking, the capital gains
realizations of an individual in year t depend on (i) their past savings choices
(i.e. their past decisions to defer income/consumption to the future; (ii) their
choice about when to realize capital gains income on their existing assets; and
(iii) their past portfolio asset allocation decisions. Changes to capital gains taxes
may affect the choices of individuals along all three of these margins.
      In order to isolate the impact of capital gains taxes on each of these margins,
we develop three models, each of which focuses on one margin. Below, we show
that capital gains taxes have a theoretically ambiguous effect on all three mar-
gins (savings, asset draw down and portfolio asset allocation). We discuss how
offsetting substitution and income/wealth effects lead to this result. Two of the
most important parameters governing the income/wealth effects in our models
are risk aversion/diminishing marginal utility and the agent's initial asset level.
      While our models are (very) stylized, they provide a useful lens through which
to interpret our empirical results. Admittedly, more complicated (and possibly
realistic) models that incorporate dynamics and interactions between the three
aforementioned choices might add more nuance to the theoretical results below.
However, we argue that the stylized models presented below provide a simple
and intuitive way of illustrating the economic forces at work following a change
in capital gains tax rates.


C.1        Capital Gains Realizations of Individuals ("Savers")
Consider a simple 2-period model. In each period an individual earns exogenous
labor income yt ; furthermore, in period 1, the individual is endowed with ex-
ogenous assets A1 . These assets, together with any savings that the individual
chooses to undertake, grow at the exogenous real return rate r and are subject
to capital gains tax  .30 For simplicity, we assume no discounting. The individ-

      For ease of exposition, we assume that labor income is not taxable.

                             = u(y1 - s1 ) + u(y2 + (A1 + s1 )(1 + r(1 -  ))).

With exogenous labor income, the individual's problem simplifies to choosing
their optimal level savings s1 . The first order conditions with respect to s1 is:

                         dU
                             = -u (c1 ) + u (c2 )(1 + r(1 -  )) = 0.              (3)
                         ds1

     With a two-period model, we assume that the agent sells all of their assets
and realizes all of their capital gains in period 2. Realized capital gains are equal
to the agent's total asset position (initial assets plus period 1 savings) multiplied
by the exogenous return rate: CG2 = (A1 + s1 )r. Thus, in this model realized
capital gains in period 2 are determined by the agents initial assets and their
period 1 savings decision. However, only the latter is under the agent's control
so the effect of a change in the capital gains rate  is proportional to the effect
of the tax on period 1 savings: dCG  d
                                       2
                                          = r ds
                                              d
                                                 1
                                                   . In order to determine the sign of
ds1 /d , we differentiate (3) with respect to  , which yields:

          ds1          ds1
u (c1 )       +u (c2 )     (1 + r(1 -  ))+ (A1 + s1 )(-r) (1+r(1- ))+u (c2 )(-r) = 0.
          d            d

Rearranging, we find

                      ds1   u (c2 )r + u (c2 )(A1 + s1 )r(1 + r(1 -  ))
                          =                                             .         (4)
                      d           u (c1 ) + u (c2 )(1 + r(1 -  ))2

Assuming that the individual experiences diminishing marginal utility of con-
sumption, the denominator of (4) is negative. The sign of the numerator is
theoretically ambiguous and depends on the relative magnitudes of the sub-
stitution effect (SE), captured by u (c2 )r, and an income/wealth effect (IE),
u (c2 )(A1 + s1 )r(1 + r(1 -  )). Notably, the latter term is larger in absolute
value when realized capital gains (i.e (A1 + s1 )r) are larger and when agents are


                                                  47
more risk averse.
     The ambiguous response of savings to capital gains taxation implies that
capital gain realizations may increase or decrease in response to a capital gain tax
increase. If the substitution effect dominates, individuals will save less and will
report less capital gains in the future. On the other hand, if the income/wealth
effect dominates, individuals will save more in order to offset the negative effect
of taxes on their lifetime wealth. This will lead to higher future capital gains
realizations.


C.2     Capital Gains Realizations of Retirees ("Spenders")
In the previous model, we explicitly interpreted s1 as flow savings (i.e income
deferred for future consumption). Positive savings are likely to be optimal for
individuals with relatively large labor income y1 and relatively small assets A1
and/or relatively small future labor earnings y2 . In that case, the amount of
observed capital gains realizations depends on the period 1 savings decisions of
the individual.
     However, for individuals with large assets A1 , optimal "savings" s1 are likely
to be negative. In other words, instead of saving, these individuals will choose
to actively draw down their wealth. Even if the agent optimally chooses to draw
down their wealth (i.e negative s1 ), the theoretically ambiguous sign of ds1 /d
from subsection C.1 will still hold. A small increase to the capital gains tax rate 
may increase or decrease asset draw down (i.e. increase or decrease s1 . In this case,
capital gains realizations will be driven by the agent's draw down and spending
decisions. On one hand, an increase in  makes second period consumption
expensive which will incentive the agent to shift consumption to period 1 and
lower period 2 capital gains realizations. On the other hand, the higher capital
gains tax will decrease the agent's lifetime wealth. All else equal, the wealth effect
will induce the agent to increase s1 , decrease the draw down of assets, increase
period 2 capital gains realizations and increase period 2 consumption. Whether
s1 (i.e. asset draw down) will increase or decrease will depend on which of these
effects dominates.

C.3       Capital Gains Realizations of Portfolio Optimizers
The third channel that affects capital gains realizations is an agent's portfolio
asset allocation choices. Consider an individual who is endowed with some ex-
ogenous starting wealth A0 and chooses how to allocate her portfolio across two
assets: a risk-less bond with return rb and a risky equity with stochastic returns
rL and rH such that (1 -  )rL < rb < (1 -  )rH . In other words, we assume that
the risky returns are subject to capital gains tax  while risk-less fixed income
returns are tax-free. Finally, we assume that the high-state occurs with proba-
bility p  (0, 1). The individual decides which share of her portfolio   [0, 1]
should be allocated to the risky asset by maximizing her expected utility31 :

  max E [U (c)] = p u[cH ] + (1 - p)u[cL ]
       

                  = p u[A0 (1 + rH (1 -  )) + A0 (1 - )(1 + rb )]
                                + (1 - p)u[A0 (1 + rL (1 -  )) + A0 (1 - )(1 + rb )].

The first order condition for  is:

  U
    = pu (cH )[A0 (rH (1 -  ) - rb )] + (1 - p)u (cL )[A0 (rL (1 -  ) - rb )] = 0. (5)
  

     The individual's choice of  determines their capital gains realizations in the
high and low state: CGi = A0 ri , i  {L, H }. Thus, the impact of capital gains
taxes on realizations depends on whether it increases or decreases the fraction
                                                   i
of the agent's portfolio allocated to equities: dCG
                                                 d
                                                     = A0 ri d
                                                             d
                                                               . Differentiating the
first corder condition (5) with respect to  gives

                            
  pu (cH )A2   H           b 2
           0 (r (1 -  ) - r ) ·- pu (cH )A2   H           b  H       H
                                          0 (r (1 -  ) - r )r - pu (c )A0 r
                                                                            H

              0 (r (1- )-r ) ·   -(1-p)u (cL )A2     L       b   L            L  L
                                                 0 (r (1- )-r )r -(1-p)u (c )A0 r = 0
                               
  31
    Assuming that the after-tax real return to equities in the low state, rL (1 -  ), is less than
the risk-free return to bonds, rb , ensures an interior solution for .




                                               49
Rearranging,

        prH [u (cH )A0 (rH (1 -  ) - rb ) + u (cH )] + (1 - p)rL [u (cL )A0 (rL (1 -  ) - rb ) + u (cL )]
     =                                                                                                    .
                     pu (cH )A0 (rH (1 -  ) - rb )2 + (1 - p)u (cL )A0 (rL (1 -  ) - rb )2
                                                                                   (6)
Note that rH (1 -  ) - rb > 0 since otherwise individuals would never invest in risky
assets. Assuming that the utility function u(c) is strictly concave, u (c) > 0 and
u (c) < 0. Consequently, the denominator of (6) is negative while the numerator
may be either positive or negative. Intuitively, higher capital gains taxes imply
lower rewards to holding equities in both the high and low state. This leads
the agent to allocate less of their portfolio to equities and lower capital gains
realizations. At the same time, the lower after-tax returns to equities generate
a negative wealth effect. When capital gains taxes increase, it is harder for
risk-averse investors to hit a target level of assets. This tends to increase equity
holding and leads to larger capital gains realizations. An examination of equation
(6) makes clear that the wealth effect is large when the capital gains tax rate is
initially low, when the return to equities in the high state is large (compared to
the return to bonds) and when the investor is risk-averse.
     Once again, capital gains realizations may increase or decrease in response
to a capital gains tax increase, depending on the relative magnitudes of the
income/wealth and substitution effects.


D      Additional Time Series Evidence
D.1     Capital Gains Realizations Over The Life-cycle
Figure D.1 uses information on the cohort of tax filers that were 30-35 years old in
1982 to illustrate how capital gains realizations evolve over the life-cycle. Focusing
on this cohort allows us to observe how capital gains realization behavior changes
over long 36-year period (from 1982-2016). Figure D.1(a) plots the fraction of
individuals in this cohort who ever reported positive capital gains by age, while
Figure D.1(b) plots the average value of the cumulative "lifetime" capital gains
by age. Figure D.1 shows that over a 36 year period, just under 50% of tax
filers in this cohort report positive capital gains on their tax return at least once.


                                           50
However, for most tax filers, the value of their cumulative capital gains are quite
small. At the median (not shown), the average "lifetime" capital gains are zero;
at the 75th percentile, the average "lifetime" capital gains are $100,000; at the
99th percentile, the average is at just above $500,000 (all 1993 dollars). Thus
for the majority of individuals in Canada, a $100,000 LCGE was equivalent to a
zero marginal effective tax rate on capital gains income.32

Notes : This figure plots the evolution of realized capital gains for those with large and small capital gains. Fig-
ure C.2(a) (resp. Figure C.2(b)) plots the average realized capital gain among those with positive gains of less
(resp. greater) than $1,000 from 1982 to 2016. Figure C.2(c) (resp. Figure C.2(d)) plots the fraction of tax fil-
ers with positive realized capital gains between $0.01 and $1,000 (resp. greater than $1,000) from 1982 to 2016.
The green shaded area marks the 1985-1994 period in which the Lifetime Capital Gains Exemption (LCGE)
was in place. The red vertical lines mark changes in the capital gains inclusion rate (from 50% to 66.6% in
1988, from 66.6% to 75% in 1990 and a decrease from 75% to 50% in 2000). The dashed grey line plots the
evolution of the inflation-adjusted values of the Standard and Poor's Toronto Stock Exchange Composite Index.

Notes : Figures C.3(a), C.3(b) and C.3(c) plot the fraction of tax filers with realized capital gains
in the past 3, 5 and 7 years in the age groups: (a) under 40, (b) between 40 and 60 and (c) over
60. Figures C.3(d), C.3(e) and C.3(f) plot the fraction of tax filers with and without realized
capital gains in the 6 years for the following age groups: (d) under 40, (e) between 40 and 60 and
(f) over 60. Figures C.3(g), C.3(h) and C.3(i) plot the average realized capital gain in the current
year, separately for tax filers with and without realized capital gains in the previous 6 years and
the following age groups: (g) under 40, (h) between 40 and 60 and (i) over 60. The green shaded
area marks the 1985-1994 period in which the Lifetime Capital Gains Exemption (LCGE) was
in place. The red vertical lines mark changes in the capital gains inclusion rate (from 50%
to 66.6% in 1988, from 66.6% to 75% in 1990 and a decrease from 75% to 50% in 2000).

D.3      Comparison with the U.S.
Figures D.4 and D.5 compare the evolution of total realized capital gains in the
U.S. and Canada. Figure D.4 compares total reported capital gains in Canada
based on individual tax returns from the LAD dataset (i.e. totals scaled from a
20% random LAD sample) to the totals from the U.S. Department of the Treasury
report.

Notes : This figure plots total reported capital gains in millions of dollars in the U.S. and
Canada from 1982 to 2016. The green shaded area marks the 1985-1994 period in which
the Lifetime Capital Gains Exemption (LCGE) was in place. The red vertical lines mark
changes in the capital gains inclusion rate (from 50% to 66.6% in 1988, from 66.6% to
75% in 1990 and a decrease from 75% to 50% in 2000). The solid grey (resp. dashed) line
shows evolution of the inflation-adjusted values of the Standard and Poor's Toronto Stock
Exchange Composite Index (resp. Dow Jones Industrial Average) over the same time period.


    Figure D.5 uses annual cross-sections of individual tax returns constructed
by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and commonly known as the Statistics of
Income (SOI) Public Use Files, for years 1982­2009. The SOI Public Use Files
consist of stratified random samples of approximately 80,000-200,000 tax returns
each year. All time-series are normalized to 100% in 2002.

     Notes : To account for differences in levels between Canada and the United States, all time-series are normalized to 100 in 2002.
     The green shaded area marks the 1985-1994 period in which the Lifetime Capital Gains Exemption (LCGE) was in place. The
     red vertical lines mark changes in the capital gains inclusion rate (from 50% to 66.6% in 1988, from 66.6% to 75% in 1990 and
     a decrease from 75% to 50% in 2000). The solid grey (resp. dashed) line shows evolution of the inflation-adjusted values of the
     Standard and Poor's Toronto Stock Exchange Composite Index (resp. Dow Jones Industrial Average) over the same time period.

Figure D.6 is similar to figures Figures 1 and 2 in the main text. The figure plots
the unconditional average realized capital gains, average realized capital gains
among those with positive realizations and the fraction of individuals with pos-
itive capital gains realizations from 1982-2016, separately for single (unmarried)

Notes : The green shaded area marks the 1985-1994 period in which the Life-
time Capital Gains Exemption (LCGE) was in place.        The red vertical lines
mark changes in the capital gains inclusion rate (from 50% to 66.6% in 1988,
from 66.6% to 75% in 1990 and a decrease from 75% to 50% in 2000).


    In Canada, the tax unit is the individual, not the family. Consequently,
tax filers that are married (or who are in a common-law relationship) have an
incentive to split realized capital gains evenly, if possible.33 Since wage income
cannot be split but capital gains can be tentatively allocated to a lower earning
        33
     There are some small deviations from this rule, e.g. some credits depend on joint income
and the personal exemption amount is partially sharable.


                                                                                                                                                                                   56
spouse, couples with uneven incomes can reduce their combined tax liability if the
lower earning partner/spouse reports all of the couple's combined realized capital
gains income. This strategy was less advantageous during the period in which
the LCGE was in place because the effective marginal tax rate on capital gains
income for tax filers with remaining exemption space was zero. For partners
that earn similar incomes, the optimal tax strategy is to split assets and the
resulting capital gains income equally. The LCGE did not change this incentive.
Consequently, after the elimination of the LCGE couples that did not exhaust
their exemption room may have reverted to shifting capital gains income to the
spouse with the lower effective marginal tax rate. To the extent that couples
where both partners had unused exemption room were disproportionately in the
treated groups, this would tend to result in larger (i.e. more positive) extensive
margin estimates in the post-1994 years. However, this type of income shifting
would not result in greater participation in capital markets.
     Figure D.7 explores whether couples follow these optimal strategies. The
results suggest a firm "no". For the vast majority of couples, the partner who
earns the most gross income also reports the most capital gains income. In
fact, for the majority of couples, capital gains income is reported on only one of
the returns and it is typically on the tax return of the higher-earning partner.
Nonetheless, Figure D.7 also documents that from 1982 until approximately 2000,
the share of capital gains income reported by the higher earner (resp. lower earner)
decreased (resp. increased). The figure provides suggestive evidence that the
introduction of the LCGE slowed down this trend, consistent with the hypothesis
that some couples responded to the introduction of the lifetime exemption by
using up the exemption space of the high-income (and, therefore, the high effective
MTR) spouse.

Notes : The sample in this figure is all tax filers that are married or in a common-law re-
lationship and report positive capital gains income. Married couples are partitioned into
four groups based on each tax filer's share of the family's gross (total) income. Figure
C.7(a) plots the average share of the family's capital gains income reported by tax fil-
ers in each of the four groups from 1982-2016. Figure C.7(b) plots the fraction of tax
filers that report more capital gains income than their spouse over the 1982-2016 pe-
riod, separately for each of the four groups. The red vertical lines mark the introduc-
tion and elimination of the Lifetime Capital Gains Exemption (LCGE), respectively.

Notes : Each figure plots the estimates of coefficients  from specification (1) described in Sec-
tion 4.1. The dependent variable is a tax filer's realized capital gain in the current tax year
(i.e. in levels). The sample in Panel A is comprised of all tax filers with 1985-1993 realized
capital gains between $100,000-$133,333 (the control group) and one of the following three
treatment groups: (i) 1985-1993 realized capital gains between $66,667-$100,000 (left panel);
(ii) 1985-1993 realized capital gains between $33,334-$66,666 (middle panel); (iii) 1985-1993
realized capital gains between $667-$33,333 (right panel). The sample in Panel B is restricted
to tax filers with positive realized capital gains in the current tax year. Number of observa-
tions: (left, middle and right panels): 293,385; 532,890; 2,593,670; 105,100; 171,300; 800,900.

Notes : Each figure plots the estimates of coefficients  from a specification that augments
equations (1) and (2) with individual fixed effects. In Panels A and B, the dependent vari-
able is the natural logarithm of $1 plus a tax filer's realized capital gain in the current tax
year. In Panel C, the dependent variable is a binary variable equal to 1 for tax filers with pos-
itive realized capital gains in the current tax year and zero otherwise. The sample in Panels
A and C is comprised of all tax filers with 1985-1993 realized capital gains between $100,000-
$133,333(the control group) and one of the following three treatment groups: (i) 1985-1993
realized capital gains between $66,667-$100,000 (left panel); (ii) 1985-1993 realized capital
gains between $33,334-$66,666 (middle panel); (iii) 1985-1993 realized capital gains between
$16,666-$33,333 (right panel). The sample in Panel B is restricted to tax filers with posi-
tive realized capital gains in the current tax year. Number of observations (left, middle and
right panels): 293,385; 532,890; 596,600; 105,100; 171,300; 186,100; 293,385; 532,890; 596,600.

Notes : Each figure plots the estimates of coefficients  from a specification that augments
equations (1) and (2) with the natural logarithm of a tax filer's total (broad) income as
a control variable. In Panels A and B, the dependent variable is the natural logarithm
of $1 plus a tax filer's realized capital gain in the current tax year. In Panel C, the de-
pendent variable is a binary variable equal to 1 for tax filers with positive realized capi-
tal gains in the current tax year and zero otherwise. The sample in Panels A and C is
comprised of all tax filers with 1985-1993 realized capital gains between $100,000-$133,333
(the control group) and one of the following three treatment groups: (i) 1985-1993 realized
capital gains between $66,667-$100,000 (left panel); (ii) 1985-1993 realized capital gains be-
tween $33,334-$66,666 (middle panel); (iii) 1985-1993 realized capital gains between $667-
$33,333 (right panel). The sample in Panel B is restricted to tax filers with positive real-
ized capital gains in the current tax year. Number of observations (left, middle and right
panels): 293,385; 532,890; 2,593,700; 105,100; 171,300; 800,900; 293,385; 532,890; 2,534,700.

Notes : Each figure plots the estimates of coefficients  from a specification that augments
equations (1) and (2) described in Section 4.1 by extending the event study window from
1990-1999 to 1984-2006. In Panels A and B, the dependent variable is the natural loga-
rithm of $1 plus a tax filer's realized capital gain in the current tax year. In Panel C, the
dependent variable is a binary variable equal to 1 for tax filers with positive realized cap-
ital gains in the current tax year and zero otherwise. The sample in Panels A and C is
comprised of all tax filers with 1985-1993 realized capital gains between $100,000-$133,333
(the control group) and one of the following three treatment groups: (i) 1985-1993 realized
capital gains between $66,667-$100,000 (left panel); (ii) 1985-1993 realized capital gains be-
tween $33,334-$66,666 (middle panel); (iii) 1985-1993 realized capital gains between $16,667-
$33,333 (right panel). The sample in Panel B is restricted to tax filers with positive realized
capital gains in the current tax year. Number of observations (left, middle and right pan-
els): 918,070; 1,672,620; 1,880,740; 319,070; 527,610; 571,030; 918,070; 1,672,620; 1,880,740.

Notes : Each figure plots the estimates of coefficients  from specification (1) described in
Section 4.1. The dependent variable is the natural logarithm of $1 plus a tax filer's real-
ized capital gain in the current tax year. The sample in Panel A is comprised of tax fil-
ers in the treatment and control groups between the ages of 19 and 49. The sample in
Panel B is comprised of tax filers in the treatment and control groups between the ages of
50 and 64. The sample in Panel C is comprised of tax filers in the treatment and con-
trol groups between the ages of 19 and 49 with positive realized capital gains in the cur-
rent tax year. The sample in Panel D is comprised of tax filers in the treatment and con-
trol groups between the ages of 50 and 64 with positive realized capital gains in the cur-
rent tax year. Number of observations (left, middle and right panels): 89,665; 176,660;

Notes : Each figure plots the estimates of coefficients  from specification (1) described in Sec-
tion 4.1. The dependent variable is the natural logarithm of $1 plus a tax filer's realized cap-
ital gain in the current tax year. The sample in Panel A is comprised of married tax filers in
the treatment and control groups. The sample in Panel B is comprised of single (unmarried)
tax filers in the treatment and control groups. The sample in Panel C is comprised of mar-
ried tax filers in the treatment and control groups with positive realized capital gains in the
current tax year. The sample in Panel D is comprised of single (unmarried) tax filers in the
treatment and control groups. Number of observations (left, middle and right panels): 228,770;

Notes : This figure plots the means for several demographic characteristics and two differ-
ent income concepts from 1982-2016 in each of the four treatment and control groups. The
figure in panel (f) plots average the effective marginal tax rate on capital gains income in
each of the treatment and control groups from over time. Note that the effective marginal
tax rate in any given year is based on reported taxable capital gains in that year and ac-
counts for the capital losses taken and the available Lifetime Capital Gains Exemption (LCGE)
space available to the tax filer in that year. Tax filers with remaining LCGE space or with
enough capital losses to offset realized gains face an effective marginal tax rate of zero. The
green shaded area marks the period of time (1985-1994) when the LCGE was available.

Notes : This figure plots the means for several demographic characteristics and two dif-
ferent income concepts for tax filers that report positive realized capital gains from 1982-
2016, separately for each of the four treatment and control groups. The figure in panel (f)
plots average the effective marginal tax rate on capital gains income in each of the treat-
ment and control groups from over time. Note that the effective marginal tax rate in any
given year is based on reported taxable capital gains in that year and accounts for the cap-
ital losses taken and the available Lifetime Capital Gains Exemption (LCGE) space avail-
able to the tax filer in that year. Tax filers with remaining LCGE space or with enough
capital losses to offset realized gains face an effective marginal tax rate of zero. The
green shaded area marks the period of time (1985-1994) when the LCGE was available.

Notes : Figures F.1(a), (d) and (g) plot the average reported dividends, investment income (sum of dividend
and interest income) and RRSP contributions from 1982-2016 for all tax filers. Figures F.1(b), (e) and (h)
plot the fraction of all tax filers with positive values of the aforementioned variables. Figures F.1(c), (f) and
(i) plot the average reported dividends, investment income and RRSP contributions for tax filers with posi-
tive values of those variables. The dashed grey line plots the inflation-adjusted values of the Standard and
Poor's Toronto Stock Exchange Composite Index. The green shaded area marks the period of time (1985-
1994) when the LCGE was available. The red vertical lines indicate the years where the capital gains inclu-
sion rate changed (from 50% to 66.6% in 1988, from 66.6% to 75% in 1990 and from 75% to 50% in 2000).

Notes : This figure plots the  coefficient estimates and the associated 95% confidence in-
tervals from the estimation of specification (1) described in Section 4.1 for each of the
three treatment groups. The dependent variables in Panels A, B and C are the nat-
ural logarithm of dividend income, investment income and RRSP contributions, respec-
tively. $1 is added to the value to all dollar values so that the natural logarithm is de-
fined. For specifications where the treatment group is $66,667-$100,000 1985-1993 capital
gains, the number of observations is 293,385. For specifications where the treatment group is
$33,334-$66,666 (resp. $16,666-$33,333), the number of observations is 532,893 (resp. 596,595).

Notes : This figure plots the  coefficient estimates and the associated 95% confidence in-
tervals from the estimation of specification (1) described in Section 4.1 for each of the three
treatment groups. For all specifications, the sample is restricted to tax filers with positive
realized capital gains. The dependent variables in Panels A, B and C are the natural log-
arithm of dividend income, investment income and RRSP contributions, respectively. $1 is
added to the value to all dollar values so that the natural logarithm is defined. For spec-
ifications where the treatment group is $66,667-$100,000 1985-1993 capital gains, the num-
ber of observations is 105,105. For specifications where the treatment group is $33,334-
$66,666 (resp. $16,666-$33,333), the number of observations is 171,335 (resp. 186,125).
