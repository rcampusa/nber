We compile the list of articles published in major refereed economics journals during the last 35
years that have received more than 500 citations. We document major shifts in the mode of
contribution and in the importance of different sub-fields: Theory loses out to empirical work, and
micro and macro give way to growth and development in the 1990s. While we do not witness any
decline in the primacy of production in the United States over the period, the concentration of
institutions within the U.S. hosting and training authors of the highly-cited articles has declined
substantially.

       Citations are one way that past research echoes through time. Although the

number of academic citations accumulated by a published research paper is an imperfect

measure of quality or influence of that paper, citation counts do have certain virtues.

They are not subjective. They are widely used in studies of academic productivity. They

are reasonably comprehensive across subject areas within economics. In this paper, we

compile a list of articles published in major refereed economics journals in the last 35

years that have received more than 500 citations as of June 2006. We then use this list to

examine various trends: what economics fields and types of articles are most in vogue

and which institutions host their production and train their authors.



How We Compiled the List

       For each article published in 41 prominent economics journals between 1970 and

2002, we download citations as of June 2006 from the ISI Web of Science/Social Science

Citation Index. We limit our focus to 41 journals because the Web of Science has an

untenable list of 175 economics and 40 finance journals. The choice of the particular 41

journals results from the union of journals which have been used in previous studies

ranking economics and finance departments and individual economists. These ranking

studies, summarized in Kim, Morse, and Zingales (2006), include Arnold, Butler, Crack,

and Altintig (2003), Coupe (2003), Dusansky and Vernon (1998), Graves, Marchand, and

Thompson (1982), and Scott and Mitias (1996). Table 1 shows the list of 41 journals.

       Our objective is to prepare a list of the articles in these journals with more than

500 cites. To do so, we make an adjustment to the downloaded citation counts to restore




                                             3
omitted citations resulting from references that contain erroneous information or omit

necessary information to generate a citation in the main record of the article. For

example, if an issue number is omitted or incorrectly referenced, the base article may not

receive credit for that citation. To ensure such underestimation does not prevent

deserving articles from making the list, we identify all papers with 400 or more correctly

referenced cites. Then we apply a manual count procedure. We search the cited reference

database for the author last name, first initial, and year for each of 198 articles receiving

more than 400 cites. When we find a citation without a linkage, we identify the

appropriate article deserving the citation following a set of rules designed to minimize

misidentification.1



The List

Table 2 presents the resulting list of 146 articles with over 500 cites as of June 2006. The

most cited article, with 4,318 cites, is Halbert White’s paper on robust standard errors,

followed by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky’s paper on prospect theory (4,085

  If an individual has only one article for a specific journal and year, all misreferenced citations that have
the correct journal and year are credited to the article. If the individual has multiple articles in the journal
for the year searched, we credit all cites with the correct issue or page number to the appropriate article. For
the remaining misreferences for individuals with multiple papers in the same journal year, we calculate the
ratio of correct citations between the multiple articles and apply the ambiguous cases in the same
proportion. These rules, however, do not capture misreferences when the last name of the author is
incorrectly spelled. Because it is unlikely that the last names of all authors of a co-authored article are
misspelled, we follow the same procedure used above for each co-author for each article and use the largest
number of misreferenced citations as the add-on to the count. Although this procedure does not capture
misspellings of the last name for solo authors, the probability of omitting an over-500-cite, solo-authored
article from the list is negligible because solo authors are the focal point of references. Finally, we miss
citations when the year of publication is wrong, which is rather rare.

cites) and Michael Jensen and William Meckling’s paper on managerial behavior and

agency costs (3,923 cites).

         Within these 146 papers, an elite group of 11 economists authored or co-authored

at least three papers. Robert Barro, Eugene Fama, and Joseph Stiglitz have six each.

Michael Jensen follows with five; Robert Lucas and David Kreps with four; and Robert

Engle, Lars Hansen, Robert Merton, Edward Prescott, and Stephen Ross have three each.



What Has Mattered to Economics

         This list of highly cited papers provides us with an opportunity to analyze what

has mattered in economics over the last 35 years. To make comparisons over time,

however, we need to correct an obvious bias: papers written in the 1970s are more likely

to meet the 500 cites threshold than papers written in the 1990s. In fact, Table 2 contains

69 articles from the 1970s, 58 from the 1980s, and only 19 from the 1990s with just one

after 1993. To make the comparison meaningful we lower the bar for papers written in

the period 1985-1999. During the first three half decades (1970-1984), the number of

over-500-cite articles hovers around 35 per half decade. Hence for the following three

half decades, we compile 35 most cited papers for each half decade.2




2
 To identify the additional highly cited papers we manually correct for misreferences as described earlier.
We do not include papers written after 2000 because the time span is too short for references to be
meaningful.




                                                     5
         To identify fields represented by these highly cited papers, we collect the JEL

code for each of the articles by looking up the reference in EconLit and recording the first

JEL code listing. We condense the two-digit JEL scheme into 11 fields, generally

adhering to the JEL aggregate fields.3

         As Table 3.A shows, econometrics and finance are well represented throughout

the period with a constant flow of highly cited papers capturing about 20% and 23%, of

the most cited papers respectively. Micro and macro have a relatively prominent presence

during the 1970s and the 1980s (18% and 17%, respectively), but both experience a sharp

decline in the 1990s (only 9% for each). In contrast, growth/development, which makes

the list only once during the 1970-1984 period, explodes in the subsequent three half-

decades with shares of 14%, 20%, and 17% for these periods.

         When we look at the type of contribution (Table 3.B), roughly one quarter of the

most cited papers in each decade are econometric methodological contributions. With the

exception of the early 1970s, this share is very constant over time. By contrast, we

observe a major reversal between theoretical and empirical papers. In the early 1970s,

77% of the most highly cited papers were theoretical, while only 11% empirical. At the

end of the century, 60% are empirical and only 11% theoretical. This change in theory’s

share might be due, at least in part, to different citation patterns for empirical and

theoretical papers, with theory starting out slowly but maintaining a longer staying

power. However, even when we look at the 1990-94 period, which allows papers to have
3
 The 11 fields are econometrics (C except game theory), microeconomics (D), game theory (C7),
macroeconomics (E), international economics (F), finance (G), public finance (H and I), labor (J), industrial
organization (L), growth and development (O and P) and others (K, M, Q, and R). For a few cases without
JEL codes, we applied our assessment of the article. We recoded JEL codes for two cases in which the
coding was clearly not the primary subject.




                                                     6
at least 12 years to accumulate cites, we still find a similar albeit less accentuated trend;

theory represents 40% of the papers and empirics 31% during this period.

       As for the publication outlet for the most cited papers, Table 4 shows sharp

changes over time. In the 1970s and 1980s, the lion’s share of these papers was published

in Econometrica (22.3%), the Journal of Political Economy (18.0%), and American

Economic Review (14.4%). Particularly noteworthy is Econometrica’s contribution in the

1980s, peaking at nearly one-third of the articles over the decade. In the 1990s, the honor

belongs to the Quarterly Journal of Economics (21.4%), the Journal of Political

Economy (15.7), the Journal of Finance (14.3%), Econometrica (12.9%), and the

American Economic Review (8.6%). Considering that the QJE’s share was only 4.3% in

the earlier period, its ascent to the position of the primary outlet for most-cited papers is

remarkable.

       As Table 5.A shows, eighty-five percent of the most cited papers are written by

researchers when they were working at U.S. institutions. This share does not exhibit any

decline over time; in fact, it slightly increases in the last five years. Within the United

States, however, the concentration declines substantially. In the 1970-74 period, almost

one fourth of the most cited papers were written at the University of Chicago and only 15

institutions were represented at all. At the end of the century, however, no institution

accounts for more than 16% of the market, and an impressive 26 institutions contribute to

the production of highly-cited articles. The within-U.S. Herfinadahl index of




                                               7
concentration4 declines 50% from a score of 0.096 in the early 1970s to 0.062 in the late

1990s.

           This reduction in concentration within the United States is consistent with Kim,

Morse, and Zingales (2006), who document a significant reduction in the local spillover

(university fixed effect) of academic productivity over the last three decades. It does raise

an interesting question, however: Why is this spreading out limited within the United

States without benefiting Europe or the rest of the world?

           The same pattern emerges if we look at where the writers of the most cited papers

were trained (Table 5.B). An overwhelming majority, 87%, received their PhDs from

U.S. institutions, with this percentage rising to 93% at the end of the century. As for the

location within the United States, however, the concentration of the institutions granting

PhDs to the authors of these papers has declined. In the early 1970s, Chicago trained 28%

of the authors and 72% were trained in the top 5 schools. By the end of the century, no

institution trained more than 18% of the authors, and the share of the top five has dropped

to 51%.



Discussion

           In closing, it should be noted that our list of most-cited articles is by no means

intended to represent all seminal contributions in economics. Not only does it exclude

foundation books such as Adam Smith’s The Wealth of Nations (1776) and Karl Marx’s

Das Kapital (1867), it also omits all pre-1970 papers that have received vast numbers of

citations such as the Coase (1937) paper, Friedman’s 1967 AEA presidential address, the

Modigliani and Miller (1958) irrelevance paper, and so on. To help in understanding

what the list covers and what it does not, it is useful to spell out some of the

consequences of the choices we made in compiling the list.

       The 41 journals that we searched rely primarily on a blind refereeing process, and

therefore, journals in which many or all of the papers are invited were omitted. Thus, our

list of articles omits the Journal of Economic Literature and the Journal of Economic

Perspectives. Nor does the list include popular economic series such as the Carnegie-

Rochester Conference Series on Public Policy, the NBER Macro Annual, and the

Brookings Papers on Economic Activity.

       We suspect that adding additional journals would result in only modest changes to

the list. Among the articles excluded due to our choice of economics journals, one of the

most likely papers to hit the 500-cites threshold is the Robert Lucas (1977) paper on

business cycles that presented the rational expectations “Lucas critique” and appeared in

Carnegie-Rochester Conference Series. However, this paper has, by our count, 491 cites

and thus would not (yet) have made the list. Our list of journals also excludes the Journal

of Economic Behavior and Organization, which published “Toward a Positive Theory of

Consumer Choice” by Richard Thaler (1980) that would have made our cut with 631

citations. Because we are reluctant to fish in all other social science fields that make

interdisciplinary contributions to economics, we exclude non-economic journals such as

Marketing Science. Unfortunately, that is where Thaler (1985) published “Mental

Accounting and Consumer Choice,” which has had 541 citations.




                                              9
       We also exclude citations to the working paper version(s) of published papers.

Published articles usually have multiple working paper versions in different years, often

with different titles. The underestimation from ignoring working papers is likely to be

small and roughly similar across papers. The exceptions are papers like the 1985 term

structure article by Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross that took almost ten years to publication. The

Web of Science has approximately 90 citations to different working paper versions under

Cox’s name. The published version has 819 citations, implying that the omission of

citations to working paper is 10% even in this extreme case.

       Finally, the Web of Science database includes citations from all social science

fields – not just citations from economics journals. We do not restrict citations to those

from economics journals alone because a paper’s spillover to other disciplines may be an

important part of its impact.

       These caveats notwithstanding, our study has shown which papers have had the

most impact on our profession and how demands for different subfields and modes of

research have changed over time. It will be interesting to look again, a few years from

now, to see what articles join the list and what new patterns emerge.

Table 3: Percent of Highly-Cited Articles by Sub-Field and Contribution Type over
Half-Decades

                                                 Panel A
This panel presents the percentage of highly-cites articles published in each economic field by half-decade.
Economic fields are assigned according to the one-digit JEL code as reported in the EconLit reference for
each article, with a few exceptions. We allow game theory (JEL classification C7) to be its own field.
Development (P) and growth (O) are combined. The “Other” category contains law and economics (K),
business administration (M), agricultural, resource and environmental economics (Q), and urban, rural and
regional economics (R). For a few cases with no JEL codes, we applied our assessment of the article. We
recoded JEL codes for two cases in which the coding was clearly not the primary subject. JEL one-digit
categories not listed below are not found in the data. The counts of articles for each field and half-decade
are in parentheses.

                                                 Panel A
This panel shows the percentage breakdown of institutions in which the authors resided during the time of
writing the highly-cited articles. We take the institutional affiliation lagged back two years from the
publication year to account for the publishing process time. The affiliations are weighted by the number of
coauthors on each article.
