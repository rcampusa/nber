        A first step in the "big-bang" deregulation of Japanese financial markets was the deregulation of the
foreign exchange market on April 1, 1998. This paper examines how the bid-ask spread and conditional
volatility in the yen/dollar foreign exchange market changed around the time of the deregulation. Intra-day
data are analyzed with the following results: (1) Holding constant the effects of volume and volatility, the
deregulation was associated with a convergence of Japanese quoted spreads toward those of other banks.
(2) Modeling the persistence in volatility reveals that deregulation lowered conditional volatility.

century, University of Hawaii, January 1999.
1. Introduction

The “Big Bang” of Japanese financial markets was proposed in November

1996 by the Hashimoto government. This was the beginning of the end to the

“convoy” system—no failure and regulatory protection—that had ruled the

Japanese financial markets since the end of the Second World War. It is a

bold idea to deregulate and liberalize the financial sectors, if not belatedly.

      There were three main objectives. First, the Big Bang aims at making

the Japanese market more efficient and internationalized. The market will

become more active and competitive, and users, such as the Japanese

corporations and retail consumers, will be beneficiaries. Second, the Japanese

institutions, with competitive pressures from foreign institutions, will have to

become more efficient. Third, it would deflect the political pressures,

representing vested interest, on the Ministry of Finance.

      After the bubble burst, the Tokyo financial markets had been losing its

steam. The Tokyo Stock Exchange lost more than half of its capitalization

since the peak of the bubble (December 1989). There had been a mass exodus

of foreign stock listings from the Tokyo Big Board. The trading volumes of the

Tokyo foreign exchange market have not been growing in the 1990s, and

Hong Kong and Singapore were catching up fast. The usage of the yen in Asia


                                        1
has not grown as some economists had predicted, partly because of the

cumbersome rules and regulations in Tokyo. The first motivation of the Big

Bang was to stop the skidding of Tokyo as an (if not ‘the’) Asian financial

center.

      Making the Tokyo markets efficient does not necessarily mean that the

Japanese institutions will flourish. If foreigners have a competitive

advantage in financial products, then they will take greater market shares in

Tokyo. It must be endured, the policy makers argued. However, it was hoped

that intensified competition would make Japanese institutions more efficient

and stronger. The second objective, which derives from the first one, was

more nationalistic, but try to force Japanese financial institutions to try

harder.

      Although the objectives were unanimously hailed as appropriate and

desirable, the timing of the announcement was not so obvious. The Ministry

of Finance was heavily criticized for its role in first creating and then

bursting the bubble and not guiding the banking industry through the sea of

nonperforming loans. First, the Ministry tried to maintain the “convoy”

system, not failing one bank by forcing banks to share the burden and

allowing banks to postpone provisioning and sales of bad assets, and then

abandoning it without an sufficiently funded safety net (deposit insurance

system). The Big Bang is a constructive way to steer attention away from the

sorry past to a bright future.




                                        2
      The rest of this paper will examine the contents of the Big Bang,

discuss its likely effects, and present some econometric analysis of early

indications in the foreign exchange market.



2. What is the Big Bang?

The Ministry described the spirit of the Big Bang as “fair, free, and global.”

Obviously, the main objectives of the Big Bang are to make the Japanese

financial markets more competitive and to provide Japanese institutions with

more opportunities than fetters. When the Big Bang is implemented,

transaction costs will be substantially reduced, and those who are using the

Tokyo markets, mostly institutions in Japan, will benefit from deregulation.

However, many observers point out that there may be more political (or

political economy) objectives. First, the Big Bang is sequenced so that it will

take some time to complete it, but will be carried through to the end. The

foreign exchange controls were effectively eliminated on April 1, 1998.

Nonfinancial institutions in Japan can deal in foreign exchange without

banks’ intermediation. Moreover, Japanese investors are now allowed to open

and maintain accounts with financial institutions in foreign countries.

Without change, Japanese banks will lose a large chunk of formerly-protected

businesses to New York and London. The Big Bang starting with the foreign

exchange deregulation will ensure that the rest of the reforms will be carried

through.




                                       3
          Politically, the Big Bang may have been a response to various scandals

among the Ministry officials. The revelation that some high-ranking officials

were caught in near-bribery scandals put the Ministry on the defensive.

Proposing and carrying out a high-profile project like the Big Bang may

deflect media attention. (Despite the effort, the Ministry of Finance continued

to be criticized in the media, since new scandals erupted in 1997.)

          The name Big Bang is misleading as the proposal is not a sudden

change. The foreign exchange control was effectively eliminated in April

1998. But, other reforms in banking, securities, and insurance sectors are

scheduled to follow. The accounting standard will also be changed, but that

will take time, as public accountants have to be educated on the change first.

Economic benefits from the Big Bang will extend to an entire financial sector

and the economy in general when the reforms are completed.

          Traditionally, domestic deregulation had been stalled by vested

interests of segmented financial markets. The Big Bang is a final answer to

deal with the crash of vested interests. Several examples will give a good

picture of the financial markets problem and the proposed solution.1

          First, banks and securities firms are at odds. Banks opposed securities

houses desire to make customers’ securities accounts more like bank accounts

(automatic deposits, demand deposits, and automatic payment services) –this

was removed in the beginning of the 1990s.



1   For the market structure before deregulation, see Ito (1992, chapter 5)


                                                4
       Second, Securities houses opposed banks’ plan to sell mutual fund

products at banks’ teller windows—this was removed in December 1998.

       Third, ordinary banks and long-term credit banks were squabbling

over the ordinary banks’ product line. Long-term credit banks opposed the

ordinary banks’ proposal to offer time deposits exceeding two years—this was

removed in the mid-1990s.

       In general “holding companies” are prohibited in Japan. Under the Big

Bang, the establishment of financial holding companies will be permitted, so

that banks, securities firms, and insurance companies may be controlled and

coordinated by a single headquarter.

       Insurance companies are segmented into three categories: Life

insurance, non-life insurance, and the “third” category—such as cancer

insurance. This segmentation will be lifted in March 2001, under the Big

Bang.2 Insurance premiums have been regulated and controlled. Under the

Big Bang, companies can charge different premiums to different kinds of

customers (e.g. non-smoker life insurance, drivers without accident records).

       Among the changes in the foreign exchanges on April 1, 1998, the

elimination of the exclusive dealing by banks is most prominent. Foreign

exchanges had been exclusively exchanged in banks that are licensed to do

dealings. Securities firms, trading houses, and other large nonfinancial



2United States pressure has been instrumental in much deregulation in Japan in the 1980s.
However, it is ironic that the United States is now opposing deregulation of insurance
segments in Japan, because AIG (a U.S. company) has a vested interest in the “third”
market.


                                            5
companies regularly receive both buying and selling orders of foreign

exchange. However, they cannot offset (marry) their buy and sell positions,

but ask banks to do the transactions. Then the banks automatically receive

commissions. This restriction was removed on April 1, 1998 as a part of the

Big Bang. In addition, investors are now allowed to hold accounts at financial

institutions abroad. These changes have put additional competitive pressure

on Japanese banks.

       In order to disentangle the vested interest turf claims, the Big Bang—

simultaneous or at least committed schedule of, deregulation—is the answer.



3. Political Economy

The Big Bang idea was an attempt of the Hashimoto government, with help

from some quarters of the Ministry of Finance, to pursue structural reforms

in domestic and international economic policy making. The domestic politics

needed some banner for the Hashimoto government (since January 1996).

Public opinion had turned against the Ministry of Finance, as the final

resolution of the insolvent Jusen (housing loans companies) required an

injection of 685 billion yen, and some Ministry officials were alleged to have

accepted cash and lavish entertainment.

       During the summer of 1996, it was proposed to reform the Bank of

Japan to make it more independent from the Ministry. This was considered

to be a deflection of criticism.




                                       6
      The Big Bang had several additional political advantages. First,

domestic resistance toward deregulation and liberalization would become less

when a “declaration” for the big deregulation is made internationally. Second,

it helps international negotiations. The U.S. had pressured Japan to “open

up” the insurance market. In fact, the U.S. demands were aimed at keeping

the Japanese insurance market under regulation. The so-called third market

(for non-life insurance) was dominated by the U.S. insurance companies. As

a result, the US opposed the deregulation of that market. The Big Bang

basically set the deadline for allowing such vested interest.

      Immediate impacts on various groups of consumers are unclear.

Wealthy individuals will benefit from the wider-range of choices in their asset

portfolios. However, small savers including pensioners may suffer from

deregulation as the various rates (brokerage commissions, insurance

premiums, bank monthly fees) will be differentiated for different types of

customers.

      We now turn to the statistical evidence on how the first step of the Big

Bang, namely the foreign exchange market deregulation, is affecting the yen-

dollar exchange rate market.



4. A First Look at the Deregulation of the FX Market

      On April 1, 1998 the revised Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade

Control Law ended the monopoly of Japanese banks in Japanese foreign




                                       7
exchange (FX) trading. Now other firms, such as general trading firms, and

individuals may freely buy and sell foreign currencies. The law extends down

to the retail level, where shops and restaurants may exchange foreign money

for yen. The revised law also permits individuals to open and maintain

foreign-currency-denominated bank and securities accounts in foreign

countries. 3 At first thought, it seems reasonable that the deregulation should

generate a yen depreciation, as the interest rate in Japan was so much lower

than in other countries. However, the expected effect on the volatility of the

yen/dollar exchange rate is unclear.

       In the weeks before the deregulation went into effect, market

participants expressed the opinion that the yen should weaken as it will be

easier for Japanese agents to sell yen for dollars. However, there were

persistent rumors of central bank interventions, selling dollars to prevent the

dollar appreciation, so it is possible that the effect of private market yen sales

was offset by central bank purchases. There were also confounding factors,

as the time of the deregulation was one where other important events were

occurring. For instance, on April 3, Moody’s Investors Service downgraded to

“negative” from “stable” its outlook for Japan’s government obligations. This

news resulted in the yen/dollar exchange rate dropping to 135 for the first

time in over six years. In the same week, the Bank of Japan’s Tankan report

indicated that the outlook had turned more negative among Japanese firms.


3Even before the big bang, foreign-currency-denominated deposits could be made with
Japanese or foreign financial institutions that were located in Japan.


                                            8
So, it is clear that there was plenty of news to motivate yen selling around

the time of the deregulation, so that one must be careful when making claims

about the effects of the April 1 change. We will now turn to a first look at the

empirical evidence related to the FX market big-bang.



Yen/Dollar Exchange Rate

      With the lifting of restrictions on dollar-denominated deposits in

foreign countries, we expect that pressures from abroad will force the

Japanese and foreign institutions in Tokyo to offer better products. This may

cause a shift to dollars from yen and a consequent yen depreciation. In a real

sense, any such depreciation is reflecting expectations regarding the

Japanese economy and financial market differences between Japan and the

United States (like interest differentials and stock market performance). The

deregulation should simply allow more Japanese firms and households to

diversify their portfolios at lower cost. To see whether there was any

discernible effect of deregulation on the yen/dollar exchange rate, we first plot

the daily data in Figure 1. The figure indicates that in the week containing

the deregulation, the yen depreciated against the dollar from about 130 to

135. However, there was a sharp appreciation in the following week which

appears to have been a result of two factors. The Bank of Japan intervened

in support of the yen and, reportedly, sold $12 billion in exchange for yen on

Thursday and Good Friday. At the same time, U.S. Treasury Secretary




                                        9
Rubin stated that he supported the Bank of Japan action and was concerned

about recent weakness in the yen. There was also an expectation among

market participants of a coordinated intervention to support the yen

following the G7 meeting scheduled for April 15. All of these factors

contributed to the yen appreciation below 130 in the second week of April.

However, as Figure 1 shows, by the third week of April, following no action

by the G7, a steady yen depreciation began that peaked in June.

      Aside from the yen appreciation prior to Easter weekend, it is clear

that the yen depreciated over most of the period starting in mid-February.

While this could have been due to expectations and the consequent

realization of portfolio rebalancing following April 1, there was also plenty of

bad news related to the Japanese economy that occurred at the same time.



Transaction Costs

      One would expect that deregulation increases efficiency as banks face

greater competition so that spreads and commissions on trading fall. There

was anecdotal evidence that this occurred. Banks cut the foreign exchange

commission charged to retail customers. 4 Securities firms cut exchange rate

commissions for preferred customers who purchase foreign-currency

denominated bonds. Aside from such anecdotal evidence from the retail level,

what do the data say about the wholesale interbank market?




                                       10
       We examined tick-by-tick data on the yen/dollar exchange rate for

evidence regarding spreads.5 First, we plotted the average daily quoted bid-

ask spreads for Japanese banks and all banks in Figure 2. It is interesting to

note that the Japanese quoted spreads exceed the rest of the market. There

may be several reasons why Japanese banks’ spreads are wider. First, they

may be just inefficient. Second, Japanese banks’ reputation was categorically

damaged when one of the 20 large banks failed in November 1997, and many

others had been downgraded. The Japanese banks were charged a “Japan

premium” by American and European banks. Credit lines were severely cut.

Unless the Japanese banks offered a higher rate, they could not borrow. A

look at the figure does not provide obvious evidence that the spreads

narrowed following the April 1 deregulation. Neither the spreads of all

quoters nor those of Japanese quoters systematically fell after April 1.

Furthermore, it is not obvious that the spreads quoted by Japanese banks

converged to those quoted by others following April 1.

       The two spikes in the spread series for all quoters are related to

specific events. The first spike occurring on March 13 coincides with the

arrest of a senior BOJ official for leaking sensitive information and the

ensuing corruption scandal. The second peak occurred on Good Friday (April

10). This is to be expected as there was heavy BOJ intervention on this day


4For instance, at the end of March, Daiwa Bank reduced its exchange commissions so that it
charges ¥28,000 to purchase $10,000. This was ¥2,000 below the other Tokyo city banks. On
April 6, Sanwa Bank cut its foreign-currency wiring fee by up to 2,300 yen.




                                           11
and the Easter weekend is a 3-day holiday weekend in many countries. With

much uncertainty regarding action by the G7 the next week and an extended

market closing, we should expect the widening spreads. Note that spreads

fell sharply the next week, following the lack of action by the G7.

       To more formally examine the effect of the deregulation, we estimated

econometric models of the spread. Microstructure models suggest that

volume and volatility should both be important determinants of the spread. 6

In addition, a dummy variable was added to estimate the impact of the April

1 deregulation. The dummy switches from zero to one on April 1. The model

is estimated twice. First, we estimate the effect of volume, volatility, and

deregulation on the average daily spread quoted by Japanese banks. Then

the model is reestimated using the difference between the average daily

Japanese quoted spreads and the average daily quoted spreads across all

banks. The independent variables used in the estimation are as follows: (a)

volume, the sum of daily volume in the spot and swap markets in Tokyo; (b)

volatility, the absolute daily change in the yen/dollar spot rate; and (c) the

dummy for deregulation. To account for the simultaneity in the data, an

instrumental variables estimation was employed where the instruments

included two lags of volume and volatility and a dummy variable for the

April 10 intervention by the BOJ. A specification search revealed that a



5 The data were obtained from Olsen & Associates in Zurich and include the intradaily
quotes over the first half of 1998.
6 See Hartmann (1998) for an analysis of the relationship between the tick-by-tick spread

and trading volumes.


                                             12
parsimonious representation of the data required a first- and second-order

autoregressive term be included to account for the autocorrelation in the

residuals.

      The results are reported in Table 1. Volume seems to have no

significant effect on either dependent variable. Volatility has a significantly

positive effect on the Japanese quoted spread and no effect on the difference

between Japanese and all spreads. The April 1 dummy has a negative and

significant effect in both cases. So taking account of the volume and volatility

effects on the spread, one can estimate a negative effect of deregulation on

the quoted spread of Japanese banks. In addition, it appears that, holding

constant the effects of volume and volatility, the deregulation was associated

with a convergence of Japanese quoted spreads toward those of other banks.

      The efficiency gains associated with FX market deregulation in terms

of lower transaction costs, appears to extend beyond the retail level. The

evidence presented here is supportive of a structural change in the wholesale

exchange rate quotes consistent with lower transaction costs in Japan.



Volatility

      The net effect that deregulation should have on FX volatility is unclear

from the Figure. On the one hand, the entry of more participants might add

depth and larger liquidity trades, so that that discrete price jumps occur less

frequently. The usual case that volume and volatility are positively




                                       13
correlated is, at least in part, a result of both being driven by news. It is not

necessary that the deregulation will increase trading volume as firms can

now take positions internally that were previously accomplished through

bank trading rooms. This could result in thinner trading. The next section

will examine the evidence on volume, here we look directly at volatility.

Figure 3 plots the daily (9 a.m. to 4 p.m., Tokyo) return on the yen/dollar

exchange rate. There is no clear pattern of volatility after April 1 compared

to before. The negative spike on April 10 is associated with BOJ

intervention. Since the table does not reveal any obvious effect of

deregulation, we will examine more formal evidence.

      It is well known that high-frequency exchange rate data exhibit

GARCH effects.7 As a result, we do not want to simply look at the pattern of

the unconditional volatility to make inferences regarding the path of

volatility around April 1. Instead, we report estimates of GARCH models.

We constructed a data set of 15-minute returns for the yen/dollar spot rate

during Tokyo business hours, ensuring that no overnight or weekend returns

were included. This is the dependent variable in the mean equation. As is

usually the case in high-frequency exchange rate applications, a

GARCH(1,1)-MA(1) model represented the data well. To test the hypothesis

that the April 1 deregulation resulted in lower volatility, we included a

dummy variable that switches from zero to 1 on April 1 in the conditional

variance equation. To account for the volatility associated with the BOJ




                                        14
intervention, an additional dummy variable was added that takes on the

value of one for April 10.

          Estimation results are reported in Table 2. The diagnostics indicate

that the model represents the data well. The deregulation dummy is

negative and significant at the 4 percent level. Thus, accounting for the

persistence that exists in intradaily exchange rate quotes, we find evidence

consistent with the deregulation reducing volatility.



Volume

          Since non-bank firms can now hold dollar deposits after April 1, 1998,

they can circumvent the bank exchange services and finance dollar deals

directly. For this reason, we might expect that the volume of foreign

exchange trading in Tokyo would fall with the April 1 deregulation. To

explore the pattern of FX trading volume we examine the Bank of Japan data

on daily volume. The BOJ collects daily data from brokers and dealers on

interbank foreign exchange transaction volume. Spot volume for the first

half of 1998 is plotted in Figure 4. Forward and swap volume is plotted in

Figure 5. The spot volume data in Figure 4 indicate a clear outlier associated

with the pre-Easter intervention. Aside from this, there appears to be an

uneven decline in volume for about a month, after which volume starts to

climb again. The swap market volume indicates a similar upward trend near

the end of the sample.


7   See Andersen and Bollerslev (1997) for a survey.

                                               15
      To isolate the effect of deregulation on volume, we would ideally need

to account for information flows as volume (and volatility) is driven by public

and private information disclosure. Lacking data on such information flows,

we experimented with alternative models of volume being driven by volatility

and a dummy for the April 1 deregulation. There were no robust results

linking volume to the deregulation. It appears that other factors dominate

the volume effect.



Overall Effects of Deregulation on FX Market

      Based on our look at the wholesale interbank FX market, we can

discern the following:

(1) There is evidence of lower transaction costs associated with yen/dollar

trading. The data suggest that, holding constant the effects of volume and

volatility, the bid-ask spread drops on yen/dollar quotes. In addition, the

difference between spreads quoted by Japanese and non-Japanese quoters

narrows after the deregulation.

(2) There is evidence that the deregulation lowers conditional volatility.

While the direct effect of deregulation on volatility is unclear, the data

indicate that a GARCH framework that takes account of the persistence in

volatility and intervention captures a negative effect.

      We urge caution in interpreting these results as there were many

factors affecting the exchange rate over this period and deregulation was but




                                       16
one. Nevertheless, it is useful to know that the effects of deregulation extend

beyond the retail level of FX that has been discussed in the popular press.



5. Concluding Remarks

The Big Bang alone will not be enough to put the Tokyo financial markets to

the status at par with New York and London, or to make the yen an

international key currency.8 However, it is an important first step. When

accompanied by tax law changes and improvement in financial

infrastructure, complete deregulation on business activities, known as the

Big Bang, will increase financial activities in Tokyo (by both Japanese and

non-Japanese institutions), and will boost the use of the yen. However, it

remains to be seen whether these changes are made in time.

          This paper examined how the bid-ask spread and conditional volatility

in the yen/dollar exchange market changed at around the time of

deregulating the foreign exchange law. Some evidence of an impact of

deregulation on the market activities was detected. However, whether the

econometric evidence can be translated into more tangible results in the long

run is obvious. The answer partly depends on the success of the remaining

changes scheduled under the Big Bang.
