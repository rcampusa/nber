We study optimal policy experimentation by a committee. We consider a dynamic bargaining
game in which committee members choose either a risky reform or a safe alternative each period.
When no redistribution is allowed the unique equilibrium outcome is generically inefficient.
When redistribution is allowed (even small amounts), there always exists an equilibrium that
supports optimal experimentation for any voting rule without veto players. With veto players,
however, optimal policy experimentation is possible only with a sufficient amount of
redistribution. We conclude that veto rights are more of an obstacle to optimal policy
experimentation than constraints on redistribution.

1    Introduction

Committees often must choose to embark on risky policy experiments. Examples are gov-
ernments implementing reforms, and international organizations agreeing to new policies.
One objective of such a committee is to embark on a policy experiment if the expected
aggregate benefits exceed the aggregate costs, and, conversely, quit an existing policy ex-
periment when the likelihood that the benefits will materialize becomes sufficiently small.
However, the decision to begin or end a policy experiment is made by individual committee
members acting in their own interests. In spite of the promise of aggregate benefits, if a
sufficient number of members do not directly gain, then policy experiments may fail to be
implemented. Similarly, if a sufficiently large coalition of vested interests supports a failed
experiment, it may persist at the expense of other members. The political economy liter-
ature on policy experimentation — which we elaborate on below — has so far developed
independently of that on redistribution. However, redistribution might be a critical factor
to circumvent the vested interests opposing a socially beneficial reform or the cessation
of a failed reform: the gains to winners should be redistributed in such a way that losers
are fully compensated and the right level of experimentation occurs. Such compensatory
transfers are difficult to implement in practice because, as Acemoglu et al. (2015) points
out, there can be a number of (exogenous) direct constraints on redistribution. Even if
some redistribution is allowed, committees may face another critical constraint: potential
winners from a policy experiment may not be able to commit to compensating the losers.
    The observations above motivate the three main questions addressed in this paper.
First, under what circumstances, if any, can committees achieve socially efficient policy
experimentation without redistribution? Second, if efficient experimentation cannot be
achieved without redistribution, can it be achieved if benefits can be redistributed among
members? Is there some minimal level of redistribution necessary for this to happen? And
third, how do the answers depend on voting rules?
    To answer these questions we present a dynamic committee bargaining model that
combines policy experimentation and redistribution. A committee (such as a legislature,
the members of an international body, or a central bank governing board) meets each period

                                              2
to decide policy. Policy has three components: the choice to implement a risky reform or
revert to a safe (known) alternative, a tax rate, and the choice of how to distribute tax
revenues. We model the constraint on redistribution as an exogenous maximum tax rate.
We assume that this is chosen separately from reforms and redistribution. For example,
U.S. tax legislation is primarily driven by the U.S. Treasury and the office of the President,
whereas other policies related to reforms and redistribution may come from the House of
Representatives or the Senate. Other possible interpretations are constitutional constraints
and the threat of capital flight (see Acemoglu et al., 2015), or that only part of individual
benefits are observable or transferable.
       Policy is assumed to continue unless changed by the committee, and, in this sense,
exhibits an endogenous status quo feature.1 More precisely, in each period, policy making
is governed by the following protocol adapted from Diermeier et al. (2017). Committee
members have the opportunity to propose amendments to the ongoing status quo in ran-
dom order, determined at the start of the period. If a proposal is voted up, then it is
implemented in that period and becomes the next period’s status quo. If all proposers
fail to amend the status quo, then it is implemented and remains in place until the next
period.
       The choice between a risky reform and a safe alternative is modeled as a bandit problem
in the spirit of Keller et al. (2005), but with heterogeneous payoffs across committee mem-
bers. The safe alternative generates a certain benefit if selected, but these benefits differ
across members. If the reform is good, then it generates benefits stochastically. These
benefits also differ across committee members. If the reform is not good, then it never
generates benefits. There is a prior belief that the reform is good and this is common to all
committee members. With each failed attempt at reform, all committee members update
their beliefs about whether the reform is good or not according to Bayes’ rule. Thus, with
each failure the belief that the reform is good decreases, and the expected payoff from the
   1
       This endogenous status quo feature of dynamic policymaking as been used in a number of recent papers
and in a variety of policy settings. These include Kalandrakis (2004) (pure redistribution), Bowen et al.
(2014) (entitlement programs), Piguillem and Riboni (2015) (public spending), Dziuda and Loeper (2016)
(binary policy).


                                                      3
reform also decreases. If the reform produces a success, then all committee members know
the reform is good with probability one. In the absence of bargaining, a utilitarian social
planner follows a rule according to which the reform is attempted until the belief that it
is good is sufficiently small. We call this the optimal stopping rule.
    We begin the analysis of the dynamic bargaining game with the case in which no
redistribution is allowed and find that the committee, in general, does not implement the
optimal stopping rule. More precisely, we show that there is a unique equilibrium outcome
and it is inefficient. Either experimentation never occurs, or the committee implements a
stopping rule whose cutoff belief for ending experimentation is the lowest median among
the committee members’ ideal cutoffs. We conclude that whenever this cutoff differs from
the social planner’s ideal cutoff, then the committee fails to implement the optimal stopping
rule.
    We then turn to the other extreme case, in which the committee can freely redistribute
revenues among its members. Perhaps unsurprisingly, we find that all equilibria sustain
the optimal stopping rule. The heterogeneity of the relative benefits from experimentation
among committee members is immaterial when those benefits can be fully redistributed.
Coupled with the no-redistribution case, this result seems to suggest that constraints on
redistribution are the main impediments to socially efficient experimentation. But our
analysis of the more realistic case in which redistribution is limited reveals that this is
not the complete picture. Indeed, with a non-collegial voting rule (i.e., without veto
players), socially efficient experimentation is attainable as long as the exogenous constraint
on redistribution is relaxed (even marginally). In contrast, with collegial rules, a minimum
level of redistribution must be permitted to sustain the optimal stopping rule.
    We conclude from our analysis that in situations where redistribution is limited, veto
rights, not the constraints on redistribution, are the main obstacle to efficient policy ex-
perimentation. Committees with veto players, who can block proposals to move away
from current policies, constitute an empirically important class of institutions (e.g., the
United Nations Security Council and presidential veto power in the US Congress). Our
focus on experimentation and redistribution thus offers a different perspective to exist-


                                              4
ing analyses of the normative implications of voting rules on committee decision making,
which have mainly concentrated on the information-aggregation channel. In our collective-
experimentation framework, non-collegial voting rules permit socially efficient experimen-
tation for a larger set of parameters than do collegial rules, so that the former rules “dom-
inate” the latter in the sense of Bouton et al. (2018).



Related literature This project is most closely related to the literature on collective
experimentation and voting rules, including Strulovici (2010), and Messner and Polborn
(2012). Like our paper, these papers study how various voting rules affect incentives to
experiment in committees. Messner and Polborn (2012) consider a two-period model and
compare the optimality of different majority rules. We consider an infinite horizon model
with general decision rules (collegial and non-collegial), which include all non-unanimity
majority rules as examples of non-collegial, and unanimity as an example of collegial. In
an infinite horizon setting, Strulovici (2010) shows that efficient policy experimentation
cannot be sustained with voting. This occurs as voters learn whether or not the policy
will be beneficial to them. In contrast to Strulovici (2010), we assume that agents know
their potential future benefit from experimentation, but there is a common uncertainty
about whether the reform is good. In this sense, a conflict exists between voters prior to
beginning experimentation and continues throughout experimentation. We show that this
conflict can be mitigated with a sufficient level of redistribution. Acemoglu et al. (2015)
consider a model of collective experimentation over political institutions, in which trials
of the risky alternative involve uncertainty not only about its payoff implications but also
about who controls political power. Strulovici (2010), Messner and Polborn (2012) and
Acemoglu et al. (2015) do not consider redistribution. Other papers considering policy
experimentation and politics include Majumdar and Mukand (2004), Volden et al. (2008),
Cai and Treisman (2009), Callander (2011), Callander and Hummel (2014), Hirsch (2016)
and Freer et al. (2018). These papers do not consider dynamic committee bargaining and
policy experimentation.
   Our paper compares committees with non-collegial voting rules (without veto players),


                                              5
to committees with collegial rules (with veto players). This focus connects the current
paper to a rich literature on veto players. This literature includes the seminal works by
Tsebelis (2002) and Krehbiel (1998). As with a number of papers in this literature, we
conclude that the presence of veto players can generate inefficiencies.2 The inefficiency
we identify is the inability of a committee to optimally experiment with reform when this
requires the decision to both optimally begin the experiment and end the experiment when
it proves to be unsuccessful.3
       We consider that policies, once implemented, can only be changed with a new round of
voting, and hence what we do relates to the literature on bargaining with an endogenous
status quo, pioneered by Baron (1996). Our framework extends the stationary divide-
the-dollar framework studied in Kalandrakis (2004, 2010), Battaglini and Palfrey (2012),
Bowen and Zahran (2012), Baron and Bowen (2015), Nunnari (2014), Richter (2014),
and Anesi and Seidmann (2015), by adding experimentation and taxation components
to the choice space. To establish our efficiency result for non-collegial voting rules and
limited redistribution (Proposition 2), we exploit the constructive techniques developed
in Baron and Bowen (2015), Anesi and Seidmann (2015), and Anesi and Duggan (2018)
but push this further to construct an efficient Markovian equilibrium in a non-stationary
environment where: (i) the size of the benefits allocated in each period is endogenously
determined by policy choices, and (ii) the committee members’ policy preferences over an
additional (non-redistributive) policy dimension evolve with their endogenous beliefs. Our
characterization of non-stationary equilibria for collegial voting rules also extends the work
of Nunnari (2014) who focuses on stationary Markov perfect equilibria in divide-the-dollar
environments with veto players.
       Merlo and Wilson (1995) and Eraslan and Merlo (2002) also analyze legislative bargain-
ing games in which the size of the revenues to be distributed among committee members
evolves stochastically over time. In contrast to our framework, however, the stochastic
   2
       A notable exception is recent work by Hirsch et al. (2015) who find that veto players can have positive
effects under some conditions by forcing higher quality policy change.
    3
      This inefficiency is also supported by some empirical work. For example, Peritz (2017) provides
empirical evidence that a greater number of veto players can hinder compliance with WTO dispute rulings.

process that governs the evolution of benefits is autonomous, and bargaining ends as soon
as an agreement is reached.
        This paper is related to the substantial body of political economy research studying
political failures, which was first articulated by Besley and Coate (1998). More closely
related are papers by Alesina and Drazen (1991), Fernandez and Rodrik (1991) and Dziuda
and Loeper (2016). These papers explore inefficient policy persistence, but do not consider
how this might be affected by the voting rule of the committee deciding how to distribute
resources. Dewatripont and Roland (1992) examined gradualism in reforms, but did not
consider how this is affected by redistribution. Tornell (1998) also provides a theory of
reform, but does not focus on the impact of redistribution.
        The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present our model
of dynamic policy making in a committee. In Sections 3 and 4, we analyze two important
benchmarks – the optimal stopping rule and the equilibrium outcome in the case of no
redistribution. In Section 5 we consider that redistribution is allowed and consider non-
collegial and collegial rules separately. We conclude with a discussion of the results in
Section 6.


2        Model

Players, policies and preferences. We present a stylized model of dynamic policy
making by a committee (such as a legislature, or members of an international organization),
which consists of n ≥ 3 members: N ≡ {1, . . . , n}. Time is divided into discrete periods
of length ∆ > 0, and the committee meets at the beginning of each period. We will
subsequently focus on the limiting case as ∆ becomes arbitrarily short.4
    4
        This approach of “discretizing” dynamic games is common in the experimentation literature (e.g.,
Murto and Välimäki (2011)). It permits the analysis of how heterogeneous agents collectively trade off
exploration and exploitation in experimentation, while avoiding the standard difficulties inherent in for-
mulating continuous-time games with history-dependent behavior (e.g., Bergin and MacLeod (1993)). The
heterogeneity of preferences over experimentation, which is crucial to our analysis, would vanish with
patience in the discrete analogue of our model.




                                                     7
   In each period t the committee has to choose a policy pt that has three components.
The first component of the policy at is a choice to engage in a risky reform R or implement
a known safe alternative S. The reform R is either good or bad. There are two possible
outcomes if it is implemented, success or failure. The probability of success is γ∆ if the
reform is good and the probability of success is 0 if it is bad. Thus good news from the
reform is conclusive. Committee member i places value ri > 0 on a success, and 0 on
a failure. If implemented, the safe alternative S gives individual i a per-period benefit
                                            P                  P
of ∆si > 0 with probability one. Let r̄ ≡ i∈N ri and s̄ ≡ i∈N si , and assume that
γ r̄ > s̄ > 0, so that the reform, if good, is better than the safe alternative in expectation.
The second component of pt is a tax rate on individual benefits τ t . We assume that
there is an exogenous upper bound τ̂ ∈ [0, 1] on τ t , so that τ t ∈ [0, τ̂ ]. This upper
bound represents an exogenous constraint on redistribution. The third component of pt ,
denoted xt , is a choice of how to redistribute the tax revenues raised in period t and hence
xt ∈ X ≡ (x1 , . . . , xn ) ∈ [0, 1]n :
                                       P
                                          i∈N xi = 1 .

   If policy pt = (at , τ t , xt ) is implemented at the start of period t and committee member
i believes that the reform is good with probability α, then her (per-period) expected payoff
is given by
                                     
                                      αγ∆(1 − τ t )ri + τ t xt r̄ if at = R ,
                     t t t                                       i
                wi (a , τ , x | α) ≡

                                                    i       i

Committee members discount at the continuously compounded rate ρ — so that the com-
mon discount factor is δ = e−ρ∆ — and seek to maximize their average discounted sums
of payoffs.


Policy making. We model policy-making using a dynamic bargaining framework with
an endogenous status quo. Each period t begins with a status quo policy pt−1 , inherited
from the previous period. An order of proposers (π1 , . . . , πn ) is randomly selected from the
set Π of all permutations of N , with each permutation in Π having a positive probability of
being selected. Proposer π1 then makes the first proposal p = (a, τ, x) ∈ {R, S}×[0, τ̂ ]×X;
once the proposal is made committee members vote sequentially (in arbitrary order) over


                                                8
whether to accept it.5 The proposal is accepted if a coalition C ∈ D of committee members
vote to accept, and it is rejected otherwise, where D ⊆ 2N \ {∅} is the collection of decisive
coalitions. If the proposal is accepted, then it is implemented, payoffs accrue and the game
transitions to the next period, where the new status quo is pt = p; otherwise, proposer π2
is called upon to make a proposal and the same process is repeated. If the n proposers
all make unsuccessful proposals, then the status quo pt−1 is implemented and remains the
status quo in period t + 1. Each proposal round takes a negligible amount of time.
       The game begins with the exogenously given status quo p0 ≡ (a0 , τ 0 , x0 ), where a0 ≡ S,
τ 0 ≡ 0 and x0i ≡ si /s̄ for all i ∈ N . That is, the initial status quo consists of the safe
alternative and no redistribution of individual benefits.
       We make standard assumptions on the set of decisive coalitions D (e.g., Austen-Smith
and Banks (1999)). We assume the voting rule D is proper, i.e., every pair of decisive
coalitions has a nonempty intersection: C1 , C2 ∈ D implies C1 ∩ C2 6= ∅. Moreover, we
assume D is monotonic, i.e., any superset of a decisive coalition is itself decisive: C1 ∈ D
and C1 ⊆ C2 imply C2 ∈ D. We will say that D is collegial if there is some committee
                                                     T
member who belongs to every decisive coalition, i.e., D 6= ∅; we refer to such a committee
member as a vetoer. The family of collegial voting rules includes unanimity rule (i.e.,
D = {N }) and dictatorships (i.e., D = {C ⊆ N : C 3 i} for some i ∈ N ). If no player has
a veto, then D is non-collegial. For example, any quota rule defined by D = {C : |C| ≥ q},
where q satisfies n/2 < q < n, is non-collegial.


Learning. The initial probability that the risky reform R is good is given by α0 ∈ (0, 1).
Committee members update their (common) belief about R’s type through the sequence
of policy choices using Bayes’ rule. The first successful trial of R reveals to all committee
members that it is good, and hence the common belief updates to one. In the event that
k ∈ N trials are unsuccessful, the belief is

                                                  α0 (1 − γ∆)k
                                      αk ≡                         .
                                             α0 (1 − γ∆)k + 1 − α0
   5
       Sequential voting is the standard approach with non-Markovian equilibrium concepts — e.g., Cho et al.
(2009). This ensures that agents always vote as if pivotal.


                                                      9
       
Let A ≡ αk : k = 0, 1, 2, . . . ∪ {1} be the set of possible values for the belief.


Equilibrium. As stated, our objective is to explore the institutional mechanisms that
support socially efficient experimentation. To do so, we follow closely the approach taken by
Acemoglu et al. (2008), studying conditions under which efficient experimentation can be
sustained by renegotiation-proof (pure strategy) perfect Bayesian equilibria (PBEs). Note
that, in an equilibrium of this game, committee members’ beliefs are necessarily given by
Bayes’ rule. An equilibrium is said to be renegotiation-proof if, after any public history,
there does not exist another PBE that can make all players weakly better off (and some
strictly better off).6 However, we will not impose any refinement of PBE when stating
our negative results (those claiming that efficient policies cannot be sustained) in order
to make them stronger. In order to limit the number of possible cases (without affecting
the paper’s conclusions), we will also assume that in case of a tie, a player will prefer to
continue rather than to stop experimenting. Henceforth we will refer to an equilibrium with
this tie-breaking rule as simply an equilibrium, and we will refer to a renegotiation-proof
PBE with this tie-breaking rule as a renegotiation-proof equilibrium.


3        The Optimal Stopping Rule

To highlight the normative implications of redistribution on experimentation outcomes,
we analyze the benchmark case of a utilitarian social planner to which later results can
be compared. Consider the problem of a social planner whose objective is to maximize
aggregate payoffs. This is a standard Markov decision problem with the planner’s belief as
a state variable. When the belief is αk and the planner implements the risky reform R she
obtains, in addition to the expected aggregate revenue αk γ∆r̄, some information that she
uses to update her beliefs. When she implements the safe alternative S she only obtains
the aggregate revenue s̄∆ and her belief remains unchanged. Therefore, if the optimal
solution requires S to be implemented in a given period t, then the belief will remain the
    6
        Though the game has imperfect information, all players are symmetrically informed at every history
and, therefore, the usual interpretation of renegotiation-proofness applies.



                                                     10
same and S will also be implemented in all future periods. As is standard in the literature
on experimentation, it follows that the optimal solution is a stopping rule: there exists a
k ∗ ∈ N such that, after k ∗ unsuccessful trials of R, the belief is so low that the planner
suspends experimentation and implements the safe alternative only.
   Formally, let V ∗ (α) be the planner’s average discounted value from a period that begins
with a belief α. That is, if the planner applies the optimal stopping rule, then V ∗ (α) is the
expected sum of the committee members’ average discounted payoffs from the resulting
outcome path. As γ r̄ > s̄, we evidently have V ∗ (1) = γ∆r̄. If the social planner chooses
to continue experimenting when the belief is αk , then her expected payoff is equal to
  1 − δ(1 − γ∆) αk γ∆r̄ + δ(1 − αk γ∆)V ∗ (αk+1 ). If she chooses to stop, then her payoff is
              

s̄∆. Hence,
                            n                                                    o
          V ∗ (αk ) = max     1 − δ(1 − γ∆) αk γ∆r̄ + δ(1 − αk γ∆)V ∗ (αk+1 ), s̄∆ .
                                           


   Denote the optimal cutoff by α∗ . Recall that periods are discrete and thus α∗ must
be an element of the set of feasible beliefs A. The optimal cutoff α∗ may thus be strictly
smaller than the belief that makes the social planner indifferent between continuing with
the reform for one more period and switching to the safe alternative. Noting that if
αk = α∗ , then V ∗ (αk+1 ) = s̄∆, we obtain

We will say that an equilibrium sustains the optimal stopping rule if the committee applies
the optimal stopping rule on the equilibrium path.
   To make things interesting, we wish to study situations where social optimality dictates
to experiment for at least one period, and thus α∗ < α0 , for ∆ sufficiently small. Note
that, as ∆ → 0, the social planner’s ideal cutoff converges to
                                (                           )

Imposing α0 > ρ/(γ (ρ + γ)(r̄/s̄) − 1 ) guarantees that there is a ∆

4        Policy Experimentation without Redistribution

We now return to the analysis of the bargaining game introduced in Section 2. Throughout
this section, we assume that no redistribution is permitted, i.e., τ̂ = 0. Comparison of this
case to the social planner’s benchmark reveals that in the absence of redistribution, socially
efficient experimentation typically cannot be sustained in equilibrium.
        To begin we must establish some notation. By the same logic as above, each committee
member i’s ideal experimentation plan is a stopping rule with cutoff
                  (        (                                                ))
                                                       (1 − δ)
        α̂i ≡ min α0 , max α ∈ A : α <                                       .
                                          γ (1 − δ(1 − γ∆))(ri /si ) − δ∆

This is the rule that committee member i would implement in every equilibrium if she
were a dictator, i.e., if D = {C ⊆ N : C 3 i}. Note that α̂i is (weakly) decreasing in the
ratio ri /si . That is, each committee member’s incentive to experiment increases with the
extent to which she values the reform over the safe alternative. Henceforth, without loss of
generality, we order committee members such that ri /si ≤ ri+1 /si+1 and thus committee
member 1 wishes to cease experimenting first. Moreover, we refer to α̂i as committee
member i’s ideal cutoff, and to ri /si as her benefit ratio. We find it useful to identify two
key members of the committee defined as follows.7

Definition 1. Committee member i ∈ N is a pivot for voting rule D if {j ∈ N : α̂j <
α̂i } ∈
      / D and {j ∈ N : α̂j > α̂i } ∈
                                   / D. The set of pivots for D is denoted P (D), and we
refer to l ≡ min P (D) and         r   ≡ max P (D) as the left and right pivots, respectively.

        Observe that coalitions {1, . . . , r} and {l, . . . , n} must be decisive for every voting rule
D; otherwise, by monotonicity of D, the right pivot would be greater than                    r   and the left
pivot smaller than l. Furthermore, it follows immediately from Definition 1 that coalition
    7
        The terms left pivot and right pivot in Definition 1 are related to similar terms described in Dziuda
and Loeper (2018). We provide a formal definition for our context.




                                                       12
{1, . . . , l} is blocking, in the sense that a policy proposal can only be accepted if at least
one member of that coalition votes to accept it.
   Next, let V i (αk ) be the average dynamic payoff to committee member i at the start of
the game induced by a stopping rule with cutoff αk ∈ A \ {1}. When the cutoff is αk , in
each of the first k periods, player i receives (1 − δ)ri if the reform is good and successful.
This occurs with probability α0 γ∆. Starting from period k + 1 onward there are two
possible cases. In the first case, the reform succeeds in at least one of the first k periods,
and it is implemented from period k + 1 on. This occurs with probability α0 [1 − (1 − γ∆)k ]
and yields a per-period expected payoff of (1 − δ)γ∆ri . In the second case, the first k trials
are all unsuccessful, and the safe alternative S is implemented from period k + 1 on. This
occurs with the complementary probability [1 − α0 1 − (1 − γ∆)k ] and yields a per-period
                                                                  

payoff of (1 − δ)∆si . Thus committee member i’s dynamic payoff for cutoff αk is given by
                                   h                                               i

                                                                           

   Our first result gives a complete characterization of the equilibria for the bargaining
game in terms of the voting rule and the distribution of ideal cutoffs.

Proposition 1. Suppose τ̂ = 0. For all voting rules there is a unique equilibrium outcome
that takes the form of a stopping rule with cutoff:
                                   
                                    α̂r if V α̂r  ≥ s ∆ ,
                                              l        l
                              ᾱ =
                                    α otherwise.
                                         0


   In words, Proposition 1 states that if experimentation begins it always ends at the right
pivot’s ideal cutoff α̂r . Furthermore, experimentation only begins if the left pivot’s dynamic
                                  
payoff using this cutoff, V l α̂r , exceeds the left pivot’s status quo payoff, sl ∆. Otherwise,
experimentation will never begin. Thus the left pivot determines whether experimentation
begins, and the right pivot determines the belief at which experimentation ends.


                                               13
    An immediate consequence of Proposition 1 is that if n is odd and the voting rule
                            
is simple majority, i.e. D = C ⊆ N : |C| ≥ (n + 1)/2 , then the stopping rule with
the median committee member’s ideal cutoff is implemented. This is reminiscent of the
well-known median voter theory, where an odd number of voters with static, single-peaked
preferences must collectively choose a policy from a unidimensional choice space. However,
the logic behind Proposition 1 is more subtle, not only because this is a dynamic setting
with evolving status quo and beliefs, but mainly because policy preferences in each period
are endogenously determined by equilibrium behavior in future periods. To see this, we
discuss the intuition for the proof below.
   Although equilibrium continuation values could intricately depend on the previous
history of play, we first show that if the belief becomes smaller than or equal to committee
member n’s ideal cutoff, α̂n , the safe alternative must be implemented in every period of
every continuation game. Therefore, when the belief is αk with αk+1 = α̂n , the members of
the decisive coalition {1, . . . , r} can play in accordance with their own preferences without
risking to trigger adverse decisions in future periods: they will always agree to switch from
R to S if R is the status quo, and will always reject any proposal to change S to R if S is
the status quo.
   Applying the same logic recursively, we obtain that whenever the belief αk is smaller
than α̂r , the equilibrium outcome of every continuation game is unique and has to be a
stopping rule with cutoff αk . Now consider any belief αk ≥ α̂r . All agents that wish
to experiment more prefer to do so right away rather than wait to experiment because by
waiting, expected future benefits are further discounted. This turns the dynamic bargaining
problem into the choice between two options: implementing the stopping rule with cutoff
                                                     
α̂r , or maintaining the safe alternative. If V l α̂r ≥ sl ∆, then the left pivot l and, by
single-peakedness, all the other members of the decisive coalition {l, . . . , n} prefer the
first option. The stopping rule with cutoff α̂r must therefore be the unique equilibrium
                           
outcome. If instead V l α̂r < sl ∆, then the left pivot l and all the other members of the
blocking coalition {1, . . . , l} prefer to maintain the initial status quo S and, consequently,
experimentation never occurs — i.e., the unique equilibrium cutoff is α0 .


                                              14
   It follows from the previous discussion that with simple majority voting and an odd
number of heterogeneous committee members, the committee always over-experiments
if α̂r < α∗ , and always under-experiments if α̂r > α∗ . With any voting rule, it over-
experiments if α̂r < α∗ and V l α̂r ≥ sl ∆, and it under-experiments either if α̂r > α∗ and
                                    

V l α̂r ≥ sl ∆, or if V l α̂r < sl ∆ and α∗ 6= α0 . Assumption A1 guarantees that α∗ > α0

for ∆ sufficiently small and hence some experimentation is optimal. We summarize this in
the following corollary.

Corollary 1. Suppose τ̂ = 0. If rr /sr 6= r̄/s̄, then there exists ∆0 > 0 such that, whenever
∆ < ∆0 , all equilibria fail to sustain the optimal stopping rule.

   Corollary 1 states that, in the absence of redistribution, every equilibrium fails to
sustain the optimal stopping rule (in the limit as ∆ → 0) whenever the right pivot’s
benefit ratio differs from r̄/s̄, which is generically the case. We conclude that efficient
experimentation is typically impossible without redistribution.
   We end this section with a remark on Pareto inefficiency. Proposition 1 and Corollary
1 show how under-experimentation may happen under any voting rule, yielding socially
inefficient outcomes in equilibrium (in a Utilitarian sense). But such equilibrium outcomes
may even be Pareto dominated. This is illustrated by the following example.
   Suppose n = 5 and D is a quota rule with quota q = 4 (so that           l   = 2 < 4 = r).
Set ρ = γ = α0 = 2/3, ri = 2 for all i, si = 1 for all i ∈ {1, 2, 3}, and si =  for
all i ∈ {4, 5}, where  > 0 is arbitrarily small. It is readily checked that under these
assumptions, lim∆→0 α̂i = 3/5 < α0 for all i ∈ {1, 2, 3}, and lim∆→0 α̂i = 3/(8 − 3) for
all i ∈ {4, 5}. Hence, for arbitrarily small ∆ > 0, the right pivot’s optimal stopping rule
converges to perpetual experimentation as  → 0. Further, V l (α̂r ) → 8∆/9 < ∆ = sl ∆, as
 → 0, so the left pivot’s dynamic payoff under the right pivot’s optimal stopping rule is
lower than the left pivot’s status quo payoff. It therefore follows from Proposition 1 that,
for sufficiently small  (and sufficiently small ∆ > 0), the reform is never implemented
in equilibrium, although all committee members would be better off experimenting for a
positive number of periods. The reason is that, while committee members in the blocking
coalition {1, 2} would like to experiment, because of the endogeneity of the status quo,

                                              15
they fear that experimentation will go on for too long, so they prefer not to experiment at
all.


5       Policy Experimentation and Redistribution

We have seen in Section 4 that the optimal stopping rule is typically not sustainable in
equilibrium without redistribution. In this section, we ask whether this is still true when it
is possible to redistribute the revenues from experimentation among committee members.
We begin with the benchmark case in which the committee can freely redistribute revenues
among its members, and then turn to the (more empirically relevant) case of constrained
redistribution.


5.1      Policy Experimentation with Unconstrained Redistribution

Suppose τ̂ = 1, so that redistribution is unconstrained. As all resources can be redis-
tributed, benefit ratios are no longer relevant and each agent that receives a share of
the surplus has an incentive to maximize that share. This is maximized when the opti-
mal stopping rule is implemented. Moreover, full redistribution allows great flexibility in
creating “rewards” and “punishments” that provide the incentives to implement optimal
policies. Although we have such flexibility, we must still ensure that any such punishments
are themselves consistent with renegotiation-proofness. We can show that in spite of this
constraint, every renegotiation-proof equilibrium sustains the optimal stopping rule for
sufficiently small period length.

Proposition 2. Suppose τ̂ = 1. Then, for any voting rule, there exists ∆ > 0 such that,
for all ∆ < ∆, renegotiation-proof equilibria exist and all of them sustain the optimal
stopping rule.

       The proof of this result borrows insights from the repeated-games literature. For every
voting rule D, we first identify a lower-bound wi (p | α) on each committee member i’s
equilibrium payoff at the start of any period that begins with status quo policy p and
belief α. It follows that equilibrium payoff vectors must belong to the simplex W (p | α) ≡

                                               16
                                Pn
    (w1 , . . . , wn ) ∈ Rn :             ≤ V ∗ (α) , and wi ≥ wi (p | α) for all i . Recall that p0 is

                                 i=1 wi

the status quo policy in period zero with the safe alternative and no redistribution. Next,
for each payoff vector w∗ on the Pareto frontier of W (p0 | α0 ) we construct a renegotiation-
proof equilibrium that supports w∗ (for sufficiently small ∆), thus establishing that every
renegotiation-proof equilibrium payoff vector (w1 , . . . , wn ) must satisfy ni=1 wi = V ∗ (α0 ),
                                                                             P

as desired. In this equilibrium construction, committee members are able to coordinate on
an efficient experimentation rule not only at the beginning of the game but also at any time
during the game, whether on or off the equilibrium path. Should any member i ever deviate
from the prescribed behavior at any status quo p and belief α, the committee implements
an efficient equilibrium point in W (p | α) that gives i her most severe punishment payoff
wi (p | α).
      Thus, without bounds on redistribution, collective experimentation must yield efficient
outcomes. In view of Corollary 1, this result may give the impression that constraints
on redistribution are the primary cause of inefficiency in collective experimentation. In
the next section we will see that this is not the complete picture for the realistic case of
constrained redistribution. There we see that voting rules may play a more significant role.


5.2       Policy Experimentation with Constrained Redistribution

Proposition 2 prompts the following question: How much stronger is full redistribution
than the condition necessary for efficient experimentation in equilibrium? The answer
critically turns on the voting rule. We first consider non-collegial voting rules and then
collegial rules.


5.2.1       Non-collegial Voting Rules

In stark contrast to the case of no redistribution, our next proposition states that with non-
collegial voting rules the optimal stopping rule can be sustained by a renegotiation-proof
equilibrium for any level of redistribution. In fact, something stronger is true: although
stationary Markov strategies sharply constrain the ability to punish and reward committee
members for past behavior, the renegotiation-proof equilibrium that sustains the optimal


                                                       17
stopping rule can be taken to be stationary Markov.8

Proposition 3. Suppose D is non-collegial, i.e., no committee member has a veto. Then,
the following holds for every upper bound τ̂ > 0: there exists ∆ > 0 such that, for all
∆ < ∆, the optimal stopping rule is sustained by a (stationary Markov) renegotiation-
proof equilibrium.

       The proof of Proposition 3 is constructive. The idea of the construction is simple:
it is built around a collection of (n − 1)-member coalitions — the potential “governing
coalitions.” These governing coalitions have the property that each committee member
belongs to at least one of these coalitions but not to all of them. The same thing inevitably
happens from any history (both on and off the equilibrium path): the optimal stopping
rule is implemented and, in every period, the members of a given governing coalition
equally share the sum of the expected aggregate revenues that can be redistributed, i.e.,
τ̂ αk γ∆r̄ > 0 if the belief αk exceeds α∗ , and τ̂ s̄∆ > 0 otherwise.
       At the start of every period, the status quo policy and the current belief — which
are payoff relevant — reveal to the committee whether play in the previous period was
consistent with the optimal stopping rule, and whether a governing coalition formed (i.e.,
equally shared the entire transferable benefits among its members). If this is the case,
then the same governing coalition forms again and continues to implement the optimal
stopping rule; otherwise, the (randomly selected) first proposer successfully offers to form
a governing coalition and to follow the optimal stopping rule.
       Given the inevitability of this process, the best possible scenario for any committee
member is to form or be a member of the governing coalition that will share the trans-
ferable revenues from experimentation in every future period. For any member i of such
a coalition, the potential benefits of a one-period deviation vanish as the period length ∆
becomes arbitrarily small, whereas the long-run cost does not: a deviation would trigger
the formation of a new governing coalition in the next period, which i might not be a
   8
       Of course, renegotiation-proofness already constitutes an obstacle to the construction of efficient equi-
libria, as it may reduce the severity of the off-path “punishments” available to support the appropriate
incentives (which must themselves be renegotiation-proof).


                                                       18
member of. Though this would have no impact on the proportion (1 − τ̂ ) of her future
payoffs that cannot be redistributed (since the optimal stopping rule is implemented in
any case), she would potentially lose a proportion τ̂ > 0 of her share of future aggregate
revenues as a member of the governing coalition. As no member of a governing coalition
is prepared to run such a risk and governing coalitions are decisive (recall that no player
has a veto), profitable deviations from the prescribed path are impossible. Moreover, this
equilibrium is renegotiation-proof since it generates payoff vectors on the Pareto frontier
both on and off the path.
   In contrast to Corollary 1, which is an “impossibility result”, Proposition 3 says that
it is possible for the committee to implement the optimal stopping rule in equilibrium. In
line with the relational-contracts literature, a possible interpretation of the proposition is
that committee members can credibly agree to play an equilibrium that sustains efficient
experimentation, and could not agree to replace it with another equilibrium once it is
in place. While we follow Acemoglu et al.’s (2008) approach of focusing on the “best
sustainable mechanisms,” it should be noted, however, that there are other renegotiation-
proof equilibria that do not sustain the optimal stopping rule. Therefore, it is not clear how
committee members would select an equilibrium. One can argue that the above equilibrium
is focal in the sense of Schelling (1960), as it is the only one whose payoff vector belongs
to the (unconstrained) Pareto frontier; this is the approach taken, for example, by Dixit
and Olson (2000).


5.2.2   Collegial Voting Rules

Given the result obtained for non-collegial voting rules in the previous subsection, it is
natural to ask whether the optimal stopping rule is also sustainable with any level of
redistribution under collegial voting rules. A little reflection suggests that the answer is
no because of the presence of veto players. Indeed, efficient experimentation requires two
sets of incentive constraints to be met. The first set ensures that the “vetoers” all agree
to change the initial status quo policy to some (R, τ, x), x ∈ X and τ ∈ [0, τ̂ ]; the second
ensures that if the belief becomes equal to α∗ , then they all agree to stop experimenting.


                                             19
       Formally, the first constraint requires that each vetoer i’s equilibrium continuation
value from implementing (R, τ, x) in the first period is greater than or equal to her payoff
from maintaining the initial status quo in all future periods. In the benchmark case where
τ̂ = 0, this is equivalent to V i (α∗ ) ≥ ∆si for each committee member i who has a veto
(where V i (·) is given in equation (1)). We rearrange terms, take the limit as ∆ goes to
zero, and apply l’Hôpital’s rule to obtain

                               1 − eψ(1+ργ) α0 γri + eψργ (1 − α0 + eψ α0 )si ≥ si ,

       Let v be the vetoer who wishes to cease experimenting first, i.e., v ≡ min                               D. It
follows that if v’s benefit ratio satisfies

                                             rv   1 − eψργ (1 − α0 + eψ α0 )

then there exists T > 0 such that, for every τ̂ ∈ [0, T ), her incentive constraint is always
violated for arbitrarily small ∆’s. Intuitively, when τ̂ < T , the permitted level of redistribu-
tion is not sufficiently large to compensate committee member v’s loss from experimenting
and, consequently, the optimal stopping rule is not sustainable in equilibrium.
       The second key incentive constraint in the construction of efficient equilibria formally
requires that if the belief becomes equal to α∗ , then each vetoer i’s continuation value from
from accepting a proposal to cease experimenting exceeds her equilibrium continuation
value from rejecting it. It is readily checked that the former continuation value can be
written as (1 − τ̂ )si + τ̂ yi s̄ ∆, for some y ∈ X.9 For every status quo policy (R, τ 0 , z), the

necessary condition for the existence of an equilibrium that supports the optimal stopping
rule is that (1 − τ̂ )si + τ̂ yi s̄ ≥ α∗ γ (1 − τ 0 )ri + τ 0 zi r̄ for some y, z ∈ X, τ 0 ∈ [0, τ̂ ], and all

then there exists T > 0 such that, for every τ̂ ∈ [0, T ) and arbitrarily small ∆, vetoer v’s
incentive constraint cannot hold. Because of the committee’s imperfect ability to redis-
tribute the benefits from ending experimentation towards vetoer v, the latter must reject
any proposal to stop experimenting when the belief is α∗ in equilibrium.
    The discussion above is summarized in the following proposition.

Proposition 4. Suppose D is collegial (i.e., some players have a veto). If either condition
(2) or (3) is satisfied, then there exists T > 0 such that the following holds for all τ̂ ∈ [0, T ):
there is ∆
         b > 0 such that, whenever ∆ < ∆,
                                       b every equilibrium fails to sustain the optimal

stopping rule.

    This proposition shows that institutional details matter: in contrast to any non-collegial
voting rule, efficient experimentation may not be attainable under a collegial voting rule
if not enough redistribution is permitted. Under the premises of the proposition, even
unrefined equilibria all fail to support the optimal stopping rule. Moreover, there is no
general lower bound on τ̂ < 1 allowing to avoid this negative conclusion. This is easily seen
by considering the case where D is dictatorial, i.e., D = {C ⊆ N : C 3 i} for some i ∈ N .
It follows immediately from the analysis in Section 3 that if the dictator’s benefit ratio
differs from the social planner’s (i.e., if ri /si 6= r̄/s̄) and τ̂ < 1, then every equilibrium fails
to sustain the optimal stopping rule.
    Coupled with Proposition 3, Proposition 4 suggests that veto rights, instead of con-
straints on redistribution, can hamper optimal experimentation in committees: constraints
on redistribution (as long as they do not completely prevent redistribution) can only create
inefficiencies if the voting rule is collegial.

6         Concluding Remarks

We analyze a dynamic model of committee decision making in which the benefits of re-
form may or may not be redistributed. Several conclusions emerge from the analysis.
First, except for nongeneric cases, socially efficient experimentation necessitates redistri-
bution. That is, when no redistribution is possible, the optimal stopping rule is generically
unachievable. Second, if the committee can freely redistribute all the revenues from exper-
imentation among its members, then the inefficiencies of the no-redistribution case vanish:
it always implements the optimal stopping rule. Third, in the more realistic case where
redistribution is constrained, arbitrarily small amounts of redistribution suffice to support
socially efficient experimentation if the voting rule is collegial. This applies to committees
such as legislatures governed by majority or supermajority rules. And fourth, if the voting
rule is non-collegial, then the optimal stopping rule can be sustained only with a suffi-
cient amount of redistribution. Collegial voting rules, such as unanimity, are ubiquitous in
international policymaking and other settings.10
         Two implications directly follow from these results. The first speaks to a major question
in the study of political institutions (e.g., McCarty (2000)): How do veto powers affect
policy outcomes? It follows from our analysis that, in situations where committees can
only partially redistribute the gains from policy experimentation among their members,
veto powers may be detrimental to social welfare by rendering efficient experimentation
unachievable. Our results also speak to the normative question of what voting rules can
support efficient collective experimentation (e.g. Strulovici (2010)). Proposition 3 provides
a simple answer: As long as some share of aggregate revenues can be redistributed, efficient
experimentation can be sustained under any non-collegial voting rule.
         The redistributive tool we have used to support efficient policy experimentation can be
used in other settings. In the case of non-collegial voting rules we have supported efficient
experimentation by linking the equilibrium of the experimentation game to an equilibrium
of the redistribution game with a structure of dynamic coalitions (similar to Anesi and
    10
         Maggi and Morelli (2006) provide theoretical conditions under which this is true if agents can choose
the voting rule ex-ante.

Seidmann (2015) and Baron and Bowen (2015)). Such “linking” of policies can be used in
other settings to support efficient policy making, and, indeed, has been used in practice
with, for example, the Paris Climate Agreement and the Green Climate Fund.
   Our analysis focuses on the frictions created by constraints on redistribution in col-
lective experimentation. Following the previous literature, we have assumed that the
committee is able to reconsider previous agreements arbitrarily frequently. It would be
interesting for future research to investigate how bargaining frictions (captured with val-
ues of ∆ bounded away from zero) affect collective-experimentation outcomes. This would
require future work to overcome technical difficulties that have not yet been addressed
in the literature on dynamic bargaining with an endogenous status quo (even without
experimentation).

                                     Appendix

A     Proof of Proposition 1

We assume throughout this section that τ̂ = 0, so that redistribution has no impact
on players’ payoffs. We represent policies as elements of {R, S}, omitting the irrelevant
sharing-rule component, to lighten notation. To prove Proposition 1, it is useful to consider
                
a class of games Γ(a, α) : a ∈ {R, S} and α ∈ A , where Γ(a, α) is the same game as that
described in Section 2, except that it begins with an initial status quo alternative a (possibly
equal to R) and a probability α (possibly different from α0 ) that Alternative R is good.
    It is useful to define the set of losers from the reform as L ≡ {i ∈ N : γri < si } and the
set of winners as W ≡ {i ∈ N : γri ≥ si }.

Lemma A1. Suppose τ̂ = 0. Then,
(i) Γ(R, 1) has a unique equilibrium outcome: Alternative R is implemented in every period
if L ∈
     / D, and alternative S is implemented in every period otherwise;
(ii) for all a ∈ {R, S} and αk ≤ α̂n , Γ(a, αk ) has a unique equilibrium outcome: Alternative
S is implemented in every period.

    The proofs of Lemma A1 and all other lemmas can be found in the Supplementary
Appendix online. We now return to the proof of the main proposition. Suppose first that
L ∈
  / D. Having characterized the unique equilibrium outcome of Γ(R, 1) and Γ(a, αk ),
for all a ∈ {R, S} and all αk ≤ α̂n , we begin with an inductive argument. Take any
k ∈ N such that (i) for each a ∈ {R, S}, alternative S is implemented in every period in
any equilibrium of Γ(a, αk+1 ), and (ii) αk ≤ α̂r . (From Lemma A1(ii), we already know
that this is the case if αk ≤ α̂n .) In the first period of Γ(S, αk ), the expected payoff
to committee member i in any equilibrium must be a convex combination of fi (αk ) ≡
             
 1 − δ(1 − γ∆) αk γ∆ri + δ(1 − αk γ∆)si ∆ and si ∆. It follows from the definition of α̂i ,
si ∆ > fi (αk ) if and only if αk ≤ α̂i . By the same logic as in the proof of Lemma A1(i),
this implies that any proposal to change status quo S to the risky alternative R must be
rejected by the members of the decisive coalition {1, . . . , r}. (The latter coalition must be

                                              24
decisive; otherwise, monotonicity of D would imply that the right pivot is greater than
r.)   Hence, si ∆ is committee member i’s unique equilibrium payoff in Γ(S, αk ). It follows
that committee member i’s payoff in the continuation game Γ(R, αk ) is fi (αk ) if R is
implemented in the first period, and ∆si otherwise. This implies that every member of the
decisive coalition {1, . . . , r} must accept any proposal to amend R to S (when decisive)
and, therefore, at least one proposer must successfully propose S in the first period in
equilibrium. We have thus established that for all αk ≤ α̂r , S is implemented in every
period of Γ(R, αk ) in any equilibrium. The unique equilibrium outcome of Γ(R, α̂r ) is
therefore the stopping rule with cutoff α̂r .
      In Section 3, we defined V i (αk ) as the expected payoff to committee member i induced
by the stopping rule with cutoff αk in Γ(S, α0 ). For every 0 ≤ ` ≤ k, we can similarly
define the expected payoff to committee member i induced by this stopping rule in Γ(S, α` )
as

      V i (αk | α` ) ≡ 1 − δ k−` (1 − γ∆)k−` α` γ∆ri + δ k−` 1 − α` + (1 − γ∆)k−` α` si ∆ .
                                                                                 


Differentiating the right side of the above equation with respect to k reveals that V i (αk |α` )
is single-peaked in k and, therefore, in the cutoff αk : it decreases with αk if αk < α̂i ,
and increases with αk if αk > α̂i . Now take any belief α` > α̂r such that the unique
equilibrium outcome of Γ(R, α`+1 ) is the stopping rule with cutoff α̂r . (From the previous
paragraph, this is the case if α`+1 = α̂r .) The expected payoff to committee member
i in any equilibrium of Γ(R, α` ) is a convex combination between V i (α̂r | α` ) and si ∆.
Moreover, it follows from the single-peakedness of V i (· | α` ) that V i (α̂r | α` ) > si ∆ =
V i (α` | α` ), for all i ≥   r   — recall that α̂i ≤ α̂r < α` for all i ≥ r. Every member of
the blocking coalition {r, . . . , n} therefore rejects any proposal to amend the status quo R
to S in the first period of Γ(R, α` ). This shows in particular that the unique equilibrium
outcome of Γ(R, α1 ) is the stopping rule with cutoff α̂r .
      Finally, consider the first period of the game — i.e., the first period of Γ(S, α0 ). It
follows from the previous paragraph that, in any equilibrium, committee member i’s payoff
must be a convex combination between V i (α̂r ) = V i (α̂r | α0 ) and si ∆ = V i (α0 | α0 ).
Suppose first that V l (α̂r ) < sl ∆, so that V i (α̂r ) < si ∆ for every member i of the blocking

                                                 25
coalition {1, . . . , l}. Every member of this coalition must therefore reject any proposal to
amend the status quo S to R in the first period. This in turn implies that the stopping
rule with cutoff α0 is the unique equilibrium outcome. Suppose now that V l (α̂r ) ≥ sl ∆.
Denoting the supremum of the equilibrium payoffs of each committee member i by Uisup ,
we thus have V i (α̂r ) ≥ Uisup ≥ si ∆ for every member i of the winning coalition C ≡
{l, . . . , n}. This implies that, in any equilibrium, the payoff of each committee member
i ∈ C from accepting a proposal to amend status quo S to R (when decisive) in the first
period of the game — i.e. V i (α̂r ) — must therefore exceed her payoff from rejecting it
— (1 − δ)∆si + δUisup . Hence, at least one member of the committee must successfully
propose alternative R in the first period. This in turn implies that the stopping rule with
cutoff α̂r is the unique equilibrium outcome, completing the proof of Proposition 1.


B     Proof of Proposition 2

In this section we prove Proposition 2 for the case of non-collegial rules. The proofs for the
various collegial rules are relegated to the Supplementary Appendix, which can be found

    Suppose that
Observe for future reference that if ∆ < ∆, then

                                                                   s̄∆    V ∗ (α)

   To establish the result it suffices to show that every payoff vector in the Pareto frontier

                                  i=1 wi = V (α0 ) can be supported in an equilibrium for

all ∆ < ∆. Take an arbitrary w0 ∈ W ∗ , and let y 0 ∈ X be defined by yi0 ≡ wi0 /V ∗ (α0 )
for all i ∈ N . Our objective is to construct an equilibrium σ, in which: (i) the committee
implements the optimal stopping rule in each period; (ii) on the path, aggregate revenues
are distributed according to y 0 in every period; and (iii) if committee member i deviates
from σ in period t then, from t + 1 on, aggregate revenues are distributed according to

for all j ∈ N . As the optimal stopping rule is implemented in every continuation game
both on and off the path, such an equilibrium must be renegotiation-proof.
       More precisely, let                      
                                                 R if α > α∗ ,

We define the strategy profile σ in terms of “phases,” formally represented by pairs in
{1, . . . , n} × {0, 1, . . . , n}. Every phase (`, i) prescribes behavior in the `th proposal stage
of any given period and in the n voting stages that follow it: “i” indicates that σ prescribes
policy a∗ (α), 1, y i to be implemented so that player i is punished. Specifically, in any
                     

period t in which the belief is α ∈ A and the order of proposers is (π1 , . . . , πn ), if the
game is in phase (`, i) 6= (n, πn ), then σ prescribes the following behavior: (i) proposer
π` offers policy a∗ (α), 1, y i ; (ii) if π` offered a∗ (α), 1, y i , then every voter accepts it
                                                                  

(irrespective of the previous voters’ behavior); and (iii) if π` offered any p 6= a∗ (α), 1, y i ,

then every voter rejects it (irrespective of the previous voters’ behavior). If the game is
in phase (n, πn ), then σ prescribes the following behavior: (i) proposer πn passes; and (ii)
every voter rejects any proposal. Phases evolve according to the following recursive rules.

objective is to avoid that the game transitions to phase j. More precisely, consider j’s
voting behavior in phase (`, i) 6= (n, πn ) when the proposer has offered policy a∗ (α), 1, y i
                                                                                                

different from the status quo. If all previous voters have accepted the proposal, or if j is
the first voter, then a∗ (α), 1, y i will be implemented in the current period, irrespective
                                    

of her decision. Her choice will only determine whether the game will transition to phase
(` + i, i) or to phase (` + 1, j). As yji ≥ yjj for all i, j ∈ N , she is better off accepting
the proposal. Now suppose that at least one of the previous voters has rejected proposal
 a∗ (α), 1, y i ; let k be the identity of the last voter who rejected. In this case, committee
               

member j’s vote will determine whether the game transitions to phase (` + 1, k) (if she
votes to accept) or to phase (` + 1, j). It follows from equation (B1) and ∆ < ∆ that she
is better off accepting, as prescribed by σ. The argument for the case where the proposer

                                                28
has offered to amend the status quo to a policy different from a∗ (α), 1, y i is analogous if
                                                                             

either j 6= πn or (`, i) 6= (n − 1, πn ) (or both): voter j acts in accordance with σ to avoid
a transition to phase (` + 1, j).
    Consider voter πn ’s behavior in phase (n − 1, πn ). Suppose first that proposer πn−1
has proposed policy a∗ (α), 1, y πn . If all previous voters have accepted the proposal, or
                                    

if πn is the first voter, then a∗ (α), 1, y πn will be implemented in the current period and
                                              

the game will transition to phase (1, πn ), irrespective of πn ’s action. Hence, she cannot
profitably deviate from σ in this case. If at least one of the previous voters has rejected
proposal a∗ (α), 1, y πn , then πn ’s payoff depends on her decision. Let α be the current
                        

belief; and let p = (a, τ, x) (resp. p0 = (a0 , τ 0 , x0 )) be the policy that will be implemented
in the current period if πn votes to accept (resp. reject) the proposal — p and p0 are
determined by the current status quo policy and by the actions prescribed by σ to the
remaining voters. By definition of σ, πn is better off accepting if
                                       1
                                          E V ∗ (α̃) | α, p ≥ (1 − δ)wπn (p0 | α) ,

where E V ∗ (α̃) | α, p is the social planner’s expected value at the start of the next period
                      

conditional on the current belief α and on p being implemented in the current period. It
follows from equation (B1) and ∆ < ∆ that this inequality holds strictly and, therefore,
that πn cannot profitably deviate.
   At the start of any phase (`, i) with ` < n that begins with belief α ∈ A, the proposer
can either propose a∗ (α), 1, y i — in which case she receives payoff yπi ` V ∗ (α) — or propose
                                 

any other policy — in which case she receives yππ`` V ∗ (α). As yπi ` ≥ yππ`` , she is better off
proposing a∗ (α), 1, y i , as prescribed by σ. At the start of any phase (n, i) with i 6= πn ,
                        

proposer πn can either propose a∗ (α), 1, y i — in which case she receives yπi n V ∗ (α) — or
                                             

propose any other policy — in which case she receives (1 − δ)wπn (p | α) + δE V ∗ (α̃) | α, p ,
                                                                                              

where p is the status quo. It follows from (B1) and ∆ < ∆ that she is strictly better off
proposing a∗ (α), 1, y i .
                        

   Consider now phase (n, πn ), and let α ∈ A be the committee members’ belief. The
argument to show that no voter j 6= πn has a profitable deviation from σ in this phase is the
same as above: as ∆ < ∆, j’s objective is to avoid a transition to phase j, irrespective of

                                                29
the policy implemented in the current period. As for voter πn , her decision has no impact
on her continuation payoff if all the previous voters rejected the proposal (as prescribed
by σ), and she is strictly better off inducing a transition to a phase (1, k) with k 6= πn if
some previous voter accepted the proposal. Finally, whether she passes (as prescribed by
σ) or makes an unsuccessful proposal, proposer πn ’s payoff is the same, and therefore, any
deviation is unprofitable.


C     Proof of Proposition 3

Fix τ̂ > 0. To prove Proposition 3, we will first define the threshold ∆ (Subsection C.1).
Then, for every ∆ < ∆, we will construct a stationary Markov strategy profile σ ∆ that
supports the optimal stopping rule (Subsection C.2). Finally, we will demonstrate that,
for all ∆ < ∆, σ ∆ is a renegotiation-proof equilibrium (Subsection C.3).

To begin we must establish some notation. For each i ∈ N , let coalition C i be defined by
C i = N \ {n} if i = 1, and C i = N \ {i − 1} otherwise. Note that, as D is non-collegial,
each coalition C i is winning. Let xi ∈ X be defined by

frontier. This observation will play an important role in the equilibrium construction
below.
   The definition of the threshold ∆ hinges on the following lemma, whose proof can be
found in the supplementary appendix.

Lemma C1. Suppose τ̂ > 0 and, for all i, j ∈ N , let Wij and Wi0 be defined as above.
There exists ∆ > 0 such that the following inequalities hold for all ∆ < ∆, all i, j ∈ N
with i ∈ C j , and all k ∈ N:

             Wij (1) > (1 − δ)γ∆r̄ + δWi0 (1) ,

            Wij (αk ) > (1 − δ)s̄∆ + δWi0 (αk ) , and

            Wij (αk ) > (1 − δ)αk γ∆r̄ + δαk γ∆Wi0 (1) + δ(1 − αk γ∆)Wi0 (αk+1 ) .

   Let ∆ be defined as in Lemma C1. Henceforth, we assume that ∆ < ∆.


C.2      Definition of Stationary Markov Strategy Profile σ ∆

This subsection describes the behavior prescribed by strategy profile σ ∆ to each committee
member i ∈ N , for all ∆ < ∆. Observe that, in each proposal stage, i’s behavior only

                                              31
    depends on the current status quo and belief and, in each voting stage, her behavior only
    depends on the current status quo, the belief, and the list of remaining proposers in the
    current period. Hence, σ ∆ is stationary Markov.


    • Proposal stages. Consider first proposer i’s behavior in a period where the order of
    proposers is π = (π1 , . . . , πn ) with π` = i for some `; and the first ` − 1 proposers have
    failed to amend the status quo. There are three cases:

Case P1: The belief is αk , where k < k ∗ .

          Proposer i offers (R, τ̂ , xi ) (which, in cases where the status quo is (R, τ̂ , xi ) means
          that she passes).

Case P2: The belief is αk , where k > k ∗ .

          Proposer i offers (S, τ̂ , xi ) (which, in cases where the status quo is (S, τ̂ , xi ) means
          that she passes).

Case P3: The belief is α∗ .

     Case 3.1: If the status quo is a policy (a, τ, x) 6= (R, τ̂ , xj ) for all j ∈ N , then proposer i
                offers (S, τ̂ , xi ).

     Case 3.2: If the status quo is (R, τ̂ , xj ) for some j ∈ N , then proposer i offers (S, τ̂ , xj ) if
                i ∈ C j , and (S, τ̂ , xi ) otherwise.


    • Voting stages. Consider now voter i’s behavior in a period where the order of pro-
    posers is π = (π1 , . . . , πn ). There are several cases:

Case V1: The status quo is (R, τ̂ , xj ) for some j ∈ N ; the belief is αk , where k < k ∗ ; and a
          proposer π` has just proposed policy (a, τ, y) 6= (R, τ̂ , xj ).

          If voter i is a member of C j , then she rejects the proposal; otherwise, she accepts
          the proposal if and only if
                                               

C.3     Verification that σ ∆ is a renegotiation-proof equilibrium

Optimal stopping rule. Before proceeding to the verification that σ ∆ is a renegotiation-
proof equilibrium, it is worth noting that it sustains the optimal stopping rule. The game
starts with status quo (S, 0, x0 ) and belief α0 . The first proposer, say j, is prescribed
to propose policy (R, τ̂ , xj ) (see Case P1 above), which is accepted by all the members of
decisive coalition C j (see Case V2.3). This policy is then implemented again in every future
period that begins with a belief greater than α∗ , as any proposal to amend it is voted down
by the members of C j (see Case V1). If the belief becomes α∗ , then all members of C j
reject any proposal until one of them proposes policy (S, τ̂ , xj ), which they all accept (see
Cases P3.2 and V5.3). (As C j is a decisive coalition, Cj ∩ {π1 , . . . , πm } 6= ∅ and, therefore,
at least one of its members is a proposer.) Policy (S, τ̂ , xj ) is then never amended, as any
proposal to change it is voted down by the members of C j (see Case V3). Hence, the
optimal stopping rule is implemented on the path. Any deviation from this path leads
                                                               0
the next proposer j 0 to successfully propose policy R, τ̂ , xj if the belief is greater than
                         0
α∗ , or policy S, τ̂ , xj if the belief smaller than or equal to α∗ . The induced path again
supports the optimal stopping rule.


Continuation values and renegotiation-proofness. Let Vi (b, τ, y|α) be player i’s
average discounted value (induced by σ ∆ ) from implementing policy (b, τ, y) when the
belief is equal to α. Observe first that if a policy (R, τ̂ , xj ), with j ∈ N , is implemented in
a period that begins with belief αk , k < k ∗ , then it is also implemented in any future period
beginning with a belief greater than α∗ (Cases V1 and V7 above). If the belief becomes
equal to α∗ , then (R, τ̂ , xj ) is amended to policy (S, τ̂ , xj ) (see Cases P3.2, V5.1 and V5.3),
which is then implemented in every future period (see Cases V6 and V3). This implies
that Vi (R, τ̂ , xj |αk ) = Wij (αk ) for all i, j ∈ N and k < k ∗ . Similar arguments establish
that Vi (R, τ̂ , xj |1) = Wij (1) and Vi (S, τ̂ , xj |αk ) = Wij (αk ), for all i, j ∈ N and k ≥ k ∗ .
By construction of σ ∆ , these are all the possible continuation values induced by σ ∆ at the
start of any continuation game. As they all belong to the Pareto frontier (Subsection C.1),
this implies that if σ ∆ is an equilibrium, then it must be renegotiation proof.


                                                 36
    Now suppose that a policy (b, τ, y), where (b, τ, y) 6= (R, τ̂ , xj ) for all j ∈ N , is imple-
mented in a period that starts with a belief αk , k < k ∗ . Player i receives (1 − δ)wi (R, τ, y |
αk ) in that period. If b is alternative R, then there are two possible cases: it succeeds with
probability αk γ∆, in which case the next period’s first proposer j successfully offers policy
(R, τ̂ , xj ) (see Cases P1, V7 and V1); and it fails with probability 1 − αk γ∆ in which case,
the next period’s first proposer j successfully offers policy (R, τ̂ , xj ) if k < k ∗ − 1 (see Case
V2.3), or (S, τ̂ , xj ) if k = k ∗ − 1 (see Cases V6 and V4.3). Therefore,

Using parallel arguments, one can show that player i’s continuation value from implement-

k ≥ k ∗ , is given by

and that her continuation value from implementing a policy (b, τ, y), where (b, τ, y) 6=

                          Vi (b, τ, y|1) = (1 − δ)wi (b, τ, y | 1) + δWi0 (1) .

    It follows directly from this characterization of continuation values and from Lemma C1
that (R, τ̂ , xj ) with i ∈ C j is player i’s ideal policy when the belief is greater than α∗ — i.e.,

Voting stages. To verify that σ ∆ is an equilibrium, we will first check that all possible
deviations in voting stages are unprofitable. To do so, we will consider in turn the various
cases in the definition of voting strategies.
    In Case V1, (decisive) voter i receives a payoff of Vi (R, τ̂ , xj |αk ) = Wij (αk ) if she rejects
the proposal (a, τ, y) to amend status quo (R, τ̂ , xj ) (as any future attempt to amend it in
this period will be unsuccessful), and a payoff of
                                             
                                              α γ∆W 0 (1) + (1 − α γ∆)W 0 (α ) if a = R ,
                                                k       i          k    i    k+1
Vi (a, τ, y|αk ) = (1−δ)wi (a, τ, y | αk )+δ
                                              W 0 (α )                          if a = S ,
                                                 i   k


if she accepts it. Hence, she cannot profitably deviate from σ ∆ if she is not a member
of C j . Moreover, it follows from Lemma C1 and the above equality that Vi (a, τ, y|αk ) <
Wij (αk ) = Vi (R, τ̂ , xj |αk ) for all i ∈ C j , so that voter i cannot profitably deviate from
rejecting (a, τ, y) if she is a member of C j .
    It follows immediately from our characterization of continuation values above that, in
Cases V2.1 and V2.2, σ ∆ prescribes voter i to accept the last proposer’s offer if and only
if her continuation value from implementing this offer exceeds her continuation value from
implementing the status quo. Therefore, deviations are also unprofitable in these cases.
In case V2.3, (decisive) player i anticipates that if she rejects the `th proposer’s offer,
(R, τ̂ , xj ), then the next proposer will successfully propose (R, τ̂ , xπ`+1 ). It is therefore

                                                    38

optimal for her to accept (R, τ̂ , xj ) if and only if Vi (R, τ̂ , xj |αk ) = Wij (αk ) ≥ Wi `+1 (αk ) =
Vi R, τ̂ , xπ`+1 |αk , as prescribed by σ ∆ to every i ∈   / C j . Moreover, by definition of Wij ,

                 0
Wij (αk ) ≥ Wij (αk ) for all i, j, j 0 ∈ N such that i ∈ C j . Therefore, it is always optimal for
voter i to accept (R, τ̂ , xj ) if i ∈ C j . The same argument applies to Case 2.4 except that
in this case, the `th proposal offer is some (b, τ, y) 6= (R, τ̂ , xj ) for all j ∈ N , so that the
value from accepting it is equal to
                                             
                                              α γ∆W 0 (1) + (1 − α γ∆)W 0 (α ) if b = R,
                                                k       i          k    i    k+1
Vi (b, τ, y) = (1 − δ)wi (b, τ, y | αk ) + δ
                                              W 0 (α )                          if b = S.

The arguments to show that there is no profitable deviation from σ ∆ in all the other cases,
but Case V5.3, are analogous: in each of these cases, σ ∆ prescribes decisive voter i the ac-
tion that maximizes her continuation value. In Case V5.3, (decisive) voter i anticipates that
                                                   0
if she rejects the `th proposer’s offer, R, τ̂ , xj , then the next proposer will successfully

propose (R, τ̂ , xπ`+1 ), and she will consequently receive Vi R, τ̂ , xπ`+1 |α∗ = Wi `+1 (α∗ ). If
                                                                                

she is a member of coalition C j and j 0 = j, then it is optimal for her to accept the offer

(as prescribed by σ ∆ ): by definition of Wi , Vi R, τ̂ , xj |α∗ = Vi (R, τ̂ , xj |α∗ ) = Wij (α∗ ) ≥
                                                                

  π`+1
Wi       (α∗ ). This implies that every member of coalition C j knows that if the status quo is
(R, τ̂ , xj ) in a period where the belief is α∗ , then the first proposer in C j will successfully
offer policy (S, τ̂ , xj ). It therefore follows from Lemma C1 and our the characterization
of continuation values above that every member i of C j obtains her highest possible con-
tinuation value, Vi (S, τ̂ , xj |α∗ ) = Wij (α∗ ), by rejecting any offer until a proposer in C j
successfully offers (S, τ̂ , xj ) (as prescribed by σ ∆ ). Finally, if i is not a member of C j ,
or if (off the path) all the proposers in C j have failed to amend the status quo, then σ ∆
optimally prescribes her, as in the previous cases, to choose the action that maximizes her
continuation value.


Proposal stages. Consider now player i’s behavior in a period where she is the `th
proposer and the first ` − 1 proposers have failed to amend the status quo. We begin with
cases where the belief α is greater than α∗ . If the status quo is (R, τ̂ , xj ) for some j ∈ N ,
then any proposal to amend it is voted down by decisive coalition C j (see Cases V1 and


                                                  39
V7). Therefore, proposer i’s payoff will be Vi (R, τ̂ , xj |α), irrespective of the action she
takes. If the status quo is a policy (a, τ, x) 6= (R, τ̂ , xj ) for all j ∈ N and she proposes
(R, τ̂ , xi ) (as prescribed by σ ∆ ), then her proposal is accepted by all the members of C i (see
Cases V2.1 and V2.3) and she obtains a payoff of Vi (R, τ̂ , xi |α) = Wii (α). As we established
above, this is the highest payoff she can get if α > α∗ . Therefore, any deviation from σ ∆
must be unprofitable.
    Suppose now that the belief α is smaller than α∗ . If the status quo is (S, τ̂ , xj ) for some
j ∈ N , then any proposal to amend it is voted down by decisive coalition C j (see Case V3).
Therefore, proposer i’s payoff will be Vi (S, τ̂ , xj |α), irrespective of the action she takes. If
the status quo is a policy (a, τ, x) 6= (S, τ̂ , xj ) for all j ∈ N and she proposes (S, τ̂ , xi ) (as
prescribed by σ ∆ ), then her proposal is accepted by all the members of C i (see Cases V4.1
and V4.3) and she obtains a payoff of Vi (S, τ̂ , xi |α) = Wii (α). As we established above,
this is the highest payoff she can get if α ≤ α∗ . Therefore, any deviation from σ ∆ must
again be unprofitable.
    Finally, suppose that the belief is equal to α∗ . If the status quo is a policy (a, τ, x) 6=
(R, τ̂ , xj ) for all j ∈ N , then the proof that proposer i cannot deviate from proposing
(S, τ̂ , xi ) is the same as in the previous paragraph. If the status quo is a policy (R, τ̂ , xj )
for some j ∈ N , then there are several possible cases:
    (i) If i is a member of C j and she proposes (R, τ̂ , xj ), then her proposal is accepted by
all the members of decisive coalition C j . As this policy is one of her ideal policies when
the belief is α∗ , she cannot profitably deviate from the behavior prescribed in Case P3.2.
    (ii) If i is not a member of C j and all proposers in C j have already (unsuccessfully)
proposed, then all the members of decisive coalition C i accept proposal (S, τ̂ , xi ) (see Case
V5.1 and the last sub-case in Case V5.3). As we established above, this is the policy that
maximizes her continuation value when the belief is α∗ . It is therefore impossible for her
to profitably deviate from proposing it, as prescribed in Case P3.1.
    (iii) If i is not a member of C j and some proposers in C j have not yet proposed, then
any proposal that differs from (S, τ̂ , xj ) is rejected by the members of C j (second sub-case
in Case V5.3) and, by the end of the period, some proposer in C j will successfully propose


                                                 40
(S, τ̂ , xj ). This implies that, irrespective of the proposal she makes, proposer i’s payoff will
be Vi (S, τ̂ , xj |α∗ ). Therefore, any deviation is unprofitable.
   This proves that σ ∆ is a renegotiation-proof stationary equilibrium, thus completing
the proof of Proposition 3.

A     Proof of Lemma A1

We begin with part (i). Suppose first that L ∈
                                             / D. To see that there exists an equilibrium
with the proposed outcome, consider the following (stationary Markov) strategy profile:

    - Whenever the status quo is R, all proposers pass (i.e., propose R), and each voter i
      accepts proposal S if and only if i ∈ L ;

    - whenever the status quo is S, each proposer i proposes R if i ∈
                                                                    / L and passes other-
      wise, and each voter i accepts proposal R if and only if i ∈
                                                                 / L.

It is easy to check that this strategy profile constitutes an equilibrium. (In particular,
proposers who prefer S to R do not deviate and propose to amend status quo R because
they anticipate that such a proposal would be rejected.)
    Next we show that this is the unique equilibrium outcome. Our proof shares some of
the intuitions of the Shaked and Sutton (1984) proof of equilibrium uniqueness for the
Rubinstein (1982) model. Let the set of equilibria of Γ(R, 1) be denoted by E(R, 1). In
Γ(R, 1), committee member i’s expected payoff in every period t is a convex combination
of γ∆ri and ∆si . Therefore, for every strategy profile σ her average discounted payoff is
                                          
of the form Vi (σ) ≡ β(σ)γ∆ri + 1 − β(σ) ∆si , with β(σ) ∈ [0, 1]. This implies that, for
any two strategy profiles σ and σ 0 , and any committee member i ∈ {i ∈ N : γri > si }, we
have Vi (σ) ≥ Vi (σ 0 ) if and only if β(σ) ≥ β(σ 0 ).
    Let {σ m } be a sequence in E(R, 1) that satisfies limm→∞ β(σ m ) = inf σ∈E(R,1) β(σ),
so that limm→∞ Vi (σ m ) = inf σ∈E(R,1) Vi (σ) for all i ∈ W ≡ {i ∈ N : γri ≥ si }. Fix
m ∈ N. Every proposal that may successfully be made by the last proposer in the first
period under σ m (both on and off the path) must be accepted by some decisive player


                                                 46
i in W . That is, i’s continuation payoff from accepting the proposal, say Uia , must be
at least as large as her payoff from rejecting it; i.e., Uia ≥ (1 − δ)γ∆ri + δVi (σ r ), where
σ r ∈ E(R, 1) is the equilibrium of Γ(R, 1) that is played from the next period on if i rejects
the proposal in the first period. From the argument in the previous paragraph, we thus have
Uja ≥ (1 − δ)γ∆rj + δVj (σ r ) for all j ∈ W . Similarly, every proposal that may successfully
be made by the penultimate proposer in the first period under σ m (both on and off the
path) must also be accepted by some member i of W . Her payoff (and therefore the payoff
of all members of W ) from accepting must be at least as large as the payoff from rejecting
                                                                    
which, as previously shown, must be at least (1 − δ)γ∆ri + δ inf Vi (σ) : σ ∈ E(R, 1) .
Applying the same argument recursively, we obtain that the acceptance of any proposal in
                                                                   
the first period must give a payoff of at least (1 − δ)γ∆ri + δ inf Vi (σ) : σ ∈ E(R, 1) for
all i ∈ W . Hence,

                     Vi (σ m ) ≥ (1 − δ)γ∆ri + δ inf Vi (σ) : σ ∈ E(R, 1) ,
                                                    


for all i ∈ W . Taking the limit as m → ∞ and recalling the definition of {σ m }, we obtain
            
γ∆ri = inf Vi (σ) : σ ∈ E(R, 1) (since γ∆ri is maximum feasible payoff for a player i ∈ W
when R is good with probability one). This in turn implies that R must be implemented
with probability one in every period of every equilibrium of Γ(R, 1).
   The argument for the case where L ∈ D is analogous.
   We now turn to part (ii). To prove the second part of the lemma, we proceed in three
steps: first, we show that the infimum of every player i’s equilibrium payoff in Γ(S, αk )
converges to ∆si as k → ∞; then, we show that for sufficiently large k, alternative S is
implemented in every period of Γ(S, αk ); finally, we use the previous result to complete
the proof of the lemma.
   Let αk ∈ A \ {1}; and let E(S, αk ) be the set of equilibria of Γ(S, αk ). Every period of
Γ(S, αk ) begins with a belief α that alternative R is good; then, either S is implemented,
in which case committee member i receives a payoff of ∆si ; or R is implemented, in which
case i’s expected payoff is αγ∆ri . Therefore, every strategy profile σ yields an expected

[0, 1] for each ` = k, k+1, . . .. Moreover, as R must have been successfully tried at least once

each i ∈ N . This in turn implies that there is a null sequence {εk } in R+ such that, for all
σ ∈ E(S, αk ), we have

                         max Vik (σ) − βsk (σ)si ∆ ≤ ∆ max Mik < εk ,
                          i∈N                                  i∈N


for every k ∈ N. Now for each k ∈ N, let {σ k,m } be a sequence in E(S, αk ) such that
limm→∞ βsk (σ k,m ) = inf σ∈E(S,αk ) βsk (σ). As σ k,m is an equilibrium of Γ(S, αk ), there must
be at least one committee member, say ik , such that

                         Vikk (σ k,m ) ≥ (1 − δ)∆sik + δ        inf       Vikk (σ) ;
                                                             σ∈E(S,αk )

otherwise some player would have a profitable deviation in the first period of Γ(S, αk ). It
follows that
                                                         h                                i
               βsk (σ k,m )∆sik + εk ≥ (1 − δ)∆sik + δ          inf       βsk (σ)∆sik − εk .
                                                             σ∈E(S,αk )


Taking the limit as m → ∞, we obtain inf σ∈E(S,αk ) βsk (σ) ≥ 1 − 2(εk /∆sik ). This implies
that inf σ∈E(S,αk ) βsk (σ) converges to one as k → ∞ and, therefore, that there exists a null
sequence {η k } such that limk→∞ maxi∈N inf σ∈E(S,αk ) Vik (σ) − ∆si < η k , for all k ∈ N,
thus completing the first step of the argument.
   We now turn to the second step of the proof. Observe first that, as (1 − δ)(si −
αk γri )∆ − δη k converges to (1 − δ)∆si > 0 as k → ∞, there is a sufficiently large K ∈ N
such that (1 − δ)(si − αk γri )∆ − δη k > 0, for all k ≥ K. Let k ≥ K, and suppose
that Γ(S, αk ) has an equilibrium in which alternative R is implemented with positive
probability. Consider the first period of Γ(S, αk ) in which R may be implemented. Every

                                                 48
decisive voter i’s benefit from rejecting any proposal to change S to R is bounded below
by (1 − δ)(si − αk γri )∆ + δ (∆si − η k ) − ∆si > 0, where the bracketed term represents the
                                               

difference between the lower and upper bounds on i’s continuation payoffs from rejecting
R and accepting it, respectively. (Recall that each committee member i’s maximum payoff
is ∆si when the belief is smaller than or equal to α̂n .) Hence, every proposal to amend S
to R is rejected in any equilibrium of Γ(S, αk ). We thus have Vik (σ) = ∆si , for all i ∈ N
and all σ ∈ E(S, αk ).
   If αK > α̂n , then Lemma 1(ii) follows immediately from the previous paragraph; so
suppose that αK ≤ α̂n . To complete the proof of the result, consider the first period of
Γ(S, αK ). If alternative R is implemented, then the expected payoff to each committee
                          
member i is 1 − δ(1 − γ∆) αK γ∆ri + δ(1 − αK γ∆)∆si < ∆si , where the inequality follows
from αK ≤ α̂n and the definition of the committee members’ optimal cutoffs in Subsection
3.2; if alternative S is instead implemented, then her expected payoff will be a convex
                                
combination of 1 − δ(1 − γ∆) αK γ∆ri + δ(1 − αK γ∆)∆si (if R is implemented with
positive probability in a future period) and ∆si , with a positive coefficient on the latter.
Therefore, all committee members are strictly better off implementing R: they all reject
proposals to amend S to R (when decisive). Hence, Vik (σ) = ∆si , for all i ∈ N , k ≥ K
and σ ∈ E(S, αk ). Applying the same argument recursively from belief αK−1 to belief α̂n
we obtain that, for all αk ≤ α̂n , Γ(S, αk ) has a unique equilibrium outcome: Alternative S
is implemented in every period. By the same logic, the same is also true in game Γ(S, αk ),
αk ≤ α̂n . In such a game, every decisive voter receives her largest possible payoff ∆si if
she accepts a proposal to change the status quo R to S, since the latter will then never be
amended. Any such a proposal must therefore be successful and, as S is the ideal policy
of all players, some proposer must successfully propose it in equilibrium.
   Finally, S being the ideal alternative of all the players, it is easy to construct an equi-
librium in which all players always propose alternative S (conditional on being recognized
to propose), accept any proposal to change status quo R to alternative S, and reject any
proposal to amend status quo S.

B     Proof of Proposition 2: Collegial Rules

Section B in the main Appendix contains a proof of Proposition 2 for cases where the
voting rule is noncollegial. This section covers all other cases.


(i) Unanimity rule. Suppose now that D = {N }. As in the proof of Proposition 1, we
denote by Γ(p | α) the continuation game that begins with status quo p ∈ {R, S}×[0, 1]×X
and belief α ∈ A.

Lemma B1. Suppose D is unanimity rule and τ̂ = 1. Then there exists ∆1 > 0 such that,
for all ∆ < ∆1 and all (τ, x) ∈ [0, 1] × X:
(i) Γ(R, τ, x | 1) has a renegotiation-proof equilibrium and, in any such equilibrium, each
                                                                        
committee member i’s payoff is wi (R, τ, x | 1) ≡ γ∆ (1 − τ )ri + τ xi r̄ ; and
(ii) the set of renegotiation-proof equilibrium payoffs for Γ(S, τ, x | 1) is the simplex
                            Pn         ∗
  (w1 , . . . , wn ) ∈ Rn :
                                                                       
                             i=1 wi = V (1) and wi ≥ (1 − τ )si + τ xi s̄ ∆, ∀i ∈ N .


Proof. Let ∆1 ≡ sup ∆ ∈ R+ : (1 − e−ρ∆ ) < e−ρ∆ (n − 2) > 0. Henceforth, we assume
                   

that ∆ < ∆1 .
                                                                 Pn         ∗
     Let (τ, x) ∈ [0, 1] × X, let w0 ∈ (w1 , . . . , wn ) ∈ Rn :
                                                                                        
                                                                  i=1 wi = V (1) and wi ≥ (1 −
               
τ )si + τ xi s̄ ∆ . To prove the lemma, we will construct a renegotiation-proof equilibrium σ
for Γ(S, τ, x | 1) in which every committee member i receives wi0 , thus establishing part (ii).
In that equilibrium, the optimal stopping rule will be implemented in every period both
on and off the path. As Γ(R, τ, x | 1) is itself a continuation game in Γ(S, τ, x | 1), this will
also establish that Γ(R, τ, x | 1) has a renegotiation-proof equilibrium. If the status quo is
(R, τ, x) and the belief is equal to 1, then each committee member i can obtain a payoff
of wi (R, τ, x | 1) by rejecting any future proposal to amend the status quo. As the payoff
                         
vector wj (R, τ, x | 1) j∈N is in the Pareto frontier (and D is unanimity rule), it follows
that wi (R, τ, x | 1) is i’s payoff in any (renegotiation-proof) equilibrium for Γ(R, τ, x | 1).
    We begin with an intuitive description of the equilibrium σ. Alternative R is im-
plemented in each period (both on and off the path). As the belief is equal to 1, this
implies that payoff vectors are Pareto optimal in every continuation game. Once S has


                                               50
been implemented, all proposers pass in all future periods, irrespective of the tax rate and
distribution of revenues. If R has not yet been implemented, then behavior is determined
by a set of n “phases,” each corresponding to one committee member in N . In commit-
tee member i’s phase, every proposer successfully offers a policy that gives a payoff of
γ∆r̄ − j6=i (1 − τ 0 )sj + τ yj s̄ ∆ to i and a payoff of (1 − τ 0 )sj + τ yj s̄ ∆ to each commit-
      P                                                                      

tee member j 6= i, where (S, τ 0 , y) is the status quo policy. The idea is that i receives her
“reward payoff” and the others their “punishment payoffs.” If a proposer, say i, deviates,
then every committee member (other than i) rejects her proposal and the game transitions
to the phase of the first committee member who rejected the proposal. If voter i rejects a
proposal which she should have accepted, then the game moves to the another committee
member’s phase.
    We now turn to the formal definition of σ for the continuation game Γ(S, τ, x | 1). As
in the case of noncollegial rules, we divide each period into n “parts,” each consisting of a
proposal stage and the n voting stages that follow it. Changes of phases can only occur
at the end of these parts. A phase is formally represented by a pair (`, i) ∈ {1, . . . , n} ×
{0, 1, . . . , n}. In every period that begins with status quo p = (a, τ 0 , y) and an order of
proposers (π1 , . . . , πn ), σ prescribes the following behavior in phase (`, i):
    (a) If a = R, then proposer π` passes; and if a = S, then she offers policy (R, 1, y i ),

at the start of phase (`, i) is wj (p | 1) if a = R, and yji V ∗ (1) if a = S.
      In period 1, play begins in phase (1, 0). Then in every period, at the end of any part that

by π` herself, then the game transitions to phase (` + 1, ı̂);
    (t8) if a = S and π` passed, then the game transitions to phase (` + 1, π` + 1).

    We now verify that for ∆ < ∆1 , σ is an equilibrium. Take an arbitrary committee
member j ∈ N , and consider a voting stage with status quo p = (a, τ 0 , y) in some phase
(`, i). Suppose first that a = S and π` proposed (R, 1, y i ), so that σ prescribes j to accept
this proposal (see (b)). If some previous voter has already rejected the proposal, then j
has trivially no profitable deviation: her decision will have no impact on her payoff. If she
is the first voter, or if all previous voters have accepted the proposal, then her decision
does impact her payoff. If she accepts (R, 1, y i ) then, from (b) and (t2) above, she receives
a payoff of yji V ∗ (1); if she rejects (R, 1, y i ) then, from (t3), the game transitions to phase
(` + 1, j + 1) and she receives (1 − δ̂)wj (p | 1) + δ̂yjj+1 V ∗ (1). Since

                   yji V ∗ (1) ≥ wj (p | 1) = (1 − δ̂` )wj (p | 1) + δ̂` yjj+1 V ∗ (1) ,

she is better off accepting.
    Suppose now that a = R and π` proposed some policy p0 6= p. If p0 is accepted
then, from (t4), thegame transitions to phase (1, i) and committee member j receives

It follows from (c) that, under σ, her decision is optimal whenever she is decisive. Hence,
she cannot profitably deviate from σ.
    Finally, suppose that a = S and π` proposed some policy p0 ∈
                                                               / (R, 1, y i ), p :

    • If some voter in N \ {π` , j} has already rejected the proposal then, from (t6), her
decision will not have any impact on her payoff and is therefore optimal.


                                                    53
   • If π` is the only voter who has already rejected p0 , then the choice of voter j 6= π`
has no impact on her stage-game payoff in this period but will impact the transition to
the next phase. It follows from (t6) and (t7) that she cannot improve on rejecting, which
is the action prescribed by σ (see (d1)).
   • If p0 has not yet been rejected and j is the nth voter, then it follows from (d2) and
(t5)-(t7) that σ prescribes her to accept p0 if and only if she is strictly better off doing so.
The same is true if j is not the last voter and she anticipates that all the remaining voters
will accept p0 — see (d3).
   • If p0 has not yet been rejected, j is not the last voter and she anticipates the some of
the remaining voters will reject p0 , then her choice has no impact on the policy that will be
implemented in the current period. If, in addition, j = π` then her choice does not have
any impact on her continuation value either and, therefore, rejecting is optimal. If instead
j 6= π` , then her decision will impact the transition to the next phase. It follows from (t6)
and (t7) that she is better off rejecting, as prescribed by σ. (She can only be indifferent if
π` is the only other voter who will reject p0 , and j = ı̂.)
   This proves that deviations in voting stages are unprofitable. We now turn to proposal
stages. Consider the proposal stage of any phase (`, i) that begins with a status quo
p = (a, τ 0 , y). Suppose first that a = R. If j = π` passes, as prescribed by σ, then from
(t1) she receives a payoff of yji V ∗ (1). If she deviates by proposing a policy p0 6= p then,
                                                                         
from (c), her proposal will be rejected: as the payoff vector wk (p | 1) k∈N belongs to the
Pareto frontier, it is impossible to offer every committee member k a higher payoff than
wk (p | 1). It then follows from (a) that proposer j gets a payoff of wj (p | 1) ≤ yji V ∗ (1)
(with a strict inequality if and only if i = j). Hence, j cannot profitably deviate from
passing.
   Suppose now that a = S. If j = π` proposes (R, 1, y i ), as prescribed by σ, then from
(b), (t2) and (a), she receives a payoff of yji V ∗ (1). If she deviates by passing, then she
receives (1 − δ)wj (p | 1) in the current period and the game then transitions to phase
(` + 1, j + 1) (see (t8)). She thus receives

                   (1 − δ̂` )wj (p | 1) + δ̂` yjj+1 V ∗ (1) = wj (p | 1) ≤ yji V ∗ (1)

                                                   54
(with a strict inequality if and only if i = j). Hence, passing is not a profitable deviation.
Finally, if she deviates by proposing a policy p0 6= (R, 1, y i ) then, from (c), her proposal
will be rejected. To see this, observe that from (d), she would have to offer more than
(1 − δ̂` )wk (p | 1) + δ̂` ykk V ∗ (1) to all the other committee members k 6= j, and more than
wj (p | 1) to herself. Summing across the committee members and rearranging terms, a
successful proposal would have to generate a total sum of payoffs that exceeds (1 − δ̂` )s̄∆ +
δ̂` V ∗ (1) + (n − 2)[V ∗ (1) − s̄∆] = (1 − δ̂` )s̄∆ + δ̂` γ r̄ + (n − 2)[γ r̄ − s̄] ∆. As aggregate

payoffs are bounded above by V ∗ (1) = γ∆r̄, this would require that

                                                                      
                           (1 − δ̂` )s̄ + δ̂` γ r̄ + (n − 2)[γ r̄ − s̄] < γ r̄                (B2)

or, equivalently, 1 − δ̂` < δ̂` (n − 2). This is impossible since ∆ < ∆1 . Moreover, it follows
from (t6)-(t7) that the game will then transition to phase (` + 1, j). As a result, j obtains
a payoff of
                     (1 − δ̂` )wj (p | 1) + δ̂` yjk V ∗ (1) = wj (p | 1) ≤ yji V ∗ (1)

(with k 6= j) if she deviates by making a proposal p0 6= (R, 1, y i ). Hence, such a deviation
is unprofitable.

Lemma B2. Suppose D is unanimity rule and τ̂ = 1. Then there exists ∆2 > 0 such that,

                                                    55
It follows that

e 2 ≡ sup ∆ > 0 : 1 − δ(1 − α∗ γ∆) s̄ − 1 − δ(1 − γ∆) α∗ γ r̄ < δ(1 − α∗ γ∆)(n − 2)[s̄ − α∗ γ r̄]

                                                  e 2 , then the following inequality holds

for all beliefs αk ≤ α∗ :
                                       
       1 − δ(1 − αk γ∆) s̄ − 1 − δ(1 − γ∆) αk γ r̄ < δ(1 − αk γ∆)(n − 2)[s̄ − αk γ r̄] .

Henceforth, we assume that ∆ < ∆2 ≡ min{∆1 , ∆
                                             e 2 }.

    To prove the lemma, one can use an equilibrium construction that parallels that in the
proof of Lemma B1. In this equilibrium, when the status quo is of the form p = (a, τ 0 , y)
and the belief is α ≤ αk , committee member i’s reward payoff is V ∗ (α) − j6=i wj (p |
                                                                                      P

αγ∆ (1 − τ 0 )ri + τ 0 yi s̄ . If the belief becomes equal to one, then the equilibrium described
                           

in Lemma B1 is played. The argument is then exactly the same. In particular, the key
condition (B2), necessary for proposers to have profitable deviations, now becomes

     1 − δ̂` (1 − γ∆) αγ∆r̄ + δ̂` (1 − αγ∆) V ∗ (α) + (n − 2) V ∗ (α) − αγ∆r̄ < V ∗ (α)

or, equivalently,
                                                                                
       δ̂` (1 − αk γ∆)(n − 2)[s̄ − αγ r̄] < 1 − δ̂` (1 − αγ∆) s̄ − 1 − δ̂` (1 − γ∆) αγ r̄ .

This cannot hold since ∆ < ∆2 .

Lemma B3. Suppose D is unanimity rule and τ̂ = 1. Then there exists ∆2 > 0 such that,
for all ∆ < ∆2 , all beliefs αk ∈ [α1 , α∗ ) and all (τ, x) ∈ [0, 1] × X:
(i) Γ(a, τ, x | αk ), a ∈ {R, S}, has a renegotiation-proof equilibrium that sustains the
optimal stopping rule; and
(ii) Γ(R, 1, x | αk ) has a renegotiation-proof equilibrium in which each committee member
i’s expected payoff is xi V ∗ (αk ).

Proof. Let ∆2 be defined as in Lemma B2. To prove Lemma B3, consider first the simple
variant on the standard Baron-Ferejohn model, denoted G(a, τ, x | αk ), in which the

wi (S, τ, x | αk ), ∀i ∈ N , and the probability that committee member i is selected to
propose is equal to the probability qi that she is the last proposer in our model. It is well
known that this game has a (pure strategy) stationary subgame perfect equilibrium, in
which the selected proposer makes the same (successful) proposal, wi (S, τ, x | αk ), in every
period.
    Let k ∗ ∈ N be implicitly defined by αk∗ = α∗ , and let (τ, x) ∈ [0, 1] × X. Consider a
                       ∗ −1
strategy profile σ k          for Γ(R, τ, x | αk∗ −1 ) that prescribes the following behavior in any
period that begins with a status quo p = (a, τ 0 , y), a belief α ∈ {αk ∈ A : k ≥ k ∗ − 1} ∪ {1},
and an order of proposers (π1 , . . . , πn ):

a = S, then the committee plays an equilibrium of Γ(R, τ 0 , y | α) in which each committee
member i’s payoff is wi (p | α) (see Lemma B2(i));
    d) if α = 1 and a = R, then the committee plays an equilibrium of Γ(R, τ 0 , y | 1) in
which each committee member i’s payoff is wi (p | 1) (see Lemma B1(i)); if α = 1 and

                                                    57
a = S, then the committee plays an equilibrium of Γ(S, τ 0 , y | 1) in which each committee
                               wi (p|1)
member i’s payoff is             s̄∆      (see Lemma B1(ii)).
                                             ∗ −1
      It is readily checked that σ k                is an equilibrium for Γ(R, τ, x | αk∗ −1 ). In particular,
the acceptance condition in case b) compares the voter’s continuation value from reject-
ing the proposal (left side of the inequality) with her continuation value from accepting
it (right side). As the optimal stopping rule is implemented in case of rejection (and the
voting rule is unanimity), at least one voter must voter to reject the proposal. It follows
that any proposal is unsuccessful in case a) and, therefore, passing is optimal for all pro-
posers. In the other cases, any deviation is by construction unprofitable. Moreover, as
the optimal stopping rule is implemented in every continuation game both on and off the
                              ∗ −1
equilibrium path, σ k                is a renegotiation-proof equilibrium. As Γ(S, τ, x | αk∗ −1 ) is a
                                                                             ∗ −1
continuation game of Γ(R, τ, x | αk∗ −1 ), the restriction of σ k                   to Γ(S, τ, x | αk∗ −1 ) is also
a renegotiation-proof equilibrium. To complete the proof of the lemma for the case where
k = k ∗ − 1, observe that if τ = 1, then each committee member i’s payoff in equilibrium
     ∗ −1
σk          is xi V ∗ (αk∗ −1 ).
      To obtain the result for any k ∈ {1, . . . , k ∗ −1}, one can then proceed recursively: having
obtained an equilibrium σ k+1 for every continuation game of the form Γ(a, τ 0 , y | αk+1 ),
one can apply the same construction as above at belief αk to obtain a renegotiation-proof
equilibrium σ k for every game Γ(a, τ, x | αk ).

Lemma B4. Suppose D is unanimity rule and τ̂ = 1. Then there exists ∆ > 0 such that,
for all ∆ < ∆, the set of renegotiation-proof equilibrium payoffs for Γ(S, 0, x0 | α0 ) is the

      To prove the lemma, one can use again an equilibrium construction that parallels that in
the proof of Lemma B1. In this equilibrium, when the status quo is of the form p = (S, τ 0 , y)

      P
s̄∆ − j6=i sj ∆ and her punishment payoff is wi (p | α0 ) = si ∆. If the belief becomes
equal to α1 , then an equilibrium as described in Lemma B3 is played — in particular, the
equilibrium described in Lemma B3(ii) if the status quo is of the form (R, 1, x) for some
x ∈ X — and if the belief becomes equal to one, then the equilibrium described in Lemma
B1 is played. The argument is then exactly the same. In particular, the key condition
(B2), necessary for proposers to have profitable deviations, is now

As ∆ < ∆, this inequality cannot hold.

   Let ∆ < ∆, where ∆ > 0 is the threshold defined in Lemma B4. To complete the

her voting strategy prescribes her to accept if and only if her continuation value from
accepting is greater than or equal to her continuation value from rejecting. Hence, she
cannot profitably deviate from σ.

(2.a) j is a vetoer and wj (p0 | α) ≤ wj (p | α). Suppose first that, given the previous
voters’ choices and the remaining voters’ strategies, voter j’s decision is not pivotal. In
this case, her choice only affects the transition to the next phase. It follows from the
transition rules (t5)-(t7) that she is always (weakly) better off rejecting p0 , as prescribed


                                                65

the game transitions to phase (` + 1, k) for some k =      6 j, and she receives a payoff of
(1 − δ)wj (p | α) + δE yj (p | α̃)V ∗ (α̃) | α, p = yjk (p | α)V ∗ (α) = wj (p | α). If instead

(2.b) Either j is not a vetoer or wj (p0 | α) > wj (p | α). If, given the previous voters’ choices
and the remaining voters’ strategies, voter j’s decision is not pivotal then, as above, any
deviation from σ is unprofitable. If j’s vote is pivotal given the previous voters’ moves and
the remaining voters’ strategies, then it must be the case that all the vetoers in V r have
already voted and they all chose to accept p0 . Let k be the last member of V r who moved. If
j chooses to accept p0 , then her payoff will be (1 − δ)wj (p0 | α) + δE yjk (p0 | α̃)V ∗ (α̃) | α, p ;

to reject p0 , then she receives wj (p | α): if ` = n − 1 and k = πn , or if ` = n, then
she gets (1 − δ)wj (p | α) + δE yjk (p | α̃)V ∗ (α̃) | α, p = wj (p | α); otherwise, she gets

(3b) j is not a vetoer. By the same logic as in case (2.a) above, voter j cannot profitably

• Case 4: In phase (n, πn ), πn has proposed a policy p0 6= p. One can show that voter j
cannot profitably deviate from σ by using the same arguments as in Cases 2 and 3.

   We now turn to committee member i’s proposal behavior. Consider in any period in
where the status quo is p, the belief is α ∈ A and the order of proposers is (π1 , . . . , πn ). In
phase (`, i) 6= (n, πn ), σ prescribes her to propose a∗ (α), 1, y i , thus receiving a payoff of
                                                                    

yji (p | α)V ∗ (α). Suppose that either ` < n − 1, or ` = n − 1 and i 6= πn . If j deviates by
making any proposal p0 6= a∗ (α), 1, y i , then her proposal is rejected by the committee, the
                                         

game transitions to phase (` + 1, j), and she receives yjj (p | α)V ∗ (α) ≤ yji (p | α)V ∗ (α). The
deviation is therefore unprofitable. Now suppose that either ` = n − 1 and i = πn , or ` = n
(so that j 6= i). In this case, if j deviates by making any proposal p0 6= a∗ (α), 1, y i , then
                                                                                         

her proposal is rejected, the status quo policy p is implemented, and the game transitions
to the next period in phase (1, j). Hence, her payoff is equal to wd ≡ (1 − δ)wj (p |
α) + δE yjj (p | α̃)V ∗ (α̃) | α, p . If j is a vetoer, then wd = wj (p | α) ≤ yji (p | α)V ∗ (α)
                                  

(which holds with equality whenever i 6= 0), and the deviation is therefore unprofitable. If
j is not a vetoer, then

                                                          1
           wd = (1 − δ)wj (p | α) ≤ (1 − δ)S(p | α) ≤        S(p | α) = yji (p | α)V ∗ (α) ,

where the second inequality follows from ∆ < ∆, and the last equality from i 6= j ∈
                                                                                  / V.

                                                  67
   Finally, in phase (n, πn ), σ prescribes proposer j = πn to pass. If she does so, then the
status quo policy p is implemented and the period starts in phase (1, πn ) (see (t11)). If
she deviates, proposing any policy p0 6= p, then her proposal is rejected by the committee:
if p0 ∈ P (p | α), then it is rejected by at least one vetoer (see (V2a)); if p0 ∈
                                                                                 / P (p | α), then
it is rejected by all the voters without a veto (see V2b). Therefore, the status quo policy is
implemented and, from (t12) and (t15), the next period starts in phase (1, πn ). It follows
that the proposer receive the same payoff irrespective of her choice and, consequently,
cannot profitably deviate from σ.
                                                      T
   We now turn to the case where ∅ 6= V ≡                 D ∈ D, i.e., the voting rule is oli-
garchich. If |V | = 1, then the result is trivial: in every continuation game, the dicta-
tor redistributes all revenues to herself and, therefore, has the same objective function
as the social planner. If |V | ≥ 3, then one can use the same equilibrium construc-
tions as above — or as in the V = N case (section B in the main text) — to estab-
                                     Pn         ∗
lish that (w1 , . . . , wn ) ∈ Rn+ :
         
                                      i=1 wi = V (α0 ) and wi ≥ si ∆, ∀i ∈ V is a subset of
renegotiation-proof equilibrium payoff vectors. As the set of equilibrium payoff vectors
                                               Pn         ∗
must be a subset of (w1 , . . . , wn ) ∈ Rn+ :
                      
                                                i=1 wi ≤ V (α0 ) and wi ≥ si ∆, ∀i ∈ V ,
                                                                        
this proves that the set of renegotiation-proof equilibrium vectors is (w1 , . . . , wn ) ∈
      Pn          ∗
Rn+ :   i=1 wi = V (α0 ) and wi ≥ si ∆, ∀i ∈ V .

   To complete the proof of the result for oligarchic rules, it remains to show that the same
is true if |V | = 2. In the previous cases, we could sustain equilibria in which a vetoer i
would receive a payoff of wi (p | α) in any continuation game Γ(p | α) because it was always
possible to ensure that every proposal giving her more than wi (p | α) would be rejected by
at least one decisive coalition. In those equilibria, it was always impossible for i to offer all
of the decisive voters more than their rewards for rejecting i’s proposals. The only reason
why the previous constructions do not apply in the |V | = 2 case is that i only needs one
of the other players (the other vetoer) to accept her proposal. As δ < 1, whenever i is
the last proposer (an event that occurs with positive probability in every period), she can
always make proposal that gives her more than wi (p | α) and the other vetoer more than
the maximum the latter would get by rejecting the proposal. This in turn implies that,


                                               68
in any period where she proposes last, vetoer i can guarantee herself some payoff greater
than wi (p | α) by rejecting the first (n − 1) proposals. One must therefore change the
lower bounds on the vetoers’ continuation values to account for this possibility. As in the
previous construction, if a vetoer i deviates then, from the next period on, we “punish” her
by giving the other vetoer the total surplus minus i’s minimum continuation value. For
each i ∈ V , let ρi be the probability is the last proposer in each period, and let Vi+ (p | α)
and Vi− (p | α) be the solutions to the following functional equations:
                                               h                  i
          Vi− (p | α) = (1 − δ)wi (p | α) + δE $i (p | α̃) | α, p
                                                         h                            i
          Vi+ (p | α) = V ∗ (α) − (1 − δ)wj (p | α) − δE V ∗ (α̃) − $i (p | α̃) | α, p ,

where $i (p | α) ≡ ρi Vi+ (p | α) + (1 − ρi )Vi− (p | α) and j ∈ V \ {i}, for all p ∈ {R, S} ×
[0, 1] × X. Intuitively, Vi+ (p | α) [resp. Vi− (p | α)] stands for vetoer i’s minimum payoff in
continuation game Γ(p | α) conditional on her being the last proposer [resp. not being the
last proposer], and $i (p | α) stands for her minimum payoff in continuation game Γ(p | α)
(computed before the realization of the order of proposers). We then obtain the result
with an equilibrium construction as above, but substituting $i (p | α) to wi (p | α) for each
i∈V.
