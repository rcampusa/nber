                  Real Aspects of Exchange Rate Regime
                   Choice with Collapsing Fixed Rates




                                  ABSTRACT




       Typical evaluations of the choice of exchange rate regime employ a
criterion function that depends on the real performance of the econoir, and
they   focus on regimes that are expected to last indefinitely. This latter

feature Is strongly contradicted by the transitory nature of actual regimes.

This paper extends the recent literature on collapses of fixed exchange rate

regimes with exogenous real sectors to examine how the predictions of two

popular models for the determination of some real economic variables must be

modified when agents rationally perceive that the fixed rate regime will be

transitory. The models studied are simple stochastic versions of the models

In Dornbusch (1976) and Flood and Marion (1982).

      Typical evaluations of the performance of an economy under alternative

 exchange rate regimes proceed under the assumption that exchange—rate regimes

 last forever. 1 This assumption is a gross contradiction of the fact that

 exchange rate regimes are actually quite transitory. Countries never really

 followed the •rules of the game" .under the Gold Standard, and it evolved into

 the Gold Exchange Standard. During the Great Depression currencies became

inconvertible. The Bretton Woods system was planned as a system of fixed

exchange rates, but it was recognized that countries would devalue and revalue

their currencies when in "fundamental disequlibrium". Although this term was

never formally defined, countries did devalue and revalue their currencies,

often by large amounts, during the two decades preceding the breakdown of the

system in 1971.

     The purpose of this paper is to reexamine the determination of real

output in two popular models of the open economy accounting explicitly for the

transitory nature of fixed exchange rate regimes. Rational agents understand

that an exchange—rate regime may be temporary, and they incorporate

expectations of the collapse of the regime and its associated capital gains or

losses into their behavioral functions. The models we examine are simple

stochastic versions of the Dorubush (1976) model of exchange rate dynamics

with flexible output and the Flood and Marion (1982) model of wage indexatiori

in an open economy. We work with simplified versions of these models since

our point is that some of the implications of the models are drastically

altered when we allow agents to act on their understanding of regime

impermanence. These alterations are robust to more complex versions of the

models, but since we are presenting some counterexamples, model complexity

only obscures our points. Our work builds on previous research on the

temporary nature of government policies including Salant and Henderson (1978),

Krugman (1979), Flood and Garber (1983, 1984) and Flood and Marion (1983).
                                        —4—
     In Section 2   of   the paper we develop our version of the Dornbusch

model. For some configurations of the model, we demonstrate that the regime

of permanently floating exchange rates always produces a higher unconditional

variance of output than does a regime of permanently fixed exchange rates.

This result is confirmed when we consider a temporary fixed—rate regime,

although we find the disadvantage of a floating—rate regime diminishes as the

possibility of an attack on a fixed rate regime rises. This result is an

unsurpr1sng extension of the original comparison between fixed and flexible

exchange rates. What is surprising to us, however, is that output variance

conditional on maintaining a fixed—rate regime which may collapse can be

higher than output variance under floating rates. Intuitively, this measure

of the conditional variance of real output corresponds to the sample or

measured output variance during a fixed exchange rate regime that has not

collapsed.

     Our examination of the wage indexing model is presented in Section 3. It

is well known that optimal wage indexation depends on the stochastic structure

of the underlying economy, and a contribution of Flood and Marion (1982) was

to demonstrate that the degree of wage indexation would not be invariant to

the country's choice of exchange—rate regime.      In their analysis, different

permanent exchange rate regimes lead to different optimal wage indexing

polices, and each policy is a fixed function of the time invariant stochastic

structure of the economy. In this paper we discuss fixed exchange rate

regimes which may collapse, and we find that the optimal degree of wage

indexation is state dependent and thus time varying even though the stochastic

structure of the economy is time invariant.
                                        —5—
     Our   results   are presented in the next two sections. For each type of

model we first examine permanent exchange rate regimes turning then to a

characterization of the economy when a fixed exchange rate regime may possibly

collapse. In each model we take the domestic credit component of the money

supply to be an exogenous process. This creates an inherent tension between

the two government policies, the domestic credit process and the fixed

exchange rate regime, which is resolved by the collapse of the regime. This

appears to capture the actual priorities of governments without modeling the

objective function of the monetary and fiscal authorities. Presumably, one

reason why the domestic credit process has priority is because of the

seignorage gained by the government from printing money.2

     Because algebraic complexity quickly renders complex versions of each

type of model analytically intractable, we worked with simple stripped down

versions of each type of model while attempting to retain the essential

economic aspects of the problems. Some of the derivations of various results

are presented in a techical appendix to facilitate presentation of the

results.

2k. A DORNBUSCH-TYPE MODEL

     The original    Dornbusch (1976) model depicted a medium-size open economy

that was large in the market for goods produced at home and small in world

asset markets. The crucial feature of the model was that domestic currency

prices of domestic goods were predetermined while the country's exchange rate

and other asset prices were currently determined and free to respond to all

current shocks. This feature gave rise to the famous overshooting result.

Since home goods prices were predetermined, the immediate response of the

exchange rate to a money—market disturbance had to be larger than that

response would have been had all prices been free to adjust. We use a version

of the model that makes output demand determined. It consists of the

following relations:

Equation (1) is money market equilibrium. The logarithm of the real money

supply, mt —   ht,   equals the demand for real money balances, —       ni    + Ydt.3

The demand for money depends negatively on the opportunity cost of holding

money, the nominal interest rate, and it depends positively on the real demand

for home goods, d. The equilibrium condition for the world capital market is

given in equation (2) by the uncovered interest rate parity condition. The

demand for domestic output is specified in equation (3). Demand for home

goods depends negatively on the logarithm of the relative price of home goods

in terms of foreign goods, ht —      (h   + St), and Ut    is   a stochastic demand

disturbance. Equation (4) states that ht is set at time t—1 at the level that

is expected to clear the market for domestic goods by equating expected demand

to full employment output, y.        Actual output in period t is determined by the

demand for it given the predetermined variables h and h. The composition of

the   money supply is given by equation (5). The nominal mony supply is

composed of a domestic credit component and an tnternational reserves

component. Equation (6) states that the rate of           growth of domestic credit,

      Et_x is the mathematical expectation of x conditional on information

stochastic processes. We assume that h =            hr_i + z1 where z1 is
serially uncorrelated and uncorrelated with the model's other disturbances.

Its variance is            and it is an element of the time t—1 information set.

This dating convention recognizes that foreign price setters are also setting

prices for period t at time t—1. The foreign nominal interest rate, i =

      Our comparison of alternative exchange rate regimes focuses on the

2B.     SOLUTIONS FOR PERMANENT EXCHANGE RATE REGIMES

        When exchange rates are perfectly flexible, there is rio intervention in

the foreign exchange market implying that rt is the constant .                  A solution

for the exchange rate can be found by recognizing that the variables on the

right—hand side of (8) completely describe the current state of the system.

Consequently, the linearity of the model allows us to apply the method of

undetermined coefficients, and we find

          From (7) and (8), the conditional variance of real output under a pure

flexible exchange rate regime is



                                               X2a2 + X2a2) + a2           2X 6a2u

          If the exchange rate is permanently fixed at a level s and the government

runs an exogenous domestic credit process, then rt becomes endogenous.

International reserves adjust during the period to equate the demand for money

and the supply of money. Under a permanently fixed exchange rate regime, s =

    for all t,      and the conditional variance of output is simply



                  v_i(y)ipi =                                                        (10)


By comparing (9) and (10), one sees that the conditional variance of real

output under a flexible exchange ra.te regime exceeds the conditional variance

of real output under a fixed rate regime whenever



             [a2(a2 +   a2)   +   (1   + n)2w2a2 ]> (2cL +   -y)cr2.                 (11)




Because the flexible exchange rate regime allows foreign price and interest

rate disturbances and the domestic money supply disturbance to affect the

exchange rate thereby altering the terms of trade, these disturbances add

additional variance to the demand for and supply of real output under such a

regime. A counterbalancing effect that tends to reduce the volatility of real

output under flexible rates when compared to fixed rates is that positive real

demand shocks appreciate the domestic currency thereby improving the terms of

trade, and this change in relative prices reduces the demand for real

output. The appreciation of the currency arises because the increase in real
                                               — 11 —

demand increases the demand for money. The smaller is the elasticity of the

demand for money with respect to real output, y, the more likely is the

volatility of real output to be greater under flexible exchange rates than

under fixed rates. In order to provide a striking comparison in what follows,

we assume that y =    0.    With this change, permanently flexible rates produce

an unambiguously larger volatility of real output than permanently fixed

exchange rates.



2C.     SOLUTION FOR A TEMPORARY FIXED EXCHANGE RATE REGIME

        Our fixed exchange rate solution from the previous section ignored the

possibility that the economy may evolve into a state where it is worthwhile

for agents to attack the government's foreign exchange reserves and end the

fixed rate regime.4 We assume that the monetary authority will defend the

fixed rate regime only until its reserves hit some known lower bound, r.

After reserves hit this bound, the netary authority is assumed to abandon

the fixed—rate regime forever, If agents successfully attack the fixed—rate

regime, they produce the floating rate whose level is given by



          =     ÷ X1h +              +         +
                                                   X4z*+ X5v              (12)
                        A2bt     1       A3x



where         .[(1—ü) + czi* +   (1+a)üi],      and X through   are as above except

with y =   0.    If    > s, risk—free profits can be had at the expense of the

monetary authority. If           < s, attackers would make losses and consequently

would not attack. If an atack took place when s s, no profits would be

realized, and the post—attack exchange rate would be s.            Thus, we treat this

case as part of the no attack situation without loss of generality, and an

attack takes place if and only if s >
                                         — 12 —

    At time t-1, when setting nominal prices for period t, agents realize
that the fixed exchange rate regime could collapse next period. Therefore,

the conditional expectation of the exchange rate in period t is not simply

s, but it is the probability weighted average of the conditional expectations

under the two possible regimes:



     Eis = (1         —
                          _i)s   + _iEt_i(5t1ct),                          (13)




where           is the probability at time t—1 of an attack at time t and Ei(sIC)

is the expectation at t—1 of s conditional on a collapse at time t.
                                                              =                —     > O}
        The probability of an attack next period, is              pr_i{5
where pr_i{x} is the probability of event x given the t—1 information set.

Examination of the solution for the flexible exchange rate in (12) indicates that

                                                         =             >

amount by which the fixed exchange rate exceeds the conditional expectation

of s based on time t—1 information. As              falls, the probability of

collapse increases monotonically since a larger part of the distribution of

   can induce a collapse.

        The volatility of real output under a fixed exchange rate regime that may

collapse is

                                     1(s   —

which is clearly larger than Vt...1(yt)Fjx. It is also true that

                    is less than Vt_1(yt)IF1ex In orderto determine this result,

consider the following decomposition of the conditional variance of the

exchange rate under the two regimes:

output than a regime of permanently fixed rates, but the volatility is not

larger than under a pure flexible rate regime.

     These results are not particularly surprising since as cSi increases,

the probability of an attack decreases, and the conditional variance of output

approaches that under a fixed exchange rate regimen Similarly, as

decreases, the probability of an attack increases, and the conditional

variance of real output approaches that under a flexible exchange rate

regime. For intermediate values of 5t1' the conditional variance iS between

the two extreme regimes.

the forecast errors that arise from both parts of the distributions of

to examine the volatility of output under a potentially collapsing fixed

exchange rate regime is to estimate the variance of output by examining only

the realizations of output under a *egime that could collapse but had not

collapsed during the sample. This corresponds to the sample variance that one

would measure by using all the data during a regime of fixed rates up to the

point of a collapse.

In order to conduct an analytical comparison of (17) and (15b), it is

nessary to consider an actual probability distribution for c. Analytical

tractablity also rules out obvious candidates like the normal distribution,

but the point of the analysis is to demonstrate that the squared exchange rate

forecast error in (17) can be greater than the one in (15b) for some

distributions.         Consequently, we examined the model under the hypotheses that

   had either a uniform distribution or a double exponential probability

distribution. Only the results for the uniform distribution are reported in

the text.

        When     is uniformly distributed, we have



                       =   1/2ri,         —ri      E                                    (18)

is 1l2I3       It also follows that

In the following discussion we will assume — n                                n, since this is the

region of interest.              If       > '            = 0,   and         cannot be less than —

output during a fixed—rate regime which may collapse. This expression is

We   also use (7) and (18) to find the conditional variance of output during a

permanently floating exchange rate regime. This expression is



       Vl(Y)IFl =                  +   c7.                                           (20b)

The lower limit of (20b) as              +   r    is a, which is output variance for a

fixed rate regime without collapse. These results confirm what was found

earlier for arbitrary probability distributions.                 When 5t1 = n, an attack

next period is unprofitable with probability one, so output variance is

When       =   —Ti,   an attack next period happens with probability one, so output

variance is [82n2/3} + a.          For values of              between n and —n, output

variance is a convex combination of the two extremes with weights that vary

nonlinearly with

       In our examination of these results, however, we asked what would happen

to measured output variance during the fixed—rate regime as 5 changed but the

regime did not collapse. The Appendix demonstrates that output variance

during the fixed—rate regime would be given by




                               2(Ti_..i)4/16n2 +          .                          (20c)
                           =




This quantity also depends on                and is plotted in Figure 1.             The

interesting feature of this line is that the maximum variance for output is

above output variance for a permanent float. Indeed, the volatilities in

(20b) and (20c) are equal when t-1 =              - [(16/3)1/4   —   un   = —.52n.     The

implication of this relationship is that while 5t1 is in the range below
                                        — 17 —

—.52n, measured output variance under the fixed exchange rate regime is

larger than output variance would be under a floating exchange rate regime.

      This result is due entirely to the fact that exchange rate prediction

errors can be larger, for some ranges of S, for a fixed—rate regime which

might collapse but does not than for a floating—rate regime. In our example

with exchange rate innovations drawn from a uniform distribution, this occurs

whenever        < —   .52n.   The lower is       the more likely is a collapse of

the regime, but if actual draws of      are not greater than       the regime

remains viable and output variance is larger than under flexible rates.



3A.   A FLOOD-MARION TYPE MODEL

      One version of the Flood—Marion (1982) model depicted an open economy

that was small both in the market for goods and in the market for assets.

Wage contracts were set one period in advance of the realizations of

disturbances. Wages, however, werelndexed to the price level in a manner to

minimize the deadweight loss from wages being different than their level in a

frictionless (no contract) economy.6 rhe major result of Flood and Marion was

that the degree of wage indexation depended on the choice of exchange—rate

regime. They found that a small open economy would index wages fully under a

regime of permanently fixed exchange rates, but wages would only be indexed

partially under a regime of floating exchange rates. Their results indicated

that the degree of wage indexing would remain constant under any single regime

as long as the underlying stochastic structure of the economy was constant.

      In our version of the Flood—Marion model, the fixed exchange rate regime

may collapse. Hence, wages are not fully indexed for such a regime, and the

degree of indexation is time varying even though the underlying exogenous

stochastic structure is time invariant.
                                          —18—
    We demonstrate this result in a stripped—down version of the Flood—Marion

     Equation (21) states that the supply of real money balances, '' —            is
equal to the demand for theni,         + u. To make the model analytically

tractable, we simplified the money demand function, removing from the Flood—

Marion model the opportunity cost of holding money as well as the portion of

output that is responsive to prices. Money demand thus depends only on a

constant, , and the productivity disturbance, ut. The qualitative properties

of our results do not depend on these simplifications, but they enormously

simplify some later calculations. Equation (22) gives the goods arbitrage

condition, which is equivalent to prchasing power parity in this one—good

model. Equation (23), which is derived in the Appendix of Flood and Marion,

is the aggregate supply function. The variable z is proportional to one minus

the optimal degree to which the nominal wage is indexed to the price level.

Since z is a deterministic linear function of the degree of indexing, the

optimal wage contract may be found by minimizing the loss function (given

below) with respect to z. Equation (24), which is also derived in the

Appendix of Flood and Marion, gives the frictionless benchmark (no indexing)

level of output,         Equation (25) specifies that the money supply is
composed of domestic credit, which we hold constant, and international

reserves. As specified in equation (26), the foreign price follows a random

walk. The disturbance terms,       u   and v have zero unconditional means   and are
mutually   and serially uncorrelated.

from time t—1, which includes all variables dated t—1 and earlier as well as

quadratic measure of deadweight loss by an appropriate choice of z.

        By substituting from (23) and (24), the optimal indexing problem (27) may

be rewritten as



             mm Ei[z(p —           Eip) +    Au}2                                 (28)

3B.     SOLUTIONS FOR PERMANENT EXCHANGE RATE REGIMES

        When the exchange rate is flexible, there is no intervention in tue

foreign exchange market. Thus, international reserves, rt, are constant at

                                                               a —
the level r, and the exchange rate is s =             rn   —
                                                                     u   —   , where
rn E   wb + (1 —   )r.        The domestic price prediction error,

Pt
      —
          E_ip,    equals v + St —   Eis, which is equal to — u.
Hence, the optimal value of z is z              =   A, and this value of z will set the
                                         Flex
loss function to zero. This special result is due to the assumed absence of

independent disturbances to the money supply or to money demand in this

simplified version of the model. In general, the optimal z will depend on the

relative sizes of the variances of the various shocks (see Flood and Marion,

p. 54). Presently, the important point is that ZIF1              is positive and time

invariant.

          When the exchange rate is permanently fixed, rt becomes demand

determined, and the domestic price is given by p =
                                                             p   + s, where s is the

fixed exchange rate. In this circumstance the domestic price prediction

error, Pt —     Et_IPt,   is simply the prediction error of foreign prices,

v.         Consequently, since v and Ut are uncorrelated, the solution to (29) is

to set z1 =         0 to screen foreign price disturances out of the domestic loss

function. This is exactly the resurt in Flood and Marion.



3C.       SOLUTION FOR A TEMPORARY FIXED EXCHANGE RATE REGIME

          The fixed—rate solution in the previous section presumed that the fixed—

rate regime would last forever. As before, however, for some configurations

of the state variables of the economy it may be profitable for agents to

attack the government?s stock of foreign exchange reserves and end the fixed—

rate regime. We continue to assume that the monetary authority will defend

the fixed rate only until international reserves hit some known lower bound,

r, and that after hitting this bound, the fixed—rate regime wiil be abandoned

forever in favor of a flexible exchange rate regime. In this model, if agents

attack the fixed rate, they will produce the floating rate given by
                                            — 22 —

where            + (1 —   w).   Thus, when forming wage contracts based on

information available at time t—1, the contracting parties must plan for the

possibility that the fixed—rate regime will be attacked successfully at time

t. The probability of an attack taking place at t, based on t—1 information,

is       =

     As before, when there is a possibility that the exchange rate regime will

collapse, the agents take account of the possibility in determining their

contractual relations. In this case, the optimal degree of indexing depends

on the probability of the collapse because this affects the unconditional time

t—1 covariance and variance in (29).

     As is shown in the Appendix, the solution to (29) for this case is



                                                                                            (31)

expectation operator based on time t—1 information but conditional on a

collapse taking place at t. The expression on the right hand side of (31),

although complicated, is simply the covariance of Au and Pt conditional only

on t—1 information divided by the variance of Pt conditional only on t—1

information.

     In typical wage indexing models the optimal z is a time invariant

function of the variances and covariances of the underlying disturbances. Our

main point in this section is that it will not in general be time invariant
                                        — 23 —

when stochastic process switching is possible. This point can be seen at an

 intuitive level by examining (31) and noticing that z_1 depends on                 the

 state dependent probability at t—1 of an attack at t.

     To make additional progress concerning z1, we again made specific

assumptions about the probability distribution functions for v and u• In

the Appendix we assume that the orthogonal disturbances v and u are each

uniformly distributed on the interval [—n,rl].         This assumption leads to the

closed form but complicated expression for zi shown in the Appendix. Since

the final expression for z_1 is so complicated, we simulated it for a few

values of         in the interval [—2n,O], and we set n = 1.      In this situation

we found:

Example (32a) is the Flood—Marion result; when            + —2, it is impossible

for v + u to be less than '_           Consequently,   t1 - 0,   and an attack on

the fixed—rate regime at time t is impossible because it cannot be

profitable. It is thus optimal to set            = 0 (index wages fully), thereby

screening all foreign disturbances out of the loss function. For larger

values of         such as —1 and 0 in examples 32b) and (32c), an attack is

possible and contracts written at t—1 allow for this contingency by setting

     at optimal values between 0, the optimal value for a fixed exchange rate

with no attack possible, and X, the optimal value for a permanently floating

exchange rate.

     The point of this simple example is to note that an economy's optimal

choice of wage indexation to the price level may not depend simply on the

policy currently being pursued by the government and the constant covariance

structure of exogenous disturbances. It may also depend on agents' rational

beliefs about the possibility of switches in government policies in the

future. Consequently, the observation that indexing in wage contracts is time

varying need not necessarily be associated with variation in the conditional

covariance matrix of the underlying exogenous disturbances, it may instead be

associated with time variation in agents' beliefs concerning the permanance of

currently implemented policies.7



4.   CONCLUSIONS

      The purpose of this paper was to examine how some aspects of the real

economy, such as the determination of output, relative prices and real wages,

are influenced by the potential collapse of a fixed exchange rate regime. We

examined the implications of the potential switch in government policies in

simple versions of two popular international macroeconomic models. In both

models, agents must take an action that predetermines some nominal variable.

Consequently, monetary policy and the choice of exchange rate regime have real

effects. In both models the monetary authority Is only willing to defend its

exchange rate until its reserves hit a known lower bound. In each case the

monetary authority also conducts an exogenous domestic credit policy. If the

authorities were willing to conduct an endogenous domestic credit policy,

there would be no need for internatioa1 reserves, and the probability of

collapse of the fixed exchange rate regime would be zero.

      Clearly, one interesting area for future work is the linkage of the

domestic credit policy and the constraints imposed by the government budget

constraint   with the choice of exchange rate regime. Eaton (1984) has

investigated this problem in a neoclassical context with exogenous real

output.

     Another interesting area for future work is to focus on devaluations as

opposed to the switch from fixed to flexible rates investigated here. What

determines the timing and magnitude of a devaluation? Blanco and Garber

(1984)    have   begun such an investigation.

Al •   RESULTS    FOR SECTION 2

       This   Appendix provides the derivation of some results in Section 2. The

first result involves a comparision of the conditional variance of the

exchange rate under flexible rates in (15b) and under collapsing fixed rates

in (15a). These equations are reproduced here as (Al) and (A2) respectively:

In order to make further progress on these expressions we assumed Ut and v to

be uniformly and independently distributed on the interval [—                n,   n].

In the calculations reported here, we impose the additional assumption that

—2n < y_ ( 0.              We impose this additional restriction because the joint

distribution of (u, v) conditional on u + v < t—1 is quite complicated

when          > 0, and we need only examine a few different values of

       to establish the point that z,_1 will be time varying. Also, when

       < —    2n, the probability of a collapse is zero.

                                   FOOTNOTES



1Early contributions to the debate on fixed versus flexible exchange rates are
    surveyed by Ishiyama (1975) and Tower and Willett (1976). Some of the
   more recent analytical contributions to this area that are based on
    rational expectations include Flood (1979), Lapan and Enders (1980),
   Helpnian (1981), Weber (1981), Eaton (1982), Kimbrough (1983), Turnovsky
    (1983), and Aizenman and Frenkel (1984).


2Fischer (1982) demonstrates that seignorage accounts for as much as ten
    percent of total government revenue for countries such as Argentina and
    Brazil. The literature on the monetary approach to the balance of
    payments, e.g. Frenkel and Johnson (1975), was quite clear that a policy
    of fixing the exchange rate made the total money supply endogenous.


3The Dornbusch model deflates nominal money balances by the domestic price of
    the domestic good instead of deflating them by a price index composed of
    the domestic price of domestic goods and the domestic price of foreign
   goods. For our purposes this is a harmless simplification which we also
    adopt.


4Although we examine only fixed and freely floating exchange rates, our
   methods could easily encompass "crawling pegs" or any rule that makes the
    fixed exchange rate a deterministic function of the previous state. Our
   methods could also be extended to analyze a "dirty float" of the form
       —
           mi =    +
                       v,   such as that studied by Aizenman and Frenkel
    (1984). In such a circumstance, while the private sector could not attack
   the money printing rule, the fiscal authority might require a change in
    the rule if it were to call for less money printing than were required for
   deficit finance. The inability of Southern Cone countries to stay on
   preannounced crawling peg schedules is perhaps an example of the type of
    fiscal authority attack we have in mind. In such countries an exchange
   rate policy seems not to be permanently viable unless it accomodates the
   fiscal authority's revenue requirements.

5'rhe conditions we use for an attack are those in Flood and Garber (1984). An
   alternative view, where the agents who would attack the price fixing
   scheme are small and disorganized is proposed by Obstfeld (1984).
   According to the Obstfeld view, s > s is necessary for an attack but not
   always sufficient. The condition is necessary and sufficient in the
   present model though, as Obstfeld (1984) has shown.


6lndexing wages to prices is motivated only by the large number of such
   contracts actually implemented. The value of the loss function can
   generally be made smaller if contracts include more complex indexing to
    the state as in Karni (1983) or Aizenman and Frenkel (1984). Our intent,
   however, is not to specify an ideal contract, but rather to indicate how
   actual contracts affect the economy in a second best environment.


7Cecchetti (1984) derives and documents changes in an implied indexing
   parameter for union wage changes from 1964—1978 for U. S. unionized
   manufacturing. The movement in the parameter may be due to movement in
    the conditional variance of the exogenous monetary and real processes of
    the economy, but the analysis in this paper suggests that such movement
   might also arise from agents' perceptions of the likelihood of switches in
   government policies. Since the contracting paradigm also leads to the
   aggregate supply curve studied by Lucas (1973), the perceived impermanence
   of existing exchange rate regimes is an additional reason why the slope
   parameters would differ across countries.
