Now Unions Increase Job Satisfaction and Well-being

NBER Working Paper No. 27720

JEL No. J28,J50,J51

                                           ABSTRACT

Using data from the United States and Europe on nearly two million respondents we show the
partial correlation between union membership and employee job satisfaction is positive and
statistically significant. This runs counter to findings in the seminal work of Freeman (1978) and
Borjas (1979) in the 1970s and most empirical studies since. With data for the United States we
show the association between union membership and job satisfaction switched from negative to
positive in the 2000s. Cohorts with positive union effects over time come to dominate those with
negative effects. The negative association between membership and job satisfaction is apparent in
cohorts born in the 1940s and 1950s but turns positive for those born between the 1960s and
1990s. Analyses for Europe since the 2000s confirm the positive association between union
membership and worker wellbeing is apparent elsewhere. We also find evidence in the United
Kingdom from panel estimation of a positive relation between union membership and job
satisfaction. We find positive union associations with other aspects of worker wellbeing including
life satisfaction and happiness, several macro variables and various measures of trust. Union
members are also less likely to be stressed, worried, depressed, sad or lonely. The findings have
important implications for our understanding of trade unionism.

union workers express greater dissatisfaction with their jobs than otherwise comparable
nonunion workers." Hersch and Stone (1990)

"One of the great empirical regularities of industrial relations research is that union
members tend to be less satisfied with their jobs than their non-union counterparts."

1. Introduction
Ever since the seminal work of Freeman (1978) and Borjas (1979) economists have
known that trade union membership is negatively correlated with job satisfaction. This is
no longer true: today the partial correlation is positive. This partly reflects birth cohort
effects with the negative association being confined to those born in the 1940s and 1950s,
while among later birth cohorts the union partial correlation with membership is positive.
It also reflects differences over time in the fear union non-members have about losing
their job relative to members.

Empirical investigations since Freeman and Borjas, both for the United States and
elsewhere, testified to the fact (Laroche, 2016; Hammer and Agvar, 2005). Freeman and
Medoff (1984) devoted a whole chapter to the issue in their classic text What Do Unions
Do? providing some theory that might account for the correlation. Applying Albert O.
Hirschman's (1970) consumer behavior model of exit voice and loyalty to employment
relations, they suggested that unions, by helping to solve employees' problems at work,
made them less likely to quit the workplace than similarly dissatisfied non-union workers
so that unions appeared to increase the `stock' of dissatisfied workers. So, the correlation
might be causal. Freeman (1980) examined this further and reported empirical evidence
showing significantly lower exit for unionized workers in several large data files.
Freeman argued that the grievance system plays a major role in lowering quit rates and
that the reduction lowers costs and raises productivity.

Unions also had an interest in fomenting dissatisfaction to help strengthen their
bargaining hand vis-à-vis the employer (what Freeman and Medoff termed "voice-
induced complaining"), which might show up as dissatisfaction in social surveys. And
they also increased the information flow to workers, so that employees often found out
about poor management or poor conditions which, in the absence of the union, they may
have been unaware of.

It was also possible that the correlation might have been a result of selection processes ­
in particular the selection of less satisfied workers into unionization, and unions' ability
to organize workplaces with poor working conditions. Failure to account for these
selection processes could generate the negative correlation that Freeman, Borjas and
Freeman and Medoff had found.

For decades after these seminal contributions, analysts puzzled as to whether the union
negative correlation with job satisfaction was causal or not. There were many papers,
                                             1
particularly for the United States and the United Kingdom, which seemed to indicate that
the correlation reflected, at least in part, poor working conditions (Bender and Sloane,
1998; Pfeffer and Davis-Blake, 1990; Bessa et al., 2020) or differences between those
who became union members and those who did not (Bryson et al., 2004 using
instrumental variables; Heywood et al., 2002 using worker fixed effects). In some
instances, panel analyses accounting for person fixed effects and the pathway by which
workers became unionized even found the correlation switched to a positive and
significant coefficient, at least in the case of pay satisfaction. 1 But this is not always the
case. For instance, Bryson and Davies (2019) find the negative association between
union membership and job satisfaction over the period 1991-2008 persists with the
introduction of person fixed effects. These mixed results are reflected in Laroche
(2016)'s meta-analysis of 59 studies and 235 estimates. He concluded that most of the
studies he examined found a negative association between unionization and job
satisfaction but that the evidence "is far from being conclusive", restating doubts
expressed decades earlier by Kochan and Helfman (1981) who had concluded that the
evidence was "mixed", and Gordon and Denisi (1995) who found that union members in
the United States did not have lower levels of job satisfaction.

The negative partial correlation between unionization and job satisfaction extends beyond
the United States and the United Kingdom: Meng (1990) found a negative for Canada,
García-Serrano (2009) for Spain and Miller (1990) for Australia. Blanchflower and
Oswald (1999) found a similar negative correlation in a 1989 International Social Survey
Programme (ISSP) survey covering ten countries, namely the United Kingdom, the
United States, Austria, Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, Italy; Ireland, Norway and
Israel.

Throughout this period few suggested that unionization may improve worker wellbeing,
even though unions' raison d'etre was the improvement in workers' terms and conditions.
There were a few exceptions. Kaufman (2004) argued that those workers who keep their
union jobs in the face of shrinking labor demand should be more satisfied with their jobs
than non-union workers. Using data from the 1977 Quality of Employment Survey for
the United States Pfeffer and Davis-Blake (1990) confirmed this was the case. Renaud
(2002) replicated these findings for Canada.

However, in the second decade of the new century a trickle of papers emerged suggesting
a positive partial correlation between union membership and job satisfaction. One
(Davis, 2012) was for the United States. Davis (2012) found that public sector


1
  Many of these studies find a role for selection effects investigate endogenous selection into union
coverage, or into a combination of coverage or membership (Powdthavee, 2011; Bryson and White, 2016a;
Bryson and White, 2016b; Green and Heywood, 2015; Bryson et al., 2010). In this paper we focus
exclusively on union membership, as opposed to coverage, to maintain comparability with the classic
seminal papers, but we also examine the sensitivity of some of our results to a wider definition of
unionization in which a worker is considered `unionized' if they are either a union member or work in a
union covered workplace.
                                                  2
unionization can increase member's job satisfaction by "favorably altering the work
environment":

"This research is consistent with arguments that unions can increase members'
satisfaction by enabling them to achieve preferred values, and it supports the assertion
that favorably altering perceptions of the work environment serves as a mechanism by
which unions indirectly increase job satisfaction (Davis, 2012, p.80)."

But the others were for Europe. Using waves 3 (2006) and 5 (2010) of the European
Social Survey Donegani and McKay (2012) found a positive partial correlation between
union membership and job satisfaction pooling data across twenty countries and in
various model specifications controlling for demographics, as well as occupation,
working hours, and firm size. They find the same positive partial correlation for other
satisfaction variables including satisfaction with income, the government and the
economy.

van der Meer (2019) uses European Social Survey sweep 5 (2010) data and finds a
positive partial correlation between union membership and job satisfaction in the United
Kingdom and Ireland sample as well as for Continental Europe. Sironi (2019) also finds
a positive partial correlation between union membership and job satisfaction, as well as
other well-being measures, using sweep 6 (2012) of the ESS. However, a word of
caution is sounded in Laroche's (2017) study for France: using linked employer-
employee data collected in 2011 he finds a negative partial correlation between
unionization and job satisfaction that disappears when accounting for endogenous
selection into a union setting, reflecting the earlier studies for the UK using similar linked
employer-employee data (Bryson et al., 2010).

In this paper we revisit the issue using large-scale survey data for the United States and
Europe to examine whether the partial correlation between union membership and worker
wellbeing has shifted since the early seminal studies of Freeman, Borjas and Freeman and
Medoff. We do so using social surveys with large samples to ensure we capture robust
correlations. For the United States we use the General Social Survey to track any change
in the relationship over time, and the Gallup Daily Tracker which, whilst only available
since 2009, contains over half a million observations on workers.

For Europe we rely primarily on the European Social Survey which covers around 30
European countries and began in 2002, though we also present some results from the
British Household Panel Survey and Understanding Society. Furthermore, we extend the
investigation to a range of wellbeing metrics, going beyond job and life satisfaction to
consider happiness, enjoyment, Cantril's Ladder, and metrics of ill-being such as feelings
of stress, pain and anxiety. We also consider partial correlations with other attitudes
which might impact individuals' wellbeing such as trust and views on the macro
economy and democracy.


                                              3
Our results are startling. We find positive correlations between union membership and
worker wellbeing across a range of metrics, both in the United States and Europe since
the turn of the Century. For the United States using the General Social Survey we
confirm the early findings of a negative partial correlation between job satisfaction and
unionization in the 20th Century, but this shifts to statistical non-significance in the early
part of the 21st Century before switching to a positive significant correlation in the second
decade of the 21st Century.

The positive correlation post the Great Recession is replicated in the US Gallup Daily
Tracker Poll (USGDTP) and is apparent for a range of wellbeing metrics. The raw
correlation continues to be statistically significant, though a little smaller, when we
condition on workers' demographic traits, state fixed effects and, in our most extensive
regressions, occupation, health, BMI, smoker status, etc. In Europe the positive
correlation between unionization and a range of wellbeing metrics has been apparent
since the early part of the new Century; it is robust to controls for demographic traits and
country fixed effects; and it is apparent in most large European countries, despite
substantial differences in the way unions bargain. That union workers have higher levels
of happiness and lower levels of stress than non-union workers, and that this is true
around the world in the years since the Great Recession, runs contrary to what was
previously found.

In addition to this literature on the links between unionization and worker wellbeing we
also contribute to the literature that has found that job satisfaction is U-shaped in age (for
the United Kingdom see Clark, Oswald and Warr, 1996; Clark, 1996; and Clark and
Oswald, 1996. See Blanchflower and Oswald, 1999 for the United States (General Social
Survey, 1973-1996), Europe (15 countries in Eurobarometer surveys for 1995-96); and
for the world in the International Social Survey Program (ISSP) 1989). There has been
much less evidence for a U-shape in job satisfaction than there has been for happiness
(Blanchflower and Oswald, 2008; Blanchflower, 2020a; Blanchflower and Graham,
2020) or unhappiness (Blanchflower, 2020b). We produce new evidence below.

Of note also is that Blanchflower and Bryson (2020) have found that union membership
peaks in midlife. Over time there have been changes in that the level of the peak has
fallen as union density rates have fallen. In addition the average age at the peak has
risen, being pulled to the right by higher density rates among workers over the age of 65.

2. Empirical Evidence

2.1    United States
Table 1 reports the partial correlation between union membership and job satisfaction
using the General Social Surveys (GSS) from 1972-2018 for workers only where the
question asked was as follows and with the following pre-codes: 2

2
 Job satisfaction data are available in the GSS for the following years: 1972-1978; 1980; 1982-1991; 1993;
1994; 1996 and then every two years through 2018.
                                                    4
Q1: On the whole how satisfied are you with the work you do ­ would you say you are
very satisfied=4, moderately satisfied=3, a little dissatisfied=2, or very dissatisfied=1?

The same question and GSS data was used by Blanchflower and Oswald (1999) for the
years 1972-1996. They estimated an ordered logit for workers and found that a union
variable entered significantly negative in a job satisfaction equation in their Table 2.
Their results are replicated in column 1 for the same years with controls for union, age
and its square, highest level of education, self-employed, region and year. To be
comparable we estimate the job satisfaction equations using ordered logits. The union
coefficient in column 1 is negative and highly statistically significant with a t-statistic of
nearly four.

Column 2 performs the same exercise for the years 1998-2008 but now the union
coefficient switches sign and becomes insignificantly different from zero. Finally, the
third column suggests something fundamental has changed since the Great Recession,
focusing on the five survey years from 2010-2018. The union coefficient has now turned
significantly positive with a t-statistic of 2.17. Union members in the years since the
Great Recession have significantly higher levels of job satisfaction than non-members.

Table 2 for workers only replicates the finding of a positive union coefficient in probit
job satisfaction equations for over half a million observations using data from Gallup's
US Daily Tracker Poll (GUSDTP) from 2009-2013.

The exact question, which is only asked of workers, is: Q2. Are you satisfied or
dissatisfied with your job or the work you do? 3 The dependent variable is set to one if
satisfied, zero otherwise and all equations include year and month of interview and state
controls. In column 1 with the addition of gender and age union membership is positive
and statistically significant. The model is extended in column 2 to include controls for
race, education, diet and exercise. 4 The union coefficient drops a little but remains
positive and highly statistically significant.

The model in column 3 is extended still further to incorporate potentially endogenous
controls including occupation, income, whether the respondent has health insurance and
whether they are part time or underemployed. 5 The inclusion of these controls increases
the size of the positive union coefficient. Consistent with the findings of Bell and
Blanchflower (2020) the underemployed (PT wants FT) have lower levels of job
satisfaction. Plus, in all three columns there is a U-shape in age, consistent with the
findings of Clark (1996).

  The consumption of fruit and vegetables and exercise are known to raise satisfaction and wellbeing
(Blanchflower, Oswald and Stewart-Brown, 2013).

  Using GSS and ESS data Pischke (2011) also examines life and job satisfaction and shows that the
association between income and well-being is causal.

2.2    Europe
In Table 3 we examine the association between union membership and job satisfaction
using data on over 70,000 observations from three sweeps from 2006, 2010 and 2012 of
the European Social Surveys across 38 countries. 6 The question asked was:

Q3. How satisfied are you in your main job? Completely dissatisfied=1; very
dissatisfied=2; fairly dissatisfied=3; neither satisfied nor dissatisfied=4; fairly
satisfied=5; very satisfied=6; completely satisfied=7?

For simplicity, now that the dependent variable is scored 1-7, we estimate OLS models
and the sample is restricted to workers only using the employment status variable
indicating that paid work is the respondent's main activity (mnactic=1). In the first
column the union variable is entered alone: the raw correlation is significant and positive
with a T-statistic of nearly 20. 7 The union coefficient remains positive in column 2 as
age, gender and native variables are added and in column 3 also with the addition of
country and wave dummies, years of education and self-employment or owning a
business. The final three columns show the result remains in each of the three sweeps
individually. As in the United States in recent years union members in Europe have
significantly higher job satisfaction than their non-member counterparts.

2.3     United Kingdom
In the discussion above, that has mostly found negative union effects on job satisfaction,
it is apparent that much of the empirical literature is for the United Kingdom, and that
most of the studies use the leading household panel survey in Britain, the British
Household Panel Survey (BHPS) and its successor Understanding Society (USoc). It is
also apparent from the literature review above that the literature has tended to focus on
two dimensions of unionization, namely coverage and membership.

In Table 4 we revisit the issue focusing on the association between union membership
and overall job satisfaction. We combine BHPS and USoc running estimates for the
period 1996-2014. The question used is

Q4. On a scale of 1 to 7 where 1 means 'Completely dissatisfied' and 7 means
'Completely satisfied', how dissatisfied or satisfied are you with your present job overall?

In column 1 we include the union variable alongside year dummies: it is negative and
significant. When we add gender, marital status, education, and region controls in
column 2 the negative coefficient increases in size and remains statistically significant.
However, when we exploit the panel nature of the data by running person fixed effects

models the coefficient switches sign, becoming positive and statistically significant both
without (column 3) and with (column 4) time-varying covariates. These results are
robust to the use of an alternative unionization variable which scores 1 if the respondent
is a union member or works in a union covered workplace (these are available on
request).

This result stands in contrast to most of the existing literature for the United Kingdom,
but there have been inklings of a positive effect in some of the literature. Bryson and
White (2016b), for example, did find that with people fixed effects in these BHPS data
1991-2007 union attitudes are broadly positive both with regard to pay and with regard to
hours of work. Bessa, Charlwood and Valizade (2020) who also used the BHPS
concluded that "our overall judgement is that union membership does not have a causal
impact on job satisfaction" but went on to argue that "studies designed to explicitly test
for positive effects of unions on job satisfaction would therefore be desirable in future."

2.4     The U-shape in job satisfaction across the life-course
In the previous literature a U-shape in age in job satisfaction among workers tends to be
found in samples that have a relatively large number of observations that also include
non-workers. It seems to be harder to find than for other measures that have bigger
samples.

There is evidence of a U-shape in job satisfaction in all of the tables above except Table 1
for the United States, which has relatively few observations. It is present in Table 2 using
the GUSDTP, minimizing at age 34 in column 3. It is also present in Table 3 for Europe
in column 3 with a minimum at age 31 and for Table 4 for the UK, with a minimum also
around age thirty-six falling to twenty-nine with person fixed effects. 8 These minima are
somewhat lower than those for other well-being measures that we look at next. They are
consistent with the early findings by Clark, Oswald and Warr (1996) of a U-shape with a
minimum in the UK using the 1991 BHPS, at age 31.

2.5     Union Membership, happiness, life satisfaction and stress
We now turn to examine other measures of wellbeing and their association with union
membership. There are relatively few examples in the literature of the impact of unions
on well-being variables other than job satisfaction. Using the first six waves of the World
Values Survey conducted in the United States (1982, 1990, 1995, 1999, 2006, and 2011)
Flavin and Shufeld (2016) find that union members are more satisfied with their lives
than those who are not members. Flavin, Pacek, and Radcliff, (2010) examined life
satisfaction in fourteen industrialized democracies: Australia, Canada, Finland, France,

8
  The Eurobarometer survey series occasionally contain questions on job satisfaction, but do not include
union variables. One example is Eurobarometer #72.1, which contains a 10-step job satisfaction question.
­ "Could you please tell me on a scale of 1 to 10 how satisfied you are with each of the following items,
where `1' means you are "very dissatisfied" and `10' means you are "very satisfied" you are with your job?
When it is regressed on a quadratic in age, gender, education and country dummies on a sample of all 28
EU countries there is a U-shape which minimizes at age 40. The results are -.0265 age (t=2.71) - .00033
Age2 (t=2.89), with n=12,318.
                                                    7
Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Japan Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland,
and the United States using the fifth wave of the World Values Survey (WVS). They
found an individual union variable entered positively as did a country level union density
variable, in a number of life satisfaction equations.

Keane, Pacek and Radcliff (2012) also used the WVS, sweeps 2-4, and included the
individual union member variable and union density at the country level and found
positive and significant effects for the individual variable but not for the aggregate one.
For a subset of OECD countries both were significant and positive. Radcliff (2005) uses
life satisfaction data aggregated from the Eurobarometers from 1975 to 1992 and mapped
in union density by country that he shows enters positively and significantly.

We begin with a few measures of positive affect ­ life satisfaction, happiness, enjoyment
and feeling calm and peaceful, where we also find positive union effects. We then
examine several measures of negative affect or unhappiness ­ stress, feeling depressed,
finding everything an effort, feeling lonely and feeling sad ­ where we find the union
coefficients are significantly negative. We then move on to look at measures of trust in
Europe ­ in relation to the police; politicians; political parties and the European
Parliament ­ and again find positive union effects. Finally, we look at respondents'
views on national government; democracy, education and health services, where the
union effects are mixed. In every case we restrict the samples to workers only to be as
comparable as possible to the job satisfaction measures.

Table 5 reports the results of OLS estimation of Cantril's 11-step life satisfaction ladder
question in the GUSDTP of 2009-2017, used previously by a number of authors
including Blanchflower and Graham (2020) and Blanchflower (2020a). The survey
question is:

Q5. "Please imagine a ladder, with steps numbered from 0 at the bottom to 10 at the top. The top
represents the best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible
life for you. On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you stand at this
time?"

The union variable is significant and positive in column 1 with age, gender and race
controls indicating union members have higher life satisfaction than non-member. The
same applies in column 2 which adds controls for education, the number of days
consuming five or more portions of fruit and vegetables, and the number of days in the
past week taking exercise of at least 30 minutes. The final column adds occupation and
income controls and other personal controls including marital status and health. The
underemployed are especially unhappy again. But the partial correlation between union
membership and life satisfaction remains in-tact and highly statistically significant.

Table 6 does the same for happiness across sweeps 1-9 of the ESS from 2002-2018, for
workers. Union membership is positive and statistically significant in an estimation
sample of around 200,000 observations. Table 7 uses life satisfaction and the results are
                                                 8
essentially the same. There is a positive statistically significant partial correlation
between union membership and happiness which persists with the introduction of basic
controls in column 2 and a wide range of controls in column 3. In both cases there are U-
shapes in age with minima in mid-life. 9 The questions used are.

Q6. "Taking all things together, how happy would you say you are? Please answer using
this card, where 0 means extremely happy and 10 means extremely happy."

Q7. "All things considered, how satisfied are you with your life as a whole nowadays?
Please answer using this card, where 0 means extremely dissatisfied and 10 means
extremely satisfied."

It turns out that unions lower stress and worry, including worry about money. In Table 8
we switch back to the United States to use the GUSDTP data to examine the association
between union membership and negative affect. Column 1 focuses on stress, as
previously examined by Blanchflower (2020b) and Graham and Puzuello (2019) using
the Gallup World poll. The survey question is: Q8. "Did you experience stress
yesterday ­ yes or no?" In addition, we consider worry in column 2. These unhappiness
variables look like the mirror image of the life satisfaction results in Table 5 above (for
instance there is an inverted U-shape in age). Union membership enters negatively and
significantly in both cases. Turning to worry about money, union members are less likely
to worry about it than non-members, whether one conditions on income or not (columns
3 and 4).

In Table 9 we use the GUSDTP for the United States to examine the association between
workers' union membership and pain, a fairly unambiguous marker of suffering, and
anger. The questions asked are

Q8. "Did you experience physical pain/anger yesterday?" Yes/No

In contrast to the other ill-being metrics we have presented, union membership is
positively and significantly correlated with pain and anger (columns 1 and 2
respectively). The former may reflect pain induced by the occupations where union
members are often concentrated in the United States, at least traditionally ­ namely blue-
collar manual jobs.

The fact that union members feel more pain and anger than non-members is likely to
affect the way they respond to life and job satisfaction questions, since we would assume
that pain and anger are negatively correlated with well-being. This proves to be the case
as we show in columns 3 and 4 of Table 9: pain and anger are both negatively correlated
with life and job satisfaction. Their introduction to the models substantially increases the
positive coefficient for union membership in the life and job satisfaction equations

  Blanchflower (2020a) uses these ESS life satisfaction and happiness data by country and finds U-shapes
in age also with controls for marital and labor force status and education.

compared to earlier estimates in Table 5 for Cantril's ladder and Table 2 for job
satisfaction. It would appear that, in the absence of pain and anger variables the union
association with well-being is under-estimated. Since pain and anger are variables that
are not common in most social surveys, we might infer that union estimates on wellbeing
based on such surveys are downwardly biased.

2.6     Union Membership and Other Well-being Variables
We now turn in Table 10 to sixteen other measures of well-being in various sweeps of the
ESS. We run OLS equations in every case with the same controls as in column 3 of
Table 6, that is age and its square, gender, native, years of education, self-employment,
plus wave and country dummies. The questions are provided below the table (Q9-Q14)
and we simply report the union coefficient, the T-value and the sample size. The results
are split into four groups and in every case, there are positive and significant union
coefficients.

2.6.1 Panel A: Positive Affect
First, we have 11-step data on nearly 70,000 respondents from sweeps 3, 5 and 6 for
workers on how satisfied they are with their work-life balance. Second, there is a
different 11-step life satisfaction question from sweep 3 that differs from the measure
referred to from Q2 above: the latter refers to "nowadays" whereas the one in row 2 of
Table 10 refers to how well life has turned out "so far'. There are only 22,000
observations here. The outcome variable in row 3 is a 4-step measure referring to
enjoyment of life from sweeps 3, 6 and 7 with a sample of 58,000 and the final outcome
variable in row 4 ­ also a 4-step variable - refers to whether life was calm and peaceful.
In all four cases the union partial correlation is positive and statistically significant.

2.6.2 Panel B: Negative Affect
Data on negative affect is taken from sweeps 3, 6 and 7 of the ESS and has sample sizes
of 58,000. These data files were also examined by Blanchflower (2020b). Here we find
negative and significant union coefficients on a series of variables scored 1 through 4, for
depression, everything being an effort, feeling lonely and feeling sad.

2.6.3 Panel C: Trust
Beginning in the late 1960s Americans began to `join less, trust less, give less, vote less
and schmooze less' (Putnam and Feldstein, 2003, p.4). This decline in trust has been
associated with a decline in unionism. This is illustrated below where we plot the US
unionization rate from www.unionstats.com alongside the trust variable from the General
Social Survey which asks "can people be trusted?" with pre-coded response options "can
trust" or "can't be too careful" and "depends". We simply plot the proportion in the
United States who reply `can trust'. The proportion saying `can trust' has fallen from
46% in 1973 to 32% in 2018 while union density has more than halved.

                % can trust      % membership
1973               46.0            24.0
1980               45.5            23.0
                                            10
1990                 38.1            16.1
2000                 35.2            13.5
2008                 33.0            12.4
2014                 30.8            11.1
2016                 32.0            10.7
2018                 31.6            10.5

It is possible that unions themselves may be victims of a decline in trust in society, but
what is the correlation between being trusting and union membership? In Table 10 we
have data on trust from all nine of the sweeps of the ESS, with sample sizes of around
175,000. Compared with non-members union members have higher levels of trust in
other people as well as in institutions like the police, politicians, political parties and even
the European Parliament.

2.6.4 Macro variables
It turns out that union members in Europe as reported in Table 10 are also more
optimistic than non-members on the state of the economy in their country as well as in
democracy and the overall state of education.

3. Discussion
The negative partial correlation between union membership and job satisfaction has been
one of the chief empirical regularities to come out of labour economics and industrial
relations. It dates back to seminal studies from the late 1970s and early 1980s. In this
paper we present new empirical evidence challenging that regularity. With data for the
United States we show the association between union membership and job satisfaction
switched from negative to positive in the 2000s. Analyses for Europe since the 2000s
confirm this positive association is apparent elsewhere. Furthermore, we find union
membership is positively and significantly associated with a range of other well-being
metrics including life satisfaction, happiness, depression, sadness, trust as well
satisfaction of democracy, education and the overall economy.

The question we are left with is: why?

Union membership offers two benefits: bargaining to secure better terms and conditions,
and insurance against job loss and arbitrary employer unfair behavior. It seems
reasonable to ask whether unions did these `jobs' differently in recent years in a way that
may have affected the wellbeing differential between union and non-union workers, or
whether ­ if they were doing essentially the same job over time ­ that job was valued
differently by union members such that their wellbeing benefited relative to non-union
workers.

First, we checked to see whether the union wage premium had changed over time.
Perhaps higher satisfaction and wellbeing reflected an improvement in the wages of
union members relative to their non-union counterparts? This proves not to be the case.

                                              11
It is true that union members receive a substantial wage premium, but this has not
changed over time.

We examined this by extending work reported in Blanchflower and Bryson (2004) and
estimated, by year, log hourly wage equations to calculate union wage differentials using
earnings data from the 2002-2018 MORG files of the CPS. They had previously used
date for the period 1983-2001. We use the same controls as they did ­ age gender, race,
education, industry and state along with a union status dummy - and excluded individuals
using variable I25d, which identifies those for whom wages were imputed, because of the
rise in the proportion who do not report earnings.

As Blanchflower and Bryson (2004) note this matters as union status was not used in the
imputation equation so not excluding them lowers the wage differential. We found no
evidence of a shift up in wage differentials ­ obtained by taking antilogarithms and
deducting one - and there was constancy over time in the estimates. So we do not think
that the change in the union coefficient in a job satisfaction equation was due directly to
rising union wage differentials. We estimate the union wage premium 1973-2018 in the
United States as follows, in per cent.

Below we report estimates taken from 1973-2001 from Blanchflower and Bryson (2003),
using the May CPS from 1973-1981 and then the MORG CPS files from 1983. There was
no CPS survey with wages and union status in 1982. Our new estimates are from 2002
and show a slight fall over the entire forty-five year period with perhaps a sign of a
further drop in the most recent years. From 1973-2001 the series averaged a differential
of 17.9% versus 14.3% from 2002-2018.

1978         22.8      1988        18.4     1998      15.8     2008      14.1    2018     12.7
1979         16.6      1989        17.8     1999      16.0     2009      14.0
1980         17.7      1990        17.1     2000      13.4     2010      14.5
1981         16.1      1991        16.1     2001      14.1     2011      14.8
                       1992        17.9     2002      14.6     2012      14.7

Second, we turn to survey evidence on job insecurity. In the economics literature this has
two components: the probability of job loss and, conditional on that, the probability of
getting a `like' job (the latter effectively proxying for the cost of job loss) (Nickell et al.,
2002). Fortunately, the GSS contains proxies for both. We find that prior to the Great
Recession union members were more likely than their non-member counterparts to say
they were likely to lose their job in future.
                                              12
This seems to run counter to the proposition that unions offer insurance against job loss,
but it is possible that the response reflects the well-known fact that employment growth is
lower in the union sector (Blanchflower et al., 2001; Bryson, 2004) which, in turn, partly
reflects union bargaining over wages and the fact that unions often inhabit sectors that are
in secular decline. However, what is interesting and directly relevant to this paper, is that
this effect disappeared with the Great Recession: the differential between union members
and non-members vanished. This is apparent in Table 11 which reports on expected job
loss in the GSS using the variable joblose. The question asked is as follows:

Q15. Thinking about the next 12 months, how likely do you think it is that you will lose
your job or be laid off--very likely (=4), fairly likely (=3), not too likely (=2), or not at all
likely (=1)? Our coding is in parentheses.

This extends work reported by Blanchflower and Oswald (1999) using the same variable
and data, for 1978-1996, and controls along with state unemployment rates that were
mapped in. 10 They found that union membership entered positively in an expected job
loss equation. Column 1 finds the same for the longer time run of years from 1978-2018.
The second column includes an interaction between the union membership variable and a
dummy representing 1 if the sample was from 2000-2018, zero otherwise. The union
variable is significantly positive and the interaction term is significantly negative,
showing no impact of unions from 2000 onwards. This is confirmed in columns 3 and 4,
which separates the sample and shows a significant positive effect in the first period and
no union effect in the second. This likely helps to explain the positive coefficient in the
job satisfaction equations: union workers are less fearful of job loss than previously, yet
they continue to receive the substantial wage premium they have always received.

The above result is particularly striking since in the United States we see evidence from
the General Social Surveys in the years since 2010 that there has been a big decline in the
recorded responses on the ability to find an equally good job: it would appear that the
costliness of job loss, as perceived by workers, has been rising, such that they may value
insurance against job loss more over time.

In the second part of Table 11 we now look at how easy it would be for a worker to find a
comparable job, again extending results in Blanchflower and Oswald, 1999 for 1977-
1996 using the GSS. The question asked was as follows

Q16. Jobfind - How easily could you find an equally good job? Not easy (=1), somewhat
easy (=2) or easy (=3).

The table shows that union workers find it less easy to replace their jobs than non-union
workers. The ease of finding a comparable job declines with age and rises with years of
education. Column 2 shows a positive coefficient on the interaction term indicating that

10
     We do not have access to state of residence information so instead include controls for 9 regions.
                                                       13
the gap between members and non-members in terms of the ease with which they could
find a comparable job narrowed after 2000, although the union coefficient in column 4 is
still sizeable, significant and negative, confirming union workers would still find it harder
than their non-union counterparts to find a comparable job. The lack of a significant time
trend in the first period contrasts with a negative and significant one in the second.

Chart 1 provides further intriguing evidence for the United Kingdom indicating that fear
of unemployment is a lead indicator predicting rising unemployment. Workers' fears of
unemployment are subsequently realized, at least in the aggregate. The fear factor was
rising from 1988 through 1993 and from 1997 through 2009 and especially from 2014
even as the unemployment rate fell from 7.2% at the start of 2014 to below 4% from
December 2019 through May 2020. In all three upticks the fear of unemployment started
rising before the unemployment rate rose. For more on the fear of unemployment and its
consequences see Blanchflower (1991) and Blanchflower and Shadforth (2009).

In the last twenty years we have seen a once in a generation financial market shock
followed by a major downturn and then a global pandemic. In the United States even
though the unemployment rate had fallen to record lows by the start of 2020, the
employment rate was well below its level at the start of recession in January 2008 (62.9)
and even further below its level at the start of the 21st Century (January 2000=64.6). It
remained below these levels in January 2020 (61.2) before falling to 55.1 in July 2020.
In both the United States and the United Kingdom and other advanced countries around
the world wage growth was benign, and much lower that it had been historically at these
low levels of unemployment (Blanchflower, 2019). Underemployment, where workers
had too few hours remained above pre-recession levels around the world (Bell and
Blanchflower, 2020). The unemployment rate gave a poor steer on the state of labor
markets at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the spring of 2020. Workers fear
unemployment.

One possibility is that there are cohort effects: those who experience a negative economic
shock ­ such as those living through the 1970s oil shocks ­ adjust their preferences and
attitudes as a result of the shock. 11 Such shocks could result in a reappraisal of the value
of the union good. To examine this possibility we reran the equation in Table 2 column 1
estimating the partial correlation between union membership and job satisfaction in the
Gallup Daily US Tracker, but we did so for eight separate decennial cohorts, the earliest
being those born in 1980 and the latest being born in the 1990s and later.

The results are presented in the table below. We see that the introduction of birth cohorts
does not affect our main result: union membership remains positive and statistically
significant (last row). The overall result extends the column 1 of Table 2 finding, but
adds 7 cohort dummies, with little effect. However, the partial correlation between union
membership and job satisfaction differs by birth cohort even though all of the cohorts had
recently lived through the Great Recession. The 1940 and 1950 birth cohorts who would

11

                                                        14
have made up most of the sample in Freeman and Borjas's studies in the 1970s exhibit a
negative union partial correlation with job satisfaction, but subsequent birth cohorts
exhibit a positive partial correlation. Early birth cohorts who became union members
continued to express greater job dissatisfaction than their non-member counterparts even
in the Gallup data for the period 2009-2013, despite experiencing a couple of deep
recessions, while the union members among more recent birth cohorts had greater job
satisfaction than their non-member counterparts, despite going through the Great
Recession. Cohort effects matter, but they do not relate to the experience of recession, at
least in a direct sense.

effects.

4. Conclusions
The implication of the findings presented here is that, even in the presence of possible job
or sectoral composition differences, that might predispose union members to lose their
jobs, union members no longer perceived such a differential after the Great Recession.
Put differently, union members benefited in relative terms from the downturn in the
economy. This is, in essence, a facet of the counter-cyclical benefits of unionization that
we have pointed to before in terms of wages (Blanchflower and Bryson, 2004) only this
time it relates to job security. What makes this finding particularly important is that
uncertainty and concern about job security was rising over this period, and has remained
high today, not only in the United States but in Europe too. Job security has become a
scarce commodity post-Great Recession (Blanchflower, 2019). In these circumstances
the insurance component of the union good becomes more attractive, especially if one
also continues to receive a union wage premium. This seems likely to continue to be the
case in the light of COVID-19 induced impending recession and mass job loss.

It has usually been assumed that unions do best for their members during a slump and
worse in a boom. Defined benefit plans maintain their values in a slump while defined
contribution funds lose their values. When stock markets are booming defined
contribution plans may well do better. The counter to all of this around the world is the
seemingly inexorable decline in union jobs. But eventually the strongest are left. This is
                                              15
what David Metcalf (1989) called "batting average effects" where the team average rises
as the worst batters are dropped. He argued it occurred where there was an improvement
in productivity from shedding less productive resources.

What do we think may have happened to explain the switch in the partial correlation
between union membership and job satisfaction from negative in the 20th Century to
positive at the beginning of the 21st Century? We make inferences based on our analysis
of the data for the United States since this is the longest series we have available to us.
What we know from that evidence presented here is as follows.

(a) Union members continue to benefit from a very substantial wage premium relative to
their non-member counterparts. It may have fallen a little in recent years but is broadly
flat.

(b) The ease of finding a comparable job if you lose your current job has been falling
since 2000; union members are more likely to say that they would find it hard to find a
comparable job if they lost their current job.

(c) In the past union members were more likely than non-members to say they expected
to lose their job in the future, but this differential disappeared in the 2000s ­ from that
point on there was no difference between members and non-members in their perception
of likely job loss.

(d) Among early birth cohorts ­ those appearing in the data of Freeman and Borjas, union
members expressed greater job dissatisfaction than non-members ­ back in the 1970s and
again today post- Great Recession, whereas today among birth cohorts born more
recently job satisfaction is higher among members than it is among non-members.

Taken together these four facts may help explain why it is that, ceteris paribus, union
members are now more likely than non-members to express job satisfaction. Perhaps this
also spills over into other parts of their lives ­ expressed in their greater life satisfaction,
happiness, and other facets of wellbeing whilst, at the same time, making them less prone
to anxiety and worry, including worry over money.

On many dimensions, relating to work, wellbeing, time trust and macro issues union
members are more satisfied than non-members. We didn't know this before. We
especially didn't know that union status now enters positively in a job satisfaction
equation. We had always believed and had taught our students for decades that,
following Freeman (1979) union members had lower job satisfaction. The findings pose
a challenge to our previous conception of trade unionism and industrial relations. There is
nothing new under the sun. Actually, there is.

The chart reports the answers to the following question. Q9. How do you expect the number of people unemployed in this country to change over the next 12
months? The number will... increase sharply (PP); increase slightly (P); remain the same; fall slightly (M); fall sharply (MM) or don't know. A score is
constructed from the responses as follows: B = (PP + 1/2P) - (1/2M + MM). So, the higher the score the higher unemployment is expected to be. As can be seen
from above the unemployment in the United Kingdom fell sharply from 2010. https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/user-guide-joint-harmonised-eu-programme-
