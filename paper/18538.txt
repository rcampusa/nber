                                           ABSTRACT

We use an RCT to analyze the impacts of microcredit. The study population consists of loan applicants
who were marginally rejected by an MFI in Bosnia. A random subset of these were offered a loan.
We provide evidence of higher self-employment, increases in inventory, a reduction in the incidence
of wage work and an increase in the labor supply of 16-19 year olds in the household’s business. We
also present some evidence of increases in profits and a reduction in consumption and savings. There
is no evidence that the program increased overall household income.

I.      Introduction
A substantial part of the world’s poor has limited, if any, access to formal sources of credit.
Instead, they depend on informal credit from expensive moneylenders or have to borrow from
family and friends (Collins et al. 2009). Such credit rationing may constrain entrepreneur-
ship and keep people trapped in poverty. Microfinance, pioneered by the Bangladeshi Grameen
Bank, aimed to deal with this issue in a sustainable fashion. A key research and policy ques-
tion is whether the availability of credit for the more disadvantaged can reduce poverty.
     We address this question by analyzing the results of an experiment where we randomly
allocated loans (at the individual level) to a subset of applicants considered too risky and
“unreliable” to be offered credit as regular borrowers of a well-established microfinance
institution (MFI) in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Our group is poorer and generally more dis-
advantaged than regular borrowers of the institution. They all applied for a loan but were
subsequently turned down, as the loan officers deemed them of lesser quality than regular
clients. This is an interesting group to analyze if we are to understand whether alleviating
credit constraints can be an effective anti-poverty tool. Moreover, the fact that they are ap-
plicants implies that almost all individuals in the treatment comply (take-up the loan), which
increases the power of the experiment. Indeed, only eight respondents (less than 1.5 percent)
of those selected to receive a loan later refused it. However, the specific focus on marginal
clients may also limit the external validity of our findings. In many cases it may be of interest
to measure the impact of making microfinance available more generally, as in Banerjee et al.
(2013).
  Our paper contributes to a small but expanding literature on the impact of microcredit on
poverty alleviation. Following some initial work based on observational data,1 important
progress towards understanding the impact of microfinance has been made by a number of
randomized controlled trials (RCTs - see the introductory article to this Special Issue) and
by quasi-experimental evidence (Kaboski and Townsend 2011, 2012). The focus of much
of this literature is on the introduction of microcredit in contexts where no formal financial
     1 An early observational study of microcredit is Pitt and Khandker (1998). Their results and analysis are
critically discussed in Morduch (1998) and Morduch and Roodman (2009). See Ghatak and Guinnane (1999)
for an early summary of the theoretical literature and Giné et al. (2010) for experimental evidence on the
mechanisms through which joint liability affects repayment.

institutions existed before. Our paper offers new evidence in two ways. First, we consider
the impact of extending loans to poor individuals in a context where micro-lending is already
well established for individuals with a solid background and good quality collateral. In
this respect our design is similar to that of Karlan and Zinman (2010 and 2011) although
the type of loans they considered was quite different, one being a four-month high-interest
consumption loan (200% APR) in South Africa and the other a four-month business loan
(60% APR) in the Philippines - in our case the loan is supposed to be for business (although
this is not explicitly monitored), interest rate is 22% and the average maturity just over a
year.
    Many of our findings strengthen the evidence found in other contexts: the loans increased
levels of business activity and self-employment. This did not translate into increased house-
hold income in the 14 months of our observation period (possibly because borrowers seem
to substitute out of wage labor). We also find evidence that business profits increased. Those
without savings - mainly the less-educated - reduced consumption while those with a prior
business and some savings ran down their savings. These facts are consistent with invest-
ments being lumpy and with the loans being too small in themselves to start or expand a
business. It seems that households, in anticipation of future returns, used their own resources
to top up the loan to reach an amount of funds that was sufficient to make an investment of a
certain minimum size (see also Karlan, Osman, and Zinman, 2013).
    Finally, our experimental study came at a particularly difficult time, namely at the height
of the 2008-09 financial crisis, which strongly affected Bosnia and Herzegovina.2 After
years of rapid credit expansion, various Bosnian MFIs experienced an increase in non- and
late repayment (Maurer and Pytkowska, 2011). Our paper is one of the first to study the
impact of microcredit on borrowers during an economic downturn and amid widespread
concerns about over-indebtedness. In this environment, we document a high number of
defaults, substantially higher than those of the average regular client pool at the same time.
Indeed the program led to an implicit subsidy of $268 per marginal borrower on average.
   2 There have been some non-experimental studies in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Hartarska and Nadolnyak
(2007) find that access to microcredit has alleviated Bosnian firms’ financing constraints. Demirgüc-Kunt,
Klapper, and Panos (2011) find similar results for financing constraints at the household level. Their findings
suggest that households that received microcredit were more often able to make a successful switch from
informal to viable, formal entrepreneurs over the period 2001-04.


                                                      2
     The paper proceeds as follows. In Section I we describe the loan program and our target
population after which Section II sets out the experimental design. Sections III and IV then
discuss our main results and the financial sustainability of the program. Section V concludes.



II.       The program

A.     Target population

We conducted our field experiment with the collaboration of a large Bosnian MFI established
since in the mid-nineties and a 36,000 client base across the entire country at the time of the
baseline survey. As part of the experiment the loan officers of this MFI extended microcredit
to a poorer, “marginal” segment of the population that they would normally reject, but to
whom they would consider lending if they were to accept slightly more risk. Table A2 in
the Appendix reports some characteristics of marginal clients as collected from a baseline
questionnaire to loan officers. The average marginal applicant did not meet 2.6 out of the
six main requirements of our MFI for regular loans: 77 percent did not possess sufficient
collateral or did not meet one or more of the other requirements, which include an assessment
of the applicant’s character.3 About one in three marginal clients were judged to have a weak
business proposal while loan officers worried about repayment capacity in about a quarter of
the marginal applications (column 1).
     Overall, 28.2 percent of the total sample lived in urban areas, here defined as cities with
more than 50,000 inhabitants. At baseline, 78 percent of all respondents had some income
from self-employment. Of these, 27 percent was engaged in trade, 29 percent in the services
sector, 38 percent in agriculture, and 6 percent in manufacturing.
     We can also compare the average marginal client to the population of Bosnia and Herze-
govina as a whole and to regular first-time clients of our MFI. We do the former by using
the 2010 data from the EBRD/World Bank Life in Transition Survey (LiTS) in which 1,000
Bosnian households were interviewed, a nationally representative sample. LiTS sampled
   3 Of those who did provide collateral, the distribution of collateral types was as follows: house 7 percent;
machinery 4 percent; own salary 19 percent; spouse’s salary 3 percent; family member’s salary/co-signer 62
percent; other 19 percent. More than one type of collateral could be pledged.



                                                      3
two types of respondents. The first is the household head or another household member
with sufficient knowledge about the household. The second (if different from the first) is
the person aged 18 years and over who last had a birthday in the household. We compare
our marginal clients to these latter, randomly sampled persons and constrain the sample to
the same age range we observe for our marginal clients. We find that compared with this
population, the average marginal client is younger and more likely to be male and married.
Relatively many marginal clients completed at most primary education. We also use data
from the MFI’s management information system to compare the marginal clients to regular
first-time borrowers. This shows that marginal clients are younger, less likely to be married,
and have less education. They are also less likely to be employed full-time .


B.    The loan

The loans offered as part of the experiment were similar to our MFI’s regular loan product in
terms of interest rate and maturity. They were individual-liability loans with monthly repay-
ments and no grace period. The loans had an interest rate of 22 percent Annual Percentage
Rate (APR) paid on the declining balance, so that the monthly payments were fixed over
time with an increasing portion of the payment being capital. The rate for regular clients was
21 percent over the same time period. The amounts loaned varied depending on the business
plan and ranged from BAM 300 to BAM 3,000 with a mean of BAM 1,653 which at the
prevailing exchange rate at baseline of US$ 1 to BAM 1.63 this amounts to an average loan
of US$ 1,012and a similar median amount. Our MFI provides some flexibility in terms of
the maturity and size of individual loans. The maturity averaged 57 weeks.
     77 percent of the loans ended up being collateralized. However, as we document in
the last section of the paper, those who offered some collateral and despite that were still
classified as marginal (and thus failed to be part of the regular client pool) were adversely
selected and often ended up having an erratic repayment history. The adverse selection is
explainable based on the subjective evaluation of the loan officers.

III.      The experiment

A.     Experimental design

The experiment started with the research team conducting training sessions with all loan
officers in all branches of our collaborating MFI (which operates across all of Bosnia and
Herzegovina). Our MFI did not use an automated credit-scoring system, but an individual-
ized screening by loan officers. During the training sessions loan officers were instructed on
how to identify clients they would normally reject, but to whom they would consider lending
if they were to accept slightly more risk. For example, it was explained that a loan applicant
could possess insufficient collateral, be less educated or poorer than average, or be perceived
as somewhat more risky for other reasons. The training stressed that marginal clients were
not applicants with a poor credit history, that were over-indebted, or that were expected to
be fraudulent.
     Once all officers were trained, and following a pilot in November 2008 in two branches in
Gradačac and Bijeljina, the experiment was rolled out two months later to all 14 branches of
our MFI.4 Loan officers were now asked to start identifying potential marginal clients from
the population of loan applicants over a period of several months, until the desired sample
size was achieved. The loan officers receive a monthly bonus depending on the performance
of their portfolio. To counteract this disincentive for taking additional risk and to reward
the additional effort needed to identify marginal clients, loan officers received a fee of 10
BAM (~US$6) for each marginal client to whom a loan was disbursed. While one may be
concerned that loan officers would divert regular clients to the marginal group, this concern
is mitigated by the fact that they would not want to take the 50 percent risk of having to
turn down a solid (and possibly repeat) client due to the randomization process. After loan
disbursement loan officers were instructed to monitor regular and marginal clients in the
same way and to the same extent. Importantly, the loan performance influenced their bonus
in the same way, irrespective of the type of client.
     Once a loan officer identified a potential marginal client, and following a short vetting
process by the loan committee, the potential client was told that although he or she would
   4 Figure   A1 in the Appendix displays the geographical distribution of the branches and respondents.

normally not qualify for a loan, our MFI was reviewing its policies and as a result could
offer a 50 percent chance of a loan provided that the applicant would agree to participate
in a survey now and in a year’s time (obviously this conditionality would and could not be
enforced for the second round of data collection). The clients were not asked to sign an
explicit agreement. The loan officer also explained that the MFI would use the results of the
study to decide how best to expand lending to this new client group on a permanent basis,
meaning that marginal clients could continue to borrow as regular ones. Our MFI indeed
continued to lend to many marginal clients that repaid on time during the experiment. Of
all marginal clients 24.4 percent received one or more repeat loans and this percentage is
substantially higher than among the regular clients that received their first loan during the
same period (16.3 per cent).
    This process continued until a total of 1,241 marginal applications were submitted to the
loan committee. In total 1,196 of these marginal loan applicants were approved and inter-
viewed. The interview lasted around 60 minutes and was conducted by a professional survey
company using computer-assisted telephone interviews (CATI). This baseline survey was
conducted after the individual was judged to be eligible for participation in the program but
before the randomization. This ensured that responses were not correlated with the random-
ization outcome. We ensured that respondents were aware that their answers would in no
way influence the probability of receiving a loan.
    At the end of each week, the research team in London would use a random number
generator to allocate newly interviewed applicants with a 50 percent probability to either the
treatment (receiving a loan) or the control group (no loan).5 Successful applicants received
the loan within a week. Applicants allocated to the control group did not receive a loan from
our MFI for the duration of the study. The last interview and loan disbursal took place in May
2009. During February-July 2010, 14 months after the baseline survey, all RCT participants
- both those who received a loan and those who did not - were called back and invited to be
   5 The chance of obtaining a loan was slightly higher than 50 per cent (ex post 52.8 percent) as we allocated
randomly to the treatment group either half of each weekly batch containing an even number of applicants
(N/2) or (N+1)/2 in all odd-numbered batches. For example, if at the time of a weekly randomization round
11 marginal clients had been interviewed, six would be randomly allocated to the treatment group and the rest
to the control group. Alternatively, we could have just applied a 50 percent chance on each applicant, but we
wanted to avoid occasional batches with too many rejections.



                                                      6
re-interviewed. We returned to those who declined and offered them an incentive (a mobile
phone SIM card). This further improved the final response rate.
   While the design, implementation and evaluation of the experiment was done as care-
fully as possible there are inevitably certain issues that we need to keep in mind. First, the
attrition rate is 17 percent with a ten percentage point difference between the control and
the treatment group. We show, however, that the sample remains balanced post-attrition.
Below, we provide an in depth analysis of attrition in our sample and its possible impact
on the balanced nature of our dataset. Second, the participants in our RCT were all well
aware that they were part of a study and that the MFI would normally have rejected them.
This may raise some concerns about the external validity of our findings as well as about
the possibility of Hawthorne and/or John Henry effects. While we cannot completely rule
out such effects, we think they are unlikely to have introduced a strong bias as it was made
clear ex ante that, depending on the results of the study, our partner institution would expand
its lending to marginal borrowers in the future. Moreover, we limited possible reporting bi-
ases by undertaking the baseline survey before the randomization decision and by hiring a
completely independent survey company that was not linked to our partner MFI. Before the
interviews took place, it was also made clear to the respondents that their answers would in
no way influence the probability of receiving credit now or in the future.
   Third, the sample size should ideally have been larger as we test multiple hypotheses and
the individual test sizes need to be adjusted for this.
   Finally, our design focuses on applicants that were originally rejected for a loan. While
this has the advantage of excellent compliance rates and a focus on poorer individuals, it
may limit external validity. . The rationale for this design was that there was already a well
established microfinance system for higher quality borrowers in place in Bosnia at the time
of the start of our RCT. The research question therefore focused on the impact of expanding
this system to poorer people who did not have easy access to formal sources of credit. We
try and give as much information as possible on our borrowers to facilitate comparisons with
other contexts.




                                                7
B.     Treatment-control balance

We collected detailed data during the baseline and follow-up interview rounds on the appli-
cant’s household structure, entrepreneurial activities and other sources of income, household
consumption and savings, asset ownership, outstanding debt, exposure to shocks, and stress
levels. As the allocation of marginal applicants into the treatment and the control group was
random, we expect no systematic differences between both groups at the time of the baseline
survey. To check whether this is indeed the case, Table 1 presents summary statistics for
the main characteristics of the marginal clients and their households. For each variable we
present the baseline mean for the control group (in the post-attrition sample) as well as the
difference in means between the control and treatment group (with a p-value for a t-test of
equality of these means in the last column).
     Table 1 indicates that there are no statistically significant differences between the two
groups except a small (0.16) difference in the number of household members. When we
conduct a joint significance test for treatment-control balance based on a large set of vari-
ables together we find a p-value of 62 percent. Thus there is no systematic overall difference
between the two groups and no evidence of imbalance. Unreported Kolmogorov-Smirnov
(KS) tests to compare the baseline distribution of continuous variables in the treatment with
those in the control group also suggest orthogonality between observable variables and treat-
ment status.
     Almost 60 percent of the (potential) marginal clients are male and their average age is 37
years. The average respondent worked 49 hours a week, of which 33 hours were spent in a
small-scale business. A third of the marginal clients only attended primary school while five
percent of the sample went to university. We also show information on household income
of the marginal clients. The average income was BAM 18,000 (US$ 11,006) in the year
prior to the baseline survey, of which on average 7,453 (US$ 4,031) was earned through
self-employment and BAM 369 (US$ 182) as wages from agricultural activities. The sample
also appears balanced in terms of where respondents are located. The average distance to the
nearest city is about 54 kilometers in both the treatment and control groups (see also Figure
A1 in the Appendix).

     Table 1 also gives information on the debt that marginal clients had outstanding at the
time of the baseline survey. On average marginal clients had fewer than one loan outstanding
(43 percent had no loan outstanding and 42 percent one loan). While this indicates that
our sample had not been completely cut-off from borrowing in the past, we note that in
comparison to the typical microfinance borrower in Bosnia and Herzegovina the number of
loans is very low. Maurer and Pytkowska (2010) in a random sample of 887 microcredit
borrowers in Bosnia and Herzegovina at the same time as our study found that 58 percent
had more than one active credit contract, the average was 2.021 per client, and the maximum
number of loans was 14.


C.     Attrition

In total, 1,241 respondents were selected to participate. After refusals or lack of availability
we were left with 1,196 individuals at baseline. Of these 995 were re-interviewed at follow-
up, representing an attrition rate of 17 percent. Table A3 in the Appendix provides details
on the targeted and actual number of interviews at baseline and follow-up. To reduce attri-
tion, interviewers were trained to encourage participation and the survey company sent all
participants a reminder letter at the start of the follow-up survey, also announcing a raffle
for all who completed the survey in which a laptop and several iPods could be won. People
who nevertheless initially declined were called back later by a senior interviewer, asked once
more to participate, and also offered a EUR 10 phone card, corresponding to 54 percent of
average daily earnings.
     In the end, the response rate among the control group was about ten percentage points
lower than in the treatment group (Table 1). Importantly, however, when we analyze the
observed baseline characteristics of only those who were surveyed at follow-up, we find that
these characteristics are still balanced between the treatment and control group. We also
checked that pre-treatment characteristics are balanced across treatment and control groups
in the sub-samples defined by business ownership at baseline, high versus low education
level, and gender of the respondent. There is also no significant difference in repayment
performance (loan default) between those who responded in the follow-up survey and those



                                              10
who did not (p-value is 0.22). Appendix Table A4 presents regressions where an attrition
dummy was regressed on treatment status, various standard respondent covariates, as well
as ‘soft’ respondent characteristics (summarized in Appendix Table A9) as observed by the
loan officer. A test of joint significance shows that these covariates are not jointly correlated
with attrition status.
    In Table A5 we re-estimate the regressions for our main impacts using the DiNardo,
Fortin and Lemieux (1996) approach where we re-weigh the data using the inverse of the
propensity to be included in the follow-up survey. The statistical and economic significance
of all results remains unchanged.
    Lastly, in Table A6 we check how those who dropped out of our sample and those reinter-
viewed compare along observable characteristics and whether the differences correlate with
treatment status. This analysis shows that those who were lost from the sample are very sim-
ilar to those who remain; this also holds in both the treatment group and the control group
separately. We do find, however, that those lost from the sample have slightly more children
younger than 16 and that the number of outstanding loans at baseline was somewhat higher
among them (though only in the control group).
    All in all, we conclude that attrition is unlikely to have undermined the balance between
treatment and control and introduced bias in the reported results.



IV.     Estimation approach and inference
We estimate the treatment effects of the program by regressing the outcome variables on
the treatment indicator and baseline characteristics (so as to improve precision). Baseline
covariates included in all regressions are gender, age, marital status of the respondent (the
marginal applicant), and information on the household composition (number of children in
the age range 0-5, 6-10, 11-16, number of household members that are: female, employed,
in school, retired). When we also include week of randomization dummies (since random-
ization was stratified by week) all our results go through in terms of both economic and
statistical significance. Appendix Table A1 contains all variable definitions.
    We present standard errors that are robust to heteroskedasticity. Since we are testing


                                               11
multiple hypotheses at once we compute levels of significance for each coefficient using the
step-down approach of Romano and Wolf (2005). To quote Romano and Wolf (2005) “...we
account for data mining [by] (asymptotic) control of the familywise error rate (FWE). The
FWE is defined as the probability of incorrectly identifying at least one...” coefficient as
significant. Thus our approach is to control for a FWE of 1, 5 and 10 percent and mark
each coefficient that is significant at each of these rates. The standard errors allow for the
construction of confidence intervals. These will often exclude zeros (at 95 or 90 percent
confidence), while at the same time the step-down p-value will be higher than 10 percent.
Testing too many hypotheses at once may reduce power to detect anything significant. We
thus test multiple hypotheses in related groups rather than for all effects reported in the paper.
Moreover, we report joint tests that all effects and groups of effects we look at are jointly
significant, based on a c 2 -type test the distribution of which is simulated using the bootstrap.



V.     Results
Below we present results on outcomes split in thematic parts. Based on the c 2 -type test,
the effects we present are jointly significant with a p-value of zero. This is true even if we
exclude from the test the impact of the experiment on loan availability. The experiment
therefore did change the outcomes we focus on.


A.     The intervention and access to liquidity

As we show in Table 1 the loan applicants did have access to some finance before we inter-
viewed them at baseline. Applicants had on average 0.8 loans outstanding with and average
value of BAM 4,125 in the control group. This compares to two or more loans for the av-
erage microborrower. As a result of the intervention all applicants who were randomized in
obtained a loan with an average maturity of 57 weeks. The median and average loan amount
were BAM 1,500 and BAM 1,653, respectively.
     Those randomized out were excluded from borrowing from our MFI, but could apply
elsewhere. The data does not contain a complete history of loan activity. However, as can be
seen in Table 2, at follow up the treatment group was 20 percentage points (pp) more likely to

                                               12
have an outstanding loan (st. error 2.6 pp) and 44 pp more likely to have a loan outstanding
from an MFI (st. error 2.9 pp). The excess outstanding loans for the treatment group is an
indicator of better access to liquidity and can arise because the treatment group would have
been able to raise more funding and/or for longer maturities. These results are consistent
with the controls having less access to finance, because they were turned down by other
sources and/or given loans with a much shorter maturity. We conclude that the treatment
group did indeed have significantly better access to liquidity than the control group.

B.          Impact on self-employment and income

Table 3 summarizes the impacts of credit on business creation and operation. Here the main
outcomes are asset value, ownership of inventory, profit of the respondent’s main business,
whether the person owns a business and whether the household receives income from any
self-employment activities. The entire set of outcomes reported in this table have a joint
p-value of 0.7 percent making them jointly significant.
      Households offered a loan are 6 pp more likely to receive income from self-employment
and 6 pp more likely to own a business - business ownership at baseline was 51 per cent. The
incidence of inventory holding goes up by a similar percentage: at follow-up treated respon-
dents are 5 pp more likely to hold inventory compared to the control group.6 Individually
     6 In   the control group at follow-up, inventory is held by 58 percent of the small-scale businesses in trade, 14


                                                                     13
these effects are significant at either the 5 or the 10 percent level. However, once we allow
for multiple testing for the set of results reported in this table the only significant effect (at
10%) is ownership of inventory. We also found no significant differences between those who
had high versus low education at baseline, or those who did and did not own a business at
baseline.
    The table does not show any significant impact on profits (by any criterion). An issue is
whether 14 months is too soon after the loan disbursement to see any outcomes on profits.
So in a survey of loan officers that we undertook in 2013 we asked: “When people start a
new business, it may take some time before they generate revenues and make a profit. How
long do you think it takes your first-time borrowers on average to start generating revenues”.
The median answers for varying sectors were well within our observation period: agriculture
5.5 months; trade 2 months; manufacturing 3 months. Looking further into this result, we
found that six outlying observations had a very large impact on our estimates of the effects
of the program on profit from the main business of the respondent. So when we trim the top
1 percent of profits, the effect becomes 858.9 (st. error 405.3) as shown in Table A7 in the
Appendix.7 In that table we also present the results of quantile regressions which confirm
that for the higher quantiles there are individually significant positive impacts of access to
credit on firm profitability.
    The loans were intended for business use but our MFI did not apply sanctions of any sort
if the loans were used for consumption (in part or in full). So it is interesting to measure
the impact on profits for those declaring an intention at baseline to use them for business.
Of course, as Karlan, Osman and Zinman (2013) point out, using survey data to measure
(intended) loan use can be problematic due to biases resulting from strategic reporting. This
caveat apart, for those with an intended business use the overall effect on profits is 1,113 (se
581.4). For this subsample trimming has little effect on the coefficient estimate, but it does
make it more precise (1,137 with a standard error of 430.5 - see Table A7 for details).
    In Table 4 we consider the impact on various sources of income - whether such sources
are present and how they were affected by the loan (with zeros if they are not present).
percent in services, 12 percent in agriculture, and 40 percent in production.
    7 In Table A10 in the Appendix, we also provide trimmed results for all other monetary variable outcomes

as an additional robustness test.

The incidence of any self-employment income for the household increases by 6 percentage
points, while the incidence of wage income declines by 8 pp, both effects being individ-
ually significant (but only the latter is significant at the 5 percent level once we allow for
multiple hypothesis testing). These results therefore suggest a change in activity towards
self-employment and away from wage work.8 Indeed, in the next sub-section we describe an
equivalent shift in hours worked away from “Other activities” (which includes wage labor)
and towards work in the own household business.
       The resulting magnitude of the changes in these income sources is not precisely esti-
mated. The amount of welfare benefits declines by 167 BAM, which may reflect that those
borrowers who set up profitable businesses may no longer be eligible for means-tested ben-
efits. However, once we allow for multiple-hypothesis testing this effect is no longer signifi-
cant at conventional levels.9
   8 Crepon et al. (2014) find a similar effect in their Moroccan experiment.
   9 The main social transfers in Bosnia relate to child-care allowance, social assistance, and veterans-related
benefits. Only the latter category is not means tested.

C.     Impact on hours worked

Table 5 displays the estimated impact on labor supply. Columns 1-3 look at hours worked by
all household members aged 16-64 while columns 4-6 focus on teens aged 16-19. The upper
part of the table shows impacts at the aggregate household level, while the lower panel gives
impacts on the average number of hours worked by household members of the specified age
range. At baseline (not shown in the table) a household member of working age worked on
average 37 hours per week of which 19 were spent on the household business. All outcome
measures include zeros for households that have no household members of the specified age
range as well as zero working hours for those who do not work.
     We find no overall effect on hours worked (column 1), possibly because starting up a
business substituted for other work activities. Indeed, the hours worked in the business
increased by 3.8 (s.e. 3) and the hours spent on other activities decreased by 4.3 hours (se
2.5). Perhaps the most interesting result in this table is that the labor supply of teens (16-
19) on the business increases significantly overall and is larger for the children of lower
education borrowers, where the increase is 1.1 hours (se 0.52). Conditioning on households
with children in that age group we get about 4 hours extra per week (not in the table). When
adjusting for multiple hypothesis testing the impact on working in the business for 16-19
year olds is significant at the 10 percent level. Note however, that the overall labor supply of
16-19 year olds does not seem to have increased significantly.


D.     Impact on consumption and savings

Consumption is a particularly interesting outcome to consider. While in the long run con-
sumption should go up if access to microcredit successfully improves standards of living,
in the shorter run it can go either way. If the loan and the opportunity for entrepreneurial
activity increases permanent income, consumption can increase within the observation win-
dow if the household can borrow sufficiently or if the returns accrue fast enough. However,
this argument is no longer necessarily valid for households who decide to invest the entire
amount and who are facing minimum investment amounts (such as start-up costs). These
households may need to reduce consumption and/or accumulated savings if the loan amount

is insufficient to cover the required capital and they are liquidity constrained. In other words,
the household will crowd-in resources by running down other assets and/or reducing con-
sumption to take advantage of a now feasible investment opportunity.
    It is not straightforward to check whether the actual investments were lumpy. We know
that 24 percent of loans were used for purchasing livestock. Another 14 percent of the clients
used the loan mainly for other agricultural investments such as buying seed and fertilizer
(which clearly is not lumpy). However, based on intended use at baseline, 28 percent of the
clients planned to invest in a new business, which may well require minimum amounts for
viability. On average these applicants planned to invest more than 90 per cent of the loan
amount into that business. Three out of four respondents even stated that they would invest
at least the full loan amount. This indicates that many of the investments may have been
lumpy. For more details see Appendix Table A8.
    Households that still do not invest (but do take up the loan) or who are able to make
only marginal investments will increase their consumption. Such a mechanism is in line
with a structural model of household decisions proposed by Kaboski and Townsend (2011)
where households face borrowing constraints, income uncertainty, and high-yield indivisible
investment opportunities.
    Table 6 summarizes the estimated impacts on consumption and savings and a home
durable goods index. The first column shows that annual per capita consumption was BAM
648 lower in the treatment compared to the control group, which amounts to 15 percent of the
follow-up consumption of the controls. This measure includes food (inside and outside of the
home), other non-durables (such as rent, bills, clothes, and recreation) and durables (large,
infrequent purchases which here include educational expenses, the purchase of vehicles, and
vacations).10 For individual commodities we find that food consumption declined among
the lower-educated (not shown) by approximately BAM 18 (US$ 13) a week, which equals
15 percent of the household’s food consumption at followup. This negative impact differs
significantly from the equivalent effect on the higher educated (p-value: 0.02). We find no
  10 Food  expenditures were collected over a recall period of a week, other non-durables over a month, and
durables over a year. To calculate aggregate spending we assume that the week and month about which the
household was asked were representative for the year. This assumption does not introduce bias to the impact
analysis (as we compare treatment and control groups over the same period) but does play a role when we put
the value of expenditures in context, for instance by comparing them to income.


                                                    19
significant effects on consumption for the higher educated households.
   As in Banerjee et al. (2013) and Banerjee and Mullainathan (2010) there is a reduction
in the consumption of temptation goods, which is individually significant at the 10 percent
level: at baseline the expenditure for these goods was on average 9 percent of total consump-
tion expenditures. At the time of the follow-up survey, treated marginal clients spent about
16 percent less on alcohol and cigarettes than the control group due to the loan.
   If investments are lumpy, households may be saving up towards a required amount for
investment and appear not to be liquidity constrained. When a loan becomes available, a
profitable investment may become feasible when the loan is combined with household sav-
ings. Hence, exactly as with consumption we may also observe a decline in savings as a
result of the loan availability. In line with this, we find that households reduce the amount
of their financial savings compared with the control group. This effect on savings is concen-
trated among those with businesses and higher education at baseline, who had the highest
savings to begin with (difference in impacts significant at the 1 percent level). On average,
borrowers at the time of the follow-up survey had savings that were 36 percent lower than
those of the control group. We similarly find that households reduce their home durable
goods as evident from column 8.
   Many of these effects have t-statistics above 1.96 (5 percent significance) or above 1.6 (10
percent significance) but none of them is significant at the 10 percent level if we account for
multiple-hypothesis testing using the step-down procedure. However, based on a joint c 2 -
type test, the total set of treatment effects reported in this table has a p-value of 1.6 percent.
Separately, the change in consumption, durables and savings (which are also included in the
main set of effects for the purposes of testing) are jointly significant with a p-value of 0.1
percent.
   In interpreting these point estimates we may be concerned they reflect difficulties with
loan servicing for investments that did not work out. In fact most households had paid-off
the initial MFI loan by the time of the second interview and the measure of non-durable
consumption covered the month before the interview. This suggests that the effects on non-
durable consumption were most likely not only due to loan servicing (unless struggling
borrowers took out follow-up loans to repay initial loans). Carrying out a simple back of


                                               20
the envelope calculation (suggested by a referee) we see that loan servicing corresponds to
approximately the income raised by the program. Specifically, suppose we take the loans
outstanding at the time of the follow-up interview (1.487 for the treatment and 1.068 for the
control) when consumption and savings are measured. With an average loan amount of BAM
1,653 and a 22 percent annual interest rate, this corresponds roughly to an annual amount
that the treated and the controls had to repay of BAM 3,019 and BAM 2,154, respectively.
The difference (BAM 865) is very close to the additional income generated by the businesses
of the treated (BAM 859 in our preferred, trimmed specification).
     Moreover, from a simple descriptive analysis it seems that the decline in consumption
is not only driven by households who had difficulties repaying. In particular, when we es-
timate the effect on consumption by excluding households who had payment difficulties,
the estimated coefficients and their standard errors only change marginally. Of course this
is far from conclusive because this is a highly selected group based on post-randomization
realizations. Thus it seems that while the loan relaxed liquidity constraints, households still
had to find additional resources to be able to invest the minimum amount of capital that was
needed. This interpretation of our findings is also backed up by more anecdotal evidence
based on a survey that we carried out in 2013 among the loan officers of our partner MFI.
These data show that loan officers estimate that loans to first-time borrowers cover the full
intended investment in only 65 per cent of the cases. According to the officers, additional
resources are typically drawn from own savings, followed by loans from other institutions.


E.     Social impacts

Turning to Table 7 we now consider the effect of the program on schooling of children
and stress levels. We also look at whether the proportion of 16-19 year olds living in the
household was affected by the program, since this could lead to composition effects in the
impact of schooling for this group.
     The loan could encourage schooling by alleviating liquidity constraints. Alternatively,
it may lead to less schooling if the family prefers family labor to hiring external labor (say
because of monitoring or regulatory costs) and the returns to schooling are not perceived as

high enough. We find no impact on the schooling of children below 16, when schooling is
compulsory and an 8.9 pp point decline (se 5.4 pp) for the 16-19 year olds.11 While this
decline is individually significant at the 10% level it is not significant when adjusting for
multiple hypotheses testing. Finally, we find no impact on the number of 16-19 year olds
living in the household, which could have caused a composition effect, distorting the impact
of microfinance on schooling.
    Finally, we also estimate the impact of access to credit on a summary measure of per-
ceived stress which is based on the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), a set of ten questions that
capture how unpredictable, uncontrollable, and overloaded respondents find their lives (col-
umn 3).12 Our measure of stress aggregates the answers to the ten questions and this measure
ranges between zero (“Not stressed”) and 40 (“Extremely stressed”). Interestingly, we find
no significant impact of access to credit on stress levels notwithstanding the high levels of
non-repayment (this also holds for sub-samples of higher and lower-educated respondents.
Results not shown). We also looked at two further measures of “discomfort”. We ask the
respondent whether (s)he agrees, disagrees, or is neutral to the statements “I am in control
of my business and it does not control me” and “I think it would be easier for me to be an
employee of another business”. We find again no effect of access to credit on the probability
of agreeing to either of these two statements (unreported).

  11 We   note for the benefit of future research that when we consider the sample of low educated borrowers we
find a decline in schooling for 16-19 year olds of 0.19 (se 0.084). This effect although individually significant
is no longer so when we adjust for multiple hypotheses testing.
   12 For example, one question is “In the last month, how often have you been upset because of something that

happened unexpectedly?". Answers to each question range between zero (“Never”) and four (“Very often”).

VI.        Subsidized lending or sustainable expansion of loans?
To assess the profitability of the marginal lending program we compare all loans disbursed
to marginal clients between December 2008 and May 2009 and due by June 2012 to those of
regular borrowers over the same period in Table 8. One should keep in mind that Bosnia and
Herzegovina went through an economic crisis at the time of the experiment and it is therefore
important to compare the profitability of our experimental borrowers with the benchmark of
regular clients of our MFI. Since the results are almost identical for men and women (an
interesting result in itself) we only list the totals.
    It becomes clear that the new marginal client group performed significantly worse than
either first-time or all regular clients of our MFI. In particular, late payment (column 4) is
1.5 times as high among marginal clients compared with regular first-time clients (46 versus
31 percent). In the end non-repayment (column 5) among the marginal clients is even three
times as high compared with regular clients (26 versus 9 percent). The last column reports
the internal rate of return: while for regular borrowers this is 13-14 percent, for the marginal
borrowers it is minus 11 percent implying losses for the MFI (the IRR is always negative
regardless of the discount rate that we apply).13 Thus, despite a 22 percent annual interest
rate charged on these loans, the lending program was not profitable.

 Notes: This table compares the marginal borrowers with all regular borrowers of our partner MFI during the same lending period. Column 4
 shows the percentage of borrowers that was at least once late with repayments. Column 5 shows the percentage of loans that were not repaid
 and had to be written off. Column 6 shows the percentage of repaid loans. Column 7 gives the internal rate of return (IRR) on lending to the
 three groups. The IRR is the discount rate at which the net present value of all negative cash flows (disbursed loans) equals the NPV of the
 positive cash flows (repayments plus interest and fees). BAM: Bosnia and Herzegovina convertible mark. Exchange rate at baseline: USD 1 to
 BAM 1.634.



    If we add up the total amount of loans never paid back by the marginal borrowers, as
well as the foregone interest on these loans, and then divide this amount by the total number
  13 Our MFI receives concessional funding from various NGOs and development institutions. The average
concessional funding rate is just under 40 percent of the costs of its commercial funding.


                                                                 24
of marginal borrowers, we arrive at an implicit subsidy by our MFI to the average marginal
borrower of 387 BAM (US$ 268). This corresponds to approximately one fourth of the
average loan amount extended to marginal borrowers. Whether a subsidy of this magnitude
can be recovered by future loans to the clients who were revealed to be high quality is an
important question that only follow up data can reveal (the data so far suggest that repeat
lending is indeed higher among the well-behaved marginal borrowers compared to regular
borrowers). This would complete the answer as to whether such a loss-making intervention
can be sustained without public-sector funding.
   To get a better understanding of why marginal borrowers perform worse, we ran a set
of probit regressions on a sample that contains both the regular and marginal clients. The
dependent variable is a Default indicator. The key finding is that the excess default rate of
marginal borrowers (at about 16-17 pp) cannot be explained away by observable character-
istics such as age, gender, marital and economic status.
   In Table 9 we explore the correlation of two measures of default (‘ever late’ with a repay-
ment and actual loan default) with observable characteristics and the information collected
and assessed by the loan officer. This is all within the sample of the marginal borrowers. In
columns 1 and 3 we only include regressors that indicate whether a loan officer thought that
an applicant satisfied our MFI’s standard requirements in terms of collateral and repayment
capacity while in columns 2 and 4 we also add loan officers’ judgments of various character
traits of the marginal clients. All four specifications also control for the timing of the loan
disbursement (the number of days between the start of the experiment and disbursement);
loan maturity; loan size; and a set of standard covariates and branch fixed effects.
   We find a weak but positive association between compliance with our MFI’s collateral
requirement and late payment though not with actual default. The coefficient declines once
we add the various soft client characteristics. The positive correlation suggests that to be a
marginal client despite having collateral reveals other strong negative characteristics relating
to repayment capacity. However, the loan officers seem to understand the actual quality of
the applicant since the effect is explained away by their own assessment. In particular, those
loan applicants that were rated highly by loan officers on competency and trustworthiness
show significantly lower rates of late payment and even default. All this suggests that the


                                              25
loan officers had good reason to classify our target population as marginal. It also raises
the issue of whether formal and simple credit scoring can get round adverse selection as
effectively as the loan officers were able to (given the incentive structure they face, where
their remuneration depends on the performance of their portfolio).

VII.      Discussion and conclusion
We designed an experiment to evaluate the impact of extending microfinance to marginally
rejected individuals in Bosnia, where microfinance loans were already well established. The
key hypothesis we intended to test is whether this excluded and relatively poor population
could benefit from access to loans by exploiting profitable business opportunities.

                                                               26
   The results show an increase in self-employment activity, business ownership, inventories
and a shift away from wage work. The results on business profits are mixed. In the whole
sample the effect of profits is not significant. But once we trim out the top 1 percent of
observations the impact is positive and significant. Furthermore, using quantile regression
we find that the effect is driven by impacts at the top of the distribution of profits.
   Our evidence also shows a decline in consumption and of savings (including household
durables). We interpret this as implying that households need to make lumpy investments
and that they use their own funds to match those available from the loan to achieve their goal.
Interestingly, the consumption of alcohol and tobacco also declines, as observed elsewhere
in the literature. We note, however, that we cannot rule out that part of the reduction in
savings and consumption is driven by households that are still repaying their debt. Finally,
we observe a significant increase in the labor supply of 16-19 year olds who work more in
the household business.
   Liquidity constraints may not be the only impediment to income growth. Training that
allows better identification of business opportunities and possibly better management may
also be crucial elements of a policy that encourages the poor into successful self-employment
(see Bruhn, Karlan, and Schoar (2010) for a discussion). This point is underscored by the
fact that the microloan program for this group was loss making and led to an implicit subsidy
of $268 per household. This contrasts with the much better performance of loans extended
to non-marginal clients of the same MFI over the same time period. Indeed such an implicit
subsidy may distort the selection into self-employment and away from other potentially more
productivity activities.

Appendix - Characteristics of marginal clients

When identifying marginal clients loan officers followed our MFI’s regular screening proce-
dures as closely as possible. Since the decision on whether a loan applicant was marginal or
not was not based on a credit-scoring system but on the loan officers’ judgment, we asked
loan officers to fill in a questionnaire about each marginal client. This questionnaire elicited
a number of both objective and subjective assessments in order to help us better understand
the composition of our population.
   First, loan officers had to indicate whether they thought that the client conformed with our
MFI’s requirements regarding the amount of available collateral, repayment capacity (based
on estimated cash flows), the client’s overall creditworthiness, his or her business capacity,
and finally the client’s credit history (if any). We find that the average marginal applicant did
not meet 2.6 out of six main requirements of our MFI. Table A2 shows that most marginal
credit applicants were considered marginal because they did not possess sufficient collateral
(77 percent) or did not meet one or more of the ‘other’ requirements, which include an
assessment of the applicant’s character. About one in three marginal clients were judged
to have a weak business proposal while loan officers worried about repayment capacity in
about a quarter of the marginal applications. Loan officers were also asked which aspects of a
potential marginal client they thought were most and least worrisome. The last two columns
of Table A2 show that (a lack of) collateral was seen as most worrisome. On the other
hand, loan officers report to be least concerned about credit history, which is less relevant for
first-time borrowers, or the client’s repayment and business capacity.
   Second, because the loan officer’s view of the applicant’s character also feeds into the
decision to provide a loan or not, we asked loan officers to rate a number of personality
traits on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 representing total agreement and 5 total disagreement). These
traits included whether they perceived the marginal client to be competent, reliable, aggres-
sive, trustworthy, etc. Table A9 shows descriptive statistics for a summary indicator where
agreement (‘totally agree’ and ‘agree’) is coded as one and disagreement (‘somewhat agree’,
‘disagree’, and ‘totally disagree’) as zero. The biggest ‘gaps’ are perceived to be in the

                                               30
applicants’ knowledge (almost 50 percent are not perceived as knowledgeable) and their
integration into society (more than 50 percent are not seen as well integrated).
   We also asked loan officers whether each of these character traits would influence the
prospective client’s business success. Column 2 indicates, for instance, that if a marginal
client was perceived to be insecure, loan officers typically believed this insecurity would
have an impact on the client’s business. Likewise, if a client was characterized as a risk-taker,
then loan officers thought in about 70 percent of the cases that this trait would influence the
success of the business. Interestingly, however, loan officers thought that their own ex ante
judgment of an applicant’s ‘competence’ and ‘trustworthiness’ would not matter much for
subsequent business risk. Yet, in Table 9 we show that these two traits were in fact important
predictors of loan default.

Notes: Data source: Endline household survey. Coefficients and robust standard errors (in parentheses) from an OLS regression of the variable
on a treatment dummy, controlling for covariates as in Table 2. The table shows the estimated impact on business revenues, expenses, and
profits (in BAM) for the full sample (Panel A) and for a sample where values higher than the 99th percentile are trimmed (Panel B). Panel
A also shows coefficient estimates for the 70th, 80th, and 90th quantile regression. Both panels also show separate results for borrowers that
indicated at baseline that they would use credit partly for consumption and those that intended to use the full loan amount for business purposes.
Table A1 in the Appendix contains all variable definitions. BAM: Bosnia and Herzegovina convertible mark. The exchange rate at baseline
was USD 1 to BAM 1.634. ***, **, * indicate significance at 1, 5, and 10%.
