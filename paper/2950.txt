                                  ABSTRACT



     This   paper deals with three important issues related to real exchange

rates. First, it discusses the analytical concept of real exchange rate

(RER) placing particular emphasis on providing an operational definition for

the equilibrium real exchange rate. Of course, once this concept is defined

we can begin to discuss in a meaningful way what we mean by real exchange

rate misalignment, or deviations of the actual RER from its equilibrium

value. Second, this paper deals with problems associated with measuring

real exchange rates. Several proposals are analyzed and the more serious

problems encountered when attempting to compute RER's in the developing

countries are discussed. And third, I analyze the actual behavior of RER's

in a number of developing countries. Here, issues related to the behavior

of alternative indexes and to the statistical properties of real exchange

rates are emphasized. Additionally, I study the real consequences of

increased real exchange rate volatility.

 1. Introduction

      The exchange rate has been at the center of recent economic debates

 regarding developing countries. For example, Cline (1989) has argued that

 the inappropriate exchange rate policies pursued by a number of developing

 countries in the late 1970s contributed in an important way to the current

 international debt crisis. Other authors have argued that the maintenance

 of overvalued exchange rates in Africa for a prolonged period have resulted

 in the dramatic deterioration observed in that continent's
                                                               agricultural
 sector and external position (Gulhati et al., 1985). Still other experts

 (i.e., Corbo et al., 1986) have postulated that it was the failure    to

 sustain an adequate exchange rate policy that triggered the    collapse of the

Southern Cone (Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay) experiments with economic

reform and free market policies. Moreover, some authors have argued that

the economic success of countries like Indonesia, Korea, Thailand and

Colombia is to a large extent attributable to the fact that these countries

have pursued realistic and appropriate exchange rate policies (Dervis and

Petri, 1987).

     There is little doubt that during the last 15 years or so, the real

exchange rate has claimed a crucial role in the economic literature devoted

to economic performance and policies in developing countries.     One of the

most important of these exchange rate-related problems has to do with

defining whether a country's real exchange rate is overvalued, or out of

line with its long run equilibrium value. A second important problem refers

to how real exchange rates should be measured. Here there are remarkable

disagreements, with different people arguing in favor or against the use of

particular indexes.

        The purpose of this paper is threefold: first, it discusses the

analytical concept of real exchange rate (RER) placing particular emphasis on

providing an operational definition for the equilibrium real exchange rate.

Of course, once this concept is defined we can begin to discuss in a

meaningful way what we mean by real exchange rate misalignment, or deviations

of the actual RER from its equilibrium value. Second, this paper deals with

problems associated with measuring real exchange rates, Several proposals

are analyzed and the more serious problems encountered when attempting to

compute RERs in the developing countries are discussed. And third, I

analyze the actual behavior of RER's in a number of developing countries.

Here, issues related to the behavior of alternative indexes and to the

statistical properties of real exchange rates are emphasized. Additionally,

I study the real consequences of increased real exchange rate volatility.1


2. Equilibrium and Disequilibrium Real Exchange Rates

        Exchange rates play a crucial role th determining the external position

of a particular country. The long run external equilibrium position of a

country (i.e. ,    current   account) will be affected by the real exchange rate

as opposed to the nominal exchange rate. In the literature, however, there

has been some disagreement regarding the definition of the real exchange
        2
rate.       In this section some of the alternative definitions offered in the

literature are critically reviewed. The concept of "equilibrium" real

exchange rate is then introduced, and the difference between equilibrium and

(1985) for an exhaustive review of alternative definitions of the real
exchange rate.

 disequilibrium real exchange rates is briefly discussed.

 2.1 The Definition of the Real Exchange Rate

      The real exchange rate has been defined in a number of
                                                                     alternative ways
 in the economic literature. According to earlier views the real exchange

 rate was defined as the nominal exchange rate corrected (i.e.,
                                                                       multiplied)
 by the ratio of the foreign to the domestic price level. The main idea was

 that in an inflationary world changes in the nominal exchange rate would

have no clear meaning, and that explicit consideration should be given to

 changing values in the domestic. and fo:reig currencies,, as measured
                                                                            by the
 respective rates of inflation. In this context a number of writers referred

to the real exchange rate as the Purchasing Power Parity
                                                                 (PFP) exchange
rate. However, this approach to the real exchange rate is subject to the

well-known criticisms and problems of the PPP theory,       including those

related to the selection of appropriate price indexes and of an adequate

reference time period.3

     More recently most authors have defined the real exchange rate in the

context of a dependent economy type model, with tradable and nontradable

goods. In this setting the real exchange rate has been defined as the

(domestic) relative price of tradable to nontradable goods         (see, for example,

Dornbusch (1974, 1980), Krueger (1978, 1983), Mussa (1979, 1984), and Bruno

(1982)). It should be noted, however, that there is no universally accepted

definition of "the" real exchange rate. Indeed, some authors still object to

the idea of even considering that an exchange rate     -   -a   nominal concept by
definition --   could   become a real variable (see Maciejewski (1983)), while


     3See, for example, Krueger (1983, p. 18), McKinnon (1979, pp. 121-28),
Officer (1982, pp. 148-50) and Williamson (1983b, p. 14). For discussions
on the merits and problems of the PPP theory see, for example, Officer
(1982) and Frenkel (1978, 1981).
                                         4



others continue using the PPP notion of the real exchange rate.

     Unless otherwise explicitly stated, in the rest of this study we will

use the modern concept of the real exchange rate, defined as the relative

price of tradable to nontradable goods. If E is the nominal exchange rate

defined as units of domestic currency per unit of foreign currency, P is

the world price of tradables in terms of foreign currency, and               is the

price of nontradable goods, and no taxes on trade are assumed, the real

exchange rate (e) is then defined as:4


                 eâ€¢-
     The reason for defining the real exchange rate in this way is that in

the context of a tradable and nontradable goods model, the trade account will

depend on the (domestic) relative price of tradables to nontradables, and not

on the PPP definition of the real exchange rate. This follows directly from

the fact that the trade account is equal to the excess supply for tradable

goods. In fact, assuming that the supply for tradables depends positively on

the relative price of those goods (EP/PN) and that the demand depends

negatively on this relative price and positively on real income, the current

account - -   defined   as the excess supply of tradables -   - will   be a positive

function of real income and of the relative price of tradables to nontrad-

ables or real exchange rate. In this setting, a higher relative price of

tradables will result in a higher supply and lower demand for these goods

and, consequently assuming that the Marshall-Lerner condition holds, on an




     4Notice that this definition assumes that the law of one price holds
for tradable goods. This, of course, is a debatable issue.

 improved current account.5 The real exchange rate defined in
                                                                   this way, then,
 captures the degree of competitiveness (or Profitability) of the tradable

 goods sector in the domestic country. With other things
                                                              given, a higher e
 means a higher degree of competitiveness (and production), of the domestic

 tradables sector. Williamson (l983a) writes:
                                                    "[linternational competjtjve
 ness of our goods, ... can ceteris aribus be identified with the real

 exchange rate N (P. 161). Maciejewski (1983), on the other hand,
                                                                            writes:
 "[S]uch index values [of the real exchange rate] may provide some broad

 indication of the gain or loss in price (cost) Competitiveness      .   ." See   also
 Diaz-Alejandro (1983), Neary and Purvis (1983) and Williamson (1983b).

        It is interesting to compare further the   tradables-nontradables
 relative price definition with the (traditional) PPP definition of the real

 exchange rate. The PPP real exchange rate is defined as:


                       â€” EP*


where    P and P* are domestic price indexes.
                                                    Assuming that these indexes

are geometric weighted averages of tradable and nontradable prices:


                   â€”   p,l-a
                        NT'     â€”
                                    NT
and further assuming that the country in question is a small country and

that the law of one price holds for tradable
                                               goods (i.e., T â€”     PE),      it is
possible to find the relation between
                                         percentage changes in e and in the
PPP real exchange rate (where, as usual, the "hat" operator ()
                                                                         represents


     50n this type of model see, for example, Dornbusch (1980) and Mussa
(1984). Notice that since, as explained below, the real exchange rate
defined as above does not have to move in the same direction, then the PPP-
defined real exchange rate (an improvement of the latter) does not
necessarily result in an improvement of the current account.

                 â€”
                      (l/c)E,, +   (/) (P-)
     From this expression it is possible to see that, in general, changes in

the two definitions of the real exchange rate will differ (i.e.,

Moreover, changes in the two definitions of the real exchange rate can even

go in the opposite direction, depending on the behavior of foreign relative

prices (P/P).

2.2 The Equilibrium Real Exchange Rate

     From an analytical and policy perspective, a crucial question is related

to the determination of the equilibrium value of the real exchange rate.

Once this equilibrium level is established it is possible to determine, among

other things, whether the actual real exchange rate is misaligned (i.e.,

overvalued or undervalued).6 In this section the literature on the equilib-

rium real exchange rate is briefly and selectively reviewed.

     Robert Mundell (1971) provided an early formal analysis of the

determination of the equilibrium real exchange rate. Assuming the case of a

small economy that faces given terms of trade, Mundell defines the equilib-

rium real exchange rate as the relative price of international to domestic


     6For recent discussions on the causes and magnitudes of disequilibrium
or misalignments of the real exchange rates see, for example, Dornbusch
(1982), Williamson (1983b) and McKinnon (1984).
     A common confusion in the literature is to use the concepts of the real
exchange rate and the terms of trade interchangeably. See, for example,
Isard (1983). Of course, since the terms of trade are defined as the
relative price of exportables to importables, and the real exchange rate is
defined as the relative price of tradables to nontradable goods, there is no
reason for them to be equivalent. In fact, as will be discussed below
(Section 2.3), there are circumstances where these two variables will tend to
move in the opposite direction. Williamson (1983b) has recently stressed the
importance of distinguishing between the terms of trade and the real exchange
rate. Katselj (1984) has recently shown, using a cross-country data set,
that these two variables have tended to behave quite differently in the
recent years.

 goods that simultaneously equilibrates the money market, the domestic goods

 market and the international goods market. Even though Mundell does not

 explicitly use the term real exchange rate in this paper, his analysis

 rigorously describes how the equilibrium relative price of tradables to

 nontradables is determined.

     More recently, Dornbusch (1974, 1980) developed a model of an open

 dependent economy to analyze the determination of -the equilibrium real

exchange rate. In its simpler version the model considers a two goods

economy with a tradable and nontradable sector. It is assumed that the

production of tradables depends positively on the real- exchange rate, while

the production of nontradables depends negatively on that relative price.

On the other hand, the demand functions for tradables and nontradables are

assumed to depend on the real exchange rate and real expenditure. The

equilibrium real exchange rate is defined as the relative price of tradables

to nontradables at which income equates expenditure, and both the tradables

and noritradable goods markets are in equilibrium. Once the    equilibrium real

exchange rate is defined Dornbusch investigates the characteristics of

disequilibrium in terms of an overvalued or undervalued RER (Dornbusch

(1980, pp. 102-03)). Dornbusch (1980, pp. 103-08) also discusses how, under

the assumptions of complete price flexibility and full employment, different

disturbances will affect the equilibrium real exchange rate.

     A problem with a number of models on the equilibrium real exchange

rate, including those of Mundell and Dornbusch, is that they do not allow

for a distinction between the effects of temporary and permanent changes in

the real exchange rate determinants. This distinction can, in fact, be

crucial in some policy discussions. For instance, it is possible to think

that while a particular value of the real exchange rate can reflect a short-
                                       8




run equilibrium situation, it may be way out of line with respect to its

long-run equilibrium. This possibility has recently been emphasized by a

number of authors including Williamson (1983b), Harberger (1983), Edwards

(1984), Isard (1983), and Frenkel and Mussa (1984). For example, if there

is a temporary transfer from abroad, the real exchange rate that equilib-

rates the external and internal sectors will appreciate. While this new

real exchange rate will be a short-run equilibrium rate -   - in   the sense that

it accommodates the transfer -   - it will be out of line with respect to its
equilibrium long-run value (i.e., once the transfer has disappeared).

     The distinction between the short-run equilibrium and long-run

sustainable equilibrium real exchange rate has been introduced explicitly in

some recent analyses of the determination of the equilibrium real exchange

rate.7 In most of these studies the "long-run equilibrium real exchange"

rate has been associated with a situation where there is equilibrium in the

internal and external sectors       where foreign assets are being accumulated

or decuznulated at the desired rate. For example, according to Hooper and

Morton (1982):

     The equilibrium real exchange rate is defined as the rate that
     equilibrates the current account in the long-run. The long-run
     equilibrium or "sustainable" current account, in turn, is
     determined by the rate at which foreign and domestic residents
     wish to accumulate or decuniulate domestic-currency-denominated
     assets net of foreign currency denominated assets in the lonE run.
                                                            (1982, p. 43)

     Williamson (1983b) writes:

     [TJhe fundamental equilibrium exchange rate is that which is
     expected to generate a current account surplus or deficit equal to
     the underlying capital flow over the cycle, given that the country
     is pursuing international balance as best it can and not


     7What we have called here the long-run sustainable eguilibrium real
exchange rate is (somewhat) equivalent to Williamson's l983b) "fundamental
equilibrium real exchange rate."

      restricting trade for balance of payments reasons, (1983b,
                                                                       p. 14)
      Finally, in their chapter for the handbook of International
                                                                       Economics,
 Frenkel and Mussa (1984) express:

      [T}he long-run equilibrium real exchange rate is expected to be
      consistent with the requirement that on average (in present and
      future periods), the current account is balanced.
                                                           (1984, p. 64)
      More recently, Peter Neary (1988) has develcptd an optimizing model of a

 real economy to analyze the determinants of the equilibrium real exchange

 rate. An important improvement in Neary's approach over the previous litera-

 ture is that it explicitly considers that producers and consumers are

 rational and optimize some objective function.
                                                     Also, by ignoring all
monetary considerations Neary was able to concentrate on the
                                                                  long-run proper-
 ties of the model, and, thus, on the determinants of the equilibrium real

exchange rate. A shortcoming of Neary's model, however, is that it is basic-

ally static and does not allow us to make a distinction
                                                             between temporary and
permanent shocks, or between anticipated and
                                                 unanticipated disturbances.

2.3 An Intertenmoral Model of Equilibrium Real Exchange Rates

     In this subsection I present a minimal
                                                fully optimizing model of
equilibrium real exchange rates. The model is partially based on Edwards

(l989a,b). The equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER) is defined as that

relative price of tradables to nontradables that, for given sustainable

(equilibrium) values of other relevant variables such
                                                          as taxes, internation-
al prices and technology, results in the simultaneous attaimnertt of internal

and external equilibrium. Internal equilibrium means that the nontradable

goods market clears in the current period, and is expected to be in

equilibrium in future periods. In this definition of equilibrium RER it is

implicit the idea that this equilibrium takes
                                                  place with unemployment at the
'natural" level. External equilibrium       on the other hand, is attained when
                                          10




the intertemporal budget constraint that states that the discounted sum of a

country's current account has to be equal to zero, is satisfied. In other

words, external equilibrium means that the current account balances (current

and future) are compatible with long run sustainable capital flows.

       A number of important implications follow from this definition of

equilibrium real exchange rate. First, the ERER is not an immutable number.

When   there   are changes in any of the other variables that affect the

country's internal and external equilibria, there will also be changes in

the equilibrium real exchange rate. For example, the RER "required" to

attain equilibrium will not be the same with a very low world price of the

country's main export, than with a very high price of that good. In a

sense, then, the ERER is itself a function of a number of variables includ-

ing import tariffs, export taxes, real interest rates, capital controls and

so on. These immediate determinants of the ERER are the real exchange rate

"fundarnentais". Second, the ERER will not only be affected by current

"fundamentals," but also by the expected future evolution of these

variables. To the extent that there are possibilities for intertemporal

substitution of consumption via foreign borrowing and lending, and of

intertemporal substitution in production via investment, expected future

events - -   such   as an expected future change in the international terms of

trade, for example --     will   have an effect on the current value of the ERER.

In particular, the behavior of the equilibrium real exchange rate will

depend on whether changes in fundamentals are perceived as being permanent

or temporary. If there is perfect international borrowing, a temporary

disturbance to, say, the terms of trade, will affect the complete future

path of equilibrium RERs. However, if there is rationing in the interna-

tional credit market, interteniporal substitution through consumption will be
                                      11




cut, arid temporary disturbances will tend to affect the ERER in the short

run only. In this case a distinction between short-run and long-run

equilibrium real exchange rates becomes useful.

     Although this framework is very general and it can accommodate many

goods and factors, it is useful to think of this small economy as being

comprised of a large number of profit maximizing firms, that produce three

goods --   exportables   (X), importables (M) arid nontradables (N) -- using

constant returns to scale technology, under perfect competition. It is

assumed that there are more factors than tradable goods, so that factor price

equalization does not hold. One way to think about this is by assuming that

each sector uses capital, labor and natural resources.

     There are two periods only - the present (period 1) and the future

(period 2) -- and there is perfect foresight. Residents of this small

country can borrow or lend internationally. There are, however, taxes on

foreign borrowing; the domestic (real) interest rate exceeds the world

interest rate. The intertemporal constraint states that at the end of

period 2 the country has paid its debts. The importation of H is subject

to specific import tariffs both in periods 1 and 2. In this model the

current account is equal to savings minus investment in each period.

Consumers maximize intertemporal utility and consume all three goods.

     There is a government that consumes both tradables and nontradables.

Government expenditure is financed through nondistortionary taxes, proceeds

from import tariffs, proceeds from the taxation of foreign borrowing by the

private sector, and borrowing from abroad. As in the case of the private

sector, the government is subject to an intertemporal constraint: the

discounted value of government expenditure (including foreign debt service)

has to equal the discounted value of income from taxation.

      In addition to the private sector and government budget constraints,

 internal equilibrium requires that the nontradable market clears in each

 period. That is, the quantity supplied of nontradables has to equal the sum

 of the private and public sectors demands for these goods. The model is

 completely real; there is no money or other nominal assets.

      The general model is given by equations (1) through (9), where the

 (world) price of exportables has been taken as the numeraire:

     Equation (2) is the government intertemporal budget constraint. It

states that the discounted value of government expenditure has to equal the

present value of government income from taxation. NCA, which is equal to

(R-E-) in (2) is the private sector current account surplus in period 2,

and b(NCA) is the discounted value of taxes on foreign borrowing paid by

the private sector. Notice that the use of the world discount factor 6*

in (2) reflects the assumption that in this model the government is not

subject to the tax on foreign borrowing.

     Equation (3) and (4) are the equilibrium conditions for the

nontradables market in periods 1 and 2; in each of these periods the quant-

ity supplied of N (Rq and R) has to equal the sum of the quantity

demanded by the private sector (Eq and E) and by the government. Given

the assumptions about preferences (separability and homotheticity) the

demand for N by the private sector in period 1 can be written as:

               E â€”   ir E ,                                               (10)
                q     qr
     Equations (5) and (6) specify the relation between domestic prices of

importables, world prices of imports, and tariffs. Equation (7) describes

investment decisions, and states that profit maximizing firms will add to

the capital stock until Tobin's "q" equals 1. This expression assumes that

the stock of capital is made up of the nunieraire good.

     In this model we can distinguish between the "exportables real exchange

rate" (l/q) and the "importables real exchange rate" (p/q). Since the

relative price of X and M can change we cannot really talk about a

tradable goods composite. It is still possible, however to compute how an

index of tradables prices evolve through time. Equation (8) is the defini-

tion of the price index for tradables, where 1    and (l-y) are    the weights
                                       16




 of importables and exportables. Equation (9) defines the real exchange rate

 index as the domestic relative price of tradables to nontradables.

 Equations (1) through (9) fully describe the inter and intratempora].

 (external and internal) equilibria in this economy.

      In this model there is an equilibrium path for the RER. The vector of

 equilibrium RERs, RER â€” (RER,RR)      is composed of those RERs that satisfy

 equations (1) through (9) for given values of the other fundamental

 variables. Notice that since we have assumed no rigidities,
                                                                 externalities,

 or market failures, our equilibrium real exchange rates imply the existence

 of "full" employment (see, however, Edwards 1989a).

      From the inspection of equations (l)-(9) it is apparent that exogenous

 shocks in, say, the international terms of trade, will affect    the vector of

 equilibrium relative prices and RERs through two interrelated channels.        The
 first one is related to the intratemporal effects on resource allocation and

consumption and production decisions. For example, as a result of a tempo-

rary worsening of the terms of trade, there will be a tendency to     produce
more and consume less of M in that period. This, plus the income effect

resulting from the worsening of the terms of trade will    generate an incipient
disequilibrium in the noncradables market which will have    to be resolved by a

change in relative prices and in the equilibrium RER. In fact, if we assume

that there is an absence of foreign
                                      borrowing these intratempora]. effects

will be the only relevant ones. However, with capital mobility and invest-

ment, as in the current model, there is an additional intertemporal channel

through which changes in exogenous variables will affect the vector of

equilibrium RERs. For example, in the case of a worsening of the terms of

trade, the consumption discount factor 8/ir will be affected, altering the

intertemporal allocation of consumption. Also, in that case the investment
                                           17




  equilibrium condition (7) will be altered, affecting future
                                                                     output.
       Naturally, without specifying the functional forms of the
                                                                        expenditure,
  revenue, and other functions in (l)-(9) it is not possible to write the

 vector of equilibrium relative prices of nontradables, nor the equi1ibri

 real exchange rates, in an explicit form. It is
                                                       possible, however, to write
 them implicitly as functions of all the sustainable      levels of all exogenous

 variables (contemporaneous and anticipated) in the      system:


                                                                                 (11)


                                                                                 (12)

      A crucial question is related to the way in which the equilibrju

 vectors of relative prices and RERs will change in response to different

 types of disturbances. That is, we are interested in the
                                                                   (most plausible)
 signs of the partial derivatives of RER and RER with
                                                           respect to their deter-
 minants. The actual discussion of these effects
                                                       is beyond the scope of this
 paper, and can be found in Edwards (l989a,b,c). The main
                                                                conclusions from
 the manipulation of the model can be summarized as follows:

 (1) With low initial tariffs the imposition of
                                                     import tariffs (either
 temporarily or permanently) will usually generate an ecuilibrium real

ppreciatjo in the current and future periods. A sufficient condition is

that we have (net) substitutability in
                                            demand among all three goods X, M
and N. If initial tariffs are high, for this result to hold, we need, in

addition, income effects to be dominated by substitution effects.
                                                                           If,
however,   there is cornplementarity in
                                          consumption it is possible that the
imposition of import tariffs will generate a real equilibrium depreciation.

(2) If the income effect associated with a terms of trade deterioration

dominates the substitution effect, a worsening in the terms of trade will
                                        18




 result in an equilibrium real depreciation.


 (3) Generally speaking, it is not possible to know how the effect of import

 tariffs and terms of trade shocks on the ERER will be distributed through

time.


 (4) It is crucially important to distinguish between permanent and temporary

shocks when analyzing the reaction of the equilibrium real exchange rate.


(5) A relaxation of exchange controls will always result in an equilibrium

real appreciation in period 1. Moreover, in that period we will observe

simultaneously a real appreciation and an increase in borrowing from abroad.

(6) A transfer from the rest of the world - -      or   an exogenously generated
capital inflow for that matter -   - will    always result in an equilibrium real

appreciation.

(7) The effect of an increase in government consumption on the equilibrium

RERs will depend on the composition of this new consumption. If it falls

fully on nontradables there is a strong presumption that the RER will

experience an equilibrium real appreciation. If it falls fully on tradables

there will be an equilibrium real depreciation.


2.4 Real Exchan2e Rate Misalignment

        Even though, as suggested by the model presented above, long run

equilibrium real exchange rates are a function of real variables       only,

actual real exchange rates respond both to real and monetary variables. The

existence of an equilibrium real exchange rate does not mean that the actual

real exchange rate has to be permanently equal to this       equilibrium value.

In fact, the actual RER will normally exhibit departures from its long run

equilibrium; short run and even medium run deviations of the actual from the
                                          19




 equilibrium RER, that are typically not very large and that stem from short

 term frictions and adjustment Costs, can be quite Common.
                                                                However, there
 are other types of deviations that can become persistent
                                                              through time,
 generating major and sustained differentials between actual and
                                                                     equilibrium
 real exchange rates, or real exchange rate misalinments.

        In order to construct a model of real exchange rate
                                                              misalignment it is
 necessary to abandon the frictionless "real" world of the previous
                                                                          subsection;
 we need to introduce monetary and financial sectors, as well as rigidities

 that impede instantaneous adjustments. Although the construction of such a

 model is well beyond the scope of this paper, in the rest of this section I

 discuss some of the most important characteristics of
                                                          misalignment situations.
        A fundamental principle of open economy macroeconomics is that in order

 to have a sustainable macroeconomic equilibrium it is
                                                          necessary for monetary
and fiscal policies to be Consistent with the chosen nominal exchange rate

regime. This means that the selection of an exchange rate
                                                               system imposes
certain limitations on the extent of macropolicies. If this
                                                                 consistency is
violated severe disequilibriuxij situations, which are usually reflected on

real exchange rate misalignment, will take place.

        Perhaps the case of a "high" fiscal deficit under fixed nominal

exchange rates is the most clear example of macro and exchange rate incon-

sistencies. In most developing countries fiscal imbalances are partially or

wholly financed by money creation. The inflation required to finance        a

fiscal deficit equal to a fraction 8 of GDP can be calculated as:

                    â€” 6/A
                                                                                (13)

where    ir
              is the rate of inflation required to finance the government

deficit, and A is the ratio of high-powered money to GDP. If the required
                                     20



rate of inflation is "too high," it will possibly result in the price of

nontradables        growing faster than the international price of tradables

(P) and in a real appreciation. This type of "inconsistent" fiscal policy

will result in domestic credit creation above money demand growth. This, in

turn will be translated into an excess demand for tradable goods, nontradable

goods, and financial assets. While the excess demand for tradables will be

reflected in a higher trade deficit (or lower surplus), in a loss of interna-

tional reserves, and in an increase in (net) foreign borrowing above its long

run sustainable level, the excess demand for nontradables will be translated

into higher prices for those goods, and consequently into a real exchange

rate appreciation. If there are no changes in the fundamental real determin-

ants of the equilibrium RER this real appreciation induced by the expansive

domestic credit policy will represent a departure of the actual RER from its

equilibrium value, or real exchange rate misalignment. Naturally, since this

policy is unsustainable, something will have to give. Either the inconsis-

tent macropolicies will have to be reverted, or at some time the central bank

will "run out" of reserves and a balance of payments crisis will ensue.

     The consistency between monetary and exchange rate policies is not only

needed under fixed rates, but also under most types of predetermined and

managed nominal exchange rates such as an active crawling peg. Perhaps

Argentina in the late l970s is the most notorious recent case of an incon-

sistent fiscal and crawling nominal exchange rate policies. During that

period the Argentinian government implemented the by-now famous preannounced

rate of devaluation or "tablita" as a means to reduce inflation. However,

the preannounced rate of crawl was clearly inconsistent with the inflation

tax required to finance the fiscal deficit (Calvo 1986). This inconsistency

not only generated a real appreciation, but also a substantial speculative
                                     21




 activity where the public basically bet on when the "b1ita' would be

 abandoned.

     Nonunified (or multiple) nominal exchange rates have traditionally had

 some appeal for the developing countries, and have recently become fairly

common. Under this type of system different international transactions are

subject to differential nominal exchange rates, giving rise to the possibil-

 ity of having more than one real exchange rate. Under nonunified exchange

rates, the relation between macroeconomic policies and the rest of the

economy will depend on the nature of the multiple rates system.     If, for

example, the multiple rates regime consists of two (or more) predetermined

(i.e., fixed) nominal rates, the system will work almost in the same way as

under unified predetermined nominal rates. This is because multiple fixed

nominal exchange rates are perfectly equivalent to a unified rate system

with taxes on certain external transactions. In this case, as with unified

predetermined rates, inconsistent macroeconomic policies will result in loss

of international reserves, a rate of domestic inflation that will   exceed

world inflation, and in real exchanze rate overvaluatjon. This situation,

of course, will be unsustainable in the long run and the authorities    will
have to introduce corrective macropolicies.

     A different kind of nonunified nominal exchange rates consists of a

fixed official rate for current account transactions and an (official)

freely fluctuating rate for capital account transactions. The main purpose

of this system is to delink the real side of the economy from the effects of

supposedly highly unstable capital movements. In this dual exchange rate

system, portfolio decisions are highly influenced by the differential

between the free and fixed rates or exchange rate premium. The private

sector decisions on what proportion of wealth to hold in the form of foreign
                                    22




currency denominated assets is directly influenced by the expected rate of

devaluation of the free rate.

     Under a dual exchange rate regime, even if no current account

transactions slip into the free rate, changes in the fluctuating nominal rate

will exercise an influence on the real exchange rate. Consider, for example,

the case of an increase of domestic credit at a rate that exceeds the

increase in the demand for domestic money. As before this will provoke an

excess demand for goods and financial assets. As a result of this policy

there will be a decline in the stock of international reserves, an increase

in the price of nontradable goods, and consequently a real appreciation. In

addition, there will be an increase in the demand for foreign assets, which

will result in a nominal devaluation of the free rate, and in changes in the

domestic interest rate. The devaluation of the free rate will, in turn, have

secondary effects over the official j exchange rate via a wealth effect.

The bottom line, however, is that in this case inconsistent macropolicies

will eventually be also unsustainable, as international reserves are drained.

By partially delinking the current from the capital account, all the dual

rates system can hope to do is delay the eventual crisis. A system that is

particularly relevant for the developing countries consists of the coexist-

ence of a fixed rate for commercial transactions with a floating parallel
                                                                            8
(either black or grey) market rate governing the financial transactions.


3. Measurinz Real Exchange Rates

     From an empirical point of view the first question that should be

addressed is: how should the real exchange rate be measured? From equation



     8Edwards (l989a) develops a formal model of exchange rate misalignment
and balance of payments crises.
                                         23



(9), which defines the real exchange rate as the relative price of tradables

and nontradables, it is apparent that the main measurement problems are those

related to the selection of the real-world counterparts of P and                         In

reality, it is extremely difficult -     - if not   impossible -     to   define which

goods are actually tradables and which are nontradables. A second measure-

ment problem is related to the definition of E. Should the nominal exchange

rate with respect to the U.S. dollar be considered? Or is the exchange rate

with respect to the DM the most appropriate? Or, should an average of both

rates be used? These and other problems related to the measurement of the

real exchange rate will be discussed in this section. The analysis will be

restricted to the actual measurement of the RER, without entering into the

important and difficult question of the empirical definition of the equilib-

rium level of the real exchange rate. The analysis presented in this section

will first discuss, briefly, the arguments traditionally given in favor of

alternative measures of the real exchange rate. The discussion will be quite

general and will provide a broad cover of the literature. That is, the

presentation will also deal - -   even   though briefly -   - with   the PPP real

exchange rate. Section 4, on the other hand, deals with the actual behavior

of different RER indexes in the developing countries.

     As expressed in equation (9), RER is defined as the relative price of

tradable to nontradable goods. Ideally, one would want to have data on

tradables and nontradables. In almost every country, however, these are not

available. For this reason, some proxy for the analytical concept of the

RER should b found. In some respects, the selection of the appropriate

proxies for      and P resembles the definition of the adequate price

levels in the old discussions of the Purchasing Power Parity theory (see,

for example, Keynes, 1924, Viner 1937, and Officer's 1976 review). Indeed,
                                     24




most of the discussion on the appropriate measurement of the real exchange

rate has been closely related to the PPP literature.

     Basically four alternative price indexes have been traditionally

suggested as possible candidates for the construction of the real exchange

rate index. However, as we will see, most of these propositions relate to

the traditional PPP definition, and are not entirely appropriate as proxies

for the relative price of tradables to nontradables. The following price

indexes have actually been suggested: (1) the Consumer Price Indexes at

home and abroad (CPI); (2) the Wholesale Price Indexes (WPI);    (3) the
CDP deflators (GD);   (4) and wage rate indexes (Wit).9 Also some authors

have suggested using specific components of the CPI and WPI as proxies for

the prices of tradables and nontradables. In practice, however, this

procedure has the same type of problems as those arising from the use of

more standard price indexes. The relative merits of these indexes are also

somewhat related to the old PPP discussion.

     Of course, none of these indexes is perfect and all of them present

some advantages and disadvantages. The relevant question, then, is which

index, or indexes, are preferable for analyzing changes in the real exchange

rate and the degree of competitiveness. In the rest of this subsection the

discussion will be restricted to the merits of the alternative price

indexes. Below, the question of bilateral versus multilateral real exchange

rates will be tackled in detail.




     9Sorne authors have also suggested using an alternative indicator of
competitiveness constructed as the ratio of export unit cost to import unit
costs. Of course the problem with this is that it confuses the terms of
trade with the real exchange rate! See Williamson t1983b. See also
Connolly and Lackey's (1983) proposition for using the "real monetary
parity".
                                          25




      Within the context of the PPP real exchange rate, the most
                                                                   commonly used
 index of the real exchange rate in empirical and policy discussions, is that

 constructed using CPIs as the relevant price indexes (see DeVries (1968)).

 It has been argued that this indicator will provide a comprehensive measure

of changes in competitiveness since the CPIs include a broad group of goods,

including services (see Genberg 1978). Another advantage of this index is

that almost every country periodically (i.e., monthly) publishes     fairly
reliable data on CPI behavior. However, an obvious problem with this measure

is that since the CPI includes a large number of nontraded goods, it will

tend to provid a biased measure of the changes in the degree of competitive.

ness of the tradable goods sector (see Frenkel (1978), Officer (1982)).

     Some authors have suggested that this problem would be solved if WPI

indexes, which contain mainly tradable goods, are used in the computation of

the real exchange rate. This measure, however, has also been subject to

criticism. It has been argued, for example, that since these indexes

contain highly homogeneous tradable goods, whose prices tend to be    equated

across countries when expressed in a common currency, the real exchange rate

computed using WPIs will vary very little, without really measuring actual

changes in the degree of competitiveness (see Keynes 1930, Officer l982))0

Also, the use of WPI (as well as other) indexes, is subject to the problem

arising from the use of different weights across countries.

     The main merit of the CDP deflator as a candidate for the construction

of the RER is that it is a genuine price index of aggregate production, while

both the CPI     and the WPI are indexes of consumption prices. It has been

          This
            .     .   .   .   .   .   .
            criticism implicitly assumes that the "law of one price' holds
for homogeneous tradable goods. See, however, Kravis and Lipsey (1983) and
Isard (1977).
                                    26



thought, then, that a real exchange rate index computed using GDP deflators

will provide a good indicator of changes in the degree of competitiveness in

production (see Officer 1976, 1982; Barro 1983). On the other hand, a

crucial drawback of the GDP deflator is that, for most developing countries

it is only available on a yearly basis, and that as in the case of the CPI it

has a large component of nontradable goods (see Harberger (1981)).

     Many authors, including the IMF staff (Artus (1978), Artus and Knight

(1984)), prefer to compute the real exchange rate as a ratio of unit labor

costs (see also Houthakker (1962, 1963)), the reason being that this index

is, in some sense, a direct measure of relative competitiveness across

countries (see Maciejewski (1983)). It has also been argued that relative

labor costs are more stable than relative goods prices (Artus (1978),

Officer (1982)). As in the case of the other indexes, there are a number of

analytical problems related to the use of this type of measure for the real

exchange rate. First, an indicator based on wage rates behavior will be

highly sensitive to cyclical productivity changes. For this reason the IMF

has constructed the so-called normalized unit labor costs indexes which

correct the competitiveness measure by these productivity changes (see

Maciejewski (1983), and International Financial Statistics (April 1984, p.

63)). Unfortunately, however, due to data availability limitations, the IMF

only computes these normalized unit labor costs for the Q.Q.2 countries. A

second shortcoming of the wage rate based measure of the real exchange rate

is that it takes into account only one factor of production. To the extent

that the capital/labor ratio differs across countries, this will introduce a

bias into the index. Finally, the poor quality and limited availability of

wage rates data for developing countries is also a serious drawback for the

use of this indicator.
                                    27




     Recently some authors have argued that the best way to construct a real

exchange rate index is to use some component of the more traditional price

indexes to construct proxies for the domestic price of tradables and non-

tradables. For example, Kravis and Lipsey (1983) have suggested using (for

most countries) the CDP deflator for services and government expenditures to

construct a proxy for nontradables and the deflators of the rest of the

sectors to construct a proxy for tradables. Even though this sounds like a

sensible proposition, it has two important drawbacks. First, the existing

disaggregation at the national account level in most countries is too broad

to allow for really meaningful comparisons across sectors. Second, and more

important, with very few exceptions, national account data are only avail-

able on a yearly basis and with a substantial delay. This, unfortunately,

defeats the whole idea of having a reliable and fast index of external

competitiveness. At this level, a more practical proposition is to

construct the real exchange rate using components of the consumer and

wholesale price indexes to build the proxies for tradables and nontradables

prices. These indexes are available fairly quickly and in almost every

country on a monthly basis. A problem with this proposition, however, is

how to make the selection of which components to be included as part of what

index. Another problem, of course, is related to the selection of the

weight to attach to each component in the construction of the proxies. Even

though these are tricky problems, they are not insurmountable. Their

solution will basically require good judgment.

     Thus from a practical point of view and for most purposes, it is

advisable to stick to real exchange rate indexes constructed with the

traditional price indexes. There are two main advantages to this. First,

the cost involved in building these series is relatively low; and second, in
                                           28




this way cross-country comparisons can be made more easily. In the rest of

this section, the discussion will be restricted to the behavior of real

exchange rate indexes constructed using CPIs, WPIs, CDP deflators and wage

indexes. A growing number of authors have recently proposed that an

adequate proxy for the relative price of tradables to nontradables can be

constructed if the foreign WPI is used in the numerator and the domestic CPI

is used in the denominator. Later .in this section a more detailed discus-

sion on the merits and demerits of this particular index will be provided.

3.1 The Real Exchange Rate in a World of Floating: Effective Real Exchange
     Rates vs. Bilateral Real Exchange Rates

     The preceding discussion referred to bilateral rates between the

domestic currency and, say, the U.S. dollar. However, in a world where the

main currencies are floating there are many different bilateral rates, and

there is no reason why one rate should be preferred over another. For this

reason indexes of real exchange rates that take into account the behavior of

all the relevant bilateral rates have been constructed. These exchange rate

indexes have been called real effective exchange rates or real basket

exchange rates.

     The behavior of the effective exchange rate can be, at least in theory,

very different form the behavior of any bilateral exchange rate. In order

to illustrate this point we will concentrate on effective vs. bilateral

nominal exchange rates. The analysis follows easily for the case of real

exchange rates. Assume that a country trades with k countries. Then the

effective nominal exchange rate         B is defined as:
                         k
                  Bt =   E   a. E .                                       (14)
                         â€”
                              1   cit

where a. is the appropriate weight for country i, and           is an index
                                              29




of the bilateral nominal exchange rate between the home country's currency

and country i's currency in period t. By triangular arbitrage:

                 Eci â€”EciEii
where Ed       is, for example, the bilateral nominal exchange rate betwen the

home country and the U.S. dollar, and E1. is the rate between the U.S.

dollar and country i's currency (i.e., the U.S./Yen Rate).

     The rate of change of the nominal effective exchange rate                     can be

written as (where       â€”   dX/dt   i/X):


                      ci +                                                              (15)
                              [i2    riEhii li]

where

                              k
                  Aâ€”a +       Z a. E
                             jâ€”2


        Equation (15) indicates that in a world of floating rates the rate of

change of the effective nominal rate                will differ from the change in the

bilateral rate with respect to the reference country c1' by the term in

square brackets. In particular, if the U.S. dollar --                the   currency in terms

of which the bilateral rate is defined -            - is   appreciating in the world


market (i.e., E.2 (aEii/A) E1.
                                            < 0),   the rate of nominal depreciation of

the effective nominal rate will be smaller than the rate of nominal depreci-

ation of the bilateral rate            <
                                            ci      o course,     the contrary would be

the case if the dollar depreciated relative to the other currencies, as has

been the case since 1985.

Macedo (1982) and Branson and Katseli (1982).

4. Real Exchange Rate Behavior In Selected Develooing Countries

     The purpose of this section is to investigate how different indexes of

RERs have behaved in a large number of developing countries. In particular,

the analysis compares the behavior of bilateral, effective, official and

parallel market exchange rates. The discussion concentrates on determining

whether RERs have exhibited trends and on how volatile RERs have been. In

addition the analysis inquires into whether it really makes a difference

which price indexes are used to construct RER indexes.

4.1 Official Nominal Exchange Rates and RER Behavior in 33 Develoting
     Countries

Effective Real Exchange Rates and Bilateral Exchange Rates

     In the construction of the effective indexes of real exchange rate the

following equation was used:

                         k
                         Z a.E P!r
                             iitit
               MRER. â€”
                   Jt

where MRER.    is the index of the multilateral or effective real rate in

period t for country j; Ej is an index of the nominal rate between

country i and country j in period t; i â€”        1,... ,k   refers to the k

partner countries used in the construction of the MRER index; a. is the
                                                                    1.



weight corresponding to partner i in the computation of MRER; P is
the price index of the i partner in period t; and              is the price

index of the home country in period t. An increase in the value of this

index of MRER reflects a real depreciation, whereas a decline implies a

real appreciation of the domestic currency.

     Two indexes of multilateral real exchange rates were constructed and

their behavior compared. The first index --   which   is a proxy for the
                                       31




relative price of tradables to nontradables -. used the partner countries'

WPIs as the Ps's and the borne country CPI as             For notation purposes

this index was called MRER1. The second index --     which   is related to the

more traditional PPP measure of the real exchange rate -     - used   consumer

price indexes for both partner countries and the home country. This index

was called MRER2.

        In the construction of both indexes the following procedure was

followed: (1) The weights (a's) were trade weights constructed using

data from the International Monetary Fund Directions of Trade.         (2) For

each country the ten largest trade partners in 1975 were used for the

construction of the real exchange rate indexes.     (3) In all cases the

nominal exchange rate indexes (E) were constructed from data on official

nominal exchange rates obtained from the International Financial Statistics

(IFS). In those cases where there were multiple official exchange rates the

"most common" rate as listed by the j, was used. This means that these

indexes are capturing some of the distortions introduced by the existence of

multiple rates. What they do not capture, however, is the role of non-

official black or parallel markets for foreign exchange (see, however,

Edwards 1989a).

        Two indexes of bilateral real exchange rates with respect to the U.S.

were also constructed using data on official nominal rates. These indexes

were defined as:


                  BRER1 â€”
                            E   JPI

 and,
                                        32




                BRER2 â€”   E   CPI

 where E is the bilateral (official) nominal exchange rate with respect to

 the U.S. dollar; WPIUS and CPIUS are the wholesale and consumer price

 indexes; and CPI is the domestic country consumer price index.
                                                                       BRER1,

 then, is the bilateral counterpart of MRER1. On the other hand, BRER2

 uses both the domestic country and the U.S. CPIs and has historically been

 the most popular RER index in policy analyses.

      Figures 4-1 through 4-8 show the evolution of two real exchange rate

 indexes, the multilateral MRER1 index and the bilateral BRER1 index, for 33

 developing countries. As may be seen, in most cases bath indexes tended to

move roughly in the same direction throughout most of the     period, and in

particular between 1960 and 1971. After the collapse of the Bretton Woods

system, in many of the countries depicted in these diagrams the multilateral

and bilateral indexes started to exhibit some difference in behavior.

     In order to formally compare the behavior of the four alternative

indexes of the real exchange rate constructed
                                                  using official data, coeffi-
cients of correlations between the multilateral and the bilateral real

exchange rate indexes were computed using quarterly data for the period that

goes from the first quarter of 1965 up to the second quarter of 1985. The

following regularities emerged from this analysis.     First, in most countries

the two alternative definitions of the bilateral real exchange rate index

moved closely together during this period. In 27 out of the 33 countries

considered the coefficient of correlation between     log(BRER1) and
log(BRER2) was above 0.9 and in all cases it exceeded 0.8. Second, the two

indexes of trade weighted multilateral RER also moved closely together. In

30 out of the 33 countries the
                                 coefficient of correlation between the logs

of MRER1 and MRER2 exceeded 0.9. And third, the behavior of the bilateral

and multilateral RER indexes has been quite different in many of these

countries. In 16 cases the coefficient of correlation between log MRER and

log BRER was below 0.5 and in two countries it was even negative. These

findings indicate that for most countries, and within a particular type of

index -   - bilateral   or multilateral --   the   selection of the price indexes

used in the construction of the RER measure is not a major practical

problem. The results also show that the bilateral and multilateral real

exchange rate indexes move in different, and even opposite, directions.

This means that when evaluating policy-related situations it is necessary to

use or construct a broad multilateral index of real exchange rate. A

failure to do this, can result in misleading and incorrect inferences

regarding the evolution of a country's degree of competitiveness.


Trends and Variability

     The real exchange rate indexes depicted in Figures 4-1 through 4-8 have

two important characteristics. First they show that in most countries the

real exchange rate has been fairly variable. Second, in spite of the

observed variability, in several of these countries it appears that these

indexes have not had significant long term trends during the whole period

under consideration. For the shorter, more recent periods, however,

negative trends can be detected in a number of cases.

     Tables 2 and 3 contain data on the main statistical properties of the

multilateral real exchange rate index MRER1 for our 33 countries. These

indicators have been calculated for two periods of time: 1965-71 and 1972-

85. The years 1965-71 correspond to the last years of the Bretton Woods

period, where a majority of countries were pegged to the U.S. dollar. The

last period, 1972-85, corresponds to the post-Bretton Woods era, a period

during which most advanced countries have adopted a dirty (or managed)

floating nominal exchange rates system and most of the developing nations

have maintained some kind of peg. The more important findings that emerge

from these tables can be summarized as follows: First, as the diagrams

suggested, real exchange rates have been quite volatile in many of these

countries, with the extent of this variability being quite different across

countries. For example, while in Zambia the difference between the maximum

and minimum values of the index for the complete 1965-85 period surpasses

130 points, it was only 25 points in Singapore. A second fact that emerges

from Tables 2 and 3 refers to the increased real exchange rate variability

through time. A comparison of the coefficients of variation for 1965-71 and

1972-85 reveals that in all but 4 countries (Ecuador, Philippines, Turkey

and Yugoslavia), the multilateral real exchange rate has been significantly

more volatile during the post-Bretton Woods era.

     In all of these countries a steady depreciation of the multilateral real

exchange rate was observed until a certain date -   - usually   late 1970s - -   and

a fairly steep real appreciation has been detected since. Not surprisingly a

number of these countries have pegged, or managed their currency against the

U.S. dollar; as the U.S dollar appreciated in the first part of the l980s so

did these countries real exchange rates. It can also be identified a group

of countries whose RERs have exhibited clear long term trends: Cyprus,

India, Malta, Mauritius, Tunisia and Turkey have a definitively strong

positive trend (i.e., the RER has depreciated through time), while Bolivia,

Ecuador, Ethiopia, Paraguay and Zambia have exhibited a negative (real

appreciation) long run trend, Finally, there are those countries whose RERs

do not show a significant long term trend. However, in spite of the absence

of a long term trend, in some of these cases, as in Kenya and Mexico, there
                                     37




have been some fairly abrupt jumps in RERs usually as a result of major

nominal devaluations. The degree of RER instability across these countries

has also been fairly different, with Kenya, for example, being quite stable,

while Mexico has exhibited a fair amount of instability.

     In order to further investigate RER behavior, linear trends regressions

were estimated for four time periods: 1965-1985, 1965-1971, 1972-1985 and

the more recent period 1978-1985. For most countries the absolute value of

the estimated coefficients for the whole period were small, although in most

cases they were significant. A comparison of the number of negative signs

of the trend coefficients in the earlier Bretton Woods era and the more

recent period shows that during 1965-71 in only 8 out of the 33 countries

the trend coefficient was small but negative, indicating a weak tendency

towards appreciation. However, during 1978-85 in 23 out of 33 countries the

trend coefficient was negative, and in some cases like Ecuador, Paraguay and

Bolivia, fairly large.

4.2 Parallel Markets and RER Behavior: The Cross Country Evidence

     The RER indexes used in the analysis of subsection 4.1 were constructed

using data on official nominal exchange rates. However, as pointed out in

Section 3 above, in many developing countries at different points in time

there have been quite significant parallel (or black) markets for foreign

exchange. The coverage and importance of these parallel market varies from

country to country and from period to period. In some cases they are quite

thin, and are mainly used by those nationals that want to spend their

vacations abroad and are only allowed a limited quota of foreign exchange at

the official rates. In other cases, the coverage of the parallel market is

very broad and the parallel market exchange rate is the relevant marginal

rate for most transactions. The degree of legality of these parallel
                                       38




markets also varies from case to case. While in some cases they are quasi-

legal and accepted by the authorities as a minor nuisance, in others they

are strongly repressed with the authorities severely persecuting those that

engage in black market transactions.

     By the very nature of these markets --   illegal   or quasi-illegal --   it
is not possible to have accurate data on their volume of transactions and on

their relative importance. However, there are relatively reliable data on

parallel market quotations and parallel market premia. Generally speaking,

the parallel market premium will become higher as exchange controls become

more pervasive and generalized and as fewer transactions are allowed through

the official market. In fact, under conditions of generalized exchange

controls and rationing the RER indexes computed using official rates will

become more and more irrelevant for a number of transactions and in parti-

cular for imports.

     There is no reason why the parallel market RER index (PMRER) should

move closely with the indexes constructed using the official nominal

exchange rates. In fact, there are a number of circumstances under which,

in a country with pegged nominal official rates, these two RER indexes will

tend to move in opposite directions. This will be the case, for example,

when there is a massive domestic credit creation under
                                                          generalized exchange

controls and active parallel markets. Under these circumstances, the higher

growth of domestic credit will sime aneously generate an appreciation of

the official RER index and a depreciation of the parallel market RER. In

order to investigate this issue further coefficients of correlation between

the parallel market RER and official RER bilateral indexes were calculated

(see Edwards l989a). The parallel market index was constructed as:
                                        39




                               wPIUs



where (PM) is an index of the parallel market bilateral nominal exchange

rate with respect to the U.S. dollar,        p1US is the U.S. wholesale price

index and CPI is the domestic country consumer price index. PMRER1, then

is the bilateral parallel index equivalent to BRER1 in Section 4.1. The

results obtained clearly capture the fact that the parallel and official RER

index indeed behave very differently. In fact in 13 out of the 28 cases the

coefficients of correlation turned out to be negative!


5. Real Exchange Rate Volatility and Economic Performance12

     An important finding on RER behavior reported in the previous section

refers to the increased degree of volatility experienced by RERs. From a

theoretical perspective it has been well established that real exchange rate

disequilibrium and heightened uncertainty regarding RER behavior will have

negative effects on economic performance (Willet, 1986). Empirically,

however, there has been more difficulty finding evidence that supports these

theoretical insights. According to the IMF (1984), for example, there is

insufficient evidence linking increased real exchange rate instability to

less active international trade. To quote the Fund (1984, page 36):

     The large majority of empirical studies on the impact of exchange
     rate variability on the volume of international trade are unable
     to establish a systematic significant link between measured
     exchange rate variability and the volume of international trade,
     whether on an aggregate or on a bilateral basis.

     In its own empirical investigation the Fund found no empirical evidence

of a relationship between exchange rate instability and bilateral trade

flows for 7 industrial nations. Cavallo and Cotani (1985), however, were


            section draws partially on Edwards (l989d).
                                        40



able to find some evidence on a negative relation between RER variability

and economic performance. Their analysis looked only at bilateral rates and

concentrated on official nominal exchange rates. We have seen above,

however, that not only effective and bilateral rates behave in a signifi-

cantly different way, but also, that black market and official rates many

times move in opposite directions.

       In this section we report some regression results on the relation

between real exchange rate instability and economic performance using cross

section data for 23 out of the 33 countries of the previous      section.13 The

data were broken into two periods: 1965-1971 corresponding to the last six

years of the Bretton Woods System, and 1978-1985 corresponding to     the most

recent period with an international floating exchange rate system. The

analysis dealt with four different measures of economic performance: (1)

average rate of growth of real GDP over each of the two periods considered;

(2) average rate of growth of real GDP per capita; (3) average rate of

growth of real export; and (4) average investment-output ratio. The

regressions were estimated both in levels as well as in logs. The

structural form of the equations actually estimated were:

                 Xn â€”a+ n+Eji ni
                              Z +n                                          (16)

and,


                 log X â€” a' +   ' log   s + z j log     +
                                                            En
                                                                            (17)


where the following notation has been used:

        â€” performance variable (average growth of GDP; average growth of
Xn
          exports; and average investment ratio) for country n.



      13These are the only countries for which there are data on all the
 required variables.

    n,wn â€” error
                   terms, assumed to have the usual properties.

         Depending on the left hand side variable different Z.'s were

included. In the two output growth equations, two Z.'s (i.e., "other"

variables) were incorporated to the regressions: investment-output ratio

and variability (coefficient of variation) of the international terms of

trade. The investment variable was incorporated as a way to capture the

effects of capital accumulation in explaining cross country growth

differentials. Its coefficient is expected to be positive. The terms of

trade variability was added in an effort to incorporate other sources of

external instability faced by these nations, and its sign is expected to be

negative. In the growth of exports equations the variability index of the

    terms of trade was the only        included; its sign is expected to be

    negative. Finally, in the investment ratio equation no additional variables

    (Z's) were incorporated.
         Our interest is to find out whether greater real exchange rate

    instability has indeed been associated to some kind of "poorer" economic

    performance. In terms of equations (15) and (16) we are interested in

    testing whether the coefficients       and 9'   are significantly negative, or

    if as suggested by the IMF, there has been no relation between exchange rate

    instability and economic performance. The output growth equations performed

    better when they were estimated in levels. The exports and investment

    equations, on the other hand, generated better fits when estimated in logs.

    For the sake of saving space we only report the better results. Other

    estimates, including those obtained when nonlinear terms were added, are

     Tables 4 through 6 contain the regression results obtained when

"official" RER indexes were used in the computation of the RER variability

measure. A number of interesting results emerge from these tables. In

particular, there seems to be a definite difference in the way these

variables have interacted during the Bretton Woods and the floating rates

periods. The results are quite strong in indicating a structural break

between the two periods. While real exchange rate instability played no

role in the Bretton Woods era, they help explain cross country differentials

in economic performance during the more recent period. Moreover, during the

more recent floating rates era there is a quite clear negative relation

between real exchange rate instability and our real performance measures.

     Table 4 contains the regression results for the average rate of growth

of real GDP and real GDP per capita. The results are quite satisfactory,

especially for the floating rates era. The R2s indicate that a fairly

significant fraction of the variability of average rates of growth across

countries can be explained by these equations. Not surprisingly, the

investment ratio is positively related to the average rates of growth.

Those countries that accumulate capital more rapidly have generally grown at

a faster average rate. This result holds both for the Bretton Woods period

as well as for the floating rates period. Notice, however, that there is a

marked difference in the magnitude of the coefficients. For the more recent

era the point estimates are almost one half of those obtained for the

Bretton Woods period. As noted, the coefficients of the RER variability

indexes are quite different across periods. The results do provide quite

strong support to the hypothesis that, during the floating rates period,

higher real exchange rate instability has been associated to poorer economic

performance. It is interesting to note that the coefficients of the index

of variability of the real effective rate are higher than those of the index

of variability for the real bilateral rate. In all equations the index of

instability of external terms of trade turned out to be non-significantly

different from zero.

     How can we account for the differences in the results for the Bretton

Woods and floating rates period? A possible explanation lays on the

different nature of real exchange rate instability in both periods. During

the old institutional arrangements real exchange rate movements were much

more predictable, since the institutional framework rule out wide daily

fluctuations in third parties bilateral exchange rates.

     Table 5 presents the regression results for the investment equation. A

double log specification was used. In many ways these results are similar

to those on real output growth, indicating that during the floating rates

period there has been a pretty strong negative relation between the degree

of real exchange rate instability and investment. Notice, however, that

these equations only explain a very low percentage of the cross country

variation of investment ratios. Finally, Table 6 contains the results for

the export growth equations. Interestingly enough, these results are in

line with those of the IMF, indicating that there is no significant connec-

tion between RER instability and exports performance. However, a word of

caution related to measurement is needed here. The exports growth data used

in these regressions refer to exports in real U.S. dollars, and have been

computed as the rate of growth of exports in U.S. dollars deflated by the

U.S. WPI. There is, then, a potential valuation problem that may be

responsible for the fact that the coefficients of the variability indexes

are nonsignificant.

6. Concluding Remarks

     In this paper I have analyze& some off the mast. imartant       aspects
related to the concept: and measurement of: real excbange   rates.     In addition

I have provided an. einpirical analysis off real exchange rate behavior in a

large group of develop;thg countries. The discussion emphasized that it is

crucially important to make a distinction between equilibrium and

disequilibrium changes of real exchange rates. For this purpose I presented

an intertemporal model of equilibrium real exchange rate behavior in a fully

optimizing economy, and I discussed bow' alternative macroeconomic policies

can result in real exchange rate misalignment.

     The empirical analysis showed that in the recent years bilateral and

multilateral real exchange rates have exhibited markedly different behavior.

This indicates that ignoring those problems emerging from the existence of

floating rates international monetary system can result in greatly biased

policy recommendations. It is also pointed out that in a large number of

developing countries parallel markets for foreign exchange can be quite

important. This means that in these cases using RER constructed with

official nominal rates can also result in misleading conclusions.

     Finally, in this study I investigate empirically the effects of real

exchange rate variability on economic development in a group of developing

countries. It is found using a cross section data set that higher RER

volatility has been associated with lower output growth and lower

investment. There are no indications, however, that higher variability in

the RER affects the level of exports.
