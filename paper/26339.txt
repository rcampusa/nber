                                         ABSTRACT

Strategies based on growth and inequality reduction require a long-run horizon, and this paper
therefore argues that those strategies need to be complemented by poverty alleviation programs.
With regards to such programs, informality in Latin America and the Caribbean is a primary
obstacle to carry out means testing income-support programs, and countries in the region have
therefore mostly relied on proxy means testing mechanisms. This paper studies the relative
effectiveness of these and other mechanisms by way of a formal model in which workers choose
between job opportunities in the formal and informal sectors. Although the means testing
mechanism allows for a more pro-poor design of transfers, it distorts labor decisions made by
workers. On the other hand, (exogenous) proxy means testing does not cause distortions, but its
pro-poor quality is constrained by the power of observable characteristics to infer income levels.
However, since taxation is necessary to fund programs, redistribution becomes less effective,
especially for programs other than means testing. The paper concludes by discussing the
implications of these results for the design of more efficient targeting programs.

1. Introduction


For several decades, poverty has been on a steady downward path, both worldwide and

in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). Growth in incomes and a decline in

inequality in the 2000s have triggered these improvements. Still, there is room for

progress, and poverty reduction remains a top priority for societies and policymakers in

the LAC region. This paper is therefore dedicated to assessing the effectiveness of

poverty reduction strategies.


In terms of poverty, LAC has consistently ranked in the middle of the remaining regions

of the world, below Europe and Central Asia and the Middle East and Northern Africa,

but above South Asia, East Asia and the Pacific, and sub-Saharan Africa. With the

exception of this last region, all regions have gone through a sustained process of

poverty reduction. The fall in poverty in LAC has been underpinned by long-run growth

in the region, although there has been frequent macroeconomic instability. Inequality

generally rose in the 1990s, while it has fallen in the 2000s. With some exceptions, the

gains in the 2000s have more often offset the declines in the 1990s, implying that

declines in inequality have contributed to declines in poverty.


This paper estimates the contribution of growth and inequality towards poverty

reduction by means of regression-based decompositions, finding that growth has been

the main driver behind falling poverty in LAC. This is not because declining inequality

is ineffective at reducing poverty ­ far from it, the estimates indicate that the elasticity

of poverty with respect to inequality is rather large, especially in the region. The reason

is rather that inequality has not fallen consistently from its values at the beginning of the

sample.




                                              2
That being said, growth and sustained declines in inequality are necessarily long-term

strategies for poverty reduction. Even when growth and declines in inequality are

sustained, this paper argues that there is a need to complement these developments with

poverty alleviation programs. This is because improvements do not automatically spill

over to everyone, and groups without the proper human capital and access to better

opportunities are unlikely to be able to gain their share of these benefits.


The effectiveness of poverty alleviation programs depends crucially on whether they

can efficiently target the poorest sector of the population. High-income countries have

mainly relied on means testing strategies to gauge this efficiently, but this requires

being able to verify whether incomes have been reported accurately. In a context with

huge levels of informality, as is the case in LAC, incomes are generally unobservable to

program administrators. As a result, developing countries have adopted proxy means

testing mechanisms to assess the poverty status of potential beneficiaries.


This paper compares the performance of these and other alternative mechanisms by

means of a formal model. While means testing may steer workers away from more

productive opportunities in the informal sector, it allows for a more flexible design of

transfers and a greater pro-poor character for a program. On the other hand, proxy

means testing generates no distortions in workers' decisions, but the overall pro-poor

nature of the program is constrained by the ability of observable characteristics to

accurately predict poverty levels. Additionally, since means testing programs do not

provide income support for informal workers, the effect of complementing means

testing with transfers to informal workers is analyzed. When transfers are granted to all

informal workers, the level of filtration to the non-poor is possibly large, while it is not

possible to provide greater transfers to the poorest informal workers. As a result,

indiscriminate transfers to informal workers are a rather inefficient way to reduce the
                                              3
incidence and depth of poverty. Transfers to informal workers assigned through proxy

means testing generates distortions in labor market decisions, a result that contrasts with

the effect of proxy means testing alone.


Finally, this paper considers how the design of redistributive programs affects the budget

constraints of the public sector. Informality diminishes public revenues for a given tax

rate or requires a higher rate for a desired revenue level. Additionally, it makes taxation

of the non-poor and targeting of the poor less efficient, weakening the overall distributive

effect of public programs. These effects are stronger if income support is provided to

informal workers, even by means of proxy means testing. In view of this, this paper argues

that greater reliance on means testing may be suitable in LAC. The main reasons are that

means testing is a more pro-poor design, curbs the size of the informal sector and the

losses in revenues associated with it, and avoids unnecessary filtration to the non-poor.


The next section of this paper discusses methodological issues behind the measurement

of poverty and presents the evidence on poverty in LAC and the rest of the world.

Section 3 studies the role of growth and inequality in poverty reduction, and estimates

the elasticities of poverty with respect to growth and inequality. It also quantifies the

contribution of each of these factors to poverty reduction in LAC. Section 4 uses a

formal model to examine income-support programs for the poor in the context of high

informality, and draws conclusions for improvements in policy design. Finally, Section

5 puts forth the conclusions and implications of the paper.

2.     The evidence

2.1.    Measuring monetary poverty


The measurement of poverty first requires establishing a threshold to distinguish the poor

from the non-poor. Although it is hard to justify such a discontinuity in the welfare

distribution, the practicality and usefulness of poverty lines has been hard to replace.


There are two possible criteria with which to set the poverty line. The first is an absolute

poverty threshold. The logic behind an absolute poverty line requires establishing a

series of needs to be satisfied by means of a basket of goods and pricing this basket.

Caloric intake is a classic element of such baskets. The alternative is a relative poverty

line, which can be defined as a fixed rule of the distribution of welfare. For example, a

relative poverty line may be defined as 50 percent of mean per capita income.


The key difference between these principles is that absolute poverty lines are meant to

identify persons with the greatest needs, while relative poverty lines are conceived to

adjust to their social context. For example, as incomes grow in a country, the relative

poverty line adjusts automatically, reflecting a broadening of the needs that society

considers basic. By comparison, absolute poverty will unequivocally fall as incomes

grow, provided growth is at least partially shared by the lower tail of the income

distribution.


Although most developing countries tend to use absolute poverty lines, there is consistent

evidence that these are influenced by relative factors. The first piece of evidence to

support this claim is that countries with higher incomes tend to opt for higher poverty

lines, even after adjusting for differences in purchasing power, as is shown in Figure 1.

Additionally, after sustained periods of growth, practically the entire population will have



                                             5
overcome a given poverty threshold. When this happens, the poverty rate will remain

stagnant at very low levels. Figure 2 illustrates this point for Chile. After a sustained

period of poverty reduction, the Ministry of Social Development made a substantial

methodological change in how to measure poverty, including an upward adjustment of

the poverty line. Although such changes are generally grounded in changes in spending

patterns of a reference population, development is an undeniable cause of such changes.

Thus, even if not explicitly, poverty lines do adjust to social progress.

As a consequence, differences in national poverty rates reflect not only true differences

in poverty between countries, but also the methodological differences in how poverty is

measured. Making poverty rates comparable therefore requires the use of a uniform

methodology and a line that adjusts for differences in price levels between countries.

The World Bank popularized the use of $1 per-person-per-day poverty line, which has

been updated several times to account for inflation in the United States, reaching

US$1.25 in 2005 and US$1.90 in 2011. The poverty line is adjusted by a factor

reflecting differences in the purchasing power of the U.S. dollar in each country. Thus,

the line is adjusted to each country to reflect the cost of a uniform basket of goods.


Once the poverty line has been set and the poor have been identified, the task that

follows is to build a synthetic index from the distribution of income of the poor.


                                                  7
Following Sen (1976), a poverty index should comply with two axioms. The first is the

monotonicity axiom, which states that a decrease in the income of a person below the

poverty line must increase the poverty index. The second is the transfer axiom, which

states that any pure transfer from a poor person to someone who is richer must result in

an increase in poverty. The headcount ratio does not satisfy either of these axioms,

while the poverty gap does not satisfy the transfer axiom.


Foster, Greer, and Thorbecke (FGT) (1984) propose a family of indexes in the

following form:

                                   
                        1      
                    () =  (1 - ) 1( < ) ,                       0,
                              
                                  =1



where  is the income of person or household  ,  is the poverty line,  is the total

population or number of households, and 1(. ) is an indicator function. When  = 0,

this index is the poverty headcount ratio, while  = 1 delivers the poverty gap. Any

 > 1 will satisfy the transfer and monotonicity axioms. This has popularized the use of

(2) as a poverty index, commonly known as poverty gap squared. This paper uses

poverty lines adjusted for purchasing power parity and poverty indexes from Foster,

Greer, and Thorbecke (1984).


2.2. Evidence of poverty and inequality


Table 1 shows several poverty indicators worldwide and for different developing

regions since 1981. The period has been one of consistent poverty reduction worldwide.

Extreme and moderate poverty have fallen by over 30 and 20 percentage points,

respectively. The decline in extreme poverty has reached a point that this benchmark

has become of little use, and more moderate poverty lines have become the more


                                            8
relevant benchmark. The fall in poverty is evident in all regions and all indicators,

although certain differences prevail. East Asia and the Pacific has been by far the most

dynamic in poverty reduction, while progress has been slowest in relative terms in sub-

Saharan Africa. LAC is consistently ranked in the middle compared to the remaining

regions: while far from the low poverty levels of Europe and Central Asia, it fares

considerably well when compared to regions such as sub-Saharan Africa or South Asia.

Poverty levels seem to be historically similar to those of the Middle East and Northern

Africa, and also similar to those of East Asia and the Pacific in the most recent

measures.

Table 2 shows poverty rates within LAC for the latest years available. As mentioned

when discussing Table 1, extreme poverty is very low for most countries in the region:

only one of the 17 countries has a rate that is over 10 percent, and only five have a rate

above 5 percent. Nevertheless, moderate poverty is still widespread in the region.

Moreover, it can be seen that there is substantial variation in the poverty rates.

  2.3. Drivers of poverty reduction


  The evidence reviewed so far shows a consistent decline in the poverty rate, although it

  does little to explain the drivers behind this trend. Because of the importance of

  understanding the underlying factors behind the decline in poverty, the remainder of this

  section is dedicated to its analysis. Schematically, changes in the poverty rate can have

  three sources, which are explained with the help of Figure 3. Panel A shows an income

  distribution and a poverty line (vertical dashed line). Given that the poverty rate is

  calculated as the percentage of the population below the poverty line, the brown area

  below income distribution and to the left of the line is a graphical representation of the

  poverty rate. Panel B shows us that an increase in the value of poverty line, for example

  because the goods in the basket become more expensive, increases the poverty rate by a

                                                    11
magnitude represented by the red shaded area. This is called the "line effect" and it is a

result of changes in the real value of the poverty line. In Panel C, the income

distribution is shifted to the right representing an even increase in incomes. Before the

income shift, the poverty rate is represented by the brown and red shaded areas, while

only those in the red area remain poor after the income increase. Thus, the brown area

represents the fall in poverty resulting from an increase in incomes, called the "growth

effect". Last, poverty rates can change because the income distribution becomes more or

less egalitarian. These changes are shown in Panel D, where the distribution in red is

more even than that in black. If the income distribution were to evolve from the red to

the black, poverty would fall by the area shaded brown. This is the "distribution effect."

Simple as it is, this logic provides an outstanding framework to understand the drivers

behind the fall in poverty. The following sections are dedicated to studying the growth

and the redistribution components of changes in poverty.1


 2.3.1. Economic growth


Economic growth is generally believed to be a necessary factor behind poverty

reduction strategies, given that there are constraints to income distribution. As incomes

grow, a given poverty line should be accessible to more people. Figure 4 shows the

growth in mean and median incomes adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP) in the

region. The figure shows that all countries experienced at least some growth over the

1981­2014 period. On average, mean incomes grew by 69 percent from their base year

while median incomes grew by 82 percent. Additionally, the figure shows the volatile

history for which LAC is well known. The decade starting in 1990 had mixed results, as

individual country mean growth rates ranged from -2 percent per annum (Venezuela) to

over 3 percent per annum (Chile, Honduras, Panama). In terms of median income, the

growth rates ranged from -2.8 percent per annum (Venezuela and Paraguay) to 4.5

percent per annum (Honduras). In the 2000s, there was strong growth in most countries,

more than offsetting previous declines in incomes. Growth rates at the beginning of the

millennia were quite sensitive to the timing of the crises and in many cases were

inflated as a result of the subsequent recovery, but mean incomes still grew by between

3 to 4 percent per annum in most countries after 2005. Median incomes grew faster, in

the range of 4 to even 6 percent per annum after 2005.

                                                     14
In all, despite several macroeconomic crises, countries in the region have generally gone

through a period of sustained income growth. This growth is expected to have

contributed to the fall in poverty discussed previously.


2.3.2. Inequality


Latin America has long been recognized as a region with comparatively high levels of

inequality. For example, Londoño and Szekely (2000) characterized the region as

having "excess inequality" given that countries in the region have greater inequality

than would be expected for their income levels. Figure 5 illustrates the concept. The

figure shows that inequality in Latin America is higher than in any other region in the

world. Moreover, even the least unequal countries in the region have inequality levels

that would be among the highest in any other region. This shows that inequality is not

only high on average, but also a phenomenon that extends throughout the entire region.


The evolution of inequality is a history of ebb and flow. Table 3 shows that reforms in

the 1990s tended to increase inequality in most countries in LAC. On the other hand,

the past decade of commodity booms and strong economic growth has been

accompanied by a generalized fall in inequality in the region. With the exceptions of

Costa Rica and Paraguay, the decline in inequality over the past decade was enough to

offset the increases in inequality in the earlier period.


One would intuitively believe that the decline in inequality must have contributed to the

decline in poverty. However, the claim that both growth and falling inequality played a

role in poverty reduction is qualitative. A quantitative decomposition of the decline in

poverty into growth and inequality factors would contribute to a more comprehensive

understanding of the process behind poverty reduction. The next section takes on that

task.

3. Decompositions of changes in poverty


There is an extensive series of methods by which changes in poverty can be

decomposed into several possible explanatory factors. One of the simplest

methodologies, which will be employed here, is a regression-based decomposition. The

method consists on estimating a variant of the following equation:


ln( ) =  +  ln( ) +  ln( ) +  +  +  ,                                                            (1)


where  is a poverty index,  is an income index,  is an inequality index,  is a

constant,  and  are time and country fixed effects, and  is an error term. As the

previous expression is written in logarithmic form, the parameters  and  constitute the




                                                    17
elasticities of the poverty rate with respect to income and inequality, respectively. The

coefficient  is expected to be negative, while  is expected to be positive.


Variants of equation (1) are estimated based on data extracted from PovCalNet (2017).

This source provides internationally comparable poverty and inequality indexes and

data regarding consumption and income adjusted for purchasing power parity.

Adjustments were made to the data given that the indexes reported are based on the

distribution of income for some countries, on consumption for others, and on both for

others. We used the countries for which both income and consumption indexes were

available to calculate the average ratio between the two and then use this correcting

coefficient to countries for which only income-based indexes were provided. All

countries for which at least two observations were available were kept in the final

sample. The final dataset obtained consists of an unbalanced panel of 135 countries with

data from 1984 to 2014, and the results of estimating equation (1) are shown in Table 4.

Columns (1), (4), and (7) show the results for the full sample of 135 countries; columns

(2), (5), and (8) exclude 19 high-income countries from the sample; and columns (3),

(6), and (9) limit the sample to countries in LAC. The upper panel shows the results for

the US$1.9 PPP poverty line, while the lower panel uses the US$3.2 PPP line. Poverty

indexes used are the headcount ratio (columns 1-3), the poverty gap (columns 4-6), and

the poverty gap squared (columns 7-9).

                 The elasticities of both growth and inequality have the expected sign throughout the

                 different estimations. At around -2, the growth elasticity of poverty is similar to that of

                 previous studies (Ravallion and Chen 1997; Ravallion 1997; Kraay 2006). Exclusion of

                 high-income countries has a minimal effect on the parameters estimated when compared

                 to the full sample. However, restricting the estimation to LAC countries has a notable

                 effect on the coefficients. The table shows that the effectiveness of growth for poverty

                 reduction becomes much smaller for all poverty indexes except for the poverty gap

                 squared with the US$1.9 line. Additionally, inequality reduction is more effective in

                 reducing poverty in LAC than in the other countries. Table A1 in the Appendix shows




                                                                       19
the same results using median consumption instead of the mean. The results remain

largely similar in spite of this change.


Higher-than-average inequality is a key factor that explains the difference in

coefficients between LAC countries and the full sample. For example, the effect of a

small change in income on the poverty rate is the density of the income distribution

around the poverty rate. Under certain simplifying assumptions on the distribution of

income, high inequality generates a low density around the poverty line, and therefore a

low income elasticity of poverty (Bourguignon, 2003). Empirical evidence is consistent

with this explanation (Ravallion, 1997). Additionally, falling inequality generates a

proportionally greater reductions in poverty in a place where inequality is high, because

this implies larger transfers from rich to poor.


We now assess the quantitative impact of growth and inequality for each country. Table

5 shows the LAC countries in the sample and the change in the poverty rate, income,

and inequality expressed in log points. The growth (inequality) effect is calculated as

the product of the change in log points in income (inequality) and the elasticity featured

in Table 4. The mean change in the poverty rate is -1.11 log points, while the growth

and inequality effects average -0.97 and -0.12 log points, respectively. These

magnitudes indicate that growth has been responsible for the bulk of poverty reduction,

although inequality has also played a role. The decomposition of the remaining poverty

indexes is featured in the in Tables A2-A6 in the Appendix. These show that the growth

effect accounts for between 70 and 90 percent of the change in the poverty rate, while

inequality explains around 12 percent.

     These estimates lead to the conclusion that growth has been the central element behind

     poverty reduction in LAC. This is not because declines in inequality are ineffective in

     reducing poverty. Quite the contrary, Table 4 suggests that the elasticity of poverty with

     respect to inequality is rather large. The reason seems to be that countries in the region

     have failed to reduce inequality substantially over long periods of time.


     Despite the fact that both factors facilitate overcoming the poverty threshold, there is

     still a nucleus of poor people for whom that progress is elusive. This is because they

     may be incapable of building the assets (tangible or otherwise) to benefit from these

     trends. What is more, persistent poverty interferes with the proper upbringing of

                                                          21
children, generating an intergenerational transmission. Long-term strategies for poverty

reduction therefore require complementing growth and fostering equality, without

affecting grow much, with poverty alleviation for the core of the poor population.

Unfortunately, adequate identification of this population is quite a challenge, so the

following section is dedicated to this issue.


4. Poverty alleviation programs and targeting


Sustained economic growth does not automatically spill over to the entire population.

Capitalizing on growth often requires the correct set of skills and opportunities, which

many may lack. Those incapable of capitalizing on growth may even be done a

disservice by it, as growth puts pressure on the prices of vital goods, such as food and

land in locations with better access to these opportunities.


The persistence of these inequalities has long been a rationale for poverty alleviation

programs based on ethical grounds. Given that structural factors impede a permanent

improvement in the standard of living, programs such as food stamps, subsidized

housing, and income support have typically been implemented to mitigate the effect of

poverty. Moreover, poverty status may also inhibit proper investments in health and

schooling of children ­ investments that are socially desirable in the long run. This

argument adds an efficiency basis for poverty alleviation, and these concerns have

explicitly been taken into account in the design of income-support programs such as

conditional cash transfer (CCT) programs, which are popular in LAC and require

compliance with specified schooling and health criteria for children.


Successful targeting in any poverty alleviation program depends on the possibility of

correctly identifying of who is poor and who is not. High-income countries generally



                                                22
rely on employment outcomes to determine eligibility for welfare programs. For

example, workers who lose their job qualify for unemployment insurance, workers

earning less than a given threshold are entitled to tax credits, and so on. Ownership of

assets may also be taken into account to determine eligibility, for example, as is the case

of Medicaid in the United States.


However, employment-based criteria have traditionally been considered unsuitable for

welfare programs in LAC because of the region's large informal sector. Table 6 shows

the informal economy in relation to GDP. Roughly one-third of economic activity in

LAC is informal. Table 7 shows informality rates in labor markets. With an unweighted

average of 49.9 percent and a minimum of over 30 percent, informality is widespread

across the region. In this context, programs like unemployment insurance are virtually

impossible to monitor given the difficulty of distinguishing the unemployed from

informal workers. What is more, although there is a correlation between informality and

poverty, and an inverse correlation between informality and income, these relations are

not very strong. Informality rates are large even for middle- and high-income families,

and income testing alone would generate a large filtration of public resources to the

non-poor.

Given that employment outcomes are an unreliable targeting mechanism in LAC,

alternate mechanisms have become necessary, as will be discussed in the following

section.



                                                   24
4.1. Targeting in highly informal economies


As discussed earlier, poverty alleviation programs include a broad range of transfers,

some in-kind, others in the form of discounts or refunds (i.e., distortion of relative

prices), and also some in cash. Additionally, income-support programs have eligibility

requirements that aim to reduce filtrations outside the target population. For poverty

alleviation programs, the most immediate measure of whether persons should receive

benefits is their income or consumption level, which makes means testing a preferred

targeting mechanism. However, administrative agencies have limited power to verify

the income of potential beneficiaries in largely informal economies, and means testing

has been sidelined as a result.


The literature has proposed a number of alternative targeting mechanisms.

Conditionality, for example, has made income-support programs more palatable for

non-beneficiaries. If people are going to be getting money, the reasoning goes, they

might as well be expected to do something in return. Besley and Coate (1992) argue that

conditionality works as a targeting mechanism, as those whose time is too valuable to

dedicate to compliance will self-exclude themselves from the program. Conditionality is

widely used in LAC, but this design feature has probably more to do with encouraging

investments in the human capital of children than with screening the poor from the non-

poor.


In a paper that compares the targeting efficiency of different program designs, Alatas et

al. (2012) empirically assess whether community-based targeting performs better than

proxy means testing and a hybrid mechanism in a field experiment. They find that

community-based targeting performs worse than proxy means testing overall, although

it performs slightly better at identifying the poorest. However, even though proxy


                                             25
means testing performs better, the authors find that communities where the community-

based mechanism is used are more satisfied with the outcome. They also find that a

reason for this is that communities have an objective function that is more

comprehensive than simply a household consumption level.


At the extreme on the trade-off between inclusion and exclusion errors are universal

basic income programs. Hanna and Olken (2018) discuss this format in detail, finding

several shortcomings in this design. Typically, one would expect individuals to have a

positive marginal tax rate, even at low levels of income, and even if universal basic

income generates a negative average tax rate for them. However, this is difficult to put

into practice in countries where a relatively small fraction of the population pays taxes,

because the rest are either exempt or informal. Furthermore, they argue that eligibility

requirements not only have an effect on the tradeoff between inclusion and exclusion

errors, but also on the size of transfers families end up receiving. There is a point where

more lenient eligibility implies that a given mass of resources has to be distributed

among more families, generating decreasing marginal effects on welfare. In LAC,

policymakers have relied heavily on proxy means testing as a targeting mechanism, to

the point where proxy means testing has become an "industry standard" (De Wachter

and Galiani 2006). Following Barr (1998), proxy means testing has a number of

advantages compared to means testing: it does not discourage work effort as much,

under some circumstances it requires less information, and it provides a stable

assessment of a family's quality of life. Moreover, proxy means testing is especially

useful in countries with a high degree of informality, where means testing is unreliable.


However, proxy means testing has its detractors. For starters, there is growing concern

regarding its actual efficiency. Stampini and Tornarolli (2012) show that the targeting

efficiency of CCT programs in LAC has waned as these programs have grown (Table
                                            26
8). Although targeting errors are inevitable, large errors will negatively affect the

programs' poverty reduction effect, and may also generate a sense of unfairness,

especially if the program relies on a scoring system that is difficult for the average

person to understand. Moreover, programs with large errors may be hard to redesign, as

leakages to the middle class increase support for the program.

                                              28
The next section develops a simple model to assess the targeting efficiency of different

mechanisms in a context where workers can choose to work in the formal or informal

sector. Overall, the conclusions are quite intuitive and illustrative of the agenda going

forward for research and policy.


4.2. A model of targeting efficiency


This section is dedicated to examining the targeting efficiency of several alternative

mechanisms in situations where workers have employment opportunities in the formal

as well as the informal sectors. The difference is that income is unverifiable in the latter,

and therefore policymakers cannot use it in means testing. It is assumed that there is a

mass  of public revenue to be allocated to transfers with the goal of minimizing a

poverty index given a poverty line of  . Alternative programs can be evaluated along

several dimensions. The first dimension is targeting efficiency, which looks at whether

the program can be designed so as to transfer income to poor workers. The second is the

degree to which the program generates economic distortions, measured as the changes

in labor decisions induced by the program. As will become clear, distortions in labor

decisions reduce the overall effectiveness of a program, even if all beneficiaries are

poor.


Both the poverty gap and the poverty gap squared are considered as the relevant

indexes. The poverty gap is a very intuitive index, where targeting efficiency of a

program simply comes down to how much it can increase the average income of poor

families. However, when studying optimal policies, the poverty gap leads to infinite

solutions, making comparisons difficult. For this reason, the analysis will be

complemented with the poverty gap squared, which assigns a greater weight to targeting




                                             29
the poorest of all. This is a valid concern for policy design and a realistic feature of

social preferences.


It is assumed that there is a unitary mass of workers who are characterized by two

random variables: a wage in the formal sector  , and a wage in the informal sector  .

When discussing proxy means testing, an additional feature will be added to workers,

but this is not necessary for now. Workers will choose the sector that grants them the

greatest income after transfers, which vary depending on the setup of each transfer

program. For analytical convenience, it is assumed that the distributions of wages are

uniform and independent:


 ~[0,  ]
       



 ~[0, ]
      


 | ~[0, ]
        



 | ~[0, ]
         .


Moreover, it is assumed that  >  , so incomes in the formal sector dominate those in

the informal sector in a first-order stochastic sense. Although this assumption is largely

unnecessary for this paper, it is included because it is a realistic feature of labor

markets. Note that absent any transfer program, workers will choose whatever sector

generates greater income for them.2 Hence the following expression corresponds to the

distribution of wages after the choice of sectors:


() = ( <    < )


() = ( < )  ( < )


                                              30
() =  2 / (   )
               if  <     < 
                            ,


where the second expression holds because the distributions of wages are independent

and the last expression arises after replacing the appropriate cumulative density

functions. It is assumed that  <  and  <  , so () =  2 / (   )
                                                              is the

functional form of the cumulative density function in the space that is relevant for

measuring poverty. The poverty gap and poverty gap squared that would result absent

any public program are given by:

         
                 3
                 
 =  ( - )() =
   0          3   . 



          
                                    4
                                    
 =  ( - )2 () =                         .
         0                       6   . 
                                       



4.2.1. Optimal targeting


It is assumed that observing wage opportunities in both sectors implies that the transfer

can be a function of available jobs in the formal and informal sectors. Let   ( ,  ) 

0 be the functional form of the optimal transfer. Naturally, the structure of the optimal

function will depend on the welfare measure used. First, the poverty gap is considered

as the objective function and the properties of an optimal transfer function are

enunciated in the following proposition.3


Proposition 1. A function   ( ,  ) minimizes the poverty gap if the following

conditions hold:


i.     If   ( ,  ) > 0,  =  { ,  } +   ( ,  )  

             
        0 0   ( ,  )( ) ( ) =  .
           
ii.


                                            31
Proposition 1 indicates that the transfers can only be positive for poor workers who do

not cross the poverty line as a result of the transfer. The second condition simply states

that all the money available is spent. As it turns out, there are an infinite number of

functions that can meet these criteria. However, when the poverty gap squared is

considered as the objective function,   (. ) has a unique functional form. Again, this

result is shown in the form of a proposition.


Proposition 2. The function   ( ,  ) that minimizes the poverty gap squared has the

following form:


                                  - { ,  }   > { ,  }
                    ( ,  ) = {                        ,
                                    0        


where  = 3
         3      
                 and  < .


In this case, the optimal function raises the income of everyone below  to this level,

and  is set to the value at which the budget restriction is exhausted. The reason for this

is that the marginal decrease in poverty is greater the lower the income, and therefore it

is always optimal to increase transfers to the poorest families. Additionally, note that the

function in Proposition 2 satisfies the conditions in Proposition 1, and so this function

also minimizes the poverty gap.


For completeness, the expression for the poverty gap (PG) and the poverty gap squared

(PGS) are shown below.


         3 -  3
        
  =
           3


          4 - 3 (4
                    - 3)
  =                      .
                 6


                                             32
Rather than focusing on the expressions of the poverty gap and the poverty gap squared,

greater emphasis will be placed on the form of the transfer functions and the effects they

generate. It is understood that unless a transfer function can satisfy the conditions

expressed in Propositions 1 and 2, the resulting poverty gap and poverty gap squared

will be greater than these values. The study of possible transfer programs will begin

with a universal program.


4.2.2. A universal transfer program


A universal program is perhaps the simplest welfare program that is feasible to apply.

The mass of workers was normalized to equal one, and each worker gets a transfer  .

Thus, the support of the distributions is shifted as follows:


 ~[,   + ]
      



 ~[,  + ].


The cumulative density function for wages is now:


 () = ( - )2 /(  )
                    > .


Now, the expressions corresponding to the poverty gap and the poverty gap squared are:

               ( - )3
 =  ( - ) () =
               3   . 
                     


                                    ( - )4
 =  ( - )2  () =                           .
                                    6   . 
                                          


One can see that the effect of the universal program on both poverty indexes is identical

to that of a reduction in the poverty line by a magnitude of  . The universal program is


                                             33
very inefficient in terms of targeting, a result that resembles the discussion by Hanna

and Olken (2018) on universal basic income with a high minimum taxable income. This

is because everyone receives the transfer, regardless of whether they are above or below

the poverty line. However, the universal program generates no distortions: all workers

choose the same sector that they would have chosen absent the program. Although

universal programs perform poorly in terms of poverty reduction, the fact that they do

not affect labor choices is a positive feature of these types of programs. Given that the

deficiency of the universal program is the large number of filtrations, the next section

looks at a means testing scheme, where it can be ensured that all beneficiaries are poor.


4.2.3. Means testing transfer program


Means testing programs rely on direct indicators of the standard of living to determine

eligibility. In practice, means testing programs may take into account factors such as a

person's assets or rental income. For the purpose of simplicity, it is assumed that the

means assessment relies exclusively on the income earned in a formal sector job. If

formal income is below the poverty line, the worker is granted income support. Since

wages in the informal sector are unverifiable, only formal workers are eligible for the

public transfer.


It is assumed that workers in the formal sector are entitled to a transfer that is a function

of their reported wage, ( ). For purposes of simplicity, it is assumed that all poor

workers get a positive transfer that is proportional to the distance from the poverty line:


( ) = ( -  )   >  ,


where   [0,1] is a parameter that determines the degree of phasing out of the

program. Since only formal workers are eligible for the transfer and workers choose the

                                             34
formal sector if  + ( ) >  , the following expression shows how the cumulative

density function changes as a result of the transfer:


             ((1­ )  +  <    < )     <  < 
 () = {
                ( <    < )             


             (w 2 - )/ [(1 - b)    ]
                                                            <  < 
 () = {              2                                            .
                     / (    )                                 


Additionally, the cost of the program is represented by the following expression, which

can be equated to  to find the (maximum) value of :


                                 3     2
                                    (
       (1-)+
                                     6+ 3)
            
                     ( -  )
                              =           .
 0   0                 
                                      


The discussion now turns to the intuition behind the welfare effects of this type of

policy. By design, only poor workers get the transfers, no worker crosses the poverty

line as a result of the transfer, and all money is spent if  is chosen appropriately. One

may be tempted to believe that this type of transfer is optimal in the sense described by

Proposition 1. Unfortunately, this is not so. The reason is that many workers sacrifice

better employment opportunities in the informal sector to become eligible for the

transfer. This is a distortion caused by the welfare program. Figure 6 shows that the

after-transfer distribution of income dominates the distribution absent a program in a

first-order-stochastic sense, but the pre-transfer distribution is dominated by the

distribution absent a program. Thus, the effectiveness of the program in terms of

reducing the poverty gap is partly offset by the foregoing of productive jobs in the

informal sector.

Note: MT: means testing.


In terms of the poverty gap squared, it is noteworthy that because one can choose  >

0, this transfer mechanism has a clear pro-poor nature. However, wages are not

equalized for the poorest and the overall effect is therefore suboptimal unless the budget

is sufficient to lift everybody out of poverty. Moreover, even if one allowed for a more

flexible functional form, the poverty gap squared under optimal targeting would still be

unattainable. Again, the reason for this is that the transfer program channels workers

away from more productive jobs in the informal sector.


In spite of this, it is clear that poverty falls as measured by both indexes. The expression

of the poverty gap and the poverty gap squared is


                       3      1
             3
                   1 - 2   + 2   3
        =

                                                36
It is easy to verify that these indexes are smaller than corresponding ones absent means

testing, and poverty is reduced as a result of the program. An interesting question is

whether universal programs can reduce poverty more than means testing programs. In

terms of the poverty gap, it seems logical that means testing is more effective because it

generates no filtration to the non-poor. However, it is technically possible that, if

filtration is low (e.g., because practically everyone is poor) or if distortions caused by

means testing are large, then a universal program may be more effective at reducing the

poverty gap than a means testing program. In terms of the poverty gap squared, this is

again possible, but more unlikely because the design of the transfer is more pro-poor

under means testing.


4.2.4. A proxy means testing program


To consider the effect of a proxy means testing program, it is assumed there is a series of

subsets  = {1 , 2 , ... ,  } that constitute a partition of the space of possible wages. The

proportion of members in each group is  , with   = 1. Figure 7 is a graphical

representation of such possible subsets.

    Figure 7. Graphic representation of the distribution of wages and characteristics




Let us assume that the government transfers  to all members of group  and that the

transfer is only conditional on belonging to the group, may differ between groups, and

may be equal to zero. The poverty indexes that arise from the transfer are:

                                  
                              ( +  ) (| )  ,
                            =1 0



where () = ( - ) 1{ > } for the poverty gap, and () = ( - )2 1{>

} for the poverty gap squared. Let () denote a series of transfers for groups

{1 , 2 , ... ,  }. De Wachter and Galiani (2006) show that the optimal targeting rule

corresponds to the following expression:



                                           38
                            
  () = arg max  (0 () - ( +  ) (| ) -  )  ,                                 (2)
              ()



where  is a parameter that can be scaled so that total spending equals available

revenue. Intuitively, this rule says that positive transfers must be assigned to groups for

which poverty reduction is larger than  .


Note that the proxy means testing program generates no distortion in the formality

decision, as wages are not taken explicitly into account when determining the transfer.

Thus, in terms of targeting efficiency, proxy means testing programs must be at least as

good as universal programs, as granting every group the same transfer is feasible within

this framework. The reason for this is because it has been assumed that  is strictly

exogenous. The implications of potentially endogenous characteristics will be discussed

in the following section.


Given a value , the transfer to a group will fall the greater the share of non-poor

members if (. ) is the poverty gap, or the higher incomes are in a group if (. ) is the

poverty gap squared. Figure 8 illustrates a case where members of group   receive

larger transfers than those of group   in spite of the fact that many the poorest workers

belong to group   . This is because the poorest workers are undistinguishable from

other non-poor workers, and the high degree of inclusion errors outweighs the benefits

of granting the poorest a greater transfer.

Overall, the targeting efficiency of proxy means testing depends on whether the space of

characteristics  can separate the poor from the non-poor and identify the poorest, in

particular. The following propositions determine conditions under which proxy means

testing minimizes the poverty gap and the poverty gap squared:

                                                          
Proposition 3. Assume there is a subset  = {1 , 2 , ... ,  }   such that all workers

in  are poor. Additionally, assume there exist a series of transfers ( ) such that

                                         
{ ,  } + () for all workers    , and =1 ( )   =  . Then, ( )       


minimizes the poverty gap.


Proposition 4. Let  be the same value found in Proposition 2. Assume there is a series of
                            
subspaces  = {1 , 2 , ... ,  } such that


                 
1 = [0,    ]  [0, ]
                 




                                           40
                          
2 = [0, 2    ]  [0, 2 ] - 1
                     


...

                             
 = [0, ]  [0, ] - 1 - 2 -  - -1 .


Additionally, assume a transfer function () = (|) for all    . If 

approaches infinity, then the transfer function is efficient.


Once again, the conditions set by Proposition 3 seem reasonable. In fact, the greatest

requirement is that the space of characteristics identifies a subset of the poor population;

it requires neither identifying all the poor people nor separating the poor from the non-

poor. However, as argued in Proposition 1, these conditions seem feasible only because

the poverty gap is imperfect as a poverty measure. On the other hand, conditions set by

Proposition 4 are unrealistic, as these conditions imply being able to infer the wage

level of all of the poorest workers.


4.2.5. The combination of multiple programs


Both means testing and proxy means testing programs can leave poor families without

support. In this context, it is common for policymakers to combine these types of

programs to ensure that more poor families receive at least some coverage. This section

considers the effect of combining different programs to cover this gap, starting by

considering the basic structure of the means testing program in Figure 9. Note that the

poor families who do not receive income support belong to the informal sector (shown

in dark orange), and the goal is therefore to study transfer programs that are conditional

on informality.




                                             41
                       Figure 9. Poor workers and income support




As has been argued previously, targeting efficiency is maximized if income support can

be made a decreasing function of income. However, because incomes in the informal

sector are unobservable, this is not feasible. Instead, one first considers combining the

means testing program with a lump-sum transfer for all informal workers. As readers

can probably guess, this program is likely to be rather inefficient, especially if there is a

large number of informal workers who are non-poor. As a consequence, this section

also examines the effects of combining the means testing program with a proxy means

testing for informal workers.


Because these programs are more general than means testing, they can trivially do as

well as means testing in terms of poverty reduction. However, the model predicts that


                                             42
conditioning income support on informality tends to increase the latter. In the context of

the model, this is not particularly disturbing, but in reality, the costs associated with

informality are likely to be much larger than those shown here.


A means testing program with a transfer to informal workers


The section examines the case of combining a means testing program with lump-sum

payments to informal workers. It is again assumed that workers choose a sector and are

granted income support equal to  ( ) =  + (1 - ) if  <  , or a lump sum

of  if they choose the informal sector. Assuming  <  , Figure 10 shows how

workers allocate themselves into the formal and informal sectors. One can see that,

compared to the case where there is no transfer to informal workers ( = 0), the

inclusion of the second transfer encourages more workers to choose the informal sector.

       . 
                 6    2   2


Note that this is a generalization of the cost of the means testing program; a value of

 = 0 delivers the same expression seen previously. Additionally, the cost of transfers

to informal workers is given by:

            (1 - )   2

The appropriate expressions for the poverty gap and the poverty gap squared are given

by:

                         3   3

Given that the goal is to minimize the poverty index, one can find an optimal solution

by choosing  and  that minimizes these poverty measures subject to the budget

            ( ( ,   ) +  ( ,   )) /                ( ( ,   ) +  ( ,   )) /


There are at least two problems with combining these policies, which can be seen in

Figure 10. The first is the possibility that many informal workers are non-poor, and

therefore the program will have a large number of filtrations (i.e. leakages). The second

is that the transfer to informal workers increases the incentive to join this sector, both

for poor and non-poor workers. As a consequence, transfers to informal workers are an

inefficient mechanism to provide income support to poor and informal workers, and

given these issues one would expect  to be rather small. These undesirable properties

can be mitigated by means of a proxy means testing transfer to informal workers, which

is discussed in the following section.


A means testing program with a proxy means transfer to informal workers


In examining the effect of proxy means testing programs, we argued that their overall

effectiveness in terms of poverty reduction depends on the empirical relation between

observable characteristics and income. When a set of characteristics are a good

predictor of low income, a large transfer can be assigned to this group to reduce

poverty. In this case, the total effect of proxy means testing as a complement to means

testing is more complex because many workers will be eligible for both subsidies and

will only be able to choose one. Moreover, the proxy means testing complement will

generally induce workers to choose the informal sector relative to the case where

income support is provided by means of a means testing program alone.


Because the effect of the proxy means testing complement depends crucially on the

relation between the observable characteristics and income, it is hard to generalize

results. Instead, we examine the effect of proxy means testing complements by studying

                                             45
three cases of different possible relations between characteristics, income, and formality

status.


Case 1: Observable characteristics identify poor informal workers


Figure 11 shows the case where observable characteristics identify workers who under a

means testing program alone would be poor and informal. In this case, workers with

characteristics   would receive a subsidy that is conditional on being informal and

holding these characteristics. The magnitude of the subsidy will depend on the specific

welfare measure used and on how poor workers in  are relative to the rest of the poor.

Relative to the case of means testing alone, one see that in this case there is no effect on

formality.




                Figure 11. Characteristics identify poor informal workers




                                             46
Case 2: Observable characteristics identify very poor formal workers


Figure 12 shows the case in which observable characteristics identify the poorest

families. In this case, it is more efficient to give informal workers with characteristics

  a large subsidy. This is because these characteristics are strong predictors of poverty,

and therefore making transfers to this group is very efficient. Moreover, while the

means testing transfer has a limited capacity to transfer income to these people (the

maximum transfer is  ), policymakers have much more discretion to make transfers

by means of proxy means testing. As a result, the expected transfer for this group would

be rather large. However, Figure 12 also shows the undesirable consequences of giving

this group a large subsidy: these workers would mainly choose the informal sector in

order to qualify for the lump sum payment.




              Figure 12. Characteristics identify very poor formal workers


                                             47
Case 3: Observable characteristics identify nearly non-poor formal workers


Finally, Figure 13 shows a situation where the observable characteristics identify

workers who are poor but are on the verge of graduating from this status. In this case, it

is optimal not to grant workers with characteristics   any additional transfer. Rather,

if negative transfers are feasible, it may even be optimal to reduce the transfers to   in

order to increase the budget available for the remaining poor. Given that the possibility

of using proxy means testing transfers is discarded, there are no additional effects

regarding the choice between sectors relative to a stand-alone means testing program.




           Figure 13. Characteristics identify nearly non-poor formal workers




                                            48
4.2.6. Welfare programs and the budget restriction of the government


The analysis so far has assumed that the budget available for redistribution was given.

This extension to the model shows that raising revenues has several adverse

consequences in the presence of a large informal sector. Since taxes can only be borne

by formal workers, these workers will tend to switch towards the informal sector as the

government raises tax rates, dampening revenues. The government will either have to

raise taxes further or make do with the diminished revenue. As a result, both the excess

in taxation and the slack of revenues will serve as a measure of the costs of informality.


As previously, it is assumed that workers choose the sector that generates the largest

disposable income. It is assumed that formal workers pay taxes at a uniform rate  and

all workers who are poor receive a transfer with the same structure as the former

example. Hence, disposable income (utility) for formal workers is:


 =  (1 - ) +  ( ),


where


           [ - (1 - ) ]            > (1 - )
 ( ) = {                                    .
                  0                 (1 - )


For informal workers, utility is given by their wage and a transfer for all non-registered

workers. Hence, disposable income for informal workers is:


 =  +  .


Workers choose the formal sector whenever  >  and choose the informal sector

otherwise. Hence, the ratios of informal and formal workers are given by:




                                            49
     1  1    2 1 -          
 =         {        + ( +      ) ( -  +  )}
     2  .      1 -        1 - 


            = 1 -  .


The goal is to find the expression for the budget restriction of the public sector. Because

both public revenue and spending on the means testing program depend on the

distribution of wages in the formal sector, one must first find the expression for the

latter. Its corresponding cumulative density function is:


( )

    1                                                 
      {  [ (1 - )(1 - ) + 2(  -  )]}      0   <
     2                                              1 - 
    1     1                                           
=     {1 + ( -       ) [(2 - ) - 2 ]}            <       +  ,
          2     1 -                      1 -        1 - 
              1                             
                {2 + }                          +         
  {                                        1 - 


where


         
1 =           [(1 - ) + 2( -  )]
      2(1 - )


       1   -          
2 = 1 + (     +  ) [(     +  ) (2 - ) - 2 ].
       2 1 -         1 - 


We are now ready to write the budget restriction of the public sector, starting with the

expression for public revenue, bearing in mind that only the formal sector is taxed:


                                                                   
           1                                                            +
 =             
                   1-   [ (1 - )(1 - ) + 
                  {0                      -  ]  + + 1-
                                                                              [2 (2 -
    .          
                                                                   1-



                                     1                       2
) - 2 - (2 - ) 1- ]  + +  2  [ 2 - (1-
                                       -  ) ]}.




                                            50
Finally, the spending side of the budget restriction is as follows:

                    
        1    1-
     =      [    - (1 - ) ] [ (1 - )(1 - ) +  -  ]  +   .
        . 
            0



There are two factors to be discussed in this setting. The first is the effect of taxation.

From the expression of  one can see that informality rises with . This is because

workers are prone to choose the informal sector where they avoid taxation. However,

this narrows the tax base. Moreover, workers who are switching between sectors at the

margin are wealthier as the tax rate increases, and taxation is also less progressive as a

result. The endogenous limitations to tax collection contrast with those discussed in

Hanna and Olken (2018), whose setup emphasizes that a high minimum non-taxable

income prevents tax collection from middle income workers, but in which tax collection

is nevertheless pro-poor.


The second factor is the effect of transfers on informal workers in this context. Given a

tax rate, increases in transfers to informal workers both further narrow the tax base and

increase the number of non-poor informal workers. As a result, transfers to informal

workers negatively affect both sides of the government budget constraint: revenues are

reduced and spending is made less efficient. This contrasts with the effect of transfers to

formal workers, which underpin the size of the formal sector and public revenues. In

addition, the change in formality choice of workers due to taxation generates intricate

efficiency effect. This is a factor to be taken into account in programs that intend to

widen the tax base, starting from one of relatively high level of minimum untaxed

income discussed in Hanna and Olken (2018).


Figure 14 schematically shows the differences between the case in which public revenue

is given and the case with taxation. The blue dashed line shows the frontier between

                                             51
formal and informal workers under taxation, while the red line shows the same frontier

absent taxation. One can see that the blue line is to the left of the red line, indicating

there is more informality. Moreover, the gap between the blue and red lines widens to

the right, indicating that even well-off workers choose the informal sector in order to

avoid being subject to taxes, implying less progressive taxation. Finally, because more

poor workers are now in the informal sector, they are not eligible for means-tested

transfers, which are more pro-poor than general transfers to informal workers. As a

result, spending is targeted less effectively.

This section discusses targeting by proxy means testing in the context of taxation. First

to be discussed is the case where income support is provided through proxy means

testing alone. Relative to the case where the revenue was given, more workers choose

the informal sector to avoid taxation, reducing funding available for income-support

programs. The first effect of taxation is therefore to reduce the overall program size.

Additionally, the size of the program also affects how transfers are allocated to

characteristics. The lower budget will affect mainly those who are poor but not the

poorest of all groups. Figure 15 shows the case of two groups of characteristics,   and

  , where both groups are poor but the former is poorer. The toll of the diminished

revenue will mainly affect group   , while it will have a smaller effect on group   .

                                            53
Next to be considered is the case in which formal workers are targeted by means testing

and informal workers by proxy means testing. The introduction of taxation in this case

implies that the benefit of joining the informal sector for workers is twofold. The first

benefit is that of avoiding taxation. The second is the possibility of receiving transfers

assigned by proxy means testing. However, from the point of view of the policymaker,

the first of these is a cost, and the second will also have an opportunity cost if the

beneficiary is not poor. For policymakers, introducing taxation implies that the costs of

transfers rise, but they do so more steeply for inclusion errors than exclusion errors. As

was the case previously, policymakers will be inclined to implement smaller programs,

given the higher cost of redistribution.


4.2.8. Program comparison and discussion


Having laid out the basic features of each program, the next section compares those

programs. Of the several arrangements discussed, it was found that the means testing

program allows for a pro-poor transfer design but channels workers away from

productive jobs in the informal sector, which partly offsets the impact of the transfers.

Transfers in the proxy means testing program do not generate distortions, but the pro-

poor character of the system of transfers is constrained by the existing relation between

poverty and observable characteristics.


The extent to which a proxy means testing mechanism is pro-poor is a question that is at

first empirical. The evidence presented previously indicated that classification errors

were rather frequent, and this should tilt the balance in favor of means testing programs.

However, in practice poor families often work in the informal sector, and this motivates

policymakers to promote income support outside the formal sector. The model here

indicates that the most general effect of income support to informal workers is an


                                             54
increase in the size of this sector. The effectiveness of these complementary programs in

reducing poverty depends on the relation between informality and poverty if support is

conditional on informality or, once again, between the strength of the correlation of the

observable characteristics available and poverty if support is assigned by means of a

proxy means testing design.


Additionally, workers tend to switch to the informal sector as a way to avoid taxation,

and governments then require higher tax rates to achieve a desired revenue level

compared to a case without an informal sector. Unlike the discussion presented by

Hanna and Olken (2018), the difficulty of phasing out a universal basic income program

in this model does not come from a high non-taxable minimum income, but rather as a

result of endogenous choice from workers.


If transfers are made to informal workers, more people are encouraged to choose the

informal sector to qualify for the subsidy. Unless the relation between informality and

poverty is extremely close, the level of filtration is large and the income received by the

poor is diluted in the mass of informal workers. This is a general feature of expanding

the base of eligibility for social programs (Hanna and Olken, 2018), with an additional

distortion generated by the switch in sector. A similar logic applies to proxy means

testing transfers: filtration implies that the cost of inclusion errors rises sharply, and

policymakers would be more tolerant of exclusion errors. As a consequence, the

redistributive capacity of the government is more constrained in these circumstances.


5. Conclusions

From a long-term perspective, Latin America and the Caribbean has benefited from a

substantial decrease in the incidence and depth of poverty. However, when compared to



                                              55
other developing regions, LAC has performed in line with its peers and experienced

declines in poverty that are far from extraordinary. The main driver behind this fall in

poverty has been economic growth ­ not because reducing inequality is ineffective but

rather because it has not been consistently achieved over the period studied. Still,

growth is a channel that operates over the long run, and even when it facilitates

improving the living standards of many poor people, spillovers to all are not

straightforward. For those of whom improvements are elusive, poverty alleviation in the

form of income-support programs is necessary.


To assess the effectiveness of income-support programs, this paper built a formal model

where workers have working opportunities in both the formal and informal sectors, and

examined how means testing programs compare to proxy means testing programs.

Because means testing programs are more flexible, a pro-poor design is possible, while

the pro-poor character of proxy means testing programs is constrained by the relation

between observable characteristics and poverty. However, implementation of means

testing programs may be problematic if there is underreporting of income at the

intensive margin. Meanwhile, the relation between observable characteristics and

poverty is not stable over time, which may weaken the targeting efficiency of proxy

means testing programs, and these programs are more distortive in a context where

raising revenue for redistribution is necessary.




While proxy-means-testing is the industry standard for developing economies, means-

testing is much more widespread in the developed world. The ability of a government to

observe incomes is a leading factor in determining the targeting design. It is possible

that if developing countries continue on the growth path that they have experienced the


                                            56
last several decades, they will eventually acquire the capabilities that are necessary for

means-testing programs. If this is so, the transition from proxy-means-testing to means-

testing will be a natural one.


On the other hand, a more skeptical view would suspect that the existing structure of

transfer programs affects the aforementioned process in some way, possibly slowing it.

Additionally, one would also wonder whether a safety net designed for informal

workers will hold them back in informality, and whether this retention has implications

for human capital acquisition and long-run growth.


A central feature to this dichotomy is the effectiveness of policies to affect the formality

decisions of workers. In particular, are subsidies and tax incentives sufficiently large to

pull a significant amount of the labor force into the formal sector? Moreover, will

complementary reforms be necessary to ease the burden of formality on firms, and

should special consideration be given to smaller firms, or those that are typically

believed to have complying with these requirements? Finally, there is the question of

whether proxy-means-targeting and means-testing programs will have to coexist during

the hypothetical transition, and, if so, what this coexistence should be like.

1
  Since we use measures of growth that are adjusted for differences in the purchasing power of the dollar,
the line effect is nil by default. The alternative would be to factor out changes in purchasing power from
the growth effect based on exchange rate movements and differential inflation, which generate changes in
the value of lines expressed in real domestic currency. However, we disregard this calculation as the
common practice is to express welfare in a purchasing-power-parity-adjusted measure.
2
  Clearly, there are other factors that affect workers' utility and, hence, decisions as to whether to work in
the formal or informal sector (Galiani and Weinschelbaum 2012). They are not included here just for
purposes of simplicity.
3
  Both Propositions 1 and 2 hold when R is small enough that there is still poverty after the transfers.
