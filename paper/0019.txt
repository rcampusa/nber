                                       Abstract


         The median operative workload of seven general surgeons comprising

    the general surgical staff of a prepaid group practice of 158,000

    enrollees was 9.9 hernia equivalents [HE] per week. The value was

    over three times that of a previously studied population of 19 general

    surgeons in fee-for—service community practice, and approximated a

    consensus standard of a full surgical workload. The median complexity

    of o7erations was 1.00 HE. similar to the community practice, and evidence

    suggested the most complex operations were handled by the surgeons with

    the most training. 3.6i.'   of   operations were performed on an ambulatory

    basis. The results suggest that the prepaid group practice under study

    possesses administrative mechanisms to efficiently utilize both general

    surgeons and the resources devoted to general surgery.
.                                    Introduction

           Prepaid group practice has been shown to be associated with

    economies in the delivery of surgical services. These economies have

    resulted from reduced rates for all inpatient operations, with operative

    rates markedly reduced for certain procedures.4 (A recent study of

    utilization patterns of union members in a prepaid group practice

    versus a fee—for—service setting found this difference in operative

    rates to be less clear cut than in previous studies.5) To date, no

    attempts have been made to assess the utilization of surgeons who

    comprise the staffs of prepaid group practices. There has been one

    attempt to measure the utilization of internists in three prepaid group

    practices and to compare that with a population of internists in a fee—

    for—service setting.6 This study did not show any increased productivity

    associated with prepaid group practice. Studies by economists in non—

    prepaid group practices have suggested that, at best, only modest

    productivity gains may be associated with group practice. They have

    also suggested possible areas of increased inefficiency in group

    settings due to decreased incentives to control costs.79 In view of

    the   previously   demonstrated economy of decreased operative rates in

    prepaid group practice and in view of the incentives in prepaid group

    practice toward the efficient utilization of scarce resources, this study

    was designed to Investigate whether there are any ecoromies in the

    utilization of surgeons in such a setting.

    A recently developed methodology allows for the measurement of the

workloads of surgeons0 The methodology expresses the operative work

of surgeons in terms of hernia equivalents (HE). One hernia equivalent

is defined as the amount of work involved in the operative and in the pre—

and post—operative care of a patient undergoing an adult unilateral

ingulnal herniorrhaphy. A consensus of surgeons from a variety of

practice settings has suggested that a weekly workload approximating

10 HE would comprise an active surgical practice yet still leave time

for continuing education.'° A recent study of the workloads of 19

general surgeons in fee—for—service, community practice showed thet the median

weekly workload was 3.1 HE, less than one third of the suggested

standard0 The size of these workloads suggested an underutilization

of the precious skills of these surgeons and an excess capacity of

general surgeons in this particular community.

     To investigate whether a prepaid setting may have an effect in adjusting

the supply of surgeons to the demand for surgery in a defined population,

the weekly workloads of seven general surgeons who comprise the entire

general surgical staff of a prepaid group practice of 158,000 enrollees

were measured for a recent six month period. The workloads measured

comprised those operations performed in the operating room of the prepaid

group practicets hospital on both hospitalized and ambulatory patients.

Surgery performed in the surgeon's office was not recorded. The

workloads of these seven surgeons were then compared with those of tne

previously studied population of nineteen general surgeons practicing

in a suburban community in the New York metropolitan area.

                                    Methods


    Methodology Employed:

         Hughes et al. have demonstrated that the relative values for

    surgical procedures in the California Relative Value Studies are valid

    weights that accurately reflectboth the operative and the pre— and

    post—operative work involved in a procedure°'11 In developing

    their weighting scale, the relative value of an adult iznilateral

    inguinal herniorthaphy was designated as one hernia equivalent o

    surgical work and the relative values of all other procedures were

    ranked as multiples of it. The resulting quotient was termed the

    hernia equivalent (HE) of the procedure. Thus a radical mastectomy

    with a relative value of 70,0, twice that of an inguinal herniorthaphy,

    35.0, may be said to be equiva'ent to 2 HE of surgical work. In order

    to account for some of the increased work involved in an operation

    with more than one procedure, a relative value equal to twenty per

    cent of the first secondary procedure in such an operation was added

    to the relative value of the primary procedure to arrive at a total

    HE for the operation.

         In the present study, heri4a equivalent values were assigned to

    all of the operations performed in an operating room during a given

    six montn period by the seven surgeons
                                             com,risjng the general surgical

    staff of the prepaid group practice. Weekly workloads for inpatient,

    ambulatory, and total operations were calculated. The vorkloads were adjusted

    for seasonal variation and extrapolated for a 48—week working year. The
                                  —4—


complexity of operations performed (HE/operation) was also determined for

each surgeon, for each classification of operation, and for the entire

population of operations. The specific operations performed by the

surgeons were enumerated.

     The findings were then comiared to those of a study of 19 general

surgeons in community practice. The workloads of the surgeons in community

practice contained only Inpatient operations. The comparison of the

workloads of the two populations of surgeons is facilitated by the fact

that the surgeons in the community performed very few ambulatory procedures

and, for the most part, admitted as inpatients those patients who were

treated on an ambulatory basis In the prepaid group practice.


Population of Surgeons:

     The seven general surgeons were graduates of American medical schools

and were all certified by the American Board of Surgery. Two were also

certified by the American Board of Thoracic Surgery. The surgeons

 ranged in age from 40 to 56, with mean age of 47.6 years.    The mean

 duration of association with the prepaid group practice was 11.7 years, with
                                              surgeons performed all the general
 a range of from 5 to 20 years. These seven
                                                                      of
 surgery presenting from the enrollees of the plan with the exception
                                                      which was referred to
 open—heart, plastic, and transplantation surgery,

 surgeons outside the prepaid group.    It was the policy of the prepaid

 group that general surgeons not perform surgery from the specialties of

 gynecology, otolaryngology, or orthopedic surgery.     That surgery was handled

 by appropriate specialists within the prepaid group.    in the community previously


 studied, the general surgeons performed surgery from these specialties.

 During the period of the study, the seven surgeons did no surgery outside
                                       —5—



the   prepaid setting and very little surgery on non—enrollees was performed

within that setting. It was the opinion of the surgeons that enrollees of

the prepaid group underwent very little surgery outside the group, other

tnan for the specific procedures which were referred out. The particular

prepaid health care plan owned its      own hospital.
       In the prepaid practice under study, the surgeons were compensated according

to a formula based on the number of years they have been associated with

the group, the duration of their residency training, and the number of

years of their experience before joining the group. Compensation was not

related to the workloads produced. The general surgeon to population

ratio in tne prepaid group practice at the time of this study was 4.4/

100,000, a low ratio compared to other prepaid group practices, which

ranged from 5.6 to 12.4/100,000, and 45% of the ratio of the U.S. in general
              *12
(9.8/100,000).       the   general   surgeon to population ratio in the fee—

f or—service community was 10.1 surgeons to 100,000 population, roughly

comparable to that of the United States as a whole at the time of that

study.




  This        excludes general surgical interns and residents. With them
         figure
included as surgical specialists, the ratio of general surgeons to
population in the United States in 1970 was 13.1/100,000.

                                  Results


         During the six months of observation, the seven general surgeons

 performed 1,523 operations with 377 secondary procedures, totaling

 l,43.6 HE of surgical work. Of these 1,523 operations, 1,163 (76.4)

 were performed on an inpatient basis and 360 (23.6%) on an ambulatory

 basis. These operations account for 94.6% and 5.4% of the total surgical

 work.

     The mean total weekly workload in the population of surgeons was

 9.1HE per week, close to the consensus standard for a full workload of

 10 HE, elaborated in the community study (Table I). The median weekly

 workload was 9.9 HE. Although four of the seven surgeons were producing

 at or modestly above the consensus standard, there was variation among

 the individual surgeons such that the weekly workload of the lowest

 producer (6.8 HE) was 65% that of the highest (10.5 HE).

     The size of each surgeon's workload was a function of both the frequency

 and the complexity of his operations in both the inpatient and ambulatory

 settings. The frequency and the comp1eity of inpatieut procedures

were greatly in excess of those in the ambulatory setting and were the

major determinants of the size of a surgeon's total workload. In fact,

 in no case did a surgeon's inpatient HE comprise less than 89% of his total work-

load. The volume of each surgeon's inpatient workloads was determined

equally by the frequency and the complexity of his operations. The frequency

of inpatient operations per surgeon ranged from 4.8 to 8.3 per week, with

a mean of 6.9. The surgeon with the highest frequency of inpatient

procedures was only the third highest producer. Inpatient operations

were distributed among the surgeons in such a way that the highest mean

HE per inpatient operation (1.68 HE) belonged to the highest overall

producer, and was 75% more complex than the mean of the surgeon performing

tne least complex work (0.96 HE), the second lowest producer. The

median complexity for inpatient operations by surgeon was 1.27 1I.E. The freuen•

of weekly ambulatory operations per surgeon ranged from 1.1 to 3.5, with

a mean of 2.2. The mean complexity of ambulatory operations by surgeon

ranged from 0.17 to 0.29, with a median value of 0.23. The mean complexity

of all operations by surgeon was 1.02 1-IE and the median complexity

0.97 NE.

     Though all the surgeons performed operations ranging in complexity

from relatively minor ambulatory procedures as resection of skin lesions

 (0.16 HE) to major inpatient work as abdominal—perineal resectlons (2.86 HE),

 the distribution of mean HE per inpatient operation by surgeon tends to

 suggest that there was some specialization among the surgeons in the handling

 oftheirwork. This impression is supported by the fact that, of the 17 operations

 more complex than 4.0 liE (vascular surgery), all but 3 were performed by

 surgeons A and D. These were the two surgeons certified in thoracic surgery.

 Further support for specialization among the surgeons is found in a negative

 correlation (r=—0.4) between the volume of each surgeon's inpatient and

 ambulatory workload. This would tend to indicate that there was some

 specialization among the surgeons in the handling of ambulatory as well

 as inpatient cases.

      Comparing the prepaid group surgeons with the 19 general surgeons

 in community practice studied earlier (Table 2), we note that the median
                                                        times that of the
 workload of the prepaid group surgeons is over three

 community surgeons. The distribution of workloads among the community

 surgeons was such that 16 out of the 19 surgeons in that setting had

 workloads less than the lowest workload observed in the prepaid group (6.8 HE).

It is interesting to note, however, that the workload of the highest

producer in the fee for service setting was 13.0 HE per week, 124% that

of the higiest producer in the prepaid group. In the prepaid group practice,

the workloads were distributed more evenly among the surgeons than in the

community——the coefficient of variation of mean weekly workload was 0.18

in the prepaid group vs0.73 among the community surgeons.

     In the community, a surgeon's age and the number of his hospital

affiliations were found to be significantly correlated with his workload.

In tnis prepaid group practice setting, however, neither a surgeon's age

nor his number of years with the group were significantly correlated with

his surgical workload; and a surgeon's hospital affiliations was not a

relevant variable. A possible reason for the absence of a relationship

between age and workloads in this prepaid group may be the relatively

small range in age of the surgeons in this setting. The prepaid group

surgeons ranged in age from 43 to 56 years, while the community surgeons

ranged from 35 to 69 years. The mean age of the surgeons in the two settings,

48years in the prepaid group and 52 years in the community, did not differ

markedly. The distribution of ages in each setting differed, however,

such that nine of the community surgeons were older than the oldest surgeon

                                               would seem to be at that point in
in the group (56 years). These nine surgeons
their careers where workloads might fall off most sharply. Indeed, it would

appear that this older age distribution in the community might account for

some of the difference in the median workload between the two settings.

As indicated in Table 2, the median weekly workload of the 10 community surgeons

 equal to or less than 56 years old was 5.3 HE per week. This value is

 about 30% closer to the median in the prepaid group of 9.9 per week than the

 overall community median of 3.1 per week, but still 46% less than that value.

     The iistribution of all,   opratioas   and of ambulatory operations in

the prepaid group practice by complexity is given in Figure 1. Forty—six percent

of all operations are less complex than an inguinal herniorrhaphy (1.00 kj)

and 79>. are less complex than a ch9lecystectomy l,7l HE).     Only 6% of the

surgery is more complex than a partial gastrectomy (2.29 HE) and 2% mqre

complex than an abdominal—perinea]. resect4ón (2.36 HE). Particularly

striking in Figure 1 are the high peals at 0.1—0.3 HE (resection of skin

lesion) and at 1.0 RE (inguinal herpiorrhaphy). More than two—thirds of the

operations in the range of 0.1—0,3 HE were performed on an ambulatory

basis. Ambulatory operations, comprising 23.6% of al,1 operations,

accounted for 50.2% of operations less complex than 1 HE. Ninety—four

per cent of ambulatory procedures were less complex than 05 HE and all

bu two (vein strippings) less complex thIn 1 HE.


     The mean and median complexity of operations in the prepaid group

practice, l.Dl HF and 1.00 H1 per operation, were not substantially

different from those values found i the fee—for-service community

practice, 0.95 HE and 0.94 HE per operation respectively (Table 2).

Figure 2 compares the frequency distribution of all operations

performed in the prepaid group practice with that of inpatient operau.ous

performed by the community surgeons. (Though the

community study contains only inpatient surgery, the comparison of the

two populations of operations are, in the aggregate, appropriate or the

reasons previously stated,) With a few exceptions, the distributions are

quite similar. The first exception is the fact that 33% of all surgery

in the prepaid group occurs i the 0.1—0.5 range as opposed to 24% in

the community. The large volume of surgery in this range in the

prepaid group practice is, in large measure, accounted for by the

procedure, resection of lesion of skin (0.16 HE), which comprises 17%

of all the operations in the prepaid group practice and 53% of surgery

within this range. It is tempting to speculate that some of the difference

between the two settings in the volume of the workloads in this range

stems from the fact that the community surgeons were probably performing

an additional number of these relatively straightforward procedures in their

private offices. Accordingly, these procedures would not appear in

their inpatient workloads. There is not, in the prepaid group setting,

a facility exactly comparable to a surgeon's private office.

     The second exception appears in the range of 0.4—0.8 HE where

there is a greater relative frequency of cases in the community as

compared to the prepaid group. This is largely a result of the fact

that 8.0% of the surgery performed by the general surgeons in the

community was in the categories of tonsillectomy with and without

adenoidectomy, and dilation and curetage. The HE values for these two

categories of procedures are 0.5 HE and 0.43 HE, and they account for

42% of operations in that range. In the prepaid group, all of this

surgery is performed by surgeons in specialties other than general

surgery and accordingly does not appear in the workloads of the general

surgeons. Finally, two per cent of cases in the group setting are in

excess of 29 HE, as compared to 0.5% of cases in the community. The

resulting skewed tail of the prepaid group curve includes the substantially

larger number of complex vascular cases, clustering about 4 HE, in

that setting.

     Despite the differences enumerated above and the fact that the

 two curves were found to be significantly different at the 1% level by

 the Ko1mogorov_Smiflov test, it is important to note two important
                                 —11—


similarities between the surgey performed in each setting. In both

settings, operations in the range of complexity from 1—2.3 RE account

for almost half of all surgery and are simjlaly distributed within

that range. Also, the five most frequently performe4 operations in both

settings: inguinal herniorrhaphy, resection of skin leion, cholecystec—

tomy, appendectomy and breast biopsy/partial mastectomy, are identica.,

accounting fçr 50% of all operations in the pepaid group and 36% of all
operaUons in the community.

                              Discussion


     The prepaid group practice under study appears to be achieving

economies in the delivery of surgical services through: (1) the relatively

hign volume of the workloads of its general surgeons, (2) the rationing

of surgical. resources to handle specific procedures, and (3) the utilization

of an ambulatory modality for the performance of almost 1 in every 4

operations.

     A median weekly workload approaching 10 HE suggests that the skills

of this population of seven general surgeons are being more efficiently

utilized than those of a previously studied population of 19 general surgeons

in community practice. At the time this study was performed, five years

had passed since a new surgeon had been added to the group. During that

time, the number of enrollees had grown by over sixty per cent. This fact

suggests the possibility of a previous underutilization of or of a

present rationing of surgeons' services through a number of means. In

this light, it would be worthwhile knowing where the prepaid group practice

stood, at the time of the study, in relationship to the equilibrium between

tue supply of surgeons and the demand for surgery. Shortly after the

completion of this study, the prepaid group added an additional general surgeon.

The addition of this surgeon would imply that the surgeons in this study

perceived their current workloads as approaching a maximum for a desirable

workload. Assuming that the addition of a new surgeon entailed no change in

the incidence of surgical procedures in the group enrollees, a 12.5%

diminution in the mean workload per surgeon would be expected. Interesting

information as to the dynamics of the surgical staffing of prepaid group

practices could be gathered by analysis of workloads of surgeons over time

 in relationship to increases in the number of enrollees and in the number
                                    —1.3—



of   surgeons. It woul.d be impprtant to couple such information with analysis

of   the non—operative tasks performed by surgeons in prepaid groups to see
jf variations In the    surgeon to population ratio are associated with

variations    in the amount of non—surgical work performed and, in the case

of general surgeons, associated with changes in the frequency of the per—

formance of non—general surgical procedures. A study of the non—operative

tasks of the general surgeons In this       prepaid group is currently undeway.
       It   is interesting to note that the seven general surgeons in this

particular prepaid group practice maintained thejr high workloads despite

the fact that their compensation was not related to the volume of their

individual workloads. This finding is ip line with the hypothesis that the

success of prepaid group practice in delivering medical care at lover cost

may be a function of the type of physicians attracted to such a setting as

well as a function of the prepayment mechanism itself.9"3

       It's important to note that the findings in this study are not,

per se, generalizable to other prepad group practices. The general

surgeon to population ratio n the particular pepaid group practice was
                                                   12
kept low as compared to other prpaj.d groups.           It would appear,

however, that the prepaid group practice modality of organizing the

delivery of surgical care, as exemplified in this particular setting,

provides the necessary administrative controls that enable the supply of

surgeons for a defined population to be adjusted to the actual

demand fpr surgery from that population. Similar controls might

also be found in non—prepaid group practices and in foundations for

medical care. It would be worthwhile studying the surgical vorkloads of

surgeons both in other prepaid group practices with differing surgeon o

population ratios and in other forms of organized practice to elucidate the
                                 —14—




impact of various forms of organization on surgeon utilization.   The

importance of the ratio of surgeons to population is further exemplified

by the fact that if the surgeon to population ratio in the fee—for—service

community previously studied were the same as that in the prepaid group,

and if the total volume of surgery performed in the conununitv remained irn—

changed, the mean operative workload of the community surgeons would be

9.9 HE per week, approximating that in the prepaid group practice.

     A further benefit in this pai.icular prepaid group practice Is the

fact that the two surgeons with the most specialized post graduate training

(tiioracic surgery residency training) were able to utilize their skills

in tne performance of complex vascular work——for the most part, aneurysms of

the abdominal and thoracic vessels. This finding was reflected in the fact

that these two surgeons had the two highest mean complexities for inpatient

operations. This economy might also entail the possibility that, in view of

the relative frequency with which these two surgeons were performing this

 type of work, the patients undergoing these operations were receiving

an increased quality of care. This is in contrast to the community of

 19 general surgeons where it was noted that the few complex cases per-

 formed during the year of study were scatteredalmost at random among the

 surgeons with no regard to their qualifications. A further quality of

 care benefit may acrue to the enrollees of the prepaid group from the practice

 of having specialty surgery performed only by specialists trained in that

field.

      Pernaps the most substantial economy in the delivery of sur;ical

 services in the prepaid group practice is the handling of 24% of all

 cases on an ambulatory basis. The prepayment mechanism in prepaid group

 practice encourages practices as this. In the fee for service community,

 however, hospitals can receive no compensation for unfilled beds or for

 unused operating rooms and the patient can receive little, if
any, compensation for elective surgical work performed in a doctor's

office. The pressures from both directions work toward the hospitalization

of patients for minor surgical procedures.       Fifty per cent of cases

chosen for ambulatory work were less complex than 0.5 HE, a range of

complexity that would, for the most part, appear to create no undue

 to the patient. Were almost one in four operat.ons in otter prepaAd group

settings to be performed on a similar ambulatory asig, such a practice

would appear to account for much of the difference noted in the rates of

hospitalized surgical procedures between health p]an members enrolled in

prepaid plans vs those receiving care in feelor—service settings5

The efficacy of the practice of am1ulatory surgery      is becoming
Increasingly recognized. In recent years, a number of ambulatory

surgical services have arisen in medical settjngs with favorable

results and hints of major cost savings. 14—17     The economic nature of

the ambulatory practice in this prepaid group is further heightened

br the fact that the operations were performed in a regular hospital

operating room. Thus, this practice entailed the use of a facility that

would otherwise be Idle and did not require the construction of a

special facility.


     The similarity of the frequency distributions of the operations in

the group practice and in the community and the similarity of the ranking

of specific procedures in each setting is worth noting, especially in view of

previous studies showing decreased rates, and at times markedly

decreased   rates,   for surgical procedures in prepaid vs. fee for gervice

settings.    To a large extent, these decreased rates have been demonstrated
for otolaryngologic and gynecologic operations which do not fall within
                                —16—


the workloads of the general surgeons in the prepaid group practice.

The similar frequency distributions in the range 1.0 to 2.3 HE suggest

that general surgery of middle level complexity is performed   in the same


proportion in the two populations. Studies are now underway to ascertain

the incidence of specific general surgical operations in the two settings.
