The ‚Äúgeography hypothesis‚Äù explains most of the diÔ¨Äerences in economic prosperity by
geographic, climatic or ecological diÔ¨Äerences across countries. The list of scholars who have
emphasized the importance of geographic factors includes, inter alia, NiccoloÃÄ Machiavelli,
Charles de Montesquieu, Arnold Toynbee, Alfred Marshall, Ellsworth Huntington, and
Gunnar Myrdal. All of these authors viewed climate as a key determinant of work eÔ¨Äort,
productivity, and ultimately, the success of nations. In a recent influential book, Jared
Diamond (1997) has argued for the importance of the geographic determinants of the Ne-
olithic revolution, and linked modern prosperity to the timing of the emergence of settled
agriculture. He forcefully states that ‚Äúthe striking diÔ¨Äerences between the long-term his-
tories of peoples of the diÔ¨Äerent continents have been... [due to]... diÔ¨Äerences in their
environments‚Äù (p. 405). Similarly, JeÔ¨Ärey Sachs (2001) has argued for the importance
of technology, disease environment and transport costs, which are determined by physical
geography and climate, for example as proxied by distance from the equator.
   An alternative view, which we refer to as the institutions hypothesis, relates diÔ¨Äerences
in economic performance to the organization of society. Societies that provide incentives
and opportunities for investment will be richer than those that fail to do so (e.g., North and
Thomas, 1973, North and Weingast, 1989, and Olson, 2000). This view dates back at least
to John Locke, who argued for the necessity of property rights for productive activities, and
to Adam Smith, who stressed the role of ‚Äúpeace, easy taxes, and a tolerable administration
of justice‚Äù in generating prosperity (quoted in Jones, 1981, p. 235).
   In this paper, we attempt to distinguish between these two broad hypotheses. If geog-
raphy is the key determinant of income diÔ¨Äerences across countries, economic performance
should be highly persistent, since geographic factors have not changed much during recent
history. To the extent that other factors also matter for income, persistence will not be per-
fect, but we should expect relatively rich countries today to have been, on average, richer
100, 200, 500 or even 1000 years ago (see, e.g., Diamond, 1997). Since institutions and
the way that societies are organized are persistent, the institutions hypothesis also predicts
persistence in income levels. Nevertheless, if there is a major change in institutions, then
we should expect a significant change in the distribution of income across countries.
   The expansion of European overseas empires starting at the end of the 15th century
provides an appealing ‚Äúnatural experiment‚Äù to distinguish between these two contrasting


                                              1
predictions. Despite the radical social changes caused in the colonies by the European inter-
vention, the geography view predicts persistence in relative incomes: the same geographic,
climatic and ecological factors making countries prosperous before should also contribute
to prosperity after European colonization. In contrast, if European dominance came with
a major change in the organization of these societies, the institutions hypothesis implies
that there should not necessarily be such persistence.
   Historical and econometric evidence suggests that European colonialism caused not only
a major change in the organization of these societies, but also an ‚Äúinstitutional reversal‚Äù‚Äì
European colonialism led to the development of relatively better institutions in previously
poor areas, while introducing extractive institutions or maintaining existing bad institutions
in previously prosperous places. The main reason for the institutional reversal is that
relatively poor regions were sparsely populated, and this enabled or induced Europeans
to settle in large numbers and develop institutions encouraging investment by a broad
cross section of the society. In contrast, a large population and relative prosperity made
extractive institutions more profitable for the colonizers, for example to force the native
population to work in mines or plantations, or tax them by taking over existing tax and
tribute systems. The institutions hypothesis, together with the institutional reversal caused
by European colonialism, suggests the possibility of a reversal among the former European
colonies: countries that were relatively rich in 1500 should be relatively poor today.
   The major finding of this paper is that there is a reversal in relative incomes among
the former European colonies. For example, the Mughals, Aztecs and Incas were among
the richest civilizations in 1500, while the civilizations in North America, New Zealand and
Australia were less developed. Today the U.S., Canada, New Zealand and Australia are
orders of magnitude richer than the countries now occupying the territories of the Mughal,
Aztec and Inca Empires. This reversal is consistent with the institutions hypothesis, but
not with the geography hypothesis.
   The obvious diÔ¨Éculty in our empirical investigation is lack of data on economic prosper-
ity in 1500. The first contribution of our paper is to justify and use urbanization rates as
a proxy for diÔ¨Äerences in economic prosperity across regions during preindustrial periods.
Bairoch (1988) argues that only areas with high agricultural productivity could support
large urban populations, while de Vries (1976, p.164) emphasizes the necessity of improve-
ments in transportation and fuel technology to provide suÔ¨Écient energy supplies for cities
as they grow. Similarly, many economic historians note that increasing urbanization is as-
sociated with economic development (see, e.g., Bairoch 1988, De Long and Shleifer, 1993,
de Vries, 1984, Kuznets, 1968, Tilly, 1990). We also present evidence that both in the time

                                              2
series and the cross section there is a close association between urbanization and income
per capita.1
       As another proxy for prosperity we use population density, for which there are relatively
more extensive data (McEvedy and Jones, 1978). Although the theoretical relationship
between population density and prosperity is more complex, it seems clear that during
preindustrial periods only relatively prosperous areas could support dense populations.
       With either measure, there is a negative association between economic prosperity in 1500
and today. Figure 1 shows a negative relationship between the percent of the population
living in towns with more than 5000 inhabitants in 1500 and income per capita today (see
below for data details). Figure 2 shows the same negative relationship between population
density (number of inhabitants per square km) in 1500 and income per capita today. The
relationships shown in Figures 1 and 2 are robust‚Äìfor example, they are unchanged when
we control for continent dummies, the identity of the colonial power, and religion, and when
we exclude the ‚ÄúNeo-Europes‚Äù, the U.S., Canada, New Zealand and Australia, from the
sample. There is also no evidence that the reversal is related to geography as proxied by
temperature, humidity, distance from the equator, and whether the country is landlocked.
       While the reversal in relative incomes among the former colonies weighs strongly against
the basic geography hypothesis, it is also important to consider a more sophisticated ge-
ography view, which we refer to as the ‚Äútemperate drift hypothesis‚Äù. According to this
hypothesis, the center of gravity of economic activity has been gradually shifting away from
the equator. In 1500 the tropical areas were relatively rich, and today they are among the
poorest places in the world. It can be argued that areas in the tropics had an early ad-
vantage, but later agricultural technologies, such as the heavy plow, crop rotation systems,
domesticated animals, and high-yield crops, have favored countries in the temperate areas
(e.g., Bloch, 1966, Mokyr, 1990, White, 1962). However, the nature and timing of the
reversal in relative incomes are not consistent with this hypothesis. The reversal in relative
incomes seems to be related to population density before Europeans arrived, not to any
inherent geographic characteristics of the area. Furthermore, according to the temperate
   1
    By economic prosperity or income per capita in 1500, we do not refer to the economic or social
conditions or the welfare of the masses, but to a measure of total production in the economy relative to
the number of inhabitants. Although urbanization is likely to have been associated with relatively high
output per capita, the majority of urban dwellers lived in poverty and died young because of poor sanitary
conditions (see for example Bairoch, 1988, chapter 12).
  It is also important to note that the Reversal of Fortune refers to changes in relative incomes across
diÔ¨Äerent areas, and does not imply that the inhabitants of, for example, New Zealand or North America
themselves became relatively rich. In fact, much of the native population of these areas did not survive
European colonialism.



                                                    3
drift hypothesis, the reversal should have occurred when European agricultural technology
spread to the colonies. Yet, while the introduction of European agricultural techniques, at
least in North America, took place earlier, the reversal occurred mostly during the 19th
century, and is closely related to industrialization. There is also no evidence that geography
either triggered or delayed industrialization.
       Is the reversal related to institutions? We document that the reversal in relative incomes
from 1500 to today can be explained, at least statistically, by diÔ¨Äerences in institutions
across countries. The institutions hypothesis also suggests that institutional diÔ¨Äerences
should matter more when new technologies requiring investments from a broad cross section
of the society become available. We therefore expect societies with institutions of private
property to take advantage of industrialization opportunities, while societies with extractive
institutions, where political power is concentrated in the hands of the small elite, fail to do
so. The data support this prediction.
       We are unaware of any other work that has noticed or documented this change in the
distribution of economic prosperity, or used the experiences of the former colonies to distin-
guish between the geography and institutions hypotheses. Nevertheless, many scholars, in-
cluding Abu-Lughod (1989), Braudel (1992), Chaudhuri (1990), Hodgson (1993), Kennedy
(1987), McNeill (1999), Reid (1988 and 1993), Pomeranz (2000) and Wong (1997), em-
phasize that in 1500 the Mughal, Ottoman and Chinese Empires were highly prosperous,2
but grew slowly during the next 500 years. Coatsworth (1993) and Engerman and SokoloÔ¨Ä
(1997, 2000) document that North America was no more developed than South America in
the early 18th century and the data presented by Eltis (1995) and Engerman and SokoloÔ¨Ä
(2000) suggest that Carribean islands such as Haiti and Barbados were richer than the
United States during early colonial times.
       The link between colonialism and economic development has been emphasized by many
Marxist historians and dependency theorists, for example, Frank (1978), Rodney (1972),
Wallerstein (1974-1980) and Williams (1944). Beckford (1972), Coatsworth (1999) and
Engerman and SokoloÔ¨Ä (1997, 2000) also point out the long-run adverse consequences of
the ‚Äúplantation complex‚Äù and the associated institutions in Latin America. Our approach
diÔ¨Äers from these contributions in two important dimensions. First, we view European
   2
     These authors also present extensive evidence that human capital was high in these countries, probably
at least at the level of Europe in China and all countries with a strong Islamic influence (including parts
of Africa). See, for example, the discussion of Indian textiles and other industries in Chaudhuri (1990,
chapter 10). The craftmanship of these products made them highly desirable in European markets. Aztec
artisanship and architecture was less developed than in Asia, but it still impressed the first colonizers
(Bairoch 1995, chapter 9, Townsend 2000, chapter 9,).



                                                    4
colonialism as a ‚Äúnatural experiment‚Äù potentially distinguishing between the geography
and institutions hypotheses. Therefore, we emphasize not the negative eÔ¨Äects of European
colonialism relative to what would have happened without colonialism, but the diÔ¨Äerential
eÔ¨Äect of European colonialism in some countries compared with others‚Äìsocieties where
colonialism led to the establishment of good institutions prospered relative to those where
colonialism imposed extractive institutions. Second, in our theory the negative eÔ¨Äects of
colonialism do not result from the plunder of the colonies by the Europeans or dependency
as emphasized by Williams, Rodney or Frank, but because extractive institutions stacked
the cards against industrialization. Put diÔ¨Äerently, according to these authors, countries
in Central America, the Caribbean and Africa are poor because of ‚Äútoo much capitalism,‚Äù
whereas in our thesis they are poor because of ‚Äúthe wrong type of capitalism‚Äù.
    Our overall interpretation of comparative development in the former colonies is related
to our previous paper, Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson (2001), where we proposed the
disease environment at the time Europeans arrived as an instrument for European settle-
ments and subsequent institutional development of the former colonies, and used this to
estimate the causal eÔ¨Äect of institutional diÔ¨Äerences on economic performance. The cur-
rent paper has a diÔ¨Äerent focus and a number of innovations relative to our earlier work.
First, our focus here is on the persistence of economic performance, which we argue can
distinguish between the geography and institutions hypotheses. Second, we point out and
document the major reversal in the distribution of economic prosperity among the former
colonies. Third, our thesis here emphasizes the influence of population density and prosper-
ity on the policies pursued by the Europeans, for example, by encouraging labor-oppressive
production methods, and the takeover of existing tax and tribute systems. Finally, we show
that the interaction between institutions and the opportunity to industrialize during the
19th century played a central role in the long-run development of the former colonies.3
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section discusses the construc-
tion of urbanization and population density data, and provides evidence that these are
good proxies for economic prosperity. In Section 3, we outline the geography and insti-
tutions hypotheses and explain why we should expect an institutional reversal resulting
   3
     Our results are also relevant to the literature on the relationship between population and growth. The
recent consensus is that population density encourages the discovery and exchange of ideas, and contributes
to growth. This view goes back to Boserup (1965) and Kuznets (1968), and was elaborated by Simon (1977).
The recent endogenous growth literature also emphasizes the beneficial eÔ¨Äects of high population through
scale eÔ¨Äects (e.g., Aghion and Howitt, 1992, Grossman and Helpman, 1991, Jones, 1997, Kremer, 1993,
Romer, 1986). Our evidence points to a major historical episode of 500 years where high population density
was detrimental to economic development, and therefore sheds doubt on the general applicability of this
recent consensus.

from European colonialism. Section 4 documents the ‚ÄúReversal of Fortune‚Äù‚Äìthe negative
relationship between economic prosperity in 1500 and income per capita today among the
former colonies. Section 5 discusses the temperate drift hypothesis, and presents evidence
against this view. Section 6 documents that the reversal in relative incomes reflects the
institutional reversal caused by European colonialism, and that institutions started playing
a much more important role during the age of industry. Section 7 concludes.

                      2   Urbanization and Population Density

A measure of economic prosperity in 1500 is crucial for our investigation. In this section, we
argue that urbanization and population density provide good proxies for income per capita
and/or productivity, and explain how these data are constructed. More detailed discussion
of data construction and alternative series are provided in Appendix A.

2.1    Data on Urbanization

Bairoch (1988) provides the best single collection and assessment of urbanization estimates.
Our base data for 1500 consist of Bairoch‚Äôs (1988) urbanization estimates augmented by the
work of Eggimann (1999). We also construct a longer time-series for a subset of countries
to study the timing of the reversal and whether there was a similar reversal before 1500.
      Merging the Eggimann and Bairoch series requires us to convert Eggimann‚Äôs estimates,
which are based on a minimum population threshold of 20,000, into Bairoch-equivalent
urbanization estimates, which use a minimum population threshold of 5,000. We use a
number of diÔ¨Äerent methods to convert between the two sets of estimates, all with similar
results. For our base estimates, we run a regression of Bairoch estimates on Eggimann
estimates for all countries where they overlap in 1900 (the year for which we have most
Bairoch estimates for non-European countries). This regression yields a constant of 6.6 and
a coeÔ¨Écient of 0.67, which we use to generate Bairoch-equivalent urbanization estimates
from Eggimann‚Äôs estimates.
      Alternatively, we converted the Eggimann‚Äôs numbers using a uniform conversion rate
of 2 as suggested by Davis‚Äô and Zipf‚Äôs Laws (see Bairoch, 1988, chapter 9, and our data
appendix), and also tested the robustness of the estimates using conversion ratios at the
regional level based on Bairoch‚Äôs analysis. Finally, we constructed three alternative series
without combining estimates from diÔ¨Äerent sources. One of these is based mainly on
Bairoch, the second on Eggimann and the third on Chandler (1987). All four alternative
series are reported in Appendix Table A2, and results using these measures are reported in

Table 5.
       While the data on sub-Saharan Africa are worse than for any other region, it is clear
that urbanization in that region before 1500 was at a higher level than in North America or
Australia. Bairoch, for example, argues that by 1500 urbanization was ‚Äúwell-established‚Äù
in sub-Saharan Africa.4 Yet by 1900, sub-Saharan Africa certainly was less urbanized than
the European settler colonies. Because there are no detailed urbanization data for Africa,
we leave this region out of the regression analysis when we use urbanization data, though
it is included in our regressions using population density.
       Table 1 gives descriptive statistics for the key variables of interest, separately for the
whole world, for the sample of ex-colonies for which we have population density data in 1500,
and for the sample of ex-colonies for which we have urbanization data in 1500. Appendix
Table A1 gives detailed definitions and sources for the variables used in this study.

2.2      Urbanization and Income

There are good reasons to presume that urbanization and income are positively related.
Kuznets (1968, p. 1) opens his book on economic growth by stating: ‚Äúwe identify the
economic growth of nations as a sustained increase in per-capita or per-worker product,
most often accompanied by an increase in population and usually by sweeping structural
changes....in the distribution of population between the countryside and the cities, the
process of urbanization.‚Äù
       Bairoch (1988) points out that during preindustrial periods a large fraction of the agri-
cultural surplus was likely to be spent on transportation, so both a relatively high agricul-
tural surplus and a developed transport system were necessary for large urban populations
(see Bairoch 1988, chapter 1, de Vries 1976, p. 164). He argues ‚Äúthe existence of true urban
centers presupposes not only a surplus of agricultural produce, but also the possibility of
using this surplus in trade‚Äù (p. 11). Moreover, he emphasizes that an increase in agri-
cultural productivity almost always tended to cause increased urbanization: ‚ÄúFor while it
is true that urbanization could not get underway without the concentration of population
and the surplus of food resulting from agriculture, it is equally true that the emergence of
agriculture set in motion forces that sooner or later led to the growth of cities.‚Äù (p. 94).5
   4
     Sahelian trading cities such as Timbuktu, Gao and Djenne (all in modern Mali) were very large in the
middle ages with populations as high as 80,000. Kano (in modern Nigeria) had a population of 30,000 in
the early 19th century, and Yorubaland (also in Nigeria) was highly urbanized with a dozen towns with
populations of over 20,000 while its capital Ibadan possibly had 70,000 inhabitants. For these numbers
and more detail, see Hopkins (1973, Ch. 2).
   5
     The view that urbanization and income (productivity) are closely related is shared by many other



                                                   7
    We supplement this argument by empirically investigating the link between urbaniza-
tion and income. Figure A1 in the Appendix shows the time-series relationship between
urbanization and income per capita for a number of countries. In all cases, changes in
urbanization and income are highly correlated. In Table 2, we provide regression evidence
also pointing in the same direction. Columns 1-6 in Panel A present cross-sectional re-
gressions. Column 1 is for the earliest date for which we have data on urbanization and
income per capita for a large number of countries, circa 1900. The regression coeÔ¨Écient,
0.038, is highly significant, with a standard error of 0.006. It implies that a country with 10
percentage points higher urbanization has, on average, 46 percent (38 log points) greater
income per capita (throughout the paper, all urbanization rates are expressed in percentage
points, e.g., 10 rather than 0.1, see Table 1). Column 2 reports a similar result using data
for 1950. Column 3 uses current data and shows that even today there is a strong rela-
tionship between income per capita and urbanization for a large sample of countries. The
coeÔ¨Écient is similar, 0.036, and very precisely estimated, with a standard error of 0.002.
This relationship is also shown diagramatically in Figure 3.
    Below, we draw a distinction between countries colonized by Europeans and those never
colonized (i.e., Europe and non-European countries not colonized by Western Europe).
Columns 4 and 5 report the same regression separately for these two samples. The estimates
are very similar: 0.037 for the former colonies sample, and 0.033 for the rest of the countries.
Finally, in column 6, we add continent dummies to the same regression. This leads to only a
slightly smaller coeÔ¨Écient of 0.030, with a standard error of 0.002. This result demonstrates
that the correlation between urbanization and income per capita is not driven by diÔ¨Äerences
across continents.
    The second panel of the table is more speculative. Here we use estimates from Gregory
King and Paul Bairoch to construct a small panel data set of urbanization and income per
capita spanning over 200 years with sporadic observations. Columns 7-10 report regressions
scholars. See Ades and Glaeser (1999), De Long and Shleifer (1993), Tilly and Blockmans (1994), and
Tilly (1990). De Long and Shleifer (1993), for example, write ‚ÄúThe larger preindustrial cities were nodes of
information, industry, and exchange in areas where the growth of agricultural productivity and economic
specialization had advanced far enough to support them. They could not exist without a productive
countryside and a flourishing trade network. The population of Europe‚Äôs preindustrial cities is a rough
indicator of economic prosperity‚Äù (p. 675).
   A large history literature also documents how urbanization accelerated in Europe during periods of
economic expansion (e.g., Duby 1974, Pirenne 1956, Postan and Rich 1966). For example, the period
between the beginning of the 11th century and mid-14th century is an era of rapid increase in agricultural
productivity and industrial output. The same period also witnessed a proliferation of cities. Bairoch
(1988), for example, estimates that the number of cities with more than 20,000 inhabitants increased from
around 43 in 1000 to 107 in 1500 (Table 10.2, p.159).



                                                     8
from this dataset. Remarkably, with or without country and period dummies, the estimates
are very similar to those shown in Panel A. They indicate that a 10 percentage point
increase in urbanization is associated with an approximately 40 percent increase in income
per capita. Overall, we conclude that urbanization is a good proxy for income.

2.3     Population density and income

The most comprehensive data on population since 1AD comes from McEvedy and Jones
(1978). They provide estimates based on censuses and published secondary sources. While
some individual country numbers have since been revised and others remain contentious
(particularly for pre-Colombian Meso-America), their estimates are consistent with more
recent research (see, for example, the recent assessment by the Bureau of the Census,
www.census.gov/ipc/www/worldhis.html). We use McEvedy and Jones (1978) for our base-
line estimates, and test the eÔ¨Äect of using alternative assumptions (e.g., lower or higher
population estimates for Mexico and its neighbors before the arrival of Cortes).
      We calculate population density by dividing total population by arable land (also esti-
mated by McEvedy and Jones). This excludes primarily desert, inland water, and tundra.
As much as possible, we use the land area of a country at the date we are considering.
      The theoretical relationship between population density and income is more nuanced
than that between urbanization and income. With similar reasoning, it seems natural to
think that only relatively rich areas could aÔ¨Äord dense populations (see Bairoch, 1988,
chapter 1). This is also in line with Malthus‚Äôs classic work. Malthus argued that high
productivity increases population by raising birth rates and lowering death rates. However,
the main thrust of Malthus‚Äôs work was how a higher than equilibrium level of population
increases death rates and reduces birth rates to correct itself. Therefore, a high population
could also be reflecting an ‚Äúexcess‚Äù of population, causing low income per capita.
      To clarify the main issues, it is useful to express these relationships mathematically. Let
us denote population in country (area) j at time t by Pj (t), land area by Lj , and the level
of multifactor productivity by Aj (which is assumed to be time invariant for simplicity).
Suppose total output Yj is given by Yj (t) = Aj ¬∑ Pj (t)1‚àíŒ∏ ¬∑ LŒ∏j , where Œ∏ ‚àà (0, 1). So greater
population increases output, but because of decreasing returns to land, it does so less than
proportionately. Dividing both sides of this equation by Pj (t), we obtain

                                      yj (t) = Aj ¬∑ pj (t)‚àíŒ∏ ,                               (1)

where y is per capita output and p = P/L is population density. Next, we need an equation


                                                 9
linking growth of population to income per capita. Suppose that this takes the form

                           pj (t + 1) = œÅ ¬∑ pj (t) + Œª ¬∑ (yj (t) ‚àí yÃÑ) + Œµj (t) ,                        (2)

where yÃÑ is subsistence income and Œµ is a random disturbance term. Equation (2) implies
that the rate of growth of population is related to the gap between actual incomes and the
subsistence level of income, and when œÅ < 1, there is also mean reversion in population.
As long as œÅ < 1, there will be a steady-state level of income per capita, yj‚àó , and steady-
state population density, p‚àój , both strictly increasing in productivity Aj . Therefore, cross-
country variation induced by diÔ¨Äerences in productivity or technology will lead to a positive
association between population density and income.
       In contrast, consider two areas with the same productivity, Aj , but one of which has
higher population density because of diÔ¨Äerences in other factors captured by Œµj in equation
(2). Then, equation (1) implies that the country with higher population density will have
lower income per capita. So there is an identification problem: it is unclear whether an
area with higher population density is in fact richer or not.
       When high population density corresponds to lower income because of transitory dif-
ferences, we should observe a subsequent decline in population density in the more densely
settled areas‚Äìpopulation there is above its long-run equilibrium level. We show below that
diÔ¨Äerences in population density before 1500 were highly persistent‚Äìthe more densely set-
tled areas in 1500 were also more densely settled in 1000 or 1AD. This still leaves diÔ¨Äerences
in other factors, leading to permanent diÔ¨Äerences in population density, so caution is re-
quired in interpreting population density as a proxy for income per capita.6
       The empirical evidence regarding the relationship between population density and in-
come is also less clear-cut than the relationship between urbanization and income. Figure
A2 in the Appendix shows that population density and income increased concurrently in
many instances. Nevertheless, there is no similar cross-sectional relationship in recent data,
most likely because of the demographic transition‚Äìit is no longer true that high population
density is associated with high income per capita because the relationship between income
and the number of children has changed (e.g., Notestein, 1945, or Cipolla, 1974).
   6
    A common current interpretation of Malthus is that population dynamics should take all countries
down to the subsistence level. This corresponds to the case in which œÅ = 1 in our framework. In this case,
more productive areas (high Aj ) still have higher population densities, but all areas have the same long-run
equilibrium income per capita, yj = yÃÑ. Although we could still use population density as a proxy for land
productivity and total income, it would not be a proxy for income per capita. However, we believe that
the case œÅ < 1, which implies that there can be long-run diÔ¨Äerences in per capita income across countries,
is more plausible, and consistent with the evidence regarding systematic diÔ¨Äerences in cross-country living
standards before the demographic transition.


                                                     10
      Despite these reservations regarding population density, we present results using popu-
lation density, as well as urbanization, as a proxy for income per capita. This is motivated
by three considerations. First, population density data are more extensive, so the use of
population density data is a useful check on our results using urbanization data. Second,
as argued by Bairoch, population density is closely related to urbanization, and in fact, our
measures are highly correlated. Third, variation in population density will play an impor-
tant role not only in documenting the reversal, but also in explaining it. In any case, the
relationship between population density in the past and income per capita today parallels
the relationship between urbanization in 1500 and income today.

                                      3   Hypotheses
3.1    The geography hypothesis

The geography hypothesis claims that diÔ¨Äerences in economic performance reflect, to a large
extent, diÔ¨Äerences in geographic, climatic and ecological characteristics across countries.
There are many diÔ¨Äerent versions of this hypothesis. Perhaps the most common is the
view that climate has a direct eÔ¨Äect on income through its influence on work eÔ¨Äort. This
idea dates back to Machiavelli (1519) and Montesquieu (1748). During the early 20th
century, the geographer Ellsworth Huntington (e.g., 1915, 1945) pursued this idea further,
and even conducted experiments to show the eÔ¨Äect of climate on work eÔ¨Äort. Both Toynbee
(1934, volume 1) and Marshall similarly emphasized the importance of climate, both on
work eÔ¨Äort, and more generally, on productivity (e.g., Marshall, 1890, p. 195).
      One of the pioneers of development economics, Gunnar Myrdal (1968), also placed
considerable emphasis on the eÔ¨Äect of geography on agricultural productivity. He argued:
‚Äúclimate exerts everywhere a powerful influence on all forms of life,‚Äù and that ‚Äúserious
study of the problems of underdevelopment... should take into account the climate and
its impacts on soil, vegetation, animals, humans and physical assets‚Äì in short, on living
conditions in economic development‚Äù (volume 3, p. 2121).
      Jared Diamond has espoused a diÔ¨Äerent version of the geography view in which the tim-
ing of the Neolithic revolution has had a long lasting eÔ¨Äect by determining which societies
were the first ones to develop strong armies and modern technology. For example, he states
that: ‚Äú...proximate factors behind Europe‚Äôs conquest of the Americas were the diÔ¨Äerences
in all aspects of technology. These diÔ¨Äerences stemmed ultimately from Eurasia‚Äôs much
longer history of densely populated...[societies dependent on food production]‚Äù (1997, p.
358). Diamond argues that diÔ¨Äerences in the nature and history of food production, in turn,


                                              11
are due to the types of crops, domesticated animals, and the axis of agricultural technology
diÔ¨Äusion in diÔ¨Äerent continents, all of which are geographically determined characteristics.
    More recently, JeÔ¨Ärey Sachs has argued for the importance of geography through its ef-
fect on the disease environment, transport costs, and technology. He writes: ‚ÄúCertain parts
of the world are geographically favored. Geographical advantages might include access to
key natural resources, access to the coastline and sea ‚Äì navigable rivers, proximity to other
successful economies, advantageous conditions for agriculture, advantageous conditions for
human health.‚Äù (2000, p. 30). He further suggests that ‚ÄúTropical agriculture faces several
problems that lead to reduced productivity of perennial crops in general and of staple food
crops in particular‚Äù (2000, p. 32), and that ‚ÄúThe burden of infectious disease is similarly
higher in the tropics than in the temperate zones‚Äù (2000, p. 32). Finally, Sachs argues
that the greater population in temperate areas over the past centuries led to more rapid
advances in technologies appropriate for these areas relative to technologies necessary for
development in the tropics (2001, p. 3 and 2000, pp. 33-34, see also Myrdal, volume 1, pp.
691-695).
    It is also useful to distinguish the (simple) geography hypothesis discussed in this sub-
section from a more sophisticated geography view. According to the sophisticated view,
the major role of geography is not through its main eÔ¨Äect, but via an interaction eÔ¨Äect, so
geography will be more important during certain periods.7 We will discuss, and provide
evidence against, a number of diÔ¨Äerent versions of this story in more detail in Section 5, in-
cluding the temperate drift hypothesis which claims that modern (agricultural) technology
has favored temperate areas.
    Despite important diÔ¨Äerences between the various versions of the simple geography
hypothesis, they all share the same persistence prediction: to the extent that geographic
factors do not change over periods of 500 years or more, countries that were relatively rich
500 years ago should be relatively rich today. This prediction holds also when we consider
the period of European colonialism. If climate, transport costs, the timing of the Neolithic
revolution and the impact of disease matter for income today, they should have mattered
at least as much before Europeans came into contact with the inhabitants of the colonies.
    7
      Put diÔ¨Äerently, in the simple geography hypothesis, geography has a main eÔ¨Äect on economic perfor-
mance, which can be expressed as Yi = Œ±0 + Œ±1 Gi , where Yi is a measure of economic performance, and Gi
is a measure of geographic characteristics. In contrast in the sophisticated geography view, the relationship
between income and geography would be Yit = Œ±0 + Œ±1 Git + Œ±2 Tt Git , where t denotes time, and Tt is a
time-varying characteristic of the world as a whole or of the state of technology. According to this view,
the major role that geography plays in history is not through Œ±1 , but through Œ±2 .




                                                     12
3.2     The institutions hypothesis

According to the institutions hypothesis, societies with a social organization that provides
encouragement for investment will prosper. John Locke ([1690], 1980) was perhaps the
first to clearly articulate the importance of property rights for production. Of land and
productive assets, Locke wrote ‚Äú...there must of necessity be a means to appropriate them
some way or other, before they can be of any use, or at all beneficial to any particular man‚Äù
(emphasis in the original, p. 10). He further argued that the main purpose of government
was ‚Äúthe preservation of the property of ... members of the society‚Äù (p. 47). Similarly,
Adam Smith and Frederick von Hayek, among many others, emphasized the importance of
property rights for the success of nations.
      The argument by some Marxist historians, for example Brenner (1976), on whether the
capitalist class had the power to make the transition to capitalist agriculture is also related.
Here the organization of the society, through its eÔ¨Äect on the organization of production,
determines how productive agriculture is and whether new technologies are adopted.
      More recently, economists and historians have emphasized the importance of institutions
that guarantee property rights. For example, Douglass North starts his 1990 book by stating
(p. 3): ‚ÄúThat institutions aÔ¨Äect the performance of economies is hardly controversial,‚Äù and
identifies eÔ¨Äective protection of property rights as important for the organization of society
(see also North and Thomas, 1973, Olson, 2000).
      To put our later results into context, it is useful to be more specific about the meaning
of ‚Äúgood‚Äù social organization/institutions. We take a good organization of society to cor-
respond to a cluster of institutions ensuring that a broad cross section of the society has
eÔ¨Äective property rights. We refer to this cluster as institutions of private property, and
contrast them with extractive institutions, where the majority of the population faces a
high risk of expropriation by the government, the ruling elite or other agents. Two require-
ments are implicit in this definition of institutions of private property. First, institutions
should provide secure property rights, so that those with productive opportunities expect
to receive returns from their investments, and are encouraged to undertake such invest-
ments. The second requirement, which we believe is equally important, is embedded in the
emphasis on ‚Äúa broad cross section of the society‚Äù. A society in which a very small fraction
of the population, for example, a class of landowners, holds all the wealth and political
power may not be the ideal environment for investment, even if the property rights of this
elite are secure. In such a society, many of the agents with the entrepreneurial human
capital and investment opportunities may be those without eÔ¨Äective property rights pro-


                                               13
tection. In particular, the concentration of political and social power in the hands of a
small elite implies that the majority of the population risks being held up by the powerful
elite after they undertake investments. This is also consistent with North and Weingast‚Äôs
(1989, p. 805-806) emphasis that what matters is: ‚Äú... whether the state produces rules
and regulations that benefit a small elite and so provide little prospect for long-run growth,
or whether it produces rules that foster long-term growth‚Äù. Whether political power is
broad based or concentrated in the hands of a small elite is crucial in evaluating the role of
institutions in the experiences of the Caribbean or India during colonial times, where the
property rights of the elite were well enforced, but the majority of the population had no
civil rights or eÔ¨Äective property rights.
      The organization of society and institutions also persist (see, for example, the evidence
presented in Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson, 2001). Therefore, the institutions hypoth-
esis also suggests that societies that are prosperous today should tend to be prosperous in
the future. However, if a major shock disrupts the organization of a group of societies, we
should expect much less persistence. Historical evidence suggests that European colonial-
ism led to the establishment of, or continuation of already existing, extractive institutions
in previously prosperous areas and to the development of institutions of private property in
previously poor areas. Therefore, European colonialism led to an institutional reversal, in
the sense that regions that were relatively prosperous before the arrival of Europeans were
more likely to end up with extractive institutions under European rule than previously
poor areas. The institutions hypothesis, combined with the institutional reversal, predicts
a reversal in relative incomes among these countries.

3.3     The institutional reversal

The historical evidence shows that, while in a number of colonies such as the U.S., Canada,
Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong and Singapore, Europeans established institutions
of private property, in many others they set up or took over already existing extractive
institutions. Examples of extraction by Europeans include the transfer of gold and silver
from Latin America in the 17th and 18th centuries and of natural resources from Africa
in the 19th and 20th centuries, the Atlantic slave trade, plantation agriculture in the
Caribbean, Brazil and French Indochina, the rule of the British East India Company in
India, and the rule of the Dutch East India Company in Indonesia. The distinguishing
feature of these institutions was a high concentration of political power in the hands of
a few who used their power to extract resources from the rest of the population. For


                                               14
example, the main objective of the Spanish and the Portuguese colonization was to obtain
silver, gold and other valuables from America, and throughout they monopolized military
power to enable the extraction of these resources. The mining network set up for this
reason was based on forced labor and the oppression of the native population. Similarly,
the British West Indies in the 17th and 18th centuries was controlled by a small group of
planters (e.g., Williams, 1970, Dunn, 1972, chapters 2-6). Political power was important to
the planters in the West Indies, and to other elites in the colonies dominated by plantation
agriculture, because it enabled them to force large masses of natives or African slaves to
work for low wages.
       Europeans running the Atlantic slave trade, despite their small numbers, also had dis-
proportionate power in Africa. The consensus view among historians is that the slave trade
fundamentally altered the social organization in Africa, leading to state centralization and
warfare as African polities competed to control the supply of slaves to the Europeans.8
       What determines whether Europeans pursued an extractive strategy or introduced in-
stitutions of private property? And why was extraction more likely in relatively prosperous
areas? Two factors appear important:

1. The economic profitability of alternative policies:             When extractive institutions were
more profitable, Europeans were more likely to opt for them. High population density, by
providing a supply of labor that could be forced to work in agriculture or mining, made
extractive institutions, with political power concentrated in the hands of a small elite, more
profitable. For example, the presence of abundant Amerindian labor in Meso-America was
conducive to the establishment of forced labor systems, while the high population in Africa
created a profit opportunity for slave traders, supplying labor to American plantations.
       The experience of the Spanish conquest around the La Plata river (current day Ar-
gentina) during the early 16th century gives an example of how population density aÔ¨Äected
European colonization (see Lockhart and Schwartz, 1983, pp. 259-60, or Denoon, 1983,
pp. 23-24). Early in 1536, a large Spanish expedition arrived in the area, and founded
the city of Buenos Aires in the mouth of the river Plata. The area was sparsely inhabited
by non-sedentary Indians. The Spaniards could not enslave a suÔ¨Écient number of Indians
   8
    Manning (1990, p. 147) describes this situation as follows: ‚Äúwith the allure of imported goods and the
brutality of capture, slave traders broke down barriers isolating Africans in their communities. Merchants
and warlords spread the tentacles of their influence into almost every corner of the continent. By the 19th
century, much of the continent was militarized; great kingdoms and powerful warlords rose and fell, their
fate linked to fluctuations in the slave trade.‚Äù There are many detailed studies of diÔ¨Äerent parts of Africa
supporting this claim. See for example, Wilks (1975) for Ghana, Law (1977) for Nigeria, Harms (1981) for
the Congo/Zaire, and Miller (1988) on Angola.


                                                    15
for food production. Starvation forced them to abandon Buenos Aires and retreat up the
river to a post at Asuncion (current day Paraguay). This area was more densely settled by
semi-sedentary Indians, who were enslaved by the Spaniards; the colony of Paraguay, with
relatively extractive institutions, was founded. Argentina was finally colonized later, with
a higher proportion of European settlers and no forced labor.
       Other types of extractive institutions were also more profitable in densely settled and
prosperous areas, where there was more to be extracted by European colonists. More
important, in these densely settled areas there was often an existing system of tax ad-
ministration or tribute, and the large population made it profitable for the Europeans to
take control of the existing tax and tribute systems and to continue to levy high taxes, or
even increase them (see, e.g., Wiegersma, 1988, p. 69, on French policies in Vietnam, or
Marshall, 1998, pp. 492-497, on British policies in India).

2. Whether Europeans could settle or not: Europeans were more likely to develop insti-
tutions of private property when they settled in large numbers, for the natural reason that
they themselves were aÔ¨Äected by these institutions.9 Moreover, when a large number of
Europeans settled, the lower strata of the settlers demanded rights and protection similar
to, or even better than, those in the home country. This made the development of eÔ¨Äective
property rights for a broad cross section of the society more likely. European settlements, in
turn, were aÔ¨Äected by population density both directly and indirectly. Population density
had a direct eÔ¨Äect on settlements, since Europeans could easily settle in large numbers in
sparsely inhabited areas. The indirect eÔ¨Äect, on the other hand, worked through the dis-
ease environment. In many of the densely settled areas, there were diseases‚Äìin particular,
malaria and yellow fever‚Äìto which Europeans were vulnerable.10
       European settlements shaped both the type of institutions that developed and the
structure of production. For example, while in Potosƒ±ÃÅ (Bolivia) mining employed forced
labor (Cole, 1985), and in Brazil and the Caribbean sugar was produced by African slaves, in
   9
     Extraction and European settlement patterns were mutually self-reinforcing. In areas where extractive
policies were pursued, the authorities also actively discouraged settlements by Europeans, presumably
because this would intervene with the eÔ¨Äective extraction of resources from the locals (e.g. Coatsworth,
1982).
  10
     Most diseases require a dense human population to act as carriers. In Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson
(2001), we documented that Europeans were less likely to settle in areas with a high risk of malaria and
yellow fever, and both of these diseases were absent in areas such as Australia or New Zealand. The diseases
in the New World did not initially cause high European mortality, but malaria and yellow fever developed
soon after African slaves were brought to the continent. In any case, the correlation between population
density and the European settler mortality variable we constructed in Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson
(2001) is 0.33.



                                                    16
the U.S. and Australia mining companies employed free migrant labor, and sugar was grown
by smallholders in Queensland, Australia (Denoon, 1983, chapters 4 and 5). Consequently,
in Bolivia, Brazil and the Caribbean, political institutions were designed to ensure the
control of the laborers and slaves, while in the U.S. and Australia, the smallholders and
the middle class had greater political rights (Cole, 1985, Hughes, 1988, chapter 10).
      The historical evidence is therefore consistent with our notion that European colonial-
ism, by introducing or maintaining extractive institutions in previously densely settled and
prosperous areas and developing institutions of private property in previously poor regions,
caused an institutional reversal. We next substantiate this view empirically.

3.4     Econometric evidence on institutional reversal

Table 3 shows the relationship between urbanization or population density in 1500 and
subsequent institutions using four diÔ¨Äerent measures of institutions. The first two mea-
sures refer to current institutions: protection against expropriation risk between 1985 and
1995 from Political Risk Services, which approximates how secure property rights are, and
constraints on the executive in 1990 from Gurr‚Äôs Polity III data set, which can be thought
of as a proxy for how concentrated political power is in the hands of ruling groups (see Ap-
pendix Table A1 for detailed sources). Columns 1-6 of Table 3 show a negative relationship
between our measures of prosperity in 1500 and current institutions.
      It is also important to know whether there is an institutional reversal during the colonial
times or shortly after independence. Since the Gurr dataset does not contain information
for non-independent countries, we can only look at this after independence. Columns 7-12
show the relationship between prosperity in 1500 and measures of early institutions. The
first measure we use is constraints on the executive in 1900. Since colonial rule typically
concentrated political power in the hands of a small elite, we assign the lowest score to
countries still under colonial rule in 1900. As an alternative variable, we use constraints on
the executive in the first year of independence from the same data set, while also controlling
for time since independence as an additional covariate. Notice that when both urbanization
and log population density in 1500 are included, it is the population density variable that is
significant. This supports the interpretation that it was the diÔ¨Äerences between densely and
sparsely settled areas that was crucial in determining colonial institutions (though it may
also reflect the fact that the population density variable is measured with less measurement
error). Finally, the second panel of the table includes (the absolute value of) latitude as an
additional control, showing that the institutional reversal does not reflect some geographic


                                                17
pattern of institutional change.
       Figures 4A and 4B show the negative relationship between constraints on the executive
in the first year of independence and our measures of prosperity in 1500 diagrammatically
(corresponding to columns 10 and 11 of Table 3). The eÔ¨Äect of time since independence is
controlled for by orthogonalizing both the left-hand side and the right-hand side variables
with respect to this variable. Many of the colonies such as Canada, the United States,
New Zealand and Australia that were relatively poor before Europeans arrived became
independent with relatively good institutions, which contrasts with the experiences of many
previously prosperous countries in Latin America, Africa and Asia.
       Overall, we interpret both the historical and the econometric evidence as supporting the
notion that European colonialism caused an institutional reversal. Therefore, the institu-
tions hypothesis suggests the possibility of a reversal in relative prosperity among European
colonies between 1500 and today, while the geography hypothesis predicts a high degree of
persistence during the same period.

                               4    The Reversal of Fortune
4.1      Results with urbanization

This section presents our main results. Figure 1 in the introduction depicts the relation-
ship between urbanization 1500 and income per capita today. Table 4 reports regressions
documenting the same relationship. Column 1 is our most parsimonious specification,
regressing log income per capita in 1995 (PPP basis) on urbanization rates in 1500 for
our sample of former colonies.11 The coeÔ¨Écient is -0.08 with a standard error of 0.03.12
This coeÔ¨Écient implies that a 10 percentage points lower urbanization in 1500 is associ-
ated with approximately twice as high GDP per capita today (80 log points‚âà120 percent).
It is important to note that this is not simply mean reversion‚Äìi.e., richer than average
countries reverting back to the mean. It is a reversal. To illustrate this, let us compare
Uruguay and Guatemala. The native population in Uruguay basically had no urbaniza-
tion, while, according to our baseline estimates, Guatemala had an urbanization rate of
  11
     Here we look at log GDP per capita in 1995 as the dependent variable. For completeness, the top
panel of Table 8 shows the relationship between urbanization in 1995 and urbanization in 1500.
  12
     Because China was never a formal colony, we do not include it in our sample of ex-colonies. Adding
China strengthens the results further. For example, with China, the baseline estimates changes from
-0.0783 (s.e.=0.0256) to -0.0790 (s.e.=0.0253). Furthermore, our sample excludes counties that were
colonized by European powers briefly during the 20th century, such as Iran, Saudi Arabia and Syria. If
we include these observations, the results are unchanged. For example, the baseline estimate changes to
-0.0715 (s.e.=0.0240).



                                                  18
9.2 percent. The estimate in column 1 of Table 2, 0.038, for the relationship between
income and urbanization implies that Guatemala at the time was approximately 40 per-
cent richer than Uruguay (exp (0.038 √ó 9.2) ‚àí 1 ‚âà 0.4). Today according to our estimate
in column 1, we expect Uruguay to be approximately 110 percent richer than Guatemala
(exp (0.08 √ó 9.2) ‚àí 1 ‚âà 1.1), which is approximately the current diÔ¨Äerence in income per
capita between these two countries.
   The second column of Table 4 excludes North African countries for which data quality
may be lower. The result is unchanged, with a coeÔ¨Écient of -0.10 and standard error of
0.03. Column 3 drops the Americas, which increases both the coeÔ¨Écient and the standard
error, but the estimate remains highly significant. Column 4 reports the results just for the
Americas, where the relationship is somewhat weaker but still significant at the 8 percent
level. Column 5 adds continent dummies to check whether the relationship is being driven
by diÔ¨Äerences across continents. Although continent dummies are jointly significant, the
coeÔ¨Écient on urbanization in 1500 is unaÔ¨Äected‚Äìit is -0.09 with a standard error of 0.03.
   One might also be concerned that the relationship is being driven mainly by the Neo-
Europes: USA, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. These countries are settler colonies
built on lands that were inhabited by relatively undeveloped civilizations. Although the
contrast between the development experiences of these areas and the relatively advanced
civilizations of India or Central America is of independent interest, one would like to know
whether there is anything more than this contrast in the results of Table 4. In column 6, we
drop these observations. The relationship is now weaker, but still negative and statistically
significant at the 7 percent level.
   Is the reversal in relative incomes related to geography? To investigate this issue,
in columns 7 and 8, we add a variety of geography-related variables, including distance
from the equator, a variety of measures of temperature, humidity, soil quality, and natural
resource endowments, and a dummy for whether the country is landlocked. These variables
themselves are insignificant (except for the landlocked dummy which is significant at the
10 percent level), and have almost no eÔ¨Äect on the reversal in relative incomes.
   Finally, in columns 9 and 10, we add the identity of the colonial power (or legal origin),
which is emphasized by Hayek (1960) and La Porta et al. (1998), and religion, stressed by
Weber ([1905], 1993) and Landes (1998). These also have little eÔ¨Äect on our estimate.
   The urbanization variable used in Table 4 relies on work by Bairoch and Eggimann, and
as explained above, we had to make a number of assumptions to combine these estimates. In
Table 5, we use separately data from Bairoch and Eggimann, as well as data from Chandler,
who provided the starting point for Bairoch‚Äôs data. We repeat the regressions of Table 4

                                             19
using these three diÔ¨Äerent series and an alternative series using the Davis-Zipf adjustment
to convert the Eggimann‚Äôs estimates into Bairoch-equivalent numbers (explained in the
data appendix). The results are very similar to the baseline estimates reported in Table 5:
in all cases, there is a negative relationship between urbanization in 1500 and income per
capita today, and in almost all cases, this relationship is statistically significant at the 5
percent level.

4.2    Results with population density

In Panel A of Table 6, we regress income per capita today on log population density in 1500,
and also include data for sub-Saharan Africa. The results are quite similar to those in Table
4 (see also Figure 2). In all specifications, we find that countries with higher population
density in 1500 are substantially poorer today. The coeÔ¨Écient of -0.38 in column 1 implies
that a 10 percent higher population density in 1500 is associated with a 4 percent lower
income per capita today. For example, the area now corresponding to Bolivia was seven
times more densely settled than the area corresponding to Argentina, so on the basis of
this regression, we expect Argentina to be three times as rich as Bolivia, which is more or
less the current gap in income between these countries.
      The remaining columns perform robustness checks, and show that including geography-
related variables, the identity of the colonial power, religion variables, or dropping the
Americas, the Neo-Europes, or North Africa has very little eÔ¨Äect on the results. In all
cases, log population density in 1500 is significant at the 1 percent level.
      The estimates in the top panel of Table 6 use variation in population density. This
reflects two components: diÔ¨Äerences in population and diÔ¨Äerences in arable land area. In
Panel B, we separate the eÔ¨Äects of these two components, and find that they come in with
equal and opposite signs, showing that the specification with population density alone is
appropriate.
      Finally, in Panel C we estimate the same relationships as in Panel A, but using popula-
tion density in 1000 as an instrument for population density in 1500. This is useful since,
as discussed in Section 2.3, it is diÔ¨Äerences in long-run population density that are likely to
be better proxies for income per capita. Instrumenting for population density in 1500 with
population density in 1000 isolates the long-run component of population density diÔ¨Äer-
ences across countries (i.e., the component of population density in 1500 that is correlated
with population density in 1000). The Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS) results in Panel C
using this instrumental variables strategy are very similar to the OLS results in Panel A.


                                              20
4.3    Further results, robustness checks and discussion

Caution is required in interpreting the results presented in Tables 4, 5 and 6. Estimates
of urbanization and population more than 500 years ago are likely to be error-ridden.
Nevertheless, the first eÔ¨Äect of measurement error would be to create an attenuation bias
towards 0. Therefore, one might think that the negative coeÔ¨Écients in Tables 4, 5 and 6 are,
if anything, underestimates. A more serious problem would be if errors in the urbanization
and population density estimates were not random, but correlated with current income
in some systematic way. The results with alternative urbanization estimates in Table 5
suggest that this is not a major problem. We investigate this issue further in Table 7. We
use a variety of diÔ¨Äerent estimates for urbanization and population density, such as those
assigning lower urbanization and population density numbers to the Americas, North Africa
and India. The results are robust to these changes. Panel B of this table also reports results
weighted by population in 1500, with very similar results.
      Much of the variation in urbanization or population density is not at the country level,
but at the level of ‚Äúcivilizations‚Äù. For example, in 1500 there were fewer separate civiliza-
tions in the Americas, and even arguably in Asia, than there are countries today. For this
reason, we repeat our key regressions using variation only at the civilization level. First, in
column 6 we use only data corresponding to the areas occupied by the 7 civilizations that
are identified by Arnold Toynbee in A Study of History and are in our ex-colonies sample.
In column 7, we then use an extended classification with 14 civilizations (using McNeill,
1999, see note to Table 7). The results confirm our basic findings. With only the 7 civiliza-
tions identified by Toynbee, there is a negative, but statistically insignificant, relationship
(which is natural given the number of observations). When we use all 14 civilizations, this
relationship becomes significant at the 5 percent level.
      Next, in Panel C we include urbanization and population density simultaneously in
these regressions. In all cases, population density is negative and highly significant, while
urbanization is insignificant. This is again consistent with the notion that diÔ¨Äerences in
population density played a key role both in the institutional reversal (recall Table 3) and in
the reversal in relative incomes among the colonies (though it may also reflect measurement
error in the urbanization estimates).
      As a final strategy to deal with the measurement error in urbanization, we use log
population density as an instrument for urbanization rates in 1500. When both of these
are valid proxies for economic prosperity 1500, this procedure corrects for the measurement
error problem. Not surprisingly, these IV estimates reported in the bottom panel of Table 7,


                                               21
which correct for the downward bias due to measurement error, are considerably larger than
the OLS estimates in Table 4. For example, the baseline estimate is now -0.18 instead of
-0.08 in Table 4. The general pattern of reversal in relative incomes is unchanged, however.
   Is the reversal shown in Figures 1 and 2 and Tables 4, 5 and 6 consistent with other
evidence? The literature on the history of civilizations, e.g., Abu-Lughod (1989), Braudel
(1992), Chaudhuri (1990), Hodgson (1993), Kennedy (1987), McNeill (1999), Reid (1988
and 1993), Pomeranz (2000) and Wong (1997), documents that 500 years ago many parts of
Asia were highly prosperous (perhaps as prosperous as Western Europe), and civilizations
in Meso-America and North Africa were relatively developed. In contrast, there was little
agriculture in most of North America, Australia and New Zealand, at most consistent
with population density of 0.1 people per square kilometer (see the map in McEvedy and
Jones p. 273, reproduced below in the Appendix). McEvedy and Jones (1978, p. 322)
describe the state of Australia at this time as ‚Äúan unchanging palaeolithic backwater‚Äù. In
fact, because of the relative backwardness of these areas, European powers did not view
them as valuable colonies. Voltaire is often quoted as referring to Canada as ‚Äúfew acres
of snow‚Äù, and the European powers at the time paid little attention to Canada relative to
the colonies in the West Indies. In a few parts of North America, along the East Coast
and in the South-West, there was settled agriculture, supporting a population density of
approximately 0.4 people per square kilometer, but this was certainly much less than that
in the Aztec and Inca Empires, which had a fully developed agriculture with a population
density of between 1 and 3 people (or even higher) per square kilometer, and also much
less than the corresponding numbers in Asia and Africa.
   Overall we conclude that the evidence points to a reversal in relative incomes among
the former European colonies. This reversal is inconsistent with geographic factors being
the major cause of income diÔ¨Äerences across countries. On the other hand, as argued in the
previous section, historical and econometric evidence suggests that European colonialism
led to an institutional reversal, creating relatively better institutions in previously poor
areas. Therefore, if institutions are a crucial determinant of economic performance, we
should expect a reversal in relative economic prosperity. In this light, we interpret the
evidence in this section as providing support to the institutions hypothesis against the
simple geography hypothesis.

4.4      Persistence before 1500 and Persistence among the non-colonies

Like the geography hypothesis, the institutions view predicts persistence in economic pros-
perity as long as there is no major shock to the social organization of the societies in
question (though perhaps in history such shocks are ubiquitous). It is therefore instruc-
tive to briefly look at persistence among non-colonized countries and among our sample of
ex-colonies during the period before 1500. Table 8 reports a range of relevant results.
       Two important patterns emerge from this table. First, among European countries, or
all countries that were not colonized by Western Europe (including European countries),
there is persistence between 1500 and today (panel A, columns 7-10). Second, both in the
sample of non-colonized countries and in our sample of former colonies, there is persistence
between 1000 and 1500, or even between 1AD and 1000 when we use log population density
(panels B, C and D). These results suggest that the reversal we document in this section
reflects an unusual event, and gives further support to the idea that the reversal is related
to European colonialism.13

             5   The Temperate Drift, The Timing of the Reversal and
                                  Industrialization
5.1      The temperate drift hypothesis

The evidence presented so far weighs against the view that geography is a major determi-
nant of economic outcomes. Nevertheless, the reversal does not necessarily reject a more
sophisticated geography hypothesis, which emphasizes the temperate (or away from the
equator) shift in the center of economic gravity over time. According to this view, which
we call ‚Äúthe temperate drift‚Äù hypothesis, geography becomes important when it interacts
with the presence of certain technologies. For example, one can argue that tropical ar-
eas provided the best environment for early civilizations‚Äìafter all humans evolved in the
tropics and the required calorie intake is lower in warmer areas. But with the arrival of
‚Äúappropriate‚Äù technologies, temperate areas became more productive (e.g., White, 1962,
Bloch, 1966, Mokyr, 1990, Chapter 3).
       The technologies that were crucial for the rise of civilizations in temperate areas include
the heavy plow, systems of crop rotation, domesticated animals such as cattle and sheep,
and some of the high productivity European crops, including wheat and barley. Despite
the importance of these technologies for development in the temperate areas, they have
  13
    This pattern of persistence also provides no support to Olson‚Äôs (1982) prediction that there should be
systematic rises and declines of nations.



                                                   23
had much less of an eÔ¨Äect on tropical zones. Although we are not aware of any social
scientist who has explicitly formulated this view, JeÔ¨Ärey Sachs (2001) implies it in his recent
paper when he adapts Jared Diamond‚Äôs argument about the geography of technological
diÔ¨Äusion: ‚ÄúSince technologies in the critical areas of agriculture, health, and related areas
could diÔ¨Äuse within ecological zones, but not across ecological zones, economic development
spread through the temperate zones but not through the tropical regions‚Äù (p. 12, italics in
the original, see also Myrdal, 1968, chapter 14).
       Many of the colonies that subsequently became rich, such as North America or Aus-
tralia, are situated in temperate climates. The populations in these areas did not have
access to the agricultural technology in use in Europe at the time, and the spread of this
technology, which accompanied European colonialism, may have enriched these areas, caus-
ing the reversal. So the reversal in relative incomes does not rule out an explanation based
on the temperate drift hypothesis.

5.2     The timing of the reversal and industrialization

The timing and nature of the reversal in relative incomes do not support the temperate
drift hypothesis. First, the results presented so far give no indication that the reversal
is related to any geographic characteristics (e.g., see Table 4). Perhaps more important,
the temperate direct hypothesis can most plausibly apply in the context of agricultural
technology, since there is no compelling case that climate and geography should matter more
for industry than for agriculture (see subsection 5.3). Therefore, this hypothesis suggests
that the reversal should be associated with the spread of European agricultural technologies.
However, while European agricultural technology spread to the colonies between the 16th
and 18th centuries (e.g., McCusker and Menard, 1985, Chapter 3 for North America),
the evidence indicates that the reversal in relative incomes is largely a 19th-century and
industry-based phenomenon. This is documented in Figures 5 and 6.
       Figures 5A and 5B show that among the ex-colonies there appears to be no reversal
between 1500 and 1700, while the reversal is quite apparent between 1700 and today. Figure
6 looks in detail at the evolution of urbanization in a number of countries to date the timing
of the reversal. In Figure 6A, we classify ex-colonies according to their level of urbanization
in 1500.14 The figure shows the higher level of urbanization among the previously high
  14
   Former colonies with high urbanization in 1500 are Ecuador, Mexico, Guatemala, Algeria, Tunisia,
Egypt, and Morocco. Former colonies with low urbanization in 1500 are Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile,
Paraguay, and the U.S. The data used in this graph are from Chandler through 1850, Mitchell for 1900
and the UN for the 20th century. India is not included in Figure 6A, because Eggimann and Chandler‚Äôs
numbers imply that India was medium rather than high urbanization in 1500. However, all the qualitative


                                                  24
urbanization colonies until the 19th century, and then a big surge in urbanization among
the previously low urbanization colonies sometime before 1850 (which is consistent with the
divergence in per capita income since 1870 documented by Prichett, 1997). This is largely
driven by the U.S., but also by Canada and Argentina. Figure 6B shows a comparison of
Mexico, India and the U.S. as three important and large colonies, reiterating the pattern
in Figure 6A. Figure 6C shows the comparison of Mexico, the U.S., Brazil and Peru, this
time using data just from Mitchell (1983) and (1995).15
    Finally, Figure 6D shows per capita industrial production for the U.S., Canada, New
Zealand, Australia, Brazil, Mexico, and India using data from Bairoch (1982). This figure
shows the takeoÔ¨Ä in industrial production in the U.S., Australia, Canada and New Zealand
relative to Brazil, Mexico and India. Although the scale makes it diÔ¨Écult to see in the
figure, per capita industrial production in 1750 was in fact higher in India, 7, than in the
U.S., 4 (with UK industrial production per capita in 1900 normalized to 100). Bairoch
(1982) also reports that in 1750, China had industrial production per capita twice the level
of the U.S.. Yet, as Figure 6D shows, over the next 200 years, there was a much larger
increase in industrial production in the U.S. than in India (and also than in China).
    This general interpretation that the reversal in relative incomes took place during the
19th century, and was linked to industrialization, is also consistent with the fragmentary
evidence we have on other measures of income per capita and industrialization. For exam-
ple, Coatsworth (1993), Eltis (1995) and Engerman and SokoloÔ¨Ä (1997) provide evidence
that much of Spanish America and the Caribbean was more prosperous (higher per capita
income) than British North America until the 18th century. The future United States rose
in per capita income during the 1700s relative to the Caribbean and South America, but
only really pulled ahead in the 100 years after 1800 (Coatsworth, 1993). McCusker and
Menard (1985) and Galenson (1996) both emphasize that productivity and income growth
in North America before the 18th century was limited.16
evidence and the numbers in Bairoch (1988) indicate that India had urbanization at least as high as Meso-
America. India had such a large population in 1500 that it dominates any weighted average, so it is more
informative to present its urbanization separately in Figure 6B.
  15
     Mitchell provides a continuous series at 10 year intervals for urbanization from the late 18th to 20th
century. In contrast, most of Chandler‚Äôs data end in 1850, Bairoch reports estimates only for every 50
years (until the 20th century), and Eggimann does not provide numbers for some key countries, such as
the U.S.. Where they overlap, Mitchell‚Äôs estimates are consistent with those from our other sources.
  16
     McCusker and Menard (1985, p. 270) argue ‚Äúalthough there were some gains in agriculture, man-
ufacturing and shipping, improvements in technology had only a minor impact on the colonial economy
[1607-1785]....improvements in economic organization, specifically shifts away from self-suÔ¨Éciency and to-
ward production for exchange, and the development of more eÔ¨Écient markets, were the principal sources
of growth in the colonies of British America.‚Äù



                                                    25
       The available data also suggest that during the critical period of growth in the U.S.,
between 1840 and 1900, there was modest growth in agricultural output per capita, and
very rapid growth in industrial output per capita. Gallman (2000) reports that in 1840,
agriculture was 41 percent of GDP, while manufacturing was 17 percent of GDP. By 1900,
these numbers had changed to 19 and 31 respectively. He also reports that GDP per capita
in 1860 dollars was approximately 96.5 around 1840, and 269.1 around 1900. These numbers
imply that between 1840 and 1900 agricultural product per capita increased roughly from
39.5 to 51.1, which is very small relative to the increase in manufacturing output per capita,
which went up from 16.4 in 1840 to 83.4 in 1900.
       Overall this evidence suggests that previously poor colonies became relatively rich dur-
ing the 19th century, and this was associated with rapid industrialization in these areas.
We interpret this pattern as evidence against the temperate drift hypothesis.17

5.3      Geography and industrialization

While the evidence does not support the temperate drift hypothesis which claims that
modern agricultural technologies favored temperate areas, one might advance a related
argument that geography matters more for industry than for agriculture, and hence geo-
graphical diÔ¨Äerences should influence economic success more during the age of industry.
Although we find this view highly implausible, it is useful to briefly discuss some possible
versions of the story, and why they are not consistent with the existing evidence.
       First, one can imagine there is more room for specialization in industry, but such spe-
cialization requires (international) trade. If countries diÔ¨Äer according to their transport
costs, it might be those with low transport costs that take oÔ¨Ä during the age of industry.
This argument is not very convincing, however, since many of the previously prosperous
colonies that failed to industrialize include islands such as the Caribbean, or countries with
natural ports such as those in Central America, India or Indonesia. Moreover, transport
costs appear to have been relatively low in some of the areas that failed to industrialize.
For example, Pomeranz (2000, Appendix A) calculates that in 1800 land transportation
capacity per capita was the same in India as in Germany.
  17
    The timing and nature of the reversal also weigh against two other potential hypotheses. The first,
inspired by Frank (1978), Rodney (1972), Wallerstein (1974-1980), and Williams (1944), would be that
Europeans plundered the formerly rich colonies, and this plunder may have caused the reversal. Since
the extraction of resources was most intense shortly after initial colonization, this hypothesis would also
suggest an early reversal. An alternative possible thesis is that the reversal reflects the direct eÔ¨Äect of the
diseases Europeans brought to the New World (e.g., Crosby, 1986, Diamond, 1997, McNeill, 1976). Since
the remaining indigenous inhabitants of the Americas had largely developed immunities to these diseases
by the 17th century, this view also suggests we should observe a relatively early timing for the reversal.


                                                      26
   Second, countries may lack certain resource endowments necessary for industrialization,
most notably coal (e.g., Pomeranz, 2000). But coal is one of the world‚Äôs most common re-
sources, with proven reserves in 100 countries and production in over 50 countries (World
Coal Institute, 2000). Leading producers today include countries that were late to industri-
alize such as India, Pakistan, Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, Indonesia and China. Countries
that industrialized early with relatively little coal include Japan, Italy, Sweden and Aus-
tria. So there appears to be no evidence either that coal, or any other natural resource, was
essential for industrialization, or that diÔ¨Äerences in industrialization across the colonies can
be explained by the availability of natural resources.
   Third, it could be argued that people work less hard in warmer climates and that
this matters more for industry than for agriculture. To start with, there is no evidence
either for the hypothesis that work eÔ¨Äort matters more for industry or for the assertion
that human energy output depends systematically on temperature (see, e.g., Collins and
Roberts, 1988). Moreover, the available evidence on hours worked indicates that people
work harder in poorer/warmer countries. For example, in the early 1990s the average work
week was 52 hours in Egypt, 47.5 in South Korea, 44.8 in Mexico, 43.7 in Argentina, 42 in
the US, 37.7 in Japan, and 38.6 in France (ILO, 1995, pp. 36-37).
   Finally, another hypothesis with a flavor similar to the geography view would be that
diÔ¨Äerent paths of development reflect the direct influence of Europeans. Places where
there are more Europeans have become richer, either because Europeans brought certain
values conducive to development (e.g., Landes, 1998), or because having more Europeans
confers certain benefits (e.g., through trade with Europe or because Europeans are more
productive). Since Europeans settled in greater numbers in previously sparsely settled
areas, the reversal may reflect this eÔ¨Äect. Alternatively, as argued by many British histo-
rians, including Winston Churchill in A History of The English Speaking Peoples, perhaps
Europeans were able to transform societies in which they had complete control, whereas
societies such as India or Meso-America posed an eÔ¨Äective resistance to change. Although
this ‚Äúresistance-to-change‚Äù view is not inconsistent with our approach, it has a somewhat
diÔ¨Äerent emphasis. We believe that existing evidence supports our interpretation rather
than these alternative views. First, Appendix Table A3 presents evidence against the view
that diÔ¨Äerences in income, and the reversal, are the direct eÔ¨Äect of European presence. In
particular, we show that once we control for the eÔ¨Äect of institutions on income, or patterns
of European settlements in 1800 or 1900 (which proxy for early institutional development),
there is no evidence that the current fraction of Europeans in a country today matters for
income.

                                              27
      To deal with the resistance-to-change view, we construct an empirical measure of
whether Europeans had total control of the society during the colonial period, and inves-
tigate whether this measure has any eÔ¨Äect on income today. We construct this European-
control variable as the fraction of Europeans in the non-slave population. The reasoning
is that slaves had little power in these colonies, so they could not create resistance against
the changes that Europeans wanted to implement. Therefore, in a society where over 90
percent of the population are slaves, and the remainder are European settlers owning most
of the property and in charge of the administrative posts, Europeans had total control over
the society and institutions (e.g., as was the case in the Caribbean). If the reason why
certain areas did not develop is because of the resistance that the locals posed to European
advances, this European-control variable should be significant. In most of the regressions
reported Appendix Table A3, this variable is insignificant, while the institutions variable or
patterns of European settlements in 1800 or 1900 continue to be significant. We take this
as preliminary evidence against the resistance-to-change view, and in favor of our argu-
ment that what was important for institutional development was the relative profitability
of diÔ¨Äerent types of institutions for European colonists.

         6   Institutions and The Making of the Modern World Income
                                   Distribution

We have so far documented the reversal in economic prosperity among the former European
colonies between 1500 and today, and argued that this is inconsistent with both the simple
and sophisticated geography views. The next step is to argue that this institutional reversal
and the institutional diÔ¨Äerences between these countries account for their diÔ¨Äerent economic
trajectories, and to investigate the mechanism through which institutions have aÔ¨Äected
economic development. In this section, we first show the reversal between 1500 and today,
at least statistically, reflects the institutional reversal‚Äìthat is, once we control for the eÔ¨Äect
of institutions on income, the reversal in relative incomes disappears. We next document
that institutions started playing a much more important role in the age of industry.

6.1    Institutions and the reversal

If the institutional reversal is the reason why there was a reversal in income levels among the
former colonies, then once we account for the role of institutions appropriately, the reversal
should disappear. That is, according to this view, the reversal documented in Figures 1
and 2 and Tables 4, 5, 6 and 7 reflects the correlation between economic prosperity in 1500


                                               28
and income today working through the intervening variable, institutions.
   How do we establish that an intervening variable X is responsible for the correlation
between variable Z and Y ? To answer this question, suppose that the true relationship
between Y , and X and Z is
                                   Y = Œ± ¬∑ X + Œ≤ ¬∑ Z + Œµ,                                  (3)

where Œ± and Œ≤ are coeÔ¨Écients and Œµ is a disturbance term. In our case, we can think of Y
as income per capita today, X as measures of institutions, and Z as population density (or
urbanization) in 1500. The variable Z is included in equation (3) either because it has a
direct eÔ¨Äect on Y or because it has an eÔ¨Äect through some other variables not included in
the analysis. The hypothesis we are interested in is that Œ≤ = 0‚Äìthat is, population density
or urbanization in 1500 aÔ¨Äect income today only via institutions.
   This hypothesis obviously requires that there is a statistical relationship between X and
Z. So we postulate that
                                       X = Œª ¬∑ Z + ŒΩ.

To start with, suppose that Œµ is independent of X and Z and that v is independent of Z.
Now imagine a regression of Y on Z only (in our context, of income today on prosperity
in 1500), similar to those we reported in Tables 4-7:

                                       Y = b ¬∑ Z + u1 .

As is well-known, the probability limit of the OLS estimate from this regression, bb, is

                                     plimbb = Œ≤ + Œ± ¬∑ Œª.

So the results in the regressions of Tables 4, 5, 6 and 7 are consistent with Œ≤ = 0 as long as
Œ± 6= 0 and Œª 6= 0. In this case, we could be capturing the eÔ¨Äect of Z (population density or
urbanization) on income working solely through institutions. This is the hypothesis that
we are interested in testing. Under the assumptions regarding the independence of Z from
ŒΩ and Œµ, and of X from Œµ, there is a simple way of testing this hypothesis, which is to run
an OLS regression of Y on Z and X:

                                   Y = a ¬∑ X + b ¬∑ Z + u2 ,                                (4)

to obtain the estimates ab and bb. The fact that Œµ in (3) is independent of both X and Z rules
out omitted variable bias, so plimab = Œ± and plimbb = Œ≤. Hence, a simple test of whether
b
b = 0 is all that is required to test our hypothesis that the eÔ¨Äect of Z is through X alone.


                                             29
       In practice, there are likely to be problems due to omitted variables, endogeneity bias
because Y has an eÔ¨Äect on X, and attenuation bias because X is measured with error or
corresponds poorly to the real concept that is relevant to development.18 So the above
procedure is not possible. However, the exact logic applies as long as we have a valid
instrument, M, for X, such that
                                            X = Œ≥ ¬∑ M + Œ∂,

and M is independent of Œµ in (3). We can then simply estimate (4) using Two-Stage Least
Squares (2SLS) with the first-stage X = c ¬∑ M + d ¬∑ Z + u3 . Testing our hypothesis that
Z has an eÔ¨Äect on Y only through its eÔ¨Äect on X then amounts to testing that the 2SLS
estimate of b, eb, is equal to 0. Intuitively, the 2SLS procedure ensures a consistent estimate
of Œ±, enabling an appropriate test for whether Z has a direct eÔ¨Äect.
       The key to the success of this strategy is obviously a good instrument for X. Here we
refer to our previous work, Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson (2001), where we showed that
mortality rates faced by settlers are a good instrument for settlements of Europeans in the
colonies and the subsequent institutional development of these countries. Table 9 reports
results from this type of 2SLS tests using the log of potential settler mortality rates as an
instrument for institutional development.
       Panel A reports results from regressions that enter urbanization and log population
density in 1500 as exogenous regressors in the first and the second stages, while Panel B re-
ports the corresponding first stages. DiÔ¨Äerent columns correspond to diÔ¨Äerent institutions
variables, or diÔ¨Äerent specifications. For comparison, Panel C reports the 2SLS coeÔ¨Écient
with exactly the same sample as the corresponding column, but without urbanization or
population density. We look at the same four institutions variables used in Table 3: pro-
tection against expropriation risk between 1985 and 1995 from Political and Risk Services,
and constraints on the executive in 1990, in 1900 and in the first year of independence from
Gurr‚Äôs Polity III dataset. The results are consistent with our hypothesis. In all columns,
we never reject the hypothesis that urbanization in 1500 or population density in 1500
have no direct eÔ¨Äect once we control for the eÔ¨Äect of institutions on income per capita,
and the addition of these variables has little eÔ¨Äect on the 2SLS estimate of the eÔ¨Äect of
institutions on income per capita. This supports our notion that the reversal in economic
prosperity reflects the eÔ¨Äect of early prosperity and population density working through
the institutions and policies introduced by European colonists.
  18
    For example, plausibly what matters for economic development is a broad range of institutions, whereas
we only have an index for a particular type of institutions, e.g., enforcement of private property rights.



                                                   30
6.2     Institutions and industrialization

Why did the reversal take place during the 19th century? To answer this question, imagine
a society like the Caribbean colonies during the 17th and 18th centuries where a small elite
controls all the political power. The property rights of this elite are relatively well protected,
but the rest of the population has no eÔ¨Äective property rights. According to our definition,
this is not a society with institutions of private property, since a broad cross section of the
society does not have eÔ¨Äective property rights. Nevertheless, when the major investment
opportunities are in agriculture, this may not matter too much, since the elite can invest in
the land and employ the rest of the population, and so will have relatively good incentives
to increase output. Now imagine the arrival of a new technology, for example, industrial
opportunities. If the elite could undertake industrial investments without losing its political
power, we may expect them to take advantage of these opportunities. However, in practice
there will be at least two major problems. First, the people with the entrepreneurial skills
and ideas may not be members of the elite. These potential entrepreneurs will not undertake
the necessary investments, because they do not have secure property rights. They correctly
anticipate that they will be held up once they undertake these investments because political
power still rests in the hands of the elite. Second, the elite may want to block investments
in new industrial activities, fearing the political turbulence and the threat to their political
power that new technologies will bring (see Acemoglu and Robinson, 2000, 2001).
      This reasoning suggests that whether a society has institutions of private property or
extractive institutions may matter much more when new technologies require broad-based
economic participation. Early industrialization may be such a process, since it requires
both investments from a large number of people who were not previously part of the ruling
elite and the emergence of new entrepreneurs. Therefore, there are reasons to expect that
institutional diÔ¨Äerences should matter more during the age of industry. This is consistent
with the evidence discussed in the previous section. We now investigate this issue in more
detail.
      If this hypothesis is correct, we should expect societies with good institutions to take
better advantage of industrialization opportunities. We can test this using data on institu-
tions, industrialization and GDP from the 19th and early 20th centuries. Bairoch (1982)
presents estimates of industrial output for a number of countries at a variety of dates, and
Maddison (1995) has estimates of GDP for a larger group of countries. We take Bairoch‚Äôs
estimates of UK industrial output as a proxy for industrialization opportunities, since dur-
ing this period the UK was the industrial leader. We then run a panel data regression of


                                               31
the following form:

                        yit = ¬µt + Œ¥i + œÄ ¬∑ Xit + œÜ ¬∑ Xit ¬∑ U KIN Dt + Œµit ,                       (5)

where yit is the outcome variable of interest in country i at date t. We consider industrial
output per capita and income per capita as two diÔ¨Äerent measures of economic success
during the 19th century. In addition, ¬µt ‚Äôs are a set of time eÔ¨Äects and Œ¥i ‚Äôs denote a set
of country eÔ¨Äects, Xit denotes the measure of institutions in country i at date t, and
U KINDt is industrial output in the UK at date t. The coeÔ¨Écient of interest is œÜ, which
reflects whether there is an interaction between good institutions and industrialization op-
portunities. A positive and significant œÜ is interpreted as evidence in favor of the view
that countries with institutions of private property took better advantage of the oppor-
tunities to industrialize. The parameter œÄ measures the direct eÔ¨Äect of institutions on
industrialization, and is evaluated at the mean value of U KIN Dt .
       The top panel of Table 10 reports regressions of equation (5) with industrial output
per capita as the left-hand side variable.19 Column 1 reports a regression of (5) using only
pre-1950 data. The interaction term, œÜ, is estimated to be 0.13, and is highly significant
with a standard error of 0.03. Note that Bairoch‚Äôs estimate of total UK industrialization
rose from 16 to 115 between 1800 and 1913 (an index with UK industrial production in
1900 normalized to 100). In the meantime, the U.S. per capita production grew from 9 to
126, whereas India‚Äôs per capita industrial production fell from 6 to 2. Since the average
diÔ¨Äerence between the constraints on the executive in the U.S. and India over this period
is approximately 6, the estimate implies that the U.S. industrial output per capita should
have increased by 77 more than India‚Äôs, which is over half the actual diÔ¨Äerence.
       In column 2, we drop the country dummies, with little eÔ¨Äect on the results. In column
3, we extend the data through 1980, again with no eÔ¨Äect on the results. In columns 4 and
5, we use average institutions for each country, XÃÑi , rather than institutions at date t, so
the equation becomes yit = ¬µt + Œ¥i + œÜ ¬∑ XÃÑi ¬∑ U KIN Dt + Œµit . This specification may give
more sensible results if either variations in institutions from year to year are endogenous
with respect to changes in industrialization or income, or are subject to measurement
error. Interestingly, œÜ is now estimated to be larger, suggesting that measurement error
  19
    We have industrial output data for the U.S., Canada, New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, Brazil,
Mexico, and India. The bottom panel considers log GDP per capita as the dependent variable, and in
addition, includes data from Argentina, Bangladesh, Burma/Myanmar, Chile, Colombia, Egypt, Ethiopia,
Ghana, India, Indonesia, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Morocco, Nigeria, Pakistan, Peru, Tanzania, Venezuela, and
Zaire. In the top panel we did not use logs, since industrial output per capita was 0 for some of the
observations. We have data for the following dates: 1830, 1860, 1880, 1900, 1913, 1928, 1953, and 1980,
though not for all countries for all dates.

                                                  32
is a more important problem than the endogeneity of the changes in institutions between
time periods.
       The real advantage of the specifications in columns 4 and 5 is that they allow us to
instrument for the regressor of interest XÃÑi ¬∑ U KINDt , using the interaction between UK
industrialization and our instrument for institutions in Table 9, log settler mortality, Mi ¬∑
U KINDt . (We could not instrument for Xit ¬∑ U KIN Dt since our potential instrument
for Xit is not time varying). Once again, institutions might diÔ¨Äer across countries because
more productive or otherwise diÔ¨Äerent countries have diÔ¨Äerent institutions, and in this case,
the interaction between industrialization and institutions could be capturing the eÔ¨Äects of
these characteristics on economic performance. To the extent that the mortality of early
settlers is a good instrument for institutions, the interaction between log settler mortality
and UK industrialization will be a good instrument for the interaction between institutions
and UK industrialization. In this case, the IV procedure will deal with the endogeneity of
institutions, the omitted variables bias, and also the attenuation bias due to measurement
error. The IV estimates reported in column 6 and 7 are close to, but larger than, the OLS
estimates in columns 4 and 5, again suggesting that the endogeneity of XÃÑi is less important
than the attenuation bias.20
       In columns 8 and 9, we add the interaction between latitude and industrialization. This
is useful because, if the reason why the U.S. surged ahead relative to Mexico and India
during the 19th century is its geographic advantage, our measures of institutions might be
proxying for this, incorrectly assigning the role of geography to institutions. The results
give no support to this view: the estimates of œÜ are aÔ¨Äected little and remain significant,
while the interaction between industrialization and latitude is insignificant.21
       For completeness, column 10 reports results for European countries. This again leads to
a positive and significant estimate of œÜ, which is somewhat smaller than the estimate from
the former colonies sample. We conjecture that this is because there is less variation in
  20
     Despite our instrumental-variables strategy, the interaction between institutions and industrialization
opportunities may capture the possible interaction between industrialization opportunities and some coun-
try characteristics correlated with institutions and our instruments. For example, with an argument along
the lines of Nelson and Phelps (1966) or Acemoglu and Zilibotti (2001), one might argue that industrial
technologies were appropriate only for societies with suÔ¨Écient human capital. This possibility does not
contradict our argument, since diÔ¨Äerences in human capital are unlikely to be caused by geography, and
most likely are related to institutional diÔ¨Äerences (e.g., in societies with extractive institutions, the masses
typically did not or could not obtain education).
  21
     Note that here we do not have data from Singapore, Hong Kong and Malaysia, three former colonies
that have prospered, most probably thanks to relatively secure property rights, and that are closer to the
equator than the industrialized countries in our sample. We conjecture that with data from these countries,
institutions would be even stronger relative to latitude.



                                                      33
institutions in the European sample. The second panel of Table 10 repeats these regressions
using log GDP per capita as the left-hand side variable, and the results are similar.22
       Overall, these results provide support for the view that institutions played an important
role in the surge in industrialization and income of the formerly poor areas.

                                         7    Conclusion

Among areas colonized by European powers during the past 500 years those that were
relatively rich in 1500 are now relatively poor. We document that both today and in
the past there is a close association between urbanization rates and economic prosperity.
Using both population density and urbanization as proxies for economic prosperity, we find
a robust reversal in relative incomes among former colonies between 1500 and today.
       We argue that this reversal is inconsistent with the simple geography hypothesis, which
explains the bulk of the income diÔ¨Äerences we observe across countries by the direct eÔ¨Äect
of geographic diÔ¨Äerences and therefore predicts a high degree of persistence in economic
outcomes. We also show that the timing and nature of the reversal are not consistent with
a more sophisticated geography view, the temperate drift hypothesis, which argues that
the center of gravity of economic activity has been shifting away from the equator, and
that contact with the Europeans led to such a process among the colonies.
       Instead, the facts point to the importance of institutions. The reversal in relative
incomes over the past 500 years reflects the eÔ¨Äect of diÔ¨Äerences in institutions (and the
institutional reversal caused by European colonialism) on income today.
       Why did European colonialism lead to an institutional reversal? And how did this
institutional reversal cause the reversal in relative incomes and the subsequent divergence
in income per capita across the various colonies? We argued that the institutional reversal
resulted from the diÔ¨Äerential profitability of diÔ¨Äerent colonization strategies in diÔ¨Äerent
environments. In prosperous and densely settled areas, Europeans introduced or main-
tained already existing extractive institutions to force the large population and the slaves
imported from Africa to work in mines and plantations, and took over existing tax and
tribute systems. In contrast, in previously sparsely settled areas, Europeans settled in large
numbers, and created institutions of private property, encouraging commerce and industry.
This institutional reversal laid the seeds of the reversal in relative incomes. But most likely,
the scale of the reversal, and the subsequent divergence in incomes, is due to the arrival
of industrialization opportunities during the 19th century. While societies with extractive
  22
    In the bottom panel, the interaction term is parameterized as Mi ¬∑ ln(U KIN Dt ) since the left-hand
side variable is log of GDP per capita.


                                                  34
institutions could exploit agricultural technology relatively eÔ¨Äectively, the spread of indus-
trial technology required the participation of a broad cross section of the society‚Äìthe small
holders, the middle class and the entrepreneurs. The age of industry created a considerable
advantage for societies with institutions of private property. Consistent with this view,
we documented that these societies took much better advantage of the opportunities to
industrialize.
   It is important to emphasize that our results do not suggest that geography played
no role in shaping cross-country diÔ¨Äerences in economic outcomes. Geographic diÔ¨Äerences
across the colonies were probably important during a certain period because of their eÔ¨Äect
on institutions. For example, whether the climate was suitable for sugar may have deter-
mined whether a plantation system was set up during the colonial era, see Engerman and
SokoloÔ¨Ä (1997), and the local disease environments determined whether Europeans could
settle, see Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson (2001). However, this means that certain re-
gions, say Central America, are poor today not as a result of their geography, but because
of their institutions, and that there is not a necessary or universal link between geogra-
phy and economic development or institutional development as implied, for example, by
Montesquieu (1748) who argued for a general connection between warm climate and despo-
tism. Finally, though this is not our view, the relative economic success and expansion of a
number of European countries from 1500 may have resulted from Europe‚Äôs geography. So
income diÔ¨Äerences today, say between South and North America, may reflect not their ge-
ographic diÔ¨Äerences, but indirectly the geographic advantage that Europe enjoyed relative
to rest of the world. Whether the world‚Äôs geography has played a major role in shaping
economic development over the past millennium is an area for future research.
   Given the quality of data on urbanization and population density more than 500 years
ago, some degree of caution is required. Nevertheless, the broad patterns in the data seem
uncontroversial: civilizations in Meso-America, the Andes, India and South-East Asia were
much more urbanized and richer than those located in North America, Australia, New
Zealand or the southern cone of Latin America. The intervention of Europe reversed this
pattern. This is a first-order fact for understanding the process of economic and political
development over the past 500 years.

                               Appendix A:
                  Construction of Urbanization Estimates
1. General
Definition of Urbanization
        Bairoch (1988) argues that the correct way to measure urbanization is to count
everyone living in towns with more 5,000 inhabitants. There are some exceptions, but in
general this level of urban population indicates that people are engaged in non-
agricultural activities.
        The main practical alternative is to measure urbanization as the population of
towns above the threshold of 20,000 inhabitants. This is not appealing, as it ignores even
substantial urbanization levels. For example, England before 1500 had only one city with
population over 20,000, but an urbanization rate by the Bairoch definition of 8% (see
Chandler 1987, p.19, Bairoch 1988, p.179, and Bairoch, Batou and Ch√®vre 1988, pp.32-
35.)
        We adopt Bairoch‚Äôs definition of urbanization. Where information is directly
available in terms of this measure, we use this. Where information is available only for
larger towns, we use various methods to convert this into Bairoch-equivalent units for our
baseline estimates (i.e., to infer the population of towns with more than 5,000
inhabitants.) As documented in this appendix, we apply this conversion as carefully as
possible and check our results for robustness using different methods. In Table 5, we also
report results that do not use any conversion. The raw data for our base estimates and
main alternative series are reported in Appendix Table 2.

Sources
        We use four main sources for information on urbanization. The first source is
research by Paul Bairoch and his associates. The second is the work of Tertius Chandler,
particularly Chandler (1987). The third is information for the twentieth century from
United Nations (UN 1969). Finally, Mitchell (1993 and 1995) offers relatively high
frequency urbanization data, although only from 1750 to the present.
        Bairoch (1988) provides the best single collection and assessment of urbanization
research. This volume reviews evidence on urbanization from around the world since the
beginning of recorded time and we rely primarily on his assessment of plausible
urbanization estimates throughout our analysis. Even when we are forced to use specific
numbers from another source, we check these estimates for consistency with Bairoch‚Äôs
various qualitative assessments (as documented in this appendix.)
        After the publication of Bairoch (1988), Bairoch and his associates continued to
develop more detailed country-level data.1 In particular, data on non-European urban

1
  Professor Bairoch passed away in 1999. We understand that a more complete global
urbanization data was under preparation at the time of his death, but have not been able to locate
it. We rely instead on official publications of his Center of International Economic History which
moved to the University of Lausanne in September 1999. Many of its publications are available
through Librairie Droz (Geneva), under the direction of Jean Batou and Bouda Etemad. For
helpful communications on these issues, we thank Professor Etemad.


                                                1
populations were collected by Gilbert Eggimann and published by Librarie Droz as ‚ÄúLa
Population des villes des tiers-mondes, 1500-1950‚Äù on the web at
http://histsociale.isuisse.com/histsociale/ (see also www.droz.org) since fall 1999. The
Scientific Editors of this publication were Paul Bairoch and Jean-Claude Toutain.
Eggimann draws on Chandler (1987) for information on early cities, and Showers (1979)
for more recent data. He also makes extensive use of country-specific sources that are
well documented in his bibliography. The main drawback is that Eggimann‚Äôs data only
covers cities that crossed the threshold of 20,000 inhabitants at some point between 1500
and 1950.2 Eggimann also does not cover the former colonies that have become rich (the
US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong and Singapore). In Section 2 below we
explain in more detail how we combine Bairoch and Eggimann to produce our baseline
estimates for 1500.
         Our second main source of urban population estimates is work by Tertius
Chandler. Bairoch (1988) reports that he used Chandler and Fox (1974) as the basis for
his first estimates. Independently of Bairoch‚Äôs later work, Chandler (1987) extended and
refined these estimates. Chandler‚Äôs data are attractive because they are more detailed for
non-European countries than what has been published by Bairoch‚Äôs group (with the
exception of Eggimann, who only covers countries that are now part of the ‚ÄúThird
World‚Äù). In particular, Chandler reports numbers by individual city since 800 as much as
possible. He also has information on cities before 800, although these data are less
comprehensive.
         However, there are three limitations of the Chandler data that make us prefer
Bairoch‚Äôs estimates (augmented with Eggimann‚Äôs data) when these are available. First,
Chandler‚Äôs minimum city size for Europe and the Americas is 20,000 (although he has
estimates for some years with a lower threshold). For the reasons outlined above, this is
not as satisfactory as Bairoch‚Äôs threshold of 5,000 inhabitants. Second, for Asia,
Chandler‚Äôs minimum city size is 40,000, making it difficult to compare precisely with his
own estimates for Europe and the Americas. For example, this leads to a much lower
(and rather implausible) estimate of urbanization in India and China compared with
Europe and the Americas, and compared with the assessments in Bairoch (1988).3 Third,
Chandler‚Äôs data ends in 1850 (1861 for the Americas). Nevertheless, Chandler (1987)
provides a very useful check on the Bairoch-Eggimann estimates for 1500, particularly
because it was an important source for that work, and also a time series for detailed
urbanization estimates across almost all countries from 800 to 1850. In section 3 below
we explain in detail how we combine Chandler with other sources to complete this time
series into the twentieth century. In section 4 we explain how we use Chandler‚Äôs data as
the basis of our urbanization estimates for 1000.


2
  Eggimann originally intended to look at cities with populations above 10,000, but this proved to
be much more work. See the section on his website under ‚ÄúPourquoi avoir abandonn√© la limite de
10'000 pour se limiter √† 20'000?‚Äù
3
  Chandler ranks cities by size of urban population in a particular polity. Note that Chandler
sometimes indicates that a city was above his minimum threshold, but he does not estimate the
precise level of urban population. In this case we assume the city was at the level of the highest
city below it in Chandler‚Äôs ranking or, if there is no such city, at the minimum threshold of
population for that region. Eggimann‚Äôs estimates do not have this problem.


                                                2
        The United Nations provides some useful urbanization data for the twentieth
century (UN 1969). We use this as a check on Bairoch and to complete our time series of
urbanization after 1500 (see section 3).
        Finally, Mitchell (1993 and 1995) reports detailed urbanization data for most of
the countries covered in this paper. Most of his information was drawn from country-
specific sources. While his data begin only in 1750 or 1800 for some countries, it has the
great advantage of running uninterrupted through the late 20th century. We use this data
for several key graphs that show the timing of urbanization relative to the timing of
industrialization. With a few exceptions, the criteria for inclusion in this dataset is a
population of 250,000 in 1970 or 400,000 in 1980 (see, for example, Mitchell 1995,
p.44.)

Calculating Urbanization
        Bairoch generally provides an estimate of urbanization (i.e., percent of the total
population living in urban areas). However, most other scholars of non-European
urbanization, including Eggimann, Chandler and Fox, Chandler, the UN and Mitchell
provide only estimates of total urban population (in cities above their minimum
population threshold.) To convert these into urbanization estimates, we use the
population figures in McEvedy and Jones (1978). We also use the land area and
population estimates in McEvedy and Jones (1978) to calculate population density.4
        We report our urbanization estimates in three sections below. First, we explain in
detail our baseline estimates for 1500. Second, we provide evidence on the development
of urbanization from 1500. Third, we provide evidence on urbanization before 1500, with
particular emphasis on 1000.
        Throughout this appendix we try to put our quantitative estimates in historical
perspective and to explain the evidence underlying particular numbers. We focus on our
base urbanization estimates, although we also discuss alternative estimates where these
are substantially different. Appendix Table A2 reports the complete series we use in our
main regressions and robustness checks.

2. Urbanization in 1500
       Our base estimates for 1500 consists of Bairoch‚Äôs (1988) urbanization augmented
by the work of Eggimann (1999). Merging these two series requires us to convert
Eggimann‚Äôs estimates, based on a minimum population threshold of 20,000, into
Bairoch-equivalent urbanization estimates, based on a minimum population threshold of
5,000.

  The McEvedy and Jones work is nearly 25 years old but is still the best source for comparable
estimates across all countries in the past 2000 years. Some estimates remain controversial (e.g.,
on pre-European America, but alternative estimates imply higher urbanization) and estimates for
Africa must be treated with particular caution (as McEvedy and Jones acknowledge.) In a recent
assessment, the US Bureau of the Census showed that McEvedy and Jones‚Äôs aggregate estimates
compare favorably with more recent estimates (see the discussion in the main text). McEvedy and
Jones‚Äô estimates for regional populations are similar for most periods to the series used in the
latest edition of Livi-Bacci (2001, Table 1.3, p.27). Kremer (1993) and De Long (1998) both rely
on McEvedy and Jones.


                                               3
        To convert between the two sets of estimates, we run a regression of Bairoch
estimates on Eggimann estimates for all countries where they overlap in 1900 (the year
for which we have the largest number of Bairoch estimates for non-European countries).
There are thirteen countries for which we have good overlapping data. This regression
yields a constant of 6.6 and a coefficient of 0.67. We use these estimates below to
generate Bairoch-equivalent urbanization estimates. The complete base series we use is
shown in Figure 1 and Figure 5A.
        We have also checked the robustness of our results using alternative methods of
converting Eggimann estimates into Bairoch-equivalent numbers. We have calculated
country-specific conversion ratios and conversion ratios at the regional level (e.g., for
North Africa and the Andean region separately). We have also constructed an alternative
series using a conversion rate of 2, as suggested by Davis‚Äô and Zipf‚Äôs Laws (see Bairoch
1988, chapter 9.)5 We have also used Bairoch‚Äôs overall assessment of urbanization for
broad regions, e.g., Asia, without the more detailed information from Eggimann. We
have also used estimates just from Bairoch, just from Eggimann and just from Chandler.
None of these alternative methods affect any of our main results (see Table 5 for relevant
regressions).
        We provide urbanization estimates for all former European colonies that now
have a population over 500,000. Most countries with a population under 500,000 either
lack reliable data or are not fully independent (e.g., this is true of many small islands that
are nominally independent in the Caribbean or the Pacific) or both. We have also
calculated urbanization rates for all European countries and non-European countries that
were never colonized. We have also checked Bairoch‚Äôs estimates against the work of
Bairoch, Batou and Ch√®vre (1988), de Vries (1984) and Hohenberg and Lees (1985).
Our discussion of urbanization in European and never colonized countries is not reported
here to conserve space, but it is available from the authors.

The Americas in 1500
        There is some doubt about the exact level of urbanization in the Americas before
the Europeans arrived, but the relative distribution of urbanization across North and
South America is clear. To the north of Mexico, there was relatively little urbanization. In
Mexico, other parts of central America and northern/western South America,
urbanization was relatively high (probably average urbanization was just a little lower
than in Asia at this time, but we cannot be sure).
        For Latin America, Bairoch (1988, Table 24.1, p.389) reports the distribution of
cities with populations of 20,000 or more. In 1500, there were 20 such cities in the

5
  We are using a conservative version of Davis‚Äôs law. Bairoch (1988, p.148) says ‚ÄúFor instance, if
in a given country the cities with populations of 5,000-10,000 together have a total population of
300,000, then the cities with populations of 10,000-20,000 will have a total population of
300,000. And the same principle applies whether we move down the scale ‚Ä¶ or up to cities with
populations of 40,000-80,000, or of 80,000-160,000, and so on.‚Äù This implies that if the
population in cities with populations in the range 20,000-40,000 is z and there are no cities over
40,000, then the total urban population (using Bairoch‚Äôs definition) will be 3z. Bairoch‚Äôs own
calculations suggest that the Zipf-Davis adjustment should be larger (see Bairoch 1988, pp.149-
150). We prefer to use a smaller adjustment, i.e., at the lower bound of what is reasonable, as this
is less favorable to our hypothesis.


                                                 4
Northern Andes (Bolivia, Colombia, Equador and Peru), and 10 in Mexico. There were
no cities above this threshold size in the Caribbean, Brazil or the ‚ÄúTemperate Regions‚Äù
(Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay). He further estimates that there were 4-7 cities with
populations of more than 50,000 and ‚Äú25-30 (perhaps even 40)‚Äù with populations of
20,000-50,000 (Bairoch 1988, p.66). There were two main concentrations of urban
population: the Aztecs, Tarascans, and Zapotecs (roughly in the area now Mexico); and
the Incas, Mayas, Chibchas, and Cakchiquels (Central America and north-western South
America.) Urbanization may have been as high as 10-13% in some places, but Bairoch‚Äôs
assessment is that it was more likely around 7% on average. For the Chimu region of the
Andes, Bairoch cites an estimate as high as 14% (Bairoch 1988, p.66). For the Andean
region as a whole, Bairoch estimates the low end for urbanization was 2-3%; and the high
end was 10-13%. In our ‚ÄúBairoch-only‚Äù data series we use a rate of 12% for Ecuador,
Bolivia and Peru.
        For Colombia in 1500, Eggimann‚Äôs estimates imply urbanization of 2%. As a
Bairoch-equivalent urbanization measure, this would be 7.9%. We use this in our
baseline data.
        For Ecuador in 1500, Eggimann estimates urbanization as 15%. Part of this urban
population should be ascribed to the area occupied by modern-day Bolivia. Dividing
Ecuador‚Äôs urban population by the combined total population of Ecuador and Bolivia
implies that both countries had 6% urbanization by Eggimann‚Äôs criterion. We use a
Bairoch-equivalent estimate of 10.6% urbanization for both countries in our baseline
data.
        For Peru in 1500, Eggimann estimates urbanization was 5.8%. This is converted
to a Bairoch-equivalent urbanization level of 10.5%. We use this in our baseline data.
        For Guatemala in 1500, Eggimann estimates 3.8% (deflating the urban population
using the whole population of Central America). Clearly part of this should be ascribed to
other parts of Central America. Our baseline data have an estimate of 9.2%, which seems
quite reasonable for Costa Rica, Honduras, Panama, Nicaragua, Belize, El Salvador, and
Guatemala on average (it might have been lower in Costa Rica and Panama and higher in
Guatemala, but we cannot be sure.) In our alternative ‚ÄúEggimann-only‚Äù estimates, we use
a rate of 18% for these countries (obtained by dividing Guatemala‚Äôs urban population by
only Guatemala‚Äôs population.)
        For Mexico in 1500, Eggimann estimates urbanization was 12.3%. Our baseline
data use the Bairoch-equivalent urbanization estimate of 14.8%. According to Bairoch,
p.389, Mexico had half as many cities with at least 20,000 population as the northern
Andes (10 vs. 20) in 1500. The population in both areas was about the same according to
McEvedy and Jones, around 5m. When Europeans arrived in 1519, Tenochtitlan (now
Mexico City) probably had a population in the range of 150-200,000 and lay in the
middle of a heavily urbanized region with up to 400,000 people living in smaller cities.
‚ÄúDuring this same period, there were only four European cities this size; and on the
Iberian peninsula, the largest cities at that time, Granada and Lisbon, had around 70,000
inhabitants each‚Äù (Bairoch, p.63).
        Despite his extensive discussion of urbanization in South America, Bairoch
makes no mention of pre-European urbanization in Argentina or Brazil or other parts of
South America. For Brazil in 1500, Eggimann estimates 0.1% urbanization (just 1,000
people in a single town). We assign a value of zero in our baseline data. For other



                                            5
countries in South America with low levels of urbanization we assume the same value.
Thus we use 0% for Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Paraguay and Guyana.
        While we also do not know the precise level of urbanization in North America,
Bairoch (1988) is clear that this was much lower than in Central and South America. He
refers to the overall situation as ‚ÄúCulture without Cities‚Äù (p.68). There was probably
some urbanization, for example the Anasazi people may have had cities with populations
of 10,000 or more between the eleventh and fourteenth centuries, but most of the
southeastern and eastern United States and Canada was much less urbanized (with only
the Huron-Iroquois having even slash-and-burn agriculture). He estimates that
population density north of the Rio Grande before the Europeans was only 0.2 people per
square kilometer or 0.4 people per square kilometer if we exclude all ‚Äútruly
uninhabitable‚Äù areas (p.69). ‚ÄúIn any event, the displacement of villages caused by the
practice of slash-and-burn cultivation considerably reduced the likelihood of the creation
of urban centers by preventing or impeding any permanent large-scale settlements
(p.69).‚Äù In his assessment, there were no ‚Äúgenuine cities‚Äù (p.69). For the most recent
archaeological evidence supporting this position, see Fagan (2000).
        We have very little information on urbanization in the Caribbean. Cuba, the
Dominican Republic, Haiti and Jamaica all probably had some urbanization, although
clearly they had less urbanization than Meso-America. We assign an urbanization level of
3% to these countries, using Bairoch‚Äôs estimate of urbanization when there is settled
agriculture. Note that Cuba is not in our base sample because we do not have
information on its GDP per capita in 1995.

Asia in 1500
        Bairoch (1988) estimates that average urbanization in Asia in 1900 was 9%, but
he argues that this was higher in the eighteenth century before European colonization
(p.430). He also argues there was more homogeneity of urbanization within Asia than
within Africa or America (pp.430-431).
        Bairoch argues that Asian urbanization did not change much in the centuries
before 1900. Bairoch (1988, table 25.1, p.407) reports urbanization in Asia in 1900 as
follows: China, 7-9%; India, 9-11%; Indonesia, 5-8%; Philippines, 14-16%; Vietnam, 6-
9%; Iran, 12-15%; Korea, 8-11%; Thailand, 8-10%; Turkey, 15-18%; and Asia as a
whole, 8-10%. Bairoch (1988, p.406) estimates that ‚ÄúAround 1700, as well as around
1930, 10-12% of the population of Asia lived in cities.‚Äù He further estimates that because
urbanization fell in China, the level of urbanization had dropped to 8-10% by the start of
the nineteenth century.
        Bairoch emphasizes the long history of relatively high urbanization throughout
      6
Asia. Prior to 1500, Asia was consistently among the most urbanized places in the
world. By 1900 this had changed. For example, Bairoch (1988, p.350) states, ‚ÄúBetween
100 BC and AD 1200 there were always one or two Asian cities among the three largest
in the world. And between 1200 and 1820 there were invariably six or seven Asian cities
(even excluding the Middle East) among the ten largest in the world. By contrast, there
were only three around 1875, and none at all in 1900.‚Äù
        Overall, ‚ÄúAround 1500 the world appears to have had some fifty to sixty cities
with populations of more than 100,000, and all but four lay in the regions destined to

    On the early and sustained development of Indian cities, see Chakrabarti (1995).


                                                  6
become the Third World of today‚Äù (Bairoch, p.436). Most of those cities were in Asia,
with perhaps 2-3 in the Americas, and 3-4 in North Africa. In contrast, there were only 4
cities in Europe with more than 100,000 in population in 1500‚Äù (Bairoch 1988, Table
27.3, p.437).7
         According to Bairoch‚Äôs assessment, China and India probably had about the same
level of urbanization in 1500, although India was at the top of an urbanization cycle and
China was at the bottom. For China, Bairoch estimates urbanization by the twelfth
century was around 10-13%, taking the population threshold of 5,000 for a city (p.353).
This was 1-2 points higher than Europe (excluding Russia) at the same time and ‚Äúclose to
the maximum reached in Europe (minus Russia) at any time before the Industrial
Revolution.‚Äù
         For China in 1900, Eggimann provides an urbanization estimate of 2.95% and
Bairoch directly estimates 7.75%. For 1500, Eggimann‚Äôs numbers imply 2.18%, and we
use a Bairoch-equivalent urbanization estimate of 8.06% in our baseline data. This is a
little low, as Bairoch says, p.403, that urbanization in China in the sixteenth century was
11-14% (falling to 6-7.5% by 1850 but rising slightly to 7-8.5% by 1900; see also p.357.)
         Regarding India, Bairoch (1988, p.350) writes, ‚ÄúBy 1300, probably five cities,
and perhaps six to ten, had surpassed [100,000 population]. It may be recalled that during
this same period, with a population of some 80-100 million, just about the same as
India‚Äôs, Europe also had five cities with populations of more than 100,000.‚Äù According to
Bairoch, urbanization in India in 1300 was roughly at the same level as in Europe. By the
early sixteenth century the largest city in India, Vijayanagar, had a population of 500,000
while Paris, the largest city in Europe, had a population of only 200-250,000.
         For 1500, Eggimann‚Äôs estimate for India, Pakistan and Bangladesh combined is
an urban population of 2.323m. With a population of 80.6m, this implies urbanization
was 2.9%. We convert to our baseline Bairoch-equivalent urbanization estimate of 8.5%
for India. We use this also for Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.8
         Our base estimate is reasonable but definitely on the low side. For India in 1900,
Eggimann‚Äôs estimate is 6.9% and Bairoch‚Äôs estimate is 10%. But Bairoch and Eggimann
overlap with an estimate of urban population closer to 1500. In 1700, Eggimann‚Äôs
estimates imply urbanization of 2.2%. For India, Bairoch cites favorably the estimate of
urbanization around 15% in 1600 (but indicates this may be on the high end) (p.351). The
midpoint of Bairoch‚Äôs estimated urbanization in this year is 12%. Bairoch‚Äôs assessment is
that urbanization in India declined after 1500. Bairoch also reports direct estimates of
urbanization in India from census figures as follows (p.400): in 1700, 11-13%; in 1800,
9-11.5%; in 1850, 7.5-9.5%; in 1900, 9-10%; in 1940, 14-16%. He argues forcefully that
the evidence of deindustrialization in the nineteenth century points to a decline of
urbanization once the British took effective control (around 1800).
         For Indonesia in 1900, Eggimann‚Äôs urbanization estimate is 2.28% and Bairoch‚Äôs
estimate is 6.5%. For 1500, Eggimann does not have an estimate. From Eggimann, the

7
  Bairoch (1988) does not name those four European cities. According to Chandler, there were
five: Paris had a population of 185,000, Venice had 115,000, Naples had 114,000, Adrianople had
127,000, and the largest city in Europe was Constantinople with 200,000 inhabitants.
8
  We have to estimate the population of India and its neighbors from McEvedy and Jones‚Äôs
estimate of total population on the subcontinent. We use the population ratios of 1945, when
India was 80.6% of the total subcontinent population.


                                              7
urban population in Malaysia in 1500 was 80,000. The population of Malaysia was only
400,000, which would imply 20% urbanization. However, making a distinction between
Malaysia and Indonesia at that time is quite artificial. The population of Indonesia was
7,750,000, giving a total population of 8.15m, and an Eggimann urbanization estimate of
1%. In our baseline data we use the Bairoch-equivalent estimate of 7.27% for both
Malaysia and Indonesia.
        Eggimann reports the urban population in Laos in 1500 as 40,000. The population
was 400,000, giving an urbanization rate of 10%. But it seems more reasonable to ascribe
part of this urbanization also to Vietnam, which in 1500 had a population of 4m. This
implies urbanization of 1%. Converting this to Bairoch-equivalent urbanization gives
7.3%, which we use in our baseline estimate. As a consistency check, we would not that
for Vietnam in 1900, Eggimann‚Äôs estimate is 2.9% and Bairoch‚Äôs estimate is 7.5%.
        According to Eggimann, in 1500 there was an urban population of 110,000 in
Burma/Myanmar. With a population of 4m, this implies an urbanization rate of 2.8%.
Converted into Bairoch-equivalent urbanization, this gives 8.48%. Note, however, that
we do not have current GDP per capita data for Burma/Myanmar, so this country is not in
our baseline estimates.
        We assign an urbanization value of 3% to the Philippines, based on the qualitative
assessment by Bairoch (1988). Bairoch says of the Philippines, ‚Äúbefore the arrival of the
Spanish colonizers, there were no genuine cities‚Äù (p.48).
        Regarding Singapore and Hong Kong, we know that neither area was developed
and neither was even a minor port. Both had some small fishing villages. We assign 3%
urbanization to Singapore and Hong Kong (Bairoch‚Äôs estimate of urbanization when
there is settled agriculture), but check our results carefully under alternative assumptions.
The Europeans built up both Singapore and Hong Kong, i.e., they did not take over an
existing port but rather started from scratch (Endacott 1971, Collis 1982).

The Pacific Region in 1500
        For Australia, Bairoch‚Äôs assessment is that ‚Äúagriculture and urbanization emerged
only in the nineteenth century, brought by the European immigrants‚Äù (p.69). The pre-
European population existed as hunter-gatherers with no towns. We use a value of 0% in
our baseline data.
        There probably was some agriculture in Western Polynesia (p.70). In Bairoch‚Äôs
assessment, this level of agriculture generally supports a minimal level of urbanization at
around 3%. Bairoch does not discuss pre-European New Zealand explicitly, but other
sources suggest that the culture was similar to Western Polynesia (Sinclair 1969). We
therefore assign an urbanization level of 3%.

Africa in 1500
        There are reasonably good urbanization data for North Africa. For Tunisia in
1500, Eggimann estimates urbanization was 8.1%. We use the Bairoch-equivalent
urbanization estimate of 12.3% in our baseline data.
        For Libya in 1500, Eggimann estimates urbanization as 3.2%. We use the
Bairoch-equivalent urbanization estimate of 8.74% in our baseline data. Note that we do
not have data on GDP per capita in 1995 for Libya, so this country is not included in our
base sample results.



                                              8
         The other Eggimann estimates for North Africa in 1500 are: 16.7% (Morocco),
11% (Algeria), 8.1% (Tunisia), and 11.9% (Egypt). We use, respectively, Bairoch-
equivalent estimates of 17.8%, 14%, 12.3%, and 14.6%.
         As a check on the Bairoch-Eggimann conversion, we can consider North Africa
as a whole. Including Egypt in 1900 the population of North Africa was 22.3m. The total
urban population from Eggimann was 2.9m, so the implied urbanization for all of North
Africa from Eggimann‚Äôs estimates is therefore 13%. Bairoch (p.429) estimates North
African urbanization in 1900 as 16%. This is quite consistent with our conversion rate.
         In 1500, the total population of North Africa was 8.3m (McEvedy and Jones
p.221, p.224 and p.227). Urban population according to Eggimann was 0.971m, implying
an urbanization rate for all of North Africa of 11.7%. Again, this is consistent with
Bairoch‚Äôs general view of this region.
         While the data on sub-Saharan Africa are worse than for any other region, it is
clear that urbanization before 1500 was at a higher level than North America or Australia.
By 1500 urbanization was ‚Äúwell-established‚Äù in sub-Saharan Africa (Bairoch 1988, p.55).
In fact, there are much older records from Arab explorers regarding African cities. ‚ÄúIn
summary, there were sizable cities in Black Africa by 1000 B.C., if not earlier‚Äù (Bairoch
1988, p.56).
         Leading examples of urbanization around the time of 1500 are to be found in the
kingdoms of Ghana, Songhai, Benin, Congo, Zimbabwe and the Yoruba states (of which
Benin was one) (Bairoch, pp.56-60). Around 1500, the city of Benin had a population in
the range of 60-70,000 and was a ‚Äúwell-ordered urban center with a system of water
conduits and a sizable artisanry working at an advanced technical level‚Äù (Bairoch, p.58).
The same kingdom had about 10 other cities at this time. At the time the Portuguese first
made contact with the kingdom of the Congo (in 1484), the capital city probably had a
population in the range of 40-60,000 (Bairoch, p.58).
         There were also a number of cities that were closely connected with or even
founded by Islamic traders from further north. Gao, Gober, Jenn√© (current spelling
Djenne), Kano, Kazargamu, Timbuktu and Zaria all fall into this category (Bairoch,
p.61). ‚ÄúAround the beginning of the sixteenth century, these cities had populations
ranging from between twenty-five thousand and seventy thousand, with an average
somewhere on the order of forty thousand‚Äù (Bairoch, p.61).
         Bairoch estimates that urbanization on average in sub-Saharan Africa was 3% in
1900 (p.430). For sub-Saharan Africa in 1800, Bairoch (1988, p.393) estimates the total
urban population was 3-4 million, of which Europeans were between 30,000 and
120,000. For 1900, he puts urbanization in the range of 2-5% (pp. 413-414, in particular
Table 26.1). His discussion makes it clear that there was substantial variation within sub-
Saharan Africa. West Africa, West-Central Africa (i.e., around the Congo/Kongo) and
East Africa (around Zanzibar and Kenya) were clearly more urbanized than Southern
Africa (with the exception of Zimbabwe, but the decline of this civilization can be placed
around 1450 and appears to have been independent of any European influence).9

  For a more detailed qualitative assessment that is broadly consistent with Bairoch‚Äôs view of
urbanization in Africa, see volumes II, III and IV of the UNESCO General History of Africa
(Mohktar 1990, Hrbek 1992, and Ki-Zerbo and Niane 1997.) Davidson (1970) argues even more
strongly that there were important cities south of the Sahara before 1500.


                                               9
       Given the weakness and incompleteness of data for sub-Saharan Africa, we do not
include any estimates in our baseline urbanization dataset. We do, however, include all of
sub-Saharan Africa in our baseline population density data.


3. Urbanization from 1500 to 2000
         Our base estimates for 1500 are drawn primarily from Eggimann and Bairoch,
with supporting evidence from Chandler. Eggimann‚Äôs data only cover countries that are
now part of the ‚ÄúThird World.‚Äù He therefore does not provide any information on the
timing of urbanization changes in settler colonies. Bairoch does have some information
on urbanization in the United States, Canada and Australia, but detailed quantitative
estimates only from 1800 (Bairoch 1988, Table 13.4, p.221.) For a more complete picture
of urbanization from 800 to 1850 across a wide range of countries, we therefore rely
primarily on Chandler‚Äôs estimates. We should emphasize, however, that wherever there is
overlapping information, these estimates are broadly consistent with the findings of
Eggimann and Bairoch.10 As before, we convert urban population numbers into
urbanization using population estimates from McEvedy and Jones (1978). The numbers
we use for 1700 are shown in Figures 5A and 5B.
         Chandler enables us to see the early increase in urbanization, but because his
series ends in 1850 (or 1861 for the Americas), we cannot follow the most important
trends into the twentieth century. In addition, Chandler‚Äôs data are reported at 50 year
intervals from 1700 (100 year intervals before that), which is enough only to show the
broad pattern.
         We therefore supplement the analysis with data from two other sources. The UN
(1969) provides detailed urbanization data from 1920, focussing on localities with 20,000
or more inhabitants (i.e., the same criteria as Chandler uses outside of Asia.) However,
this still leaves a gap between 1850 and 1920.
         We complete this composite series using data from Mitchell. His urbanization
data start in 1750, provides information every 10 years from 1790 for most countries and
runs to 1980. The only disadvantage of this series is the relatively late starting date. The
criteria for inclusion in Mitchell‚Äôs series is also a little different ‚Äì cities that had at least
200,000 inhabitants around 1970 ‚Äì but this seems to produce broadly consistent estimates
for overlapping observations. We use this data both to complete the Chandler series for
countries with low and high urbanization in 1500 (see Figure 6A) and for Mexico, India
and the US (Figure 6B) and to provide alternative estimates for the timing of urbanization
changes within the Americas (see Figure 6C).11
10
   The only point of disagreement is whether there was any urbanization in the area now occupied
by the United States in 1500. Chandler lists one town (Nanih Waiya) but does not give its
population. He also does not indicate any urbanization either before or after this date. Bairoch
argues there was no pre-European urbanization and the latest archaeological evidence suggests
villages rather than towns (Fagan 2000). We therefore follow Bairoch in assigning a value of
zero. For supportive evidence, see Waldman (1985), p.30.
11
   We use the conservative Davis-Zipf adjustment (i.e., doubling Eggimann‚Äôs estimates) in
constructing Figure 6B because otherwise the urbanization estimate for India is too far below
what Bairoch documents as reasonable for the period after 1700. However, we do not make this
adjustment for Figures 6A and 6C as it would push the timing of the reversal later into the
nineteenth century, i.e., support our hypothesis.


                                               10
         The main problem with using Chandler‚Äôs data are that he has a higher threshold
for Asia (40,000 inhabitants) than for the rest of the world (20,000). Therefore his
estimates of urbanization in, for example, India are probably around half what they would
be if he were consistently using a threshold of 20,000 (applying the Zipf-Davis
adjustment). For this reason, in our graphs of ‚Äúhigh‚Äù urbanization countries in 1500, we
do not have any Asian countries.
         However, including Asia in Figure 6A would strengthen the conclusion that the
Reversal took place late in the eighteenth or early in the nineteenth century. In particular,
the fall in urbanization around 1500 in any data series weighted by population would be
much less if we included any significant part of Asia.

Additional Information on the Americas
        More detailed information from Bairoch and Chandler confirms that urbanization
in North America occurred relatively late and quite quickly. Bairoch (1988) comments as
follows ‚ÄúAround 1700 North America north of the Rio Grande was still very thinly
populated, there being some 250,000 Europeans, some 30,000 blacks, and perhaps one to
three million native Americans. But in contrast to what was the case south of the Rio
Grande, the white newcomers did not confront indigenous urban cultures‚Ä¶ [W]hile
certain of the cultures of northern North America had attained a high degree of
development in art and in a number of techniques, they remained on the whole essentially
rural and even, in most cases, preagrarian.‚Äù (p.221).
        For 1800, Bairoch (1988, p.222) estimates that urbanization in North America
was only 5-6%, compared with 12% in Europe. Around the same time, urbanization in
Latin America was around 12-14% (p.222). In fact, for 1800, Bairoch (1988, p.389)
estimates that Latin America was the most highly urbanized part of the world, with
urbanization around 13-16%, i.e., 2-3 points higher than Europe (excluding Russia). By
1900 North America was more urbanized than Europe but most of Latin America
definitely was not.
         Chandler (1987) provides further detailed information on urbanization in 1861
and also makes a useful comparison with 1775 for almost all countries in the Americas.
In 1775 there was a total population of about 4m in what became the United States. The
total urban population in cities above 10,000 inhabitants was 89,000 (34,000 in
Philadelphia, 24,000 in New York, 19,000 in Boston and 12,000 in Charleston), implying
an urbanization rate of 2.2% (Chandler 1987, p.52.)12
        In 1800, according to Chandler, the urban population was 192,000 out of a total
population of 6m, implying urbanization of 3.2%.13 A gap was already opening up
between the North and the South of the US. In the North (defined by the states that stayed
with the union in the civil war), urbanization was 7.1% while urbanization in the South
was around 0.8% by Chandler‚Äôs figures.14 By 1850, total urbanization, using a threshold

12
   In 1700 Boston had a population of 6-7,000 (Bairoch 1988, p.296). In 1750 Boston was the
only city in North America that had a population of at least 20,000 (Chandler 1987).
13
   Even with his lower threshold for urbanization (5,000 vs. 18,000 in this case for Chandler),
Bairoch estimates that urbanization was just 5% (Bairoch 1988, p.221).
14
   For 1820, Bairoch (1988, p.297) reports that 6% of the US population lived in towns with at
least 5,000 inhabitants. By Bairoch‚Äôs figures, in 1850 urbanization was up to 13-14%. Bairoch
emphasizes that urbanization grew particularly rapidly between 1820 and 1870.


                                                11
of 18,000 inhabitants from Chandler, was 19.8%. In 1861, urbanization in the North was
up to 31.5% while in the South it was no more than 5%.15 At the same time, urbanization
in Canada was 12.9%.
         In complete contrast, in Central and South America, urbanization was relatively
high in the mid-1700s but either did not increase as rapidly as in the US or actually fell in
the next 100 years. For example, in 1775, Chandler (1987, p.52) reports that the urban
population of Mexico was 351,000, implying an urbanization rate of 7%. In 1800,
urbanization was still 7% and in 1850 it was only 7.5%, but by 1861 urbanization was
still no more than 8.6%. In Peru, Chandler (p.52) reports an urban population in 1775 of
165,000, implying an urbanization rate of 11%. By 1800, however, his numbers imply
that urbanization was down to 9.3% and by 1850 it was down to 6.6%. In 1861,
urbanization in Peru was no more than 8.7%. In Brazil, urbanization in 1775 was 7.3%,
while in 1861 it was 7.4%. In Venezuela, urbanization was 5.2% in 1775 but only 7.1%
in 1861. Urbanization in Guatemala and Haiti seems to have stayed around 2%
throughout this period.
         Urbanization fell in the former Inca empire in the century after 1775.
Urbanization in Bolivia was 9.1% in 1775 but no more than 7.7% in 1861. In Ecuador,
urbanization was 15.8% in 1775, but no more than 10.4% in 1861. In Colombia,
urbanization was 5.2% in 1775 but only 4.1% in 1861. In Cuba, urbanization in 1775 was
24.6%; in 1861 it was 23.7%. In Jamaica, urbanization was 9% in 1800 but only 8.3% in
1850. There was no appreciable increase in urbanization over the same time period in
Martinique or Barbados.
         The notable exceptions are in the southern cone, where urbanization was
relatively low in the mid-eighteenth century but then grew rapidly. In Chile, urbanization
was 2.5% in 1775, but up to 11.1% in 1861. In Argentina, urbanization was 8% in 1775
and up to 12.5% in 1861. In 1861, urbanization in Paraguay was 9.6% and 51% in
Uruguay.

4. Urbanization Before 1500 (particularly in 1000 AD)
        The most comprehensive cross-continent data on urbanization in 1000 AD is from
Chandler (1987). Eggimann‚Äôs data start only in 1500. Bairoch provides some useful
qualitative assessments but quantitative estimates only from 1300. To enable us to
calculate Bairoch-equivalent urbanization rates, we turn to Bairoch, Batou and Ch√®vre
(BBC, 1988), who provide detailed European urban population estimates by city from
800 AD (although they put more reliance in these numbers from 1200/1300). As we want
to compare urbanization in 1000 with urbanization in 1500 (on the Bairoch basis), we
convert the Chandler estimates to Bairoch-equivalent units using the BBC numbers to
guide us. As with 1500, we convert urban population numbers into urbanization estimates
using total population from McEvedy and Jones (1978).
        Specifically, we convert the Chandler estimates into Bairoch-equivalent units
using coefficients from a regression of the 11 overlapping data points for 1000 AD (all
European). The coefficient on the Chandler estimate is 1.13 (significant at the 1% level)
and the constant is 1.03. Note that given the result of this regression, our adjustment is
essentially the same as applying Davis-Zipf‚Äôs law for low urbanization countries
(although a smaller adjustment for high urbanization countries) ‚Äì see Bairoch (1988,

15
     These North-South calculations use the population numbers of 1850.


                                                12
chapter 9). We have also checked the implications of using the simple Zipf-Davis
doubling of the Chandler estimates.
        In this part of the appendix we focus on urbanization in 1000. However, to assess
whether urbanization in that year was at all unusual, as well as to give a sense of
persistence of urbanization over shorter periods, we also report urbanization for 800,
1200, 1300, and 1400. If we do not report a particular year, this indicates that the data are
missing. We should emphasize that reporting these numbers (and using one decimal
place) does not imply that we necessarily think these estimates are accurate to within a
few percentage points. Rather we argue that the broad pattern of urbanization is clear
from these estimates and we can discern (in conjunction with qualitative evidence) to
what extent urbanization has changed over periods of time such as 500 years.
        To save space, we report estimates only for the countries in our base sample for
which we have data. Estimates for non-colonized countries are available from the
authors.

The Americas in 1000
         For Mexico, Chandler reports an urban population in 1000 AD of 170,000.
McEvedy and Jones put total population at 3 million, implying urbanization of 5.7%.
Urbanization was 6% in 800, 3.1% in 1200, 2.8% in 1300 and 4.9% in 1400. We convert
Chandler‚Äôs estimate to a Bairoch-equivalent estimate of 7.5% and use this.
         For Peru, Chandler‚Äôs urban population estimate in 1000 AD is 40,000. McEvedy
and Jones put total population at 1.5 million, implying urbanization of 2.7%. Calculated
in this way, urbanization was 1.6% in 800, 2.3% in 1200, 3.5% in 1300 and 5.3% in
1400. We use a Bairoch-equivalent estimate of 4.1%.
         Chandler estimates that the urban population of Bolivia was 20,000 in 800 and
40,000 in 1200, but he does not give an estimate for 1000 AD. McEvedy and Jones put
population at 500,000 in 800 and 800,000 in 1200, implying urbanization of 4% and 5%
respectively. An estimate of 3% urbanization using the Chandler criterion in 1000
therefore seems reasonable. We use a Bairoch-equivalent estimate of 4.4%.
         The earliest urbanization data we have for Ecuador is 1200, for which date
Chandler estimates an urban population of 40,000. McEvedy and Jones suggest that total
population was half a million, which would imply that urbanization was 8%. We use this
estimate also for 1000 AD, converting it to a Bairoch-equivalent estimate of 10.1%.
Urbanization was 16% (using Chandler‚Äôs measure) in 1300 and 18% in 1400.
         According to Chandler, the area now consisting of Central America (particularly
Guatemala) had an urban population of 100,000 in 800 (at the height of the Mayan
civilization) and 45,000 in 1200. McEvedy and Jones put the population of Central
America at 500,000 and 600,000 respectively at those dates, implying urbanization of
20% at the earlier date and 7.5% at the later date. Unfortunately, we do not have data on
urbanization in 1000. To be on the safe side, we use urbanization from 1200. We convert
this to a Bairoch-equivalent estimate of 9.5%.
         Chandler does not report urbanization data for Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Canada,
Paraguay, Uruguay or the United States before 1500. For all these countries, it is safe to
assume that urbanization was essentially zero in 1000. Chandler also does not report data
for any part of the Caribbean, Colombia, Guyana, or Venezuela. We have reason to think




                                             13
that urbanization may have been above zero in some of these cases, but we assume zero
urbanization for the sake of consistency (and because it goes against our hypothesis.)

Asia in 1000
        Chandler‚Äôs estimates of urbanization in Asia are almost certainly underestimates
because he uses a minimum threshold of 40,000 inhabitants. We use the same conversion
factor (from the regression of BBC on Chandler) for our base estimates. All our estimates
for Asia are Bairoch-equivalent urbanization rates formed by thus converting Chandler‚Äôs
data.
        The urban population of Pakistan, India and Bangladesh was 627,000 in 1000
AD, while its total population was 77 million (McEvedy and Jones, p.185), giving
urbanization of 0.8%. Urbanization was 0.8% in 800, 0.8% in 1200, 0.8% in 1300, and
1.2% in 1400. These estimates are very low compared with other evidence. For example,
they imply that urbanization in 1500 was only 1.8%, whereas Bairoch‚Äôs analysis suggests
it was much higher ‚Äì probably at least 8%. Chandler‚Äôs method seems to be particularly
biased for larger countries (see also the problems with China below). We use his numbers
here, however, as we are primarily interested in the change between 1000 AD and 1500
AD using the same methodology.
        To assess urbanization in Indonesia and Malaysia we use the estimate of the total
population of the Malay Archipelago, from McEvedy and Jones, p.199. Chandler
provides no data for 1000 AD. For 800 AD, he estimates total urban population was
60,000. With total population of 3.5 million, this implied urbanization of 1.7%.
In 1300, urbanization was 0.7% and in 1400 it was 1.1%. We use the 800 AD estimate
and convert this to a Bairoch-equivalent number of 3%.
        The area occupied by ‚ÄúChina Proper‚Äù (excluding Turkestan and Tibet) contained
60 million people in 1000 AD (McEvedy and Jones, p.171). Chandler estimates the total
urban population in this area was 1.504 million, implying urbanization of 2.5%.
Measured in this way, urbanization was 2.9% in 800, 1.4% in 1200, 2.4% in 1300, and
2.8% in 1400. We use a Bairoch-equivalent urbanization estimate of 3.9%.
        Note that this is almost certainly an underestimate, as in the case of India. Given
that the urban population of China in 1500 is underestimated for the same reason (both
Eggimann and Chandler count only large cities), this should still allow us to check for
persistence, i.e., whether urbanization either fell or rose dramatically, it would probably
be picked up in these numbers. If anything, the use of a relatively high threshold ‚Äì e.g.,
40,000 inhabitants ‚Äì should exaggerate the fluctuations in urban population. We should
exercise care, however, when comparing large countries such as China and India with
smaller countries.
        The urban population of Burma/Myanmar in 1000 AD was 40,000 according to
Chandler. The total population was 2 million (from McEvedy and Jones), implying
urbanization of 2%. Urbanization was 7.3% in 1200 and 3.1% in 1400. We use a
Bairoch-equivalent estimate of 3.3%. Note that while we have urbanization data on
Myanmar in 1000 and 1500 but not data on GDP per capita today. This country therefore
appears in graphs and regressions of urbanization in 1500 on urbanization in 1000 but not
in our base sample.
        Chandler estimates the urban population of Afghanistan was 60,000, while
McEvedy and Jones put total population at 2.25 million in 1000 AD. This puts the ‚Äúpure



                                            14
Chandler‚Äù urbanization estimate at 2.7% and we use a Bairoch-equivalent estimate of
4.1%. No other information on urbanization before 1500 is available.
        Urbanization in Sri Lanka was 7.5% in 1200 ‚Äì urban population of 75,000 from
Chandler and total population of 1 million from McEvedy and Jones. No other data on
urbanization before 1500 are available. We treat this as missing data for 1000 AD.
        We have no data on urbanization in Vietnam until 1300. At that date, the urban
population, according to Chandler was 40,000. McEvedy and Jones‚Äô total population
estimate of 1 million implies an urbanization estimate of 4%. We treat this as missing
data for 1000 AD.
        We have no data on urbanization in the Philippines on or around 1000 AD. We
have no information about urbanization in Laos in or around 1000 AD. We treat this as
missing data for 1000 AD.
        We assume urbanization in Hong Kong and Singapore was 3% in 1000, following
the same reasoning as in our previous appendix on 1500.

The Pacific Region in 1000
        We assume zero urbanization in 1000 for Australia, New Zealand. This does not
seem controversial. There is no sign of significant urban structures in Australia before
1800. In New Zealand, there may have been some very small-scale urbanization, but even
if we increased the urbanization estimate to 3% (as for 1500), this would not change any
of our results.

Africa in 1000
        As is the case for 1500, the data on North Africa is reasonable and probably not
subject to greater error than other non-European data. We have information on
urbanization in 1000 for all North African countries, except Libya.
        For Egypt in 1000, Chandler reports an urban population of 285,000. McEvedy
and Jones estimate the total population was 5 million at this date, implying urbanization
of 5.7%. Urbanization, calculated from these sources, was 3.9% in 800, 10.6% in 1200,
13.5% in 1300, and 14.5% in 1400. We use a Bairoch-equivalent estimate of 7.5%.
        For Tunisia, Chandler puts the urban population in 1000 at 60,000 and McEvedy
and Jones estimate total population was 1 million. We convert this estimate of
urbanization, 6%, into a Bairoch-equivalent estimate of 7.8%. Urbanization, in
Chandler‚Äôs units, was 12.5% in 800, 6% in 1200, 7% in 1300 and 8.8% in 1400.
        Chandler estimates the urban population of Algeria was 20,000 in 1000 AD.
McEvedy and Jones put total population at 2 million, implying urbanization of 1%.
Urbanization was 1.6% in 800, 2% in 1200, 7% in 1300 and 9.1% in 1400. We use a
Bairoch-equivalent estimate of 2.2%.
        For Morocco, McEvedy and Jones put total population in 1000 at 2 million and
Chandler puts the urban population at 100,000, implying urbanization of 5%. The same
combination of sources gives urbanization of 3.25% in 800, 23% in 1200, 17.3% in 1300,
and 14.8% in 1400. We use a Bairoch-equivalent estimate of 6.7%.
        As previously discussed, the data on urbanization in sub-Saharan Africa are
fragmentary, of dubious value and almost certainly underestimates true urbanization with
biases that are hard to assess. The data for 1000 AD are worse than for 1500 and we do
not use it in our analysis.

Log GDP per capita through 1900 is from Bairoch (1978), with the addition of Gregory King for England before 1700, from Snooks (1994).
Urbanization is percent of population living in towns with at least 5,000 people, from Bairoch (1988) through 1900 with supplementary sources
as described in the appendix. Log GDP per capita in 1950 is from Maddison (1995); this regression uses urbanization in 1960 from the World
Bank's World Development Indicators 1999. Log GDP per capita (PPP) and Urbanization data for 1995 are from the World Bank's World
Development Indicators 1999. Population density is total population divided by arable land area, both from McEvedy and Jones (1978). For
detailed sources and descriptions see Appendix Table A1.

Regressions use data for all former colonies for which information on urbanization and population density in 1500 is available, as explained in the text. Urbanization in 1500 is percent
of the population living in towns with 5,000 or more people, from Bairoch (1988), with supplementary sources as described in the appendix. Population density in 1500 is total
population divided by arable land area from McEvedy and Jones (1978). Regressions with constraints on executive in first year of independence also include time since independence
as a regressor. For detailed sources and descriptions see Appendix Table A1.

Dependent Variable is log GDP per capita (PPP basis) in 1995. Base sample is all former colonies for which we have data. Urbanization in 1500 is
percent of the population living in towns with 5,000 or more people. The regression that includes continent dummies omits Oceania. The neo-
Europes are the USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. In the "other geography" regression we include 5 measures of temperature, 4 measures
of humidity, 7 measures of soil quality, and 5 measures of natural resources. The regression that controls for colonial origin includes dummies for
former French colony, Spanish colony, Portuguese colony, Belgian colony, Italian colony, German colony, and Dutch colony. British colonies are
omitted. The religion variables are percent of the population who are Muslim, Catholic, and "other"; percent Protestant is omitted. For detailed
sources and descriptions see Appendix Table A1.

Dependent Variable is log GDP per capita (PPP basis) in 1995. Base sample is all former colonies for which we have data. Urbanization in 1500 is percent of the
population living in towns with 5,000 or more people. In Panels B, C, D, and E we use, respectively, only Bairoch's estimates, Eggimann's estimates, Chandler's
estimates, and converting Eggimann's estimates into Bairoch-equivalent numbers using the Davis-Zipf adjustment. The neo-Europes, geography, religion variables and
colonial origin dummies are as described in the note to Table 4. For detailed sources and descriptions see Appendix Table A1.

Dependent Variable is log GDP per capita (PPP basis) in 1995. Base sample is all former colonies for which we have data. In our base sample,
urbanization in 1500 is percent of the population living in towns with 5,000 or more people. Alternative assumptions are as described at the top of each
column. Population density in 1500 is total population divided by arable land area. Panel D reports the second stage coefficients from an IV regression
using log population density in 1500 as the instrument. The basic Toynbee civilizations include Andean, Mexic, Yucatec, Arabic (North Africa), Hindu,
Polynesian, and Eskimo (Canada). The augmented Toynbee civilizations also include North American Indian, South American Indian
(Brazil/Argentina/Chile), Australian Aborigine, Malay (Malaysia and Indonesia), Philippines, Vietnam/Cambodia, and Burma. For detailed sources and
descriptions see Appendix Table A1.

Urbanization is the percent of the population living in cities with more than 5,000 inhabitants. Base sample is all former colonies for which we have data. Population density in 1AD, 1000
and 1500 is total population divided by arable land area. See the note to Table 7 for the list of augmented Toynbee civilizations. Column 10 includes a dummy for Asia; Europe is the
omitted category. For detailed sources and descriptions see Appendix Table A1.

Dependent Variable is log GDP per capita (PPP basis) in 1995. The measure of institutions used in each regression is indicated at the head of each column.
Regressions with constraints on the executive in the first year of independence also include time since independence as a regressor. Urbanization in 1500 is
percent of the population living in towns with 5,000 or more people. Population density is calculated as total population divided by arable land area.
Constraints on the executive in 1990, 1900 and the first year of independence are all from the Polity III dataset. Panel A reports the second stage estimates from
IV regression with first stage shown in Panel B. Panel C reports second stage estimates from the IV regression, instrumenting institutions without urbanization
and population density. Log settler mortality estimates are from Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson (2001). For detailed sources and descriptions see Appendix
Table A1.

Panel regressions; country and period dummies are included as indicated at the foot of each column. Dependent variable in Panel A is industrial output per capita, with up to 10 observations per country,
1750-1980, from Bairoch (1982). Dependent variable in Panel B is log GDP per capita from Maddison (1995). The independent variable of interest is total UK industrial output interacted with constraints
on the executive in each country from the Polity IV dataset. The main effect of institutions is evaluated at the mean value of UK industrialization. Polity IV provides information only for independent
countries; if a country was a colony at a particular date, we assign the lowest value of constraints on the executive. For detailed sources and descriptions see Appendix Table A1.

Our base estimates are constructed using information from Bairoch and a conversion from Eggimann using formula to Bairoch-equivalent estimates (as explained in the text). Where alternative estimates are available, we
use those less favorable to our hypothesis.
Bairoch-only estimates use 9% for all Asian countries, 7% for Central America and Colombia, 12% for Andean countries, 3% for countries with minimal urbanization and 0% for all other countries in our base sample.
Eggimann-only estimates are not adjusted to Bairoch-equivalent units and we use Bairoch's estimates for low urbanization countries.
Chandler-only estimates are not adjusted to Bairoch-equivalent units. We use a value of zero only for countries that are in Chandler's dataset and for which he does not indicate any urbanization in 1500 while Bairoch
indicates zero urbanization.
The Davis-Zipf adjustment doubles Eggimann's estimates but uses a low estimate for Central America (details are in the data appendix).
Population density numbers are from McEvedy and Jones (1978).
A period (".") denotes missing data. For more detailed sources and discussions of robustness, see the appendix.

Dependent Variable is log GDP per capita (PPP basis) in 1995. Base sample is all former colonies for which we have data. Urbanization in 1500 is percent of the population
living in towns with 5,000 or more people. The neo-Europes are the USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Religion variables and colonial origin dummies are as described
in Table 4. Panels A and C use log settler mortality as an instrument for institutions. Panels B, D and E are OLS regressions. For detailed sources and descriptions see Appendix
Table A1.
