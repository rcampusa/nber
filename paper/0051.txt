                   AGE, EXPERIENCE, AND WAGE GROWTH

                           by Edward Lazear*



        During the past decade, much has been said about the role that

on—the—job training plays in augmentingone's stock of human capital)

Up to this point, little has been done to distinguish the effect of

on—the—job training from that of aging on the increase in human wealth.

The reason rests primarily on the fact that it is difficult to observe

or even define in some appropriate way the amount of on—the—job training

that an individual possesses. In this paper, a method is developed by

which one may compare the effects of work experience to those of aging

per Se. The difference is then attributed to on—the—job training.

        The analysis deals with the relationship between an individual's

wage growth pattern and his employment history. If, as the human

capital framework suggests, individuals increase their wealth by investing

in themselves in the form of on—the—job training, one might expect that

workers who spend less time on the job during a given period of time

would acquire less human capital. If so, individuals who work a smaller

proportion of time during say, a three year period, will experience less

rapid wage growth than individuals who work continuously throughout this

time. Thus, it is expected that the growth rate of wages will be

related not simply to an individual's chronological age, but also to

the amount of time spent on the job during the period under consideration.

If this is in fact the case, then part of the cost of being unemployed

takes the form of human capital foregone during the period. The total

cost of unemployment is then the sum of foregone earnings plus the value
                                                     2




of    foregone human capital. The majority of this paper will be devoted
                                                                                 .
to estimating the size of this effect.



           Suppose that wage growth over time takes the form of


                                    (y.)t + u.

                    =

where      W69 is the hourly wage rate in 1969 in cents for individual i,
               I
           W66 is the hourly wage rate in 1966 in cents for individual I,

                    is the average annual growth rate of wages which varies

                    across individuals,

               A is a wage shift parameter unique to this three year period,

                    but invariant across individuals,

              u1 is the random error term where u                   N(O, 2 I)

The growth rate, y., depends on a number of other parameters, the most

fundamental of which relate to aging and the acquisition of human capital.

the individual not at work.

           Although the data to be used in this analysis are quite explicit

with respect to job experience, it still remains impossible to directly

measure with any confidence the amount of on—the—job training acquired

over this three year period. It is possible, however, to approximate

the change in the stock of on—the—job training if it is assumed that

where     E69I    is the amount of job experience in 1969 for individual i,

      and 63 are positive while S and             are negative.

             is expected to be positive since individuals who spend more

time working are more likely to acquire on—the—job training (this

essentially is the requirement that the cost of learning be a convex

function of the learning rate).2 62 should be negative since it pays

an individual who plans to invest in one—the—job training to do so during

his first years on the job. This means that as previous experience

increases, incremental investment In on—the—job training should fall.3

The sign of 63 depends upon the marginal complementarity or substitutability

of formal schooling and on—the—job training. If, as seems most likely,

formal schooling and on—the—job training are complements, 63 will be
                                                   4




positive.      Finally, 64 is negative since older individuals are less

so that we can obtain an upper bound to the effect of aging on wage

growth.

       Up to this point, onlyhuman capital variablesof themost traditional

types have been included in the wage growth equation. However, there are

reasons to expect that wage growth will depend on other factors as well.

In light of the work by Lindsay (1971), Mincer and Polachek (1974), and

Parsons (1974), it is reasonable to suppose that wage growth will be a

function of the change in the number of hours worked between 1966 and

1969. In addition, to the extent that military experience offers an

alternative method of acquiring human capital, the change in the amount

of military experience should be included. Finally, since there are

many reasons why blacks may have different incentives to invest in

on—the--job training than whites, race may be a factor in determining

wage growth. These variables are added to (8) so that it becomes



(12)      in W69 —   in          =     +   fl1S66 + fl2E66 + 3(S69 —    s66)

        CH is the "usual" number of hours worked in 1969 minus the

            "usual" number of hours worked in 1966,

        CM is the number of years of military experience in 1969 minus

            the number of years of military experience in 1966.

        This equation can be easily estimated with longitudinal data

obtainable from the National Longitudinal Survey. The data selected for

this study was that pertaining to young men, 14 to 24 years old. The

reason is straightforward. Since we are trying to estimate the effect

of experience on wage growth, postulating that missed work time represents

missed on—the—job training, we would like to examine a group of

individuals who undertake substantial investment in human capital. Since

the young tend to invest most and since men invest in on—the—job training

more than do women, the desired effects are most likely to be observed

when looking at young men. The results should therefore be interpreted

in this light: The estimated effects will tend to be stronger for the

group in question than for the working population as a whole.

        The original sample has records on 5,225 individuals. This had

to be reduced to 1,996 observations to meet the following criteria:

First, it was necessary for the purposes that individuals in the sample

have wage rates reported in both 1966 and 1969. Although this tended to

systematically throw out observations on younger individuals in the

sample, the mean age of those remaining was still 19.334 years. Second,

individuals who reported that their wage rate was either less than fifty

cents per hour or greater than ten dollars were dropped on the grounds

that reported wages in those cases were unlikely to be correct. Finally,

observations were dropped for which there was incomplete information on

variables used in this analysis.

(The figures enclosed in parentheses are standard errors.)

        The equation yields a number of interesting results. First, the

coefficient on TN is negative and significant. This is consistent with

the theory. Individuals who spend less time in the work force acquire

less human capital in the form of on—the—job training. Since this

equation holds formal schooling constant, this coefficient is not biased

by the substitution of formal schooling for on—the--job training during

the non—worked period. The term reflects the net foregone investment in

human capital associated with dropping out of the work force.6

        The coefficients are more easily interpreted when converted by

the following computation: Taking the anti—log of (12), we may write



             =
                             +      + rE66       + ...    +
                                                              p8CM)

for a white worker who was not in the military between 1966 and 1969.

(All other variables assume their mean values.)

          Equation (16) implies that being out of the work force for a

period of one additional year between 1966 and 1969 will cost the

individual 14.3 per hour in lower wages in 1969. The following calculation

reveals this to be a substantial loss.

          Suppose the individual in question missed work during 1968—69.

Let us make the optimistic assumption that he catches up with his otherwise

expected wage rate after five years, I.e., four years after re—entering

the work force. During those four years, he loses l4.3Q per hour for

each hour worked. The present value of the human capital loss to an

          When   computing      the cost of a given amount of unemployment, one

should add to foregone earnings the value of the foregone human capital.

The foregone earnings associated with being unemployed during 1968—69 can

be estimated for this individual. If



                               .434507
(18)      W69 =            e             =             e 3y
                     W66                         W66


then


(19)        y =      .144836


so that


(20)      W8 —— W6e2(.144836)
                 =   201.05(1.3360)          =     $2.686 per hour.



Foregone earnings associated with missing 1968—69 then amount to

2000($2.686) or $5,372.

          Given the assumptions, the cost of foregone human capital amounts

to about one—fifth the cost of foregone earnings associated with being

out of work. This amount is not insignificant, especially when it is

remembered that a relatively short catch—up period was assumed and that

the costs of catching up were assumed to be zero. If, at the other

extreme, one were to assume that the individual never catches up, the

present value of the human capital loss would be $2,860, or over one—half

the amount of foregone earnings.8

          These results are important in that they reveal the existence of

an experience effect. Work experience (or its complement) is related to
                                                11




wage growth independent of aging. Individuals who spend tre time at

work over the three year period seem to experience more rapid wage growth

which, it may be inferred, reflects on—the—job training.                  (This, of

course, holds other types of human capital acquisition such as formal

schooling constant.)

        It must be pointed out, however, that the effect of experience

on wage growth is much smaller than the upper bound of the aging effect.

From (11) and (13),       <    .3025.         The total effect of aging on wages is

where the second term on the right hand side of (21) is the effect of

reduced on—the—job training investment as the result of being older.

Thus

                       =                      .2749, one year of experience implies a
14.3 increase in wages. The upper bound of the effect of aging is

therefore about six times as large as that of work experience per se.

        Part of this difference may be attributed to a measurement bias.

Since older individuals are less likely to invest in on—the—job training

than are their younger counterparts, the observed wage understates the
                                     12




true   wage (which includes compensation in the form of human capital) by
                                                                            .
a greater amount for younger individuals than it does for older ones.

If so, a portion of the observed returns to aging would be illusory,

resulting from this systematic bias in observed wages.

          The last few paragraphs should not be taken to imply that

experience is unimportant. It is clear that aging is important and

understandably so for individuals in the 14 to 24 year old age group.

However, aging is parametric whereas experience is not. Experience has

been shown to be important both in an absolute sense and relative to

current wages. The fact that the effect of aging is so pronounced for

the group in question is an interesting and useful result; it does not,

however, negate the importance of the experience effect.

         It should be noted that the effect of experience on wage growth

is not analytically the same as the effect of previous experience on

wage growth. The effect of the former as reflected by the TN coefficient

represents the amount by which wages increase with additional work

experience in the current period. The latter relates to the rate at

which individuals will acquire on—the—job training in the current period

for each unit of current experience. It was anticipated that individuals

with a greater amount of previous experience would invest in less

on—the—job training during the current period since it (generally) pays

to invest in larger amounts of training during the initial years of work.

The coefficient on E66 bears this out.

         This also sheds light On the question of neutrality. If the

rental price of human capital were constant over all units of human

capital once age were given,9 and If the marginal cost of human capital
                                       13




were not a function of previous investment (i.e., Ben—Porath's neutrality

assumption), the effect of previous experience on the (absolute) change

in wages would be zero. More simply, if neither the marginal cost nor

marginal return to investment in human capital varies with previous

experience, there is no reason for the experienced worker to behave

differently from the unexperienced one. The wage growth behavior of

both individuals would be expected to be the same. The fact that

experience does have a negative effect on (in W69 —                in   W66) implies that

the neutrality assumption is invalid or that retirement (or more generally,

length of time in the labor force) is a function of experience. From

(14), we can write

(In the context of this question, W66 is a parameter. We are interested

in the effect of previous experience on wage growth between 1966 and

1969, given wages in 1966 rather than the total effect of previous

experience on wage growth which includes the effect of E66 on W66.) Then

differentiating with respect to E66 yields


        (W69 — W66)                  + ...     +

This expression is necessarily negative since                 <   0.
        The negative effect of previous experience on inferred investment

in on—the—job training Implies that one of two situations holds: On the

one hand, It may be the case that the retirement age (or the amount of
                                    14




future   time to be spent working) is a function of past experience with
                                                                               .
this age falling as previous experience increases. This reduces the

returns to investment in human capital and decreases the optimal amount

of on—the—job training purchased. It is unlikely, however, that this

can account for much of the effect since the retirement date for these

individuals is expected to occur about forty years hence.

         The alternative explanation is provided by relaxing the neutrality

assumption. If previous investment in on—the—job training affects the

productivity of time spent working by more than it affects the productivity

of time spent in the production of human capital, then the marginal cost

of a unit of human capital rises as experience rises. Thus, given age,

individuals with more previous experience enjoy less rapid wage growth

over the period.10

         Age enters negatively and significantly and the coefficient is

of roughly the same magnitude as that on previous experience. However,

since the date of retirement occurs so far in the future, it is unreasonable

to infer that the age coefficient reflects the difference in marginal

returns to investment in human capital across individuals. Two

explanations seem more plausible. First, as pointed out above, aging

is an important component in the determination of wage growth. It is

reasonable to suppose that aging matters more for younger workers than

for older ones since both physical and emotional maturity appear to be

concave functions of time. If so, the age coefficient is essentially an

interaction relationship between aging and age. Second, one may attribute

the negative age effect to a quality component not held constant by the

included variables. That is, a 24—year old who has the same amount of          S
                                             15



work experience as an 18—year old obviously uses his time differently.

If past work history is correlated with future labor force behavior, the

older individual has a lower probability of being employed throughout

the full year than does the younger one. The age coefficient then not

only picks up the effect of age per Se, but also the desire to spend a

smaller proportion of each working year at the job.

        The coefficient on incremental schooling is positive and

significant. As I have argued elsewhere,11 this should not be interpreted

as a rate of return to education, but simply as the average effect of

schooling on wage growth over this three year period. It is, however,

interesting to ask what the net effect is of dropping out of the labor

force to attend school. The results in (13) permit this calculation.

Since

               (S69       S66)36


where TO is non—school time not worked and the school year is assumed

to be thirty—six weeks long, we may substitute so that

where the expression on the left hand side is the gross—partial associated

with an increase in schooling that occurs by dropping out of the labor

force. Then

                                       =    .009189

where (.0158) is the standard error computed from the variance—covariance

matrix.

          Attending school Is then slightly more productive in terms of

wage growth than is on—the—job training. This is as it should be since

the costs associated with the former are larger than those associated

with the latter. In fact, the difference between the two may appear

to be too small. This can be explained by the fact that the estimates

relate to the average rather than marginal effects over the three year

period. If the ratio of average to marginal effects of schooling are

less than the ratio of average to marginal effects of on—the—job

training, then the estimate of the schooling effect overstates the

marginal schooling effect by less than the estimate of the on—the—job

training effect overstates the marginal on—the—job training effect.

Under circumstances where the effect of schooling (on—the—job training)

on the difference In the log of wages was a negative, convex function

of previous schooling (on—the—job training), this would be the expected

result since individuals in this group are at relatively high levels of

formal schooling, but at low levels of on—the—job training.

          As anticipated, an Increase in the number of hours per week

worked has a positive effect on wage growth. The partial effect is

so that increasing average weekly hours by 20 (I.e., moving from the

typical part—time to the typical full—time job) increases wages In 1969

by about 17C per hour.
                                   17




        One rather interesting result is that, ceteris paribus, white

workers experienced less rapid wage growth over this period than did

black workers. This probably reflects the fact that 1966—69 witnessed

rather significant change in the institutional structure, one of the

results of which was a narrowing of the black—white differential.12 The

signalling hypothesis provides another explanation)3 It may be the

case that blacks with equal schooling and job experience as whites may

be seif—selectingly higher quality workers than are the corresponding

whites. Employers who fail to discriminate in their reading of signals

at the time of hiring will tend to pay the higher quality non—whites the

same wage as the lower quality white workers. Over time, however,

employers learn about the non—white's relative advantages and the non—white

worker's wages increase accordingly.    (This would not be expected to

persist over time, though, since employers who discriminated In favor of

non—whites with equal schooling and experience at the time of hiring

would drive their less efficient competitors out of business.)

        Finally, the coefficient on incremental military experience is

positive and of roughly the same magnitude as incremental schooling.

The standard error here is large, probably because only 52 out of 1,996

individuals had a non—zero value for this variable. To the extent that

the estimate is taken to be close to the true value, it appears as though

one year in the military contributes as much to the stock of human

capital as one year of formal schooling.

 Summary and Conclusions
                                                                            .
        This paper has been an attempt to distinguish between the effects

of experience and age in the formation of human capital.     By asking
"What is the cost in foregone human capital associated with not working?"

we have obtained estimates of the age—experience differential. The major

findings were:

        1. The effect of current work experience on wage growth is

substantial. Under reasonable assumptions, anywhere from one—sixth to

one—third of the total cost of unemployment consists of the value of

foregone human capital.

        2. For individuals in the 14—24 year—old age group, aging is

the most important factor in the determination of wage growth. It should

be remembered, however, that aging is not an economic variable which is

subject to choice.

        3. The finding that wage growth is inversely related to previous

work experiences casts serious doubt on the validity of the neutrality

assumption. Since this assumption is almost universal throughout the

age—earnings literature, this result should cause some concern.

        4. As expected, an increase in formal schooling is associated

with more rapid wage growth. It is also found that schooling increases

wage growth by slightly more than does the equivalent amount of work

experience.

        5. Consistent with previous work, we find that an increase in

the number of hours worked implies more rapid wage growth.

        6. It appears that, ceteris paribus, non—whites enjoyed more

rapid wage growth over the period in question than did whites. This
                                   19




may be the result of institutional changes or of unobserved quality

differences at the time of hiring which work in favor of white workers.

        The main conclusion of this study is that it is a serious mistake

to treat "age" and "experience" as two names for the same phenomenon.

Investigators are likely to be misled by a grouping which fails to

distinguish between these two arguments of the human capital production

function.

        3. This is the usual result of an optimal investment plan in a

life—cycle context. Both Ben—Porath (1967) and Rosen (1972) derive this

implication. Heckman (1974) and Mincer and Polachek (1974), on the

other hand, show that under reasonable assumptions this result will not

hold.

        4.       is the effect of age on the acquisition of on—the—job

training. It should not be confused with a0 which is the effect of

aging on the stock of human capital and therefore on wage growth.

        5. By hypothesizing that the change in hours worked enters the

wage change equation we introduce simultaneity bias. The wage growth

equation writes wage growth as a function of the change in hours. The

supply of labor, however, would relate hours worked to wages and thus

change in hours worked to the change in wages. Because of this, OLS

yields biased estimates of the effects. The reader may be somewhat

reassured to learn that when the CH term was deleted from the equation,
                                   21




none of the remaining coefficients were significantly altered.   (See the

appendix for additional discussion of this issue.)

        The same argument does not, however, hold for the TN coefficient.

It can be argued that individuals with lower wage rates and/or higher

wealth will tend to work fewer hours. This does not apply for the change

in wage rates, however, since there is no reason to believe that

individuals who have experienced large wage increases have either low

wages or high wealth.

        6. It might be argued that this coefficient is a reflection of

differences in ability rather than in human capital stock levels. An

attempt was made to standardize for the component of ability not held

constant by inclusion of schooling, previous experience and age. The

NLS has information on virtually every individual In the sample which

gives their test scores on an examination which was designed to test

their "knowledge of the world of work." (Similar information was not

available on IQ.) If this can be considered a proxy for ability,

inclusion of this variable into equation (12) should affect the TN

coefficient if the ability argument were correct. Estimation of this

equation yielded results which were virtually identical in all respects

to equation (13). In particular, the coefficient on the ability proxy

was insignificant. (See the appendix regression #2 for complete results.)

        7. If foregone human capital affects non—market productivity as

well as market productivity, this present value calculation will tend to

understate the loss associated with unemployment. It is not likely

that this understatement will be significant, however, since on—the—job

training tends to be market specific in the type of human capital it

provides.

             If Ben—Porath's assumption of neutrality were correct, there

would be no reason to engage in any type of catch—up behavior. The

marginal cost of human capital would be independent of whether 1968—69

were worked or not. As long as the date of retirement is not significantly

altered, the marginal return to a unit of human capital would be left

unchanged as well so that there would be no reason to alter the optimal

investment plan.

        9. This amounts to assuming that retirement is a function of

age alone and is independent of the amount of time spent working over

the lifetime. In light of the work done by Bowen and Finegan (1969)

which shows that labor force participation tends to vary positively

with the level of education for older workers, it is unlikely that the

assumption is a valid one.                                                   S

          One may formulate a simple system of simultaneous equations

which treats hours worked as endogenous. Suppose



(A.l)       1169 =      + a1(ln     W69) + a2(A69)


and


(A.2)       H66 =    cz + cz1(ln W66) + a2(A66)

so that


(A.3)        CH =
                     (a0
                           —
                               a)   + a1(ln W69 —   in   W66) + a2(A69 — A66)



where     H66 is hours worked in 1966,

          1169 is hours worked in 1969,

          A66 is wealth in 1966, and

          A69 is wealth in 1969.

          Since wealth Is a lifetime concept, if expectations about lifetime

earnings between 1966 and 1969 do not change, (A69 —                    should equal
                                                                 A66)
zero. This term relates then to windfalls. Therefore define



                        =            — Y66) —        —
(A.4)       A69 — A66                           69

where y is the individual's income level and Y is the median income for

individuals in his occupation. The notion is that if the Individual's

income increases more rapidly than does the occupation's income, he has
                                    26




enjoyed a windfall gain.   (Since the sample consists of young workers,
                                                                              .
the average increase in individual income will exceed that of occupational

income. This, however, will be netted out by the constant term.)

        Appendix regression equation #4 contains the results of estimation

by 2SLS. CH is taken to be endogenous and fitted values obtained from

the regression on exogenous variables replace actual values.

        The results of the two stage regression differ substantially

from the estimates obtained by OLS. In the two stage equation, the only

variable that matters is CII. None of the other coefficients differ

significantly from zero. The explanation is straightforward: The variable

which is excluded to identify the equation is CA. CA is a transofrmation

of the change in income which for the group in question is highly

correlated with the change in wages. Since the dependent variable is the

change in the log of wages, it is not surprising that CH which uses CA

as an instrument in its construction is highly correlated with the

dependent variable. This explains the fact that its coefficient Is about

twenty times its size in the OLS regression and is the only significant

variable in the two stage regression.

        Note, however, that when the CII term is deleted in regression #3,

none of the remaining coefficients differ significantly from those obtained

in regression #1.
