Secular Stagnation? The Effect of Aging on Economic Growth in the Age of Automation

                                          ABSTRACT

Several recent theories emphasize the negative effects of an aging population on economic
growth, either because of the lower labor force participation and productivity of older workers or
because aging will create an excess of savings over desired investment, leading to secular
stagnation. We show that there is no such negative relationship in the data. If anything, countries
experiencing more rapid aging have grown more in recent decades. We suggest that this
counterintuitive finding might reflect the more rapid adoption of automation technologies in
countries undergoing more pronounced demographic changes, and provide evidence and
theoretical underpinnings for this argument.

    The rapid aging of the population of both developed economies and much of the rest of the
world, depicted in Figure 1, is seen as one of the most dangerous economic ills of the next several
decades. An increasingly popular thesis, building on Alvin Hansen’s famous 1938 presidential
address to the AEA, views developed economies as being afflicted by “secular stagnation,” partly
because an aging population creates an excess of savings relative to investments (Alvin Hansen,
1939, Lawrence Summers, 2013, and the essays in Coen Teulings and Richard Baldwin, 2014). A
different but related challenge is emphasized by Robert Gordon (2016), who identifies demographic
change as the first “headwind” slowing down economic growth in the developed world, for an
older population will reduce labor force participation and productivity (workers’ earnings, and
presumably productivity, peak in their 40s, e.g., Kevin M. Murphy and Finis Welch, 1990).

Figure 1: Aging from 1950 to 2015 and projections until 2050 (from the UN data). Aging is
measured by the ratio of the population above 50 years old to the population between 20 and 49.


    Though both perspectives imply that countries undergoing faster aging should be suffering more
from these economic problems,1 we show that since the early 1990s or 2000s, the periods commonly
viewed as the beginning of the adverse effects of aging in much of the advanced world, there is no
negative association between aging and lower GDP per capita.2 Figure 2 provides a glimpse of the

     Three qualifications to this conclusion should be noted. First, there are non-demographic factors, such as increased
levels of inequality and slower technological progress, that have also been suggested as potential causes of demand-side
secular stagnation. Second, this type of secular stagnation could be partially offset by monetary policy. Third, with
international capital flows, aging in one country might affect GDP per capita in others as well.

     Thomas Lindh and Bo Malmberg (1999) and James Feyrer (2007) investigate the relationship between demo-
graphics and aggregate productivity or growth, focusing on pre-1990 data. Both papers find some evidence supporting
the notion that the fraction of the population above 50 contributes negatively to GDP per capita. Their findings
motivate our baseline choice of demographic variable as the ratio of the population above 50 to those between the
ages of 20 and 49.

1990 and 2015 and the change in the ratio of the population above 50 to the population between
the ages of 20 and 49. In the next section, we show that even when we control for initial GDP
per capita, initial demographic composition and differential trends by region, there is no evidence
of a negative relationship between aging and GDP per capita; on the contrary, the relationship is
significantly positive in many specifications.

       The lack of a strong negative association between changes in age structure and changes in GDP
per capita is surprising. So what explains it?
       The post-1990 era coincides with the arrival of a range of labor-replacing technologies, most
recently robotics and artificial intelligence, which provide a wide variety of options for firms to
automate the production process. In Section II, we show that countries undergoing more rapid
demographic change are more likely to adopt robots (see also Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2017).3 In
Section III, we show that when capital is sufficiently abundant, a shortage of younger and middle-
aged workers can trigger so much more adoption of new automation technologies that the negative
effects of labor scarcity could be completely neutralized or even reversed.

    The recent working paper by Nicole Maestas, Kathleen J. Mullen and David Powell (2016) shows a negative
association between aging and economic growth across US states. To the extent that US states have more similar
technologies and more coordinated adoption decisions than countries, the countervailing effects of technology adoption
we emphasize would be absent or much muted in this sample.

I. Aging and GDP Per Capita: The Cross-Country Evidence

In this section, we start by showing that the relationship depicted in Figure 2 is robust. We use data
on GDP per capita from the Penn World Tables and population by age from the United Nations.
Our main results are shown in Table 1, which presents regressions of the change in (log) GDP per
capita from 1990 to 2015 on our baseline measure of population aging, the change in the ratio of
the population above 50 to those between the ages of 20 and 49. Our baseline sample includes 169
countries for which we have data. Panel A reports OLS regressions in changes (long differences)
with robust standard errors. Column 1 shows the raw correlation, already depicted in Figure 2.
We see a positive but insignificant relationship. The rest of the table investigates the robustness of
this relationship.

Notes: The table presents long-difference estimates of the impact of aging on GDP per capita in constant dollars from the Penn World Tables for
all countries (columns 1 to 5) and OECD countries (columns 6 to 8). Panels A and C define aging as the change in the ratio of the population
above 50 to the population between 20 and 49. Panel B defines aging as the change in the average age of the population above 20. Panels A and
B present results for the long differences between 1990 and 2015; while panel C presents results for the long differences between 2000 and 2015.
Columns 5 and 8 present IV estimates in which we instrument aging using the birthrate in 1960, 1965, . . . , 1980. The bottom rows indicate
additional controls included in the models but not reported. The population and age structure controls include the log of the population and the
initial value of our aging measure. We report standard errors robust to heteroskedasticity in parentheses.




     Column 2 includes initial log GDP per capita on the right-hand side, while column 3 also adds
the initial demographic composition (the ratio of the population above 50 to those between 20

and 49 and log population in 1990). Column 4 in addition includes a set of dummies for World
Bank “regions” (which are Latin America, East Asia, South Asia, Africa, North Africa and Middle
East, Eastern Europe and Central Asia, and Developed Countries), thus allowing for differential
regional trends. With these controls, the relationship between aging and GDP per capita becomes
less positive but remains statistically significant at 5 percent. For example, in column 4, the
coefficient estimate is 0.773 (standard error = 0.322).4 Column 5 estimates the same relationship
using birthrates for the 1960, 1965, 1970, 1975 and 1980 cohorts as instruments for our demographic
change variable, thus purging it from variation due to migration or changing mortality, which could
be endogenous to changes in GDP per capita. In this case, the coefficient of interest becomes even
more positive and significant, 1.703 (standard error = 0.411).
    Columns 6-8 report the same regressions for 35 OECD countries. In this case the OLS estimates
are imprecise, though the IV estimates are once again positive and similar to those in the whole
sample—1.186 (standard error = 0.458).
    Panel B shows similar patterns with a different measure of aging—change in the average age
of the population above 20. Panel C shows that the broad picture is also similar when we focus
on the post-2000 sample (2000-2015), where concerns about secular stagnation have become more
prominent.
    Table 2 extends the sample to 1965 and reports regressions with two differences of 25 years for
each country stacked together. Columns 1 and 2 mimic columns 1 and 3 from Table 1 and present
very similar results. In addition, columns 3-6 include country dummies, which are equivalent to
country-specific linear trends in levels, and report OLS and IV estimates of this more demanding
specification. The estimates again point to a positive and statistically significant relationship be-
tween population aging and economic growth in the full sample (and a less positive and insignificant
one in the OECD).


II. Aging and Robots

Why is there not a strong negative relationship between aging and GDP per capita as predicted
by a range of theories, including recent ones on secular stagnation? One possible answer is that
technology adjusts so as to undo this potential negative effect. We argue that this answer is
   4
     Figure 2 shows that Equatorial Guinea is an outlier, but leaving it out has essentially no impact on the regressions
reported here. For example, in the equivalent specification to column 4 without Equatorial Guinea, the coefficient
estimate is 0.615 (standard error = 0.290). Equatorial Guinea is an oil producer, and we also confirmed that this has
no effect on our results by including the share of oil revenues in GDP in 1990 (from the World Bank) as an additional
control.

Notes: The table presents stacked-difference estimates of the impact of aging on GDP per capita in constant dollars from the Penn World Tables
for all countries (columns 1 to 4) and OECD countries (columns 5 to 6). We define aging as the change in the ratio of the population above 50 to
the population between 20 and 49. We report estimates for the periods from 1965 to 1990 and 1990 to 2015. Columns 4 and 6 present IV

We report standard errors robust to heteroskedasticity and serial correlation within countries in parentheses.




plausible in two steps. First, in this section, we draw on Acemoglu and Restrepo (2017) to show
that countries experiencing more rapid aging are the ones that have been at the forefront of the
adoption of one important type of automation technology: industrial robots.
     The relationship between aging and adoption of robotics technology is established in Acemoglu
and Restrepo (2017) using data from the International Federation of Robotics (IFR), which provides
information on industrial robots across a range of industries for 49 countries. We use the same
data in the next figure to show the basic cross-country pattern, which reveals a strong correlation
between the same measure of demographic change used in our analysis so far—the change in the
ratio of the population above 50 to those between 20 and 49, and the change in the number of
robots (per million of labor hours) between the early 1990s and 2015.5
     Acemoglu and Restrepo (2017) document that this cross-country pattern is robust; it holds if
we exclude Korea (a clear outlier) and it holds within the OECD countries. Crucially, as would be
expected from a simple model of directed technological change, we also show that it is more pro-
nounced in industries that employ younger workers and those in which there are more opportunities
for automation.

     This figure excludes Japan, since the IRF notes that Japanese data are not comparable over time because of a
change in classification.

III. Can Labor Scarcity Lead to Higher GDP Per Capita?

In this section, we undertake the second, theoretical step in our argument. Drawing on Acemoglu
(2010) and Acemoglu and Restrepo (2016), we demonstrate that the scarcity of younger and middle-
age labor can trigger sufficient adoption of robots (and other automation technologies) so as to
actually increase aggregate output, despite the reduced labor input.
   For illustration purposes, we use a static model. Suppose that the aggregate production tech-
nology is given by the following Cobb-Douglas aggregate over the services of a range of tasks,
                                              Z 1
                                       ln Y =     ln y(i)di.                                   (1)
                                                                                                               0

Each task i can be produced with capital or labor combined with their specialized intermediates,
q(i). In particular, as in Acemoglu and Restrepo (2016), we assume that tasks i ≤ θ are automated
and can be produced using capital or labor, with the production function

                                                                                            y(i) = q(i)η (k(i) + l(i))1−η .                                (2)

Tasks i > θ can only be produced using labor, and their production function takes the form

                                                                                                   y(i) = q(i)η l(i)1−η ,                                  (3)

where η ∈ (0, 1). Intermediates, the q(i)’s, can be produced at the marginal cost of one unit of
the final good, and are supplied by a monopolist which charges a constant markup of χ ∈ (0, 1).

                                                                                                                6
The monopolist also chooses θ ∈ [0, 1] at cost C(θ)Y , which is interpreted as a (domestic) tech-
nology choice to adapt robotics or other automation techniques to the conditions of the country in
question. We assume that C is twice differentiable, strictly increasing (reflecting the fact that au-
tomating more tasks is costly for the monopolist), strictly convex (with a positive second derivative
everywhere), and satisfies the Inada condition limθ→1 C ′ (θ) = ∞.
   We assume that capital and labor are inelastically supplied, with supplies given, respectively,
as K and L, and
                                                   K > L.                                          (4)

This implies that capital is abundant and cheap relative to labor, which is plausible given the very
low interest rates around the world at the moment. This assumption ensures that automating tasks
will be profitable and increase aggregate output. In mapping the model to data, we think of L
as the supply of younger and middle-aged workers, so that population aging will correspond to a
reduction in L—a phenomenon to which we also refer to as an increase in labor scarcity.
   Following the same steps as in Acemoglu and Restrepo (2016), equilibrium aggregate output
can be expressed as Y = K θ L1−θ . Then the profit maximization problem of the monopolist is

                                          max K θ L1−θ Γ(θ),
                                         θ∈[0,1]

where Γ(θ) = ηχ − C(θ) is strictly decreasing, has a negative second derivative everywhere, and
satisfies limθ→1 Γ′ (θ) = 0. The presence of the term ηχ reflects the profits of the monopolist from
the markup on the intermediates.
   The profit maximization of the monopolist, combined with the Inada condition on C, implies

                                       ln K − ln L + Γ′ (θ) = 0.

   Differentiating this relationship yields

                                           dθ      1
                                                = ′′   < 0,
                                         d ln L  Γ (θ)

since Γ has a negative second derivative. This establishes that labor scarcity—i.e., a lower L—
encourages further automation as in Acemoglu (2010) and Acemoglu and Restrepo (2016).
   What is the effect of labor scarcity on aggregate output? To answer this question, let us totally
differentiate the expression for ln Y , taking into account the indirect effect of ln L working through




                                                     7
additional automation:

                                   d ln Y          ∂ ln Y dθ
                                            = 1−θ+                                                  (5)
                                   d ln L             ∂θ d ln L
                                                   ln K − ln L
                                            = 1−θ+
                                                       Γ′′ (θ)
                                                    θ
                                            = 1−θ− ,
                                                   εΓ

where εΓ = Γ′′ (θ)θ/Γ′ (θ) > 0 is the elasticity of the derivative of the Γ function.
   In view of condition (4), the second term is negative. Thus a lower L creates a direct effect
which is to decrease GDP because of the reduction in the labor input, but also a positive effect
through additional automation. If the second term, which is negative, is sufficiently large, then the
scarcity of labor caused by an aging population can increase GDP. This will be the case if the gap
between K and L is sufficiently large (from the second line of (5)), making capital much cheaper
than labor, or if the elasticity εΓ is small (from the third line). Hence, the aging of the labor force,
which reduces the available supply of workers to perform productive tasks in the economy, need
not reduce GDP per capita, and may in fact increase it, once we take the response of technology
into account.


IV. Conclusion

This paper establishes that, contrary to a range of theories including recent ones on demographics-
based secular stagnation, there is no negative relationship between between population aging and
slower growth of GDP per capita. This is a major puzzle for several theories that have become
very popular over the last several years.
   One possible explanation for this pattern is the endogenous response of technology—in partic-
ular, the adoption of technologies performing tasks previously undertaken by labor. We document
that countries undergoing more rapid population aging have adopted more robots, although we do
recognize that this evidence is neither causal nor does it establish that the adoption of robots is the
mechanism that neutralizes the potential negative effects of population aging on economic growth.
We also demonstrate that models of directed technological change can account for the lack of such
a negative relationship, and could generate a positive relationship, between population aging and
economic growth.
   There is a clear need for future work that systematically investigates the relationship between
demographic change and GDP growth as well as the channels via which this relationship works.
