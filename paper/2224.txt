                 Tax   Deductibility   and Municipal Budget Structure


                                         ABSTRACT


    This    paper investigates the effects of deductibility of local taxes on

communities' budgetary decisions. Our focus is on how changes in the tax

price of local spending induced by deductibility affect the mix between de-

ductible and nondeductible revenue sources, and on expenditures. The

econometric analysis is based on a rich data set that tracks the fiscal be-

havior of 172 local governments from 1978 to 1980. We find that the elastic-

ity of deductibile taxes with respect to the tax price is in the range —1.2

to —1.6; the tax price has no statistically significant effect on the use of

nondeductible revenue sources; and the elasticity of local expenditures with

respect to the tax price is about —1.8. Hence, if deductibility were elimi-

nated, we would expect to see a substantial decline in local government

spending.

I. Introduction
    Historically, federal tax law has allowed itemizers to deduct state and
local property, income, and general sales taxes on their personal income tax
returns. This provision is estimated to have decreased federal tax revenues
by about $30.8 billion in 1985. (Executive Office of the President [1986, p.
G—42]). The last several years have witnessed a serious public debate about
the merits of partially or totally eliminating state and local tax deductibility.
The U.S. Treasury recommended complete abolition of deductibility in 1984, as
did President Reagan in 1985.1 The Tax Reform Act of 1986 disallowed state
sales tax deductions, but continued those for income and property taxes.
More changes in the tax code are likely in the next few years, and state and
local tax deductibility is likely to remain a controversial issue.
     Those who favor deductibility argue that its elimination would have a
disastrous impact on state and local public finance.2 In this view, if people
cannot deduct state and local taxes on their federal tax returns, then state
and local government goods and services in effect become more expensive,
and the demand for them declines. State and local public officials appear to
believe this scenario. When the United States Conference of Mayors convened
in 1985, the New York Times reported that the meeting"... ended with an
unusual display of bipartisan unanimity: only one 'no' vote was audible on
a resolution urging Congress to amend the [President's] tax plan to keep
deductibility of state and local taxes..."3
     This very simple story about the impact of deductibility ignores the fact
that sub—federal governments have access to non—deductible sources of
revenue, such as user charges, license fees, special assessments, etc. It
could be that eliminating deductibility would lead only to the substitution of
nondeductible for deductible revenue sources, and have no impact on


                                         1
spending. However, econometric studies by Inman [1985], Hettich and Winer
[1984], and Noto and Zimmerman [1984] find that a jurisdiction's choice of
revenue instruments is not responsive to its "tax price": the effective cost of
a dollar of expenditure taking into account federal deductibility. Recently,
Feldstein and Metcalf (F&M) [1986] challenged this result, arguing that these
studies employed inappropriate data, incorrect tax price measures, and/or
inconsistent econometric techniques. F&M's examination of 1980 data
suggested that if deductibility were removed: (i) state and local use of
deductible taxes would decline; (ii) use of other revenue sources would
increase; and (iii) net expenditures from local funds would stay about the
same. Moreover, because some of the revenue sources that are nondeductible
to individuals are deductible to businesses, eliminating deductibility on
personal tax returns would not increase federal revenues as much as one
would expect if one ignored revenue instrument substitution effects. Indeed,
federal tax collections might even decrease. Unfortunately, the regression
coefficients which form the basis for all these conclusions are estimated
imprecisely in the sense that the coefficients are small relative to their
standard errors.
     At the moment, then, economists' understanding of the empirical impact
of deductibility seems to be a bit murky. In this paper we present new
evidence based on a rich set of data which tracks the fiscal behavior of 172
local governments from 1978 to 1980. Our goal is to find the effects of
deductibility on the mix between deductible and non—deductible revenue
sources, and on expenditures. The use of panel data allows us to control for
the existence of "individual effects" in our equations for the various fiscal
spending decisions, and hence to obtain more convincing estimates of the
effects of deductibility. Our main findings are that: (i) the elasticity of


                                        2
deductible taxes with respect to their tax price is in the range —1.2 to —1.6;
(ii) the tax price has no statistically significant effect on the use of
non—deductible revenue sources; and (iii) the elasticity of local expenditures
with respect to the tax price is about -1.8.
     The estimating models are specified in Section II. Section III describes
the data. Section IV discusses the econometric issues, and presents the
results. Section V concludes with a summary.

II, The Model
     A. Preliminaries
     Analysis of the effects of deductibility on community decision—making is
complicated by the fact that it leads to different voters having different
effective prices of local public spending. For a non-itemizer, the effective
price of a dollar of local spending is just a dollar. For an itemizer, the
effective price is one minus the marginal tax rate, and among itemizers,
marginal tax rates differ across people. Which tax price is relevant for
unrstanding community decisions?
   One possible approach is to appeal to the median voter model, and argue
that the median of the community's tax prices is the relevant figure.
However, the person with the median tax price is not necessarily the person
with the median demand for public goods. More fundamentally, the median
voter model has a number of well—known deficiencies——it ignores such
potentially important effects on fiscal decisions as logrolling, coalition
formation, and bureaucratic power. (See Inman [forthcoming].)
    In the absence of a generally accepted model of community decision
making to serve as a framework for our analysis, some sensible and
convenient ad hoc formulation is required. We follow Feldstein and Metcalf
and assume that the community's decision depends upon its average tax

                                         3
price. That is, if the average marginal federal tax rate for itemizers is T
and the proportion of itemizers is m , then we assume that the price that is
relevant for community decision making is (l-m)l + m(l—r) .4
       B. Estimating Equations
       1.   The Basic Model

       Our goal is to estimate the impact of the tax price on a

community's deductible taxes per capita (TD) , non—deductible own

sources of revenue per capita (TN) , and expenditures per capita, (E).

Earlier empirical work suggests that each of these varibles will depend

upon the community's tax price (P) ,         family   income (Y)

and other economic and demographic variables that might affect

the community's budget constraint and/or preferences (a k—dimensional

vector X ).         Employing the convenient constant elasticity specifica-
tion, the estimating equation for (say) TD is



(2.1)        •nTDjt = a0    + a1        +    Sn       +               +   +
                                                                2+j
                                                          j=l
where i indexes communities, t indexes years, the a's are parameters,
it is a random error term, and f. is an "individual effect" for community

I —— a composite of those characteristics of the community that affect

its fiscal decisions and do not change over time. (Examples might be

"political make—up," climate, etc.)5 Importantly, it is quite likely that

 f.     is correlated with the right hand side variables, with the result

that OLS leads to inconsistent estimates of the parameters. The equations for

tnT .       and    mE,it   take the same form.
      Nit
       In   order to estimate equation (2.1), take first differences in order to
eliminate f.:
               1




                                             4
                                                       — Sn
(2.2)       In TDjt         Tp..       = cx1(tfl

                      +
                          a2(In
                                       -   In          +
                                                           jl    2+j(Xjit_Xjit_l)

                      +

Again, the equations for (In TNjt_In TNitl) and (Sn E.t—Sn E.ti) take the
same form.

    The first problem one faces in implementing this framework is construc—

tion of the average tax price. It would clearly be desirable to compute

P separately for each community on the basis of its taxable income. However,

data limitations make it difficult to do this in a convincing way.6

Instead, we form P using data for the state in which the community is

located. Specifically, denote by P the statewide average

tax price of the state in which community i is located. Suppose that the

discrepancy between 't and                      depends on the differences between the

community's values of certain variables and their state—wide counterparts.

For example, if a community's income exceeds state income, we expect that

its tax price will be lower, cet. par. Similarly, a community with

a homeownership rate higher than the state average will have a lower

tax price, cet. par. Suppose that we denote all variables that affect

the tax price in this way by an n—dimensional vector z .                    Then we

can write


(2.3)       In    =    In         +   E ,' (z..tzs.t)           + g.


where the superscript a indicates a statewide value, and

is an individual effect.




                                                   5
        Recall now that our basic estimating equation is in first—

differences. Therefore, when (z.. —z. )              does not change much over
                               jit jit
time, its effect on the tax price can be ignored. This is likely

to be true of most candidates for inclusion in the z vector.

For example, one does not expect the difference between a community's

proportion of homeowners and the state wide average to change much

from year to year. We assume that income is the only variable

in the z—vector for which the difference between state and community values

might change substantially over time. Under this condition, taking first

differences of equation (2.3) yields



(2.4)         Sn P1Sn it—l = (Sn PSn T't1) +


                       [(tn Yitmn Y) — (Sn                 t_i)]
where           is per capita income in comnnnunity i's state during year t

Provided that the tax price goes down as income goes up, we expect

      < 0 .   Substituting   into equation (2.2) gives us


(2.5) Sn Tp.t—tn TDjt_l =       1(Sn              I—I) +      Xi7i)


                (Sn                 +
                                        j=l

               —                         +
                                              it'it—l

The same logic can be    applied to the estimating equations
for     (Sn TNit _T TNitl) and (Sn Et—Sn Eti)




                                              6
        In short, our use of the state tax price to "proxy" for the community
tax price requires that we include state income on the right side of each
equation. In doing so, notice that each of the three equations——
SnTD TN        ,   mE   ——
                             incorporates equation (2.4). As a result, the system
of   equations is subject to a nonlinear constraint: the ratio of the coef-

ficient on (the change in) state income to the coefficient on (the change in)

the tax price is identical in all three equations. In the empirical

work below, we test this constraint as a check on our specification of

the estimating equations.

     Another issue related to             is its possible endogeneity. Imagine

that community i has an "unexpectedly high" preference for using deductible

sources of revenue, i.e., a positive it .          This positive it will be
associated with a relatively high propensity to itemize in community i

and, conditional on itemizing, with a relatively low federal marginal tax

rate. Both of these tendencies will affect the value of P.                 .   Hence,
                                                                     it
there   is probably some correlation between           and       .        When

estimating the parameters from a single cross section of data, this

may be quite a serious problem.          However, its severity is likely

to be attenuated in an individual effects model. This is because the

presence of f in (2.1) better "controls" for the unobserved preferences

determining the left hand side variables. Still, some correlation between

the price variable and the error term may remain, so we employ an instru-

mental variables estimation technique, as described below.

     We now turn to the variables in the X—vector. These include:

     SHARE    state government spending as a percentage of the state and local

     total for that state;

     GRANTS = sum of federal and state grants, per capita;



                                             7
      ASSETS =   per capita market value at the beginning of the fiscal year
      of holdings of federal securities, mortgages, bonds, cash, sinking funds,

      bond funds, etc.;

      DEBTS = market value of outstanding long and short term debt per

      capita;

      POP =   population.
      The inclusion of most of these variables is routine, but a few require

some   comment. The presence of the SHARE variable is in response to the
fact that states differ in the division of taxing and expenditure decisions
between states and communities. SHARE is a simple way, suggested by Oates
[1975], of controlling for such institutional differences. The ASSETS and
DEBTS variables are present to allow for intertemporal aspects of community
decision making. Communities can finance current expenditures by drawing
down their asset8 or by borrowing, even though these activities are
sometimes subject to institutional constraints.
2. Alternative Specifications.
     We also consider a number of departures from the basic model. The        purposes

of   analyzing these variants are to assess the robustness of our results, and
to facilitate comparisons with earlier work.

     First, we estimated a group of regressions leaving out the ASSETS,

GRANTS, and DEBTS variables from the right hand side. Feldstein and

Metcalf excluded these variables from their models. Doing likewise

can help us determine whether discrepancies between our substantive

results and theirs depend on this difference in specification.

     A second    set of variations is   suggested by the   fact that most of the

earlier   work on the impact of deductibility on local public finance has used
single cross sections rather than panel data. Our individual effects model

                                            8
analyzes the changes in budget structure in response to changes in the tax
price. This corresponds more closely to the proposed policy intervention
than cross—community variation. Nevertheless, it is interesting to compare
the results when the same data are used to estimate both an individual
effects model and a series of cross—sectional models. Of course, in
cross—sectional models one must include slow changing factors that are
differenced out of the individual effects specification. Accordingly, we
augment the X vector with a number of such variables:
     PUPILS   =    individuals aged 3 and older enrolled in school per capita;
     POOR =   individuals   below the poverty line per capita;

     OLD =    individuals   aged 65 and   above   per capita;

     OWN proportion of occupied housing units that are owner occupied;

     NONWHITE =     proportion   of population that is not white;

     PCT81O, PCT1O15, PCT1525, PCT25 =       proportion    of families with incomes

     in the ranges $8,000 — $9,999, $10,000 — $14,999, $15,000 — $24,999,

     and   above    $25,000, respectively.

C.   Localities vs.    States as Observations

     In   all the models we estimate, the observations are individual localities.
In contrast, Feldatein and Metcalf employ state and local totals by state.7
Thus, while one of our observations is Bridgeport, Connecticut, F&M would
use the sum of all communities in Connecticut plus the state government
itself. F&M argue emphatically that analyzing community budgets is not a
good way to learn about the effects of deductibility. They note that the
division of taxing and spending responsibilities between state and local
governments varies enormously among the states. Moreover, some
communities are under institutional constraints with respect to the kind of



                                              9
tax instruments they can employ. Finally, they observe that it is virtually
impossible to get good tax price data on a community level.
        It   seems to us that F&M   overstate   their   case. To be sure, some
communities      may be legally constrained in their choice of tax instruments,

but within these constraints, there may be scope for choice between

deductible and non—deductible revenue sources. In any case, to the extent

that these constraints can be viewed as individual effects, our econometric

procedure "controls" for them. Similarly, we can control at least crudely

for across state differences in the state—local division of responsibilities

by   including our SHARE variable, the share of state expenditures in the state
and local total.
        As noted above, we agree with F&M that the inability to compute a tax
price   for each community is a     major problem. However, F&M's procedure does
not really solve this problem; in effect they circumvent it by assuming that
the state and all localities make their decisions on the basis of the statewide
average tax price. This does not seem too much different from our
procedure      of approximating the community tax price as the state tax         price
plus a correction factor.
        Lest this all sounds   too defensive, we should emphasize that there are

several      real advantages to using local data. First, communities and states do
not act in concert to set state and local totals; rather, the totals      are    the
aggregate      of each jurisdiction's decisions. What one gets by lumping all

communities      together and then combining them with the state government is
unclear.      In short, the underlying model purports to describe the behavior of

decision—making units; these units are the jurisdictions themselves. A second

advantage      of using local data is that there are a lot of communities, and they
differ substantially in their fiscal practices. As an econometric matter,


                                            10
greater sample size and variation are aids to obtaining precise parameter
estimates.
     We conclude that neither type of data is obviously superior. They both
have advantages and disadvantages. We view analyses of the two types of
data as complementary——each can shed light on the problem.
     III. Data8
     Our budgetary data are drawn from the Census of Governments for 1977
and the Annual Survey of Governments for 1976 and 1978-1980. A random

sample   of municipal governments was selected from the data tape for 1979
(the year with the least coverage), and these same governments were selected
for the remaining years when possible.9 There was usable information on 172
municipal governments.
     In each year, the record .for each government provides information on
the revenues, expenditures, assets, debts, and grant receipts for each
government. Par values of all outstanding debt and holdings of financial
assets are converted to market values using the indices provided by Eisner
and Pieper [1984]. Finally, budgetary variables are converted to real dollars
using a region-specific CPI and then deflated to per capita terms.
    We divide real per capita revenues into deductible taxes and
non—deductible revenues. The former is composed of (with means in
parentheses) property taxes ($281.76), general sales taxes ($12.62), and income
taxes ($3.69). Clearly the property tax is dominant. Indeed, of the 172
governments in the sample, only 39 used a general sales tax, 37 used a
selective sales tax, and only 3 had an income tax.'° Unfortunately, the
Census data do not allow us to distinguish between property taxes from
residential and nonresidential sources; the implications of this problem are
discussed in Section IV below.


                                       11
      Non—deductible revenues are simply the difference between total revenues
from own sources and deductible taxes. These revenues display considerable
diversity in the sample, but all communities rely heavily on taxes and
charges for water supply, utilities, and sewerage and sanitation. The mean
per capita value of non-deductible revenue sources was $187.28.
      As noted above, each community's tax price is assumed to be a function
of the tax price of its state. The latter is calculated in the following
fashion. For each state in every year under consideration, the average
taxable income per itemized return is computed from the IRS's Statistics of
Income and the corresponding marginal federal income tax rate (r)
determined.    In   addition, the proportion (m) of itemized returns

for   each state is calculated. The state's tax price,   pS   ,   is   then

PS     (1—m)+m(l—r).1'
      Population characteristics such as the proportion of homeowners,
proportion below the poverty line, etc., are taken from the County and City
Data Book for 1983, which contains data for 1980. Because these variables
change relatively slowly, we use the 1980 values in the cross sectional
regressions for 1978 and 1979 as well. In some cases, data for a municipality
were not available from the County and City Data Book. In these cases, data
for the county in which the municipality is located are used.
      The final data issue is the measurement of income. Yearly observations,
needed to complete the panel data set, are not available from Census
sources. Instead, we use median family "effective buying income" taken from
Sales Management magazine as published in the Annual Survey of Buying
Power. In effect, this variable is the predicted value of an hedonic
disposable income equation based on the characteristics of the area. Data on
the income distribution within each community are taken from the same


                                         12
source. Because "effective buying income" is a disposable income concept, it
does not conform exactly to the Census measure of income used by F&M.
Nonetheless, it is quite similar. For 1980 (when both are available), the
simple correlation between this measure and Census median family income is
0.828; the correlation with Census per capita income is 0.772.
    Table 3.1 lists the means of each variable for 1980. The figures indicate
that our communities relied more on deductible than nondeductible forms of
revenue; the difference between the means of In TD and Sn TN was 0.507.
The other   general feature worth noting is the large amount   of   across community

variation. The standard deviations of the means of the logarithms imply

large variations in the levels.

     Table 3.2 shows the means of the first differences of the variables

during 1978—1980. During this period, in real terms collections of deductible

taxes per capita fell by about 4.7 percent annually, while non—deductible

revenue sources increased by about 1.7 percent a year. Real expenditures

per capita fell about 1.8 percent annually. Note, however, the relatively

large standard deviations. As in the case of the levels figures

reported in Table 3.1, there is substantial variability across jurisdictions,

so one must be cautious in thinking about the mean values as being "typical."


    IV.   Estimating   the Model

   A. Econometric Issues

    There are several general issues in estimation. First is the potential

endogeneity of the tax price. As noted above, there are good reasons to

believe that in a cross sectional regression the tax price will be correlated

with the error term. Similarly, it has been long recognized that grant

receipts are endogenously determined. In the individual effects model, the

correlation between the tax price term and the error is likely to be less

pronounced because one controls for the potential presence of unobserved taste

differences. Still, such a correlation remains a possibility, and we

therefore use lagged values of the changes in the tax price and grants as

instrumental variables. Note that although we start out with five years of

data, one is used up due to differencing, and another because lagged

variables are used as instrumental variables. Hence, our estimates are

based on three years, or equivalently, two first differences.

    A second econometric issue is that the error terms may be heteroskedastic.

To check this, in each case we compute White's [1980] heteroskedasticity

test. In no case is there even weak evidence of heteroskedasticity.

As pointed out in White [1982], this test is biased toward rejection

of homoskedasticity in the instrumental variables context, so the

failure to reject is even more striking.

    A final issue is a measurement problem associated with the dependent

variable in the deductible taxes equation. Only residential property taxes

are deductible on personal tax returns, and, hence, belong in TD. As noted

above, the Census data used do not permit us to identify residential versus

nonresidential property taxes. To gauge the impact of this, notice that the

log of residential property taxes (TR) is related to the log of total property

taxes (Tn) by the identity: lnTt =                where         is the ratio of

residential to total property taxes.'2 Viewed in this way, and ignoring

income and sales taxes,12 the error term in our equation for TDit contains

the component 1''it

     If     is time invariant, no problem arises. However, it may fall as

the tax price rises. This will induce a positive correlation between the tax

price and the error term. Other things equal, this will bias upward (toward



                                      16
zero) the estimated coefficient on the tax price.'3 Moreover, the standard

errors of our coefficients will be larger than they would have been in the

absence of this measurement problem. In short, our coefficient will under-

state the "importance" of the tax price, both quantitatively and from the

point of view of statistical significance. In the same way, the coefficient

on the tax price in the equation for nondeductible revenues will be biased

downward toward zero.

    B. Results

    The estimates of the basic model, equation (2.5), are in Table 4.1. From

the coefficient of (In P—In P1) in column (1), the elasticity of

deductible taxes with respect to the tax price is about —1.55. This

elasticity is quite precisely estimated; the coefficient exceeds its

standard error by a factor of about 3.1. In this context it is important

to emphasize that the first differences specification provides a very

stringent test of the importance of deductibility because it focuses on

the effect of changes in the tax price on changes in deductible taxes.

The fact that the coefficient from the first differences specification

is significant at conventional levels seems strong evidence that an

effect really is present.

     From the second column in Table 4.1, the elasticity of nondeductible

revenues   with respect to the tax price is —0.787, but it is imprecisely
estimated. This is similar to Feldstein and Metcalf's finding that one cannot
reject the hypothesis that the tax price has no effect on the use of
non—deductible revenue sources.
     The coefficient on the tax price variable in the third column of the table
suggests that the impact of deductibility on local expenditures is

substantial. The elasticity with respect to the tax price is -1.83, and the
coefficient exceeds its standard error by a factor of 2.7. This figure is
considerably larger than most estimates of individual price elasticities of
demand for public goods and services. However, as Feldstein and Metcalf
emphasize, it is quite possible that the aggregate response to a change in
the tax price will exceed the individual response. This follows directly from
the fact that any given percentage change in an itemizer's tax price
produces a much smaller percentage change in the community tax price. For
any observed variation in expenditure, the elasticity computed with respect
to the community tax price will exceed that computed with respect to the
itemizer's tax price.
     Most of the other coefficients in the table are imprecisely estimated.
One interesting finding is that increases in population are associated with
statistically significant decreases in per capita expenditures and per capita
collections of both deductible and non—deductible revenue source8, One
possible explanation is the existence of scale economies in the provision of
public goods and services. Another possibility is that this effect is due to
sluggish adjustment to population changes. That is, when population
increases, communities are slow to change their behavior, so per capita
magnitudes fall. To examine the second possibility, we estimated a simple
stock adjustment version of model (2.5). This amounts to including the
lagged dependent variable (DEPt....i) in each of the equations in Table 4.1.
These results, which are reported in Table 4.2, suggest that one cannot
reject the hypothesis that the coefficient on the lagged dependent variable is
zero. Thus, slow adjustment does not appear to be a major factor in our
data. Moreoever, in each equation inclusion of the lagged dependent variable

leaves the other variables basically unchanged. While we do not interpret
these results as "proof" that past decisions have no effect on current tax
and expenditure patterns, they do indicate that allowing for dynamics, at
least in a simple way, appears to have no impact on our results about the
effects of deductibility.14
        A8 noted   above, the use of equation (2.4) imposes a constraint across
equations of our model; namely, that the ratio of the coefficient on the state
income variable to the coefficient on the tax price variable should be
identical in each of the equations. This ratio is our estimate of 7].
Imposing   this constraint on the estimated coefficients does not alter any

of   the qualitative results of the model. A test of the null hypothesis that

the data satisfy the constraint yields a statistic of 0.158 which is

distributed as a chi square with 2 degrees of freedom. The null hypothesis

is not rejected at conventional levels of significance.'5 Further, the

estimated value of         is —.972 (with a standard error of .286).

Thus, as expected, the community tax     price   falls relative to the state tax

price   as community income rises relative to state income.'6

     In Our next set of experiments, we deleted ASSETS, DEBTS, and GRANTS

from   the set of right hand side variables. As mentioned earlier, although we
think that a good case can be made for including these variables, they were
omitted from Feldatein and Metcalf's specification. Hence, it is interesting to
see whether their omission induces any substantive changes. Note that
because grants are excluded from consideration, it makes sense for the
dependent variable in the "expenditures" equation to be expenditures from
own sources only. In terms of our notation, the appropriate variable is
Sn (TD+TN) rather than In     B

       The results are reported in Table 4.3. A comparison with Table 4.1


                                          21
indicates that all of the substantive results are basically unchanged. Thus,
while we prefer the specification in Table 4.1 on theoretical grounds, use of
the Feldstein—Metcalf set—up does not affect our conclusions. In particular,
we still find no evidence that a higher tax price leads to greater reliance on
non—deductible sources of revenue.
     Our last set of results consists of the basic specification estimated for
individual cross sections. As emphasized above, we think the individual
effects model is more suitable. It is therefore of some intere8t to see how the
results would have differed if we had used a cross section instead.
    The cross—sectional results for 1980 are reported in Table 4.4. From the
first column, we see that contrary to what one would expect, increases in the
tax price increase the reliance on deductible sources of revenue. However,
this coefficient is imprecisely estimated. Moreover, from the second column,
increases in the tax price decrease reliance on non—deductible revenue
sources by a huge amount (the elasticity is minus 15), and this coefficient is
more than twice its standard error.
    What accounts for these peculiar results? One possibility is that the
year 1980 was "atypical" for the communities in our sample. We therefore
estimated the cross—sectional equations for the years 1978 and 1979 as well.
The results are reported in the top portion of Table 4.5. (To conserve space,
we report only the coefficients on the tax price and income coefficients.) A
glance at the figures in the table suggests that the point estimates vary
considerably from year to year. Indeed, the elasticities of TN and E with
respect to P5 flip signs from year to year.
     Thus, we cannot "blame" the implausible results of Table 4.3 on the
choice of year. An alternative possibility is that the cross sectional

equations are estimated with inappropriate instruments. The estimates
presented so far use lagged tax     price   as an instrument. If: (a) the primary
source of endogeneity in the cross section arises from the fact that
unobserved   tastes for spending induce correlation between         and the

error term, and (b) these unobserved taste differences persist over time;

then lagged price will do little to purge the correlation between          and the

the error term.

     Fortunately,   for the year 1980 we have available an alternative set of
instrumental variables suggested by Feldstein and Metcalf. These are:         i)
the proportion of taxpayers in the state who would be expected to itemize if
each taxpayer's probability of itemizing were equal to the national average
for his or her adjusted gross income class; ii) the marginal tax rate on the
first dollar of state and local tax deductions; and iii) the average tax rate on
state and local tax deductions. These variables are expected to be correlated
with the state tax price, but uncorrelated with the error term in the
regression. (See Feldstein and Metcalf [19861 for further details.) The
estimates that are obtained with this alternative set of instrumental variables
are reported at the bottom of Table 4.5. A comparison of those elasticities
with those reported in Table 4.4 indicates that the "wrong" signs are still
present. We conclude that the use of single cross sections to estimate the
fiscal response of communities to changes in their economic environments can
produce quite misleading results.
    Nevertheless, we think that cross—sectional data may help shed some light
on a measurement problem that was discussed above. Namely, our property
tax data include payments from both residential and nonresidential sources,
which in theory can bias toward zero the tax price coefficients in the TDjt

and TNjt equations. For a subset of our communities, we obtained 1980 data
on the proportion of the property tax base that was residential. (Such data
were not available for other years.) Assuming that residents paid property
taxes in proportion to their share in the tax base, we were able to estimate
residential and nonresidential property taxes paid. For this subsample, the
cross—sectional equations for TNjt and TDjt were then estimated both with and
without nonresidential property taxes included in the respective left hand
side variables. The results with and without the adjustment were essentially
the same for both the TDjt and TNjt equations. This suggests that in our
sample, the share of nonresidential property taxes is sufficiently small that
only an inconsequential bias is induced by lumping residential and
nonresidential property taxes together. Of course, we recognize the tenuous
nature of this exercise. rt is no substitute for an analysis of longitudinal
data with information on the mix of property tax receipts.
V. Conclusion
     We have examined fiscal data on 172 communities over the period 1978 to
1980 in order to estimate the effects of deductibility on local taxing and
spending behavior. From a methodological point of view, our first main
result is that local data provide a fruitful source of information on the
impact of deductibility on fiscal decisions. Difficulties in defining tax prices
and accounting for differences in institutional structures across states do not
seem to prevent us from obtaining sensible and useful results. The second
methodological result is that parameters estimated from a single cross section
of fiscal data must be interpreted with care. Such parameters may depend
upon the particular year chosen, and may be inconsistent due to the failure
to account for individual effects.



                                        28
     Our main substantive findings are:
      1) Deductibility does affect the choice of revenue sources. The
elasticity of deductible taxes with respect to the tax price is in the range
-1.2 to —1.6. In our sample, the mean value of the logarithm of the tax price
in 1980 was —0.110. Thus, if deductibility were removed, i.e., if tn P
became zero, then collections of deductible taxes would fall by more than 13
percent.
     2) However, we have not been able to find any evidence that removing
deductibility would increase reliance on nondeductible sources of finance.
Indeed, the point estimates of these elasticities are negative, although they
are imprecisely estimated. Thus, there is no reason to think that tax
substitutions at the local level would mitigate against increased federal tax
revenues if deductibility were removed.
     3) Local spending is quite responsive to changes in the tax price, with
an elasticity of about -1.8. Thus, removing deductibility could have major
effects on local spending.

2There are also claims that removing deductibility would lead to an unfair
increase in the tax burden on middle class taxpayers. The distributional
implications of deductibility, both across states and across income classes,
are discussed in Feenberg and Rosen [1986] and Kenyon [1986].

3"What Happens if Washington Changes the Rules?" New York Times, June 23,
1985, p. E5.

4As Fisher [1986] has noted, another factor that might affect the tax price is
the fact that some state income taxes allow credits and deductions for local
property tax payments. To examine this possibility, we computed the state
income tax liability of a household that had the average taxable income on
all itemized returns in its state. In every case, if this household paid the
average property tax in its community, then the credit or deduction had no
marginal effect on the tax price of local spending. This is because the
credits and deductions are capped at a sufficiently low level that the house-
hold with the average property tax is not affected on the margin.

5Note that specification (2.1) ignores differences in the (quality adjusted)
resource cost of public sector inputs across communities. Implicitly, this
assumes a national market for such inputs. Alternatively, input costs may
vary across communities, but if they do not change over time, they are in-
cluded in the individual effect. Holtz—Eakin [1985] tests for the presence of
individual effects in these data and finds that they are present. In addi-
tion, this specification does not allow for year effects. In some preliminary
experiments, we included year effects, and found that they did not change any
of the substantive results.

6Ipjan [1985] provides an interesting attempt along these lines.

7Hettich and Winer [1984] employ state data without including figures from
localities in the totals.

   more complete description of the data set from which this sample is drawn
is contained in Holtz—Eakin, Newey and Rosen [1985].

9To remain in the sample, communities had to report positive school
expenditures.

10lndeed, the econometric results below are unchanged when income and sales
taxes are excluded in the computation of deductible taxes.

11This procedure differs substantially from that used by F&M, who took
advantage of data from individual tax returns. Nevertheless, the two methods
yieldquite similar results. In 1980, F&M calculate the mean tax price as 0.92
with a standard deviation of 0.02; the range is from 0.87 to 0.96. In
comparison, our statewide tax prices for 1980 have an average value of 0.90,
a standard deviation of 0.03, a minimum of 0.86, and a maximum of 0.94.
'2Allowing    for income and sales taxes would introduce some   nonlinearity
into    the problem, but not change the qualitative results.

130f course, a general analysis of the bias requires consideration of the
complete set of covariances among the right side variables and the vector  of
covariances between each of these variables and it• We think that in this
particular case, these other covariances are unlikely to change our conclusion.
14Holtz—Ein, Newey and     Rosen [1985]   discuss dyamic aspects of local govern-
ment taxing and spending   behavior.

1-5The test is computed by estimating the three equations as a system using
three—stage least squares both with and without imposing the constraint. The
covarjance matrix from the unconstrained estimation is used in both cases.
The test statistic is the difference between the constrained and unconstrained
weighted sum of squared errors for the system.

effect of community income on the left hand side variable. In the expendi-
tures equation, this turns out to be negative, a result counter to a number
of previous studies. However, the estimate is statistically insignificant.
We conjecture that mismeasureinent of the income variable may be the cause of
this result.
