                                            ABSTRACT

Analyses of the effects of election outcomes on the economy have been hampered by the problem
that economic outcomes also influence elections. We sidestep these problems by analyzing movements
in economic indicators caused by clearly exogenous changes in expectations about the likely winner
during Election Day. Analyzing high frequency financial fluctuations following the release of flawed
exit poll data on Election Day 2004, and then during the vote count, we find that markets anticipated
higher equity prices, interest rates and oil prices and a stronger dollar under a Bush presidency than
under Kerry. A similar Republican-Democrat differential was also observed for the 2000 Bush-Gore
contest. Prediction market based analyses of all Presidential elections since 1880 also reveal a similar
pattern of partisan impacts, suggesting that electing a Republican President raises equity valuations
by 2 3 percent, and that since Reagan, Republican Presidents have tended to raise bond yields.

                                                 I. Introduction

       Do election outcomes affect the macroeconomy? Theoretical predictions differ, as canonical

rational-choice political science models predict policy convergence,1 while more recent models of

citizen-candidates [Besley and Coate 1997], party factions [Roemer, 1999], and strategic extremism

[Glaeser et. al. 2006] predict divergence. Empirical evidence is mixed, reflecting the difficulty of

establishing robust stylized facts about actual economic outcomes from a small number of

Presidential election cycles.2

        We sidestep this limitation by exploiting two recent financial market developments: the

electronic trading of equity index and other futures while votes are being counted on Election

Night;3 and the emergence of a liquid prediction market tracking the election outcome. Our analysis

also benefits from natural experiments created by flawed, but widely believed, exit poll data. In

2004, exit polls released around 3pm Eastern time predicted a Bush defeat, and the price of a

security paying $10 if he was reelected fell from $5.5 to $3. As votes were counted that evening,

the same security rallied and reached $9.5 by midnight. High-frequency data shows the value of

financial assets closely tracking these changes in expectations, allowing us to make precise and

unbiased inferences of the effect of Bush’s reelection on many economic variables. Similar events

occurred in 2000, although without a prediction market precisely tracking changes in beliefs.

        We proceed by analyzing the 2004 election, comparing the results from our high-frequency

analysis with a more traditional pre-election analysis of daily data. We find that Bush’s reelection

led to modest increases in equity prices, nominal and real interest rates, oil prices, and the dollar,

and that the biases in a more traditional research design would be substantial. We then conduct a

[Lindbeck and Weibull, 1987] and lobbying [Baron, 1994].

  Alesina, Roubini and Cohen [1997] document faster economic growth under Democratic administrations (particularly
in the first half of an administration), although Democrats have governed during periods of lower inflation, casting
doubt on the interpretation that these differences reflect differences in aggregate demand management.

similar analysis of the 2000 election, finding partisan effects consistent with our analysis of the

2004 election. Finally, we turn to a longer sample, analyzing event returns surrounding elections

back to 1880. We find a remarkably consistent pattern of election outcomes affecting financial

markets. Although our finding that elections affect financial markets suggests that they also affect

economic policies and welfare, we caution that we can only speak to the effects of the elections we

analyze. Further, the effect of a candidate on a variable such as equity prices may differ from their

effect on economic welfare.

        Past work examining the correlation of financial markets and expectations about political

outcomes has used lower-frequency, pre-election data. For instance, Herron [2000] found that in the

days leading up to the 1992 British election changes in the odds of a Labour victory were correlated

with changes in British stock indices, leading him to infer that the election of Labour would have

caused stock prices to decline by 5%-11%. However, this correlation may instead reflect changing

expectations about the economy driving changing expectations about the re-election of the

incumbent. Knight [2006] sought to identify a causal effect by examining whether the difference in

returns between “Pro-Bush” and “Pro-Gore” stock portfolios were correlated with the probability of

Bush winning the 2000 election. This approach is less likely to be affected by reverse-causality,

since an improvement in the economic outlook for a particular group of companies (e.g., defense) is

unlikely to increase the re-election chances of an incumbent. Even so, the identification of partisan

effects in this setting relies on the absence of unobserved factors affecting both the pricing of these

portfolios and re-election prospects, and this might be questionable.4 Moreover, by design, this

empirical strategy cannot speak to the effects of alternative candidates on aggregates.



4
  For instance, suppose that an election features a pro- and anti- war candidate, and the pro-war candidate is a more
capable war President. If shares in defense contractors increase in value when the pro-war candidate’s electoral
prospects improve, one might be tempted to conclude that the defense contractor’s stocks are worth more because there
is a higher chance of the pro-war candidate will be elected. However a third factor—such as threatening actions from a
another nation—may have led both numbers to appreciate: the defense contractor’s from their increased sales in an
increasingly likely war, and the pro-war candidate’s from his country’s increased need of his leadership in wartime.

                                                                                                                     2
                                                  II. The 2004 Election

         During the 2004 election cycle, TradeSports.com created a contract that would pay $10 if

Bush were elected President, and zero otherwise. The price of this security yields a market-based

estimate of the probability that Bush will win the election.5 We collected these Tradesports data on

the last trade and bid-ask spread every 10 minutes during Election Day until the winner was

determined in the early hours of the following morning. We pair these data with the price of the last

transaction in the same 10 minute period for the December 2004 futures contract of various financial

variables: the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures, CME

currency futures, the Chicago Board Of Trade (CBOT) Dow Jones Industrial Average and 2 and 10

year Treasury Note futures, and a series of New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) Light Crude

Oil futures.6 The precision of our estimates is enhanced by the low volatility in overnight financial

markets,7 the dearth of non-election financial news on Election Night,8 and the substantial trading

volume generated on the Tradesports political prediction markets.9

         Figure 1 shows the prediction market assessment of the probability of Bush’s re-election and

the value of the S&P 500 future through our sample (noon EST on November 2nd through to 6am,

November 3rd, 2004). The prices track each other quite closely. The probability of Bush winning the

election starts near 55 percent. When the exit poll data was leaked, the markets quickly incorporated

5
  Wolfers and Zitzewitz [2006] show that for realistic parameters regarding the risk aversion of traders, prediction
market prices can be interpreted as a measure of the central tendency of beliefs about the probability of an event.
6
  We analyze futures rather than the actual indices because only the futures are actively traded in the period after regular
trading hours. The need to analyze data after the main U.S. markets closed also constrains the set of financial variables
we can analyze.
7
  For example, in the fourth quarter of 2004, the standard deviation of 30-minute changes in the CME S&P 500 futures
from 4pm to 3am the following morning was 7.8 basis points, compared with 28.3 basis points during regular trading
hours. While volatility was slightly higher on Election Night (the standard deviation of 30-minute changes was 10.2
basis points), the R-squared in our 30-minute-difference regressions of 0.33 suggests this increased volatility was
explained by news about the Presidential election.
8
  Counts of the number of earnings announcements recorded by I/B/E/S and news stories on the Dow Jones Newswire
that did not include the words “Bush” or “Kerry” revealed that these measures were 39 and 23 percent lower on Election
Day than their average on the two prior and two subsequent Tuesdays.
9
  On Election Day and the early hours of the following day, over $3.5 million was transacted in contracts predicting
either a Bush or Kerry victory, in 13,366 separate trades. The average bid-ask spread was 0.5% of the expiry value of a
binary option. In contrast, for the Iowa Electronic Market on the winner of the popular vote in 2000 (there was no
prediction market security on the Electoral College winner), election day volume totaled less than $20,000.

                                                                                                                          3
this information, sending Bush’s probability of election to 30 percent and stocks down nearly one

percent. When it became clear that the earlier exit poll data was faulty, Bush’s chances rose to

95 percent and stocks rebounded, rising 1½ percent. In both cases, it appears that the political news

was reflected in the stock market slightly before the prediction market, mirroring what we found

about Iraq War-related news in Wolfers and Zitzewitz [2005].

         Figure 1 strongly suggests that equities were more valuable under a Bush Presidency than if

Kerry had been elected. In order to get a precise estimate of just how much higher, we can regress

changes in the S&P 500 on changes in Bush’s chances of re-election. Specifically, we estimate:10

         ∆Log(Financial variablet) = α + β ∆Re-election probabilityt + εt

         Whereas all 10-minute intervals contain at least one prediction market trade, there are some

intervals with no fresh trade in at least one of the financial markets. In these cases we analyze

longer differences, weighting observations by the inverse of the number of periods the difference

spans so as to correct for heteroskedasticity arising from unequal period lengths.

         The timing of market movements in Figure 1 suggests that the timing of incorporation of

information into prices may be different in equity and prediction markets. To allow for this

possibility, we also estimate a version of the above model that uses 30-minute differences.

Alternative specifications, such as 60-minute differences and Scholes-Williams [1977] regressions,

yield coefficients of similar magnitude to the 30-minute differences.

         Table 1 shows the result of regressions analyzing changes in a number of different financial

prices. The coefficients can be interpreted as the percentage point difference in that indicator

resulting from a Bush presidency instead of a Kerry Presidency.11


10
   See Wolfers and Zitzewitz [2005] for a small model clarifying the assumptions under which this estimating equation
reveals the structural parameters of interest.
11
   Since our first natural experiment occurred while polls were still open, it is possible that there was a feedback
whereby news of the exit polls or market movements led to changes in voting behavior. If both prediction and financial
market traders were aware of this possibility—or if neither were aware—then our regression yields unbiased estimates.
On the other hand, if the prediction markets over (under-)shot the change in probability of Bush’s election relative to the
financial market, then our regression will yield under (over-)estimates. Two robustness checks suggest that this is not an

                                                                                                                         4
         The results for the S&P 500 suggest a precisely estimated effect, with the Bush presidency

yielding equity prices that are 1½ to 2 percent higher; other stock indices yield similar estimates.12,13

Of course, the equity market effects could reflect expectations of stronger output growth, or of

policy changes that are expected to favor returns to equity holders over debt holders, current over

future taxpayers, capital over labor, or current firms over potential entrants.

         Some further insight into expected effects on output and inflation can be gained by

examining real and nominal bond yields and the dollar. The regressions in Table 1 suggest that 10-

year bond yields would be 11-12 basis points higher and 2-year bond yields 10-11 basis points

higher under a Bush administration. Ideally one would like to separate the effect of changes in

expected inflation from changes in expected real interest rates. While there was no overnight

trading in inflation-protected Treasury bills, we do observe the value of a closely related asset—the

iShares Lehman TIPS exchange traded fund (“TIP”)—at 3 pm, 4 pm, and 9:30 am the next morning.

         Table 2 displays the percent change in prices between these inflation-indexed assets and

three comparison non-indexed assets: the 10 and 2-year CBOT Treasury futures, and the closest-

maturity non-TIP Treasury fund, the iShares Lehman 7-10 Year Treasury (“IEF”).14,15 The

12 percentage point decline in Bush’s reelection probability from 3 to 4 pm was accompanied by a

important issue. First, we examined exit poll data and found no evidence that differences between voting patterns in the
morning, early afternoon and evening varied across time zones, despite greater exposure to the “news” of a Kerry
victory in the west. This suggests that this news did not change voter behavior. Second, long-differences which are not
identified from the variation due to the faulty exit poll reporting (e.g. analyzing changes from 1pm on election day until
1am the next morning) yield results consistent with our main estimates.
12
   We also obtain similar results when we split the sample at 8pm EST (when the second natural experiment began) or
10pm EST (when polls closed in all swing states), finding no significant differences in the coefficients during the two
periods. This gives us confidence that our first experiment is not biased and that it is appropriate to combine the two
experiments. (Indeed, comparing the outcomes across these two experiments can be thought of as an overidentification
test).
13
   Our results are also robust to adding controls for the probability of Republican control of the House or Senate
changing (by including the prices of the relevant Tradesports contracts as additional regressors). This robustness is
likely due to these probabilities varying little on Election Day – the probability of a Republican House and Senate varied
between 90 and 95 and between 82 and 88 percent, respectively, before rising toward 100 late in the evening. Our
results are also robust to adding a control for the expected margin of victory, measured using Tradesports contracts on
electoral college vote totals.
14
   We use the last trade before 3pm, the last trade before 4pm, and the first trade after 9:30am, respectively. Results are
qualitatively similar if we take a quantity-weighted average of trades in the surrounding 10 minute period.
15
   The duration of the holdings of “TIP” and “IEF” is 5.9 and 6.6 years respectively, as calculated by Morningstar as of
December 2004.

                                                                                                                         5
one or two basis point reduction in both nominal and real bond yields, while the 55 percentage point

increase from 4 pm to 9:30 am the next morning was accompanied by a six to eight basis point

increase in both real and nominal yields. Wald [1940] estimators constructed using these two

windows yield results that are similar to our regressions in Table 1 for the bond futures, and suggest

that the partisan effect on nominal bond yields was almost entirely due to changes in real interest

rates, not expected inflation.

         Coupled with the strengthening of the dollar under Bush, this suggests that the move in

interest rates reflected expectations of expansionary fiscal policies, rather than an increased risk of

inflation or default. Our estimate that Bush’s reelection raised December 2004 and 2005 crude oil

prices by between $0.60 and $1.60 per barrel is also consistent with expectations of higher demand

for oil due to economic expansion.16

         Our Election-Night natural experiment yields different results from the pure time series

methods previously employed in the literature. Table 3 reports regressions explaining changes in

daily closing prices of various financial variables using changes in the 4pm price of the Bush

reelection contract, over a sample running from the start of prediction market trading in June 2003

to October 31, 2004. As above, we analyze longer differences to allow for slow incorporation of

information into the Bush reelection contract, which traded less liquidly during the 17 months

leading up to Election Night (total volume during these months was about $11.4 million, about half

of which was concentrated in September and October 2004). The observed relationship between

election and economic expectations through this period likely confounds the effects of politics on

the economy with the effects of economic conditions on the election.

         The estimated “effect” of Bush’s reelection on the stock market in this analysis is roughly a

factor of ten larger than in Table 1. This suggests the bias in a naïve time series analysis is large,

16
  Oil prices might also be expected to be higher under Bush due to reduced conservation or reduced supply, but these
explanations appear inconsistent with the term structure of the effect and with the candidates’ positions on encouraging
exploration.

                                                                                                                           6
and that much of the correlation between equity markets and Bush’s re-election probability in pre-

election data reflects reverse causation (e.g., higher stock prices help Bush) or third-factor causation

(e.g., a stronger economy helps both Bush and the stockmarket).

       For oil prices, these biases appear to cause a sign reversal. While Table 1 showed that

Bush’s re-election was expected to lead to higher oil prices, the results in Table 3 also reflect the

reverse channel, whereby lower oil prices helped Bush’s reelection chances. This reverse channel

appears to be the dominant source of variation in the pre-election data, producing the negative

correlation. The contrasting estimates in Tables 1 and 3 highlight the inadequacies of estimates of

partisan effects that simply reflect the correlation between economic and electoral conditions.

       Given that the results in Tables 1 and 2 reflect the effects of Bush on the economy, while

those in Table 3 reflect both the effects of Bush on the economy and the effects of the economy on

Bush, it seems reasonable to infer that we can combine these analyses to learn something about the

effect of the economy on Bush’s chances of re-election. We start by noting the following structural

equations:

       ∆Log(Financial variablet) = β ∆Re-election probabilityt + εt                                      (1)

       ∆Re-election probabilityt = γ ∆Log(Financial variablet) + ηt                                      (2)
                  2                2
       εt~D(0,        ); ηt~D(0,       ); E[ tηt]= ρ                                           (3); (4); (5)
                                                               2       2
       Note that this system involves five unknowns ( , ,          ,       and ρ ) while we observe only

three relevant moments (the variance of the financial variable and the re-election probability, and

their covariance). Separately, our analysis of Election-Day shocks gives us an estimate of ,

implying that only one further assumption (about the correlation between the two structural shocks,

ρ ) is required to recover estimates of the effect of the economy on Bush’s re-election prospects ( ).

       To show the relevant intuition, if we estimate equation (2) by OLS, we obtain:




                                                                                                           7

        γOLS = νγ + (1-ν)β          where ν = 2        t         t t       t   t
                                                                                                                    (6)

        We can gain some intuition about the magnitude of ν by noting that it can be roughly

interpreted as the share of financial market movements due to non-political factors. Specifically,

since we know from Table 1 that β is small, and hence if the correlation between the political and

economic shocks (ρ ) is also small then ν will be close to one, suggesting that the OLS estimate of

the effects of shocks to the economy on Bush’s re-election probability will suffer only a small bias.

        Running an OLS regression to estimate [2] using daily first differences (exactly as the first

row of Table 3, except with independent and dependent variables reversed) yields:

∆Re-election probabilityt =           0.233 ∆Log(S&P 500t) – 0.0004                      Adj. R2 = 0.017
                                    (.083)                 (.0007)                       n = 321


        While statistically significant, these estimated effects seem rather small relative to the larger

magnitudes found in the economic voting literature. Equally, OLS estimates of the effect of

elections on the economy get larger as the election approaches. Reliably statistically significant

results are only obtained in the two quarters leading up to the election, potentially providing some

support for the finding in Fair [1978] that economic factors are particularly relevant for electoral

outcomes when election day is nearer.17

        That said, it seems plausible that political and economic shocks may be strongly correlated.

If the correlation between the shocks is non-negative (for example when good news about foreign

affairs causes rallies in both the stockmarket and Bush’s re-election prospects), then the OLS

regression provides a useful upper bound, as the true causal effect of economic conditions, , will lie

below our reported      OLS.




17
   Ideally to determine the effect of the economy on electoral outcomes we would rely on an instrumental variables
strategy that isolated economic shocks that did not also change the political environment directly. We have considered
and discarded many such possible instruments, and leave this as an open question for future research.

                                                                                                                         8
                                        III. Bush versus Gore

       Our analysis of the 2004 election in Table 1 alone does not allow us to disentangle whether

the estimated effects are due to the election of a Republican (and hence reflect partisan effects), or

the re-election of a sitting president (reflecting the benefits of stability). As such, we would like to

be able to repeat this analysis for the 2000 election, in which there was no incumbent candidate

running, and the Democrats were the incumbent party. Figure 2 illustrates that there were sharp

movements in major financial indicators during the vote count, and these appear to coincide sharp

shocks to assessments of the probability of Bush or Gore winning.

          Unfortunately, we do not have an accurate estimate of the probability of victory of either

candidate since there were no contracts that tracked this. The Iowa Electronic markets only tracked

the anticipated popular vote share of each candidate, and the probability that each candidate would

win a plurality of the popular vote. Since the winner of the popular vote (Gore) did not win the

election, and it was quite clear early on Election Night that this was likely, the Iowa market price

cannot be used as an estimate of the probability that a given candidate would win the election.

Centrebet, an Australian bookmaker, did trade an appropriate contract, but closed their market on

the morning of the election. Their election-morning odds suggested that Bush had a 60% chance of

winning the election. We can use this number to bound the effect of Bush versus Gore on economic

indicators.

       If we assume that the prices of the various indicators at the beginning of our sample period

correspond to a 60% chance of Bush winning, then the decline observed between 6pm and 9pm

cannot represent more than a 60% decrease in the chance of a Bush victory. Likewise, the change

from 9pm to 2:15am cannot represent more than a 100% increase in the probability of a Bush win.

From this, Table 4 infers bounds on the relevant Wald Estimators of the effect of Bush versus Gore,

finding that a Bush presidency caused at least a 1½% increase in the S&P 500, a 3½% increase in

the Nasdaq 100 and a ½% appreciation of the dollar versus a trade weighted currency portfolio. The
                                                                                                           9
estimates from these two experiments in 2000 are consistent both with each other and with the

effects observed over the two analogous experiments in 2004, suggesting that our estimates are

isolating partisan effects rather than the costs of transferring from an incumbent regime to a new

one.



                                    IV. A Century of Elections

       Because the 2000 and 2004 elections are the only two close elections since overnight trading

began, we cannot replicate the above analysis for earlier elections. However, we can perform a

more traditional event study, comparing aggregate returns from the pre-election close to the post-

election close (the narrowest event window possible given that historically equity markets were

closed on Election Day). Naturally the identifying assumption in this case—that markets are

responding to election returns rather than other news—is more tenuous over this longer event

window. (This is an important reason that our estimates from this analysis will be less precise.)

       Santa-Clara and Valkanov [2003] have previously compared event returns accompanying

Democratic and Republican victories, finding no consistent pattern. However, as Shelton [2005]

has emphasized, it is important to distinguish elections which transmit essentially no news (such as

a market rally coinciding with Clinton’s widely expected re-election in 1996) from elections

involving large shocks (Truman surprisingly beating Dewey in 1948). Thus we once again turn to

prediction markets in order to highlight the relationship between equity market movements and

electoral surprises. Data on election betting back to 1880 were pieced together from a variety of

sources. Paul Rhode and Koleman Strumpf were particularly helpful, providing results from the

“Curb Market”—a large scale political market that operated on the curb of Wall Street through most

of this period. This market is probably best described as an historical open-outcry version of the

modern Tradesports markets, and is described in Rhode and Strumpf [2004, 2005]. These data were

supplemented with alternative sources for recent decades, including British and Australian
                                                                                                     10
bookmakers, the Iowa Electronic Markets, and Tradesports.18 Combining these prediction market

data with election outcomes yields a simple measure of the resulting partisan shock:19

      Partisan Shockt = I(Republican President electedt) – Probability of a Republican presidentt-1.

         In order to compile a long-run series of daily stock returns, we analyze movements in

Schwert’s [1990] daily equity returns data (which attempts to replicate returns on a value-weighted

total return index) supplemented by returns on the CRSP-value-weighted portfolio since 1962, and

data from Kalinke [2004] prior to 1888.

         Figure 3 shows that historically equity markets have risen when Republican presidents have

been elected, and the larger the surprise, the more they rise. This is in apparent conflict with Santa-

Clara and Valkanov [2003], who find no systematic relationship, albeit between equity returns and

the sign of the electoral surprise (i.e., whether a Republican is elected).

         Table 5 attempts to reconcile these two results, initially analyzing relationship between

return and sign for Santa-Clara and Valkanov’s 1928-1996 sample. As with their analysis, we find a

positive, but insignificant, relationship when only analyzing whether the Republican Party wins the

election. If instead we exploit our prediction market data to account for the magnitude of the

electoral surprise, our results are clearly significant, and they are slightly more so when we expand

to the full 1880 to 2004 time period for which we can obtain the needed data. A final specification

jointly analyzes both our variable describing the partisan shock (measured as the change in beliefs

that a Republican would be elected) and the change in expectations that the incumbent party would

be re-elected, again finding strong evidence that partisanship, rather than incumbency effects are

driving our results.20


18
   See the Appendix for details on the construction of these prediction market data.
19
   This measure of the partisan shock revealed by the vote count is valid only if the election winner is known by the end
of the event window. We have checked press reports of each election, and this assumption is only potentially
problematic for the 1916 and 2000 elections. Dropping these elections from the regressions in Table 5 yields slightly
stronger results.
20
   There are many ways to define incumbency from incumbent parties to the incumbency of a particular candidate. We
tested several specifications along this spectrum and found all yielded similar conclusions. We also allowed the

                                                                                                                       11
         Thus, this analysis finds further evidence of statistically and economically significant

partisan effects on equity markets, and robustness checking suggests that these estimates are not

driven by specific outliers.21 Moreover, the estimated magnitude is remarkably similar to our

assessments based on intra-day movements in the 2000 and 2004 elections, with the election of a

Republican president calculated to have typically been associated with a 2-3 percent rise in equity

prices. The statistical power of our election-night approach is illustrated by the relative precision of

the estimates in Tables 1 and Table 5: our estimate of partisan effects from a single night

(11/2/2004) yielded standard errors one-half as large those on our estimate using daily data from the

last 124 years of Presidential elections, reflecting the fact that over a ten-minute period there are

fewer unrelated shocks to financial markets creating noise. Equally, the analysis of historical data is

also likely shaped by the fact that there is heterogeneity in the ideology and quality of the specific

Republican candidates, and this heterogeneity is not present in the single-election case studies.

         Figure 4 turns to bond yields showing that they were historically quite unresponsive to

political shocks until the election of Reagan in 1980 when the yield on the 10-year Treasury bill

increased 15 basis points. Prediction markets viewed the chances of his election at 80%. Regressing

changes in bond yields on the change in probability of a Republican president as in Table 5 reveals

that there was no statistically or economically significant difference in the reaction of bond markets

to Democratic or Republican candidates from 1920 to 1976. From 1980 onward a Republican

President increased the 10-year bill yield 13 basis points (p=0.15). Although we have few

observations, this pattern is consistent with both the relatively low national debt before 1980 and a

re-alignment of the political parties with regard to government debt after 1980.

incumbency effect to vary with the incumbent’s performance, interacting the incumbency effect with various measures
of economic performance, and again found evidence of partisan but not incumbency or performance effects.
21
   We are unable to test the effect of party in control of congress since this would require knowledge of the market’s
assessment of the probability of a change in congressional control. Prediction markets did not track this before 1994. If
we assume that a certain proportion of seats going into an election would give a party near certainty of maintaining
congressional control we can test whether a President winning with control of Congress creates different returns then
winning without. We varied the necessary margin of control from 0.5 to 0.72 in increments of 0.01 and found that at no
level was there a statistically significant effect of winning with control of Congress versus winning without.

                                                                                                                       12
                                            V. Discussion

       Large natural experiments caused by flawed election-evening psephology yielded large and

plausibly exogenous shocks to the perceived probability of Bush winning both the 2000 and 2004

elections, enabling us to estimate the causal effect of alternative Presidential candidates on various

financial indices.

       Our estimates are informative for various questions in the political economy literature.

Specifically, partisan political business-cycle models specify that parties have different intrinsic

policy goals. An immediate implication of these theories is that changes in election probabilities

generate shocks to expectations about macroeconomic policy, and indeed we find that changes in

the perceived probability of electing a Republican President caused changes in expected bond

yields, equity and oil prices. A closer inspection of our results yielded somewhat more surprising

insights. The finding that equity values were expected to be 2-3 percent higher under Bush are

easily reconciled with expectations of favored treatment of capital over labor, current firms over

future entrants, equity over bond holders, or expectations of stronger real activity. Long bond yields

were expected to be 10 to 12 basis points higher under Bush, a finding at odds with the usual

characterization of right-wing parties as more strongly committed to balancing the budget, even if

the cost is lower economic activity. That said, this finding is consistent with observed higher

deficits under Republicans since the 1980s. Finally, while the literature so far has focused on

election outcomes as generating monetary or fiscal shocks, our oil price results suggest that

macroeconomic “supply shocks” might also reflect partisan preferences.

       An older strand of the literature claims that candidates and parties will converge to the same

policy—that of the median voter. Under this view, changing policies reflect changing preferences

of voters, rather than changes in the officeholder, and disentangling the two makes falsification of

the theory all the more difficult. Our analysis suggests that financial markets do not believe that
                                                                                                       13
policy convergence occurs. While Jayachandran [2006] and Knight [2006] have shown evidence of

partisanship affecting particular groups of firms differentially, our data speak to broader

macroeconomic effects.

       The reason that we have emphasized the importance of analyzing the effects of exogenous

shocks to the probability of re-election is that under retrospective economic voting a simple time

series regression of financial prices on re-election probabilities will confound the causal effects of

an incumbent’s policies on financial markets with the effects of expectations about the economy

changing expectations about the incumbent’s re-election prospects. Our natural experiments allow

us to isolate the former, and the fact that this yields substantially different results from the longer

time series points to the importance of the economic voting channel highlighted by Fair [1978].

       Our results are contrary to the findings of Santa-Clara and Valkanov [2003] who find no

sharp changes on Election Day, but large excess returns under Democratic administrations. The

greater statistical power of our approach resolves our differences regarding the former observation,

while reconciliations of the latter include the possibility that: 1) Past Democratic Presidents pursued

policies that were more beneficial for equity returns, but investors have not noticed; 2) Past

Democratic Presidents have pursued beneficial policies, but investors do not expect future ones to

do so; and 3) Partisan effects are small relative to the variance of equity returns during a Presidential

term, and past Democratic Presidents have simply been lucky in this regard.

       Finally, our results speak directly to the question asked by Jones and Olken [2005] as to

whether leaders matter. Those authors also emphasize the fact that a country’s leaders both

determine and are determined by their economic performance and hence analyze the effects of

clearly exogenous shocks caused by unexpected leader deaths, finding large effects on growth.

Similarly, Fisman [2001] analyzes financial market implications of shocks to President Suharto’s

health. Our approach is similar in that we analyze the effects of unexpected changes to beliefs about

election outcomes.
                                                                                                          14
       While our results are informative in a wide variety of settings, it is also important to point

out their shortcomings. In that we limit ourselves to U.S. Presidential elections, our analysis has

sacrificed generality for precision. Our observations reflect changing expectations among financial

market traders, rather than actual partisan differences; the partisan differences we estimate for 2000

and 2004 reflect the particularities of Bush versus Gore or Kerry rather than the more general

leanings of the Democratic or Republican parties; and the complexity of the platforms of Kerry and

Bush do not permit us to draw strong conclusions about which policies lead to the effects we

observe.

Notes: For the TIP and IEF exchange traded funds (ETF), the implied yield for 3 pm is taken to be the constant-maturity daily
yield calculated by the Federal Reserve for TIPS and Treasuries with the closest maturity to average holdings of the ETFs
(7 years in both cases). For the 10 and 2-year CBOT Treasury futures, the 10 and 2-year series are used. These yields are then
projected forward using price changes and the average duration of the funds'holdings, as reported by Morningstar in
December 2004.

Data Sources:
Political prediction markets: For 1880-1960, we analyze data provided to us by Rhode and Strumpf who collected press reports of the Curb Market on Wall
Street. Rhode and Strumpf [2004, 2005] provide greater detail about this market. For 1976-1988, we rely on press reports of betting odds with British
bookmakers; for 1992-1996, we use data from the Iowa Electronic Markets (although these are predictions of the winner of the popular vote). In 2000 we use
data provided by Centrebet, an online bookmaker and for 2004 we use Tradesports data. We were unable to obtain prediction market data for the 1964-1972; our
probability assessments for these periods are derived by estimating the following relationship between prediction market prices and two-party predicted vote
shares from the final pre-election Gallup poll:
          Prediction market price= -1(Poll-0.5/ ), where -1(.) is the inverse normal cdf.
Using non-linear least squares, we estimated =4.9, with a standard error of 1.0. Note that our method for estimating a probability is not crucial to the results,
since in 1964 and 1972 the eventual winner was at least 20 points ahead in front in the final Gallup poll, while the final poll in 1968 was virtually a dead heat.
Equity Returns: Are measured from the market the close on the day prior to the election to the close the following day. (For most of the sample, financial
markets were closed on Election Day). Estimates of returns to a value-weighted return index come from CRSP for 1964-2004 and Schwert [1990] for 1888-
1960, and for 1880-1884, we use Kalinke’s [2004] 12 stock average.
Gallup poll data: For 1936-2004 reflect the Gallup organization’s final pre-poll projections of the two-party vote share. Historical data are from
www.gallup.com.
Election results: Are reported as shares of the popular vote earned by the two most popular candidates. For the 1912 election, Taft, the Republican candidate
was effectively the third party, and hence we report Roosevelt as if he were the Republican candidate.
Partisan shock: Measures the change in the probability of a Republican president from the day prior to the election, to the day after. We measure this shock as:
I(Republican President) – p(Republican presidentt-1), where the pre-election probability of a Republican president comes from political prediction markets.
