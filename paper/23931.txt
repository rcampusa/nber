Analysis based on a new measure of financial distress for 24 advanced economies in the postwar
period shows substantial variation in the aftermath of financial crises. This paper examines the
role that macroeconomic policy plays in explaining this variation. We find that the degree of
monetary and fiscal policy space prior to financial distress—that is, whether the policy interest
rate is above the zero lower bound and whether the debt-to-GDP ratio is relatively low—greatly
affects the aftermath of crises. The decline in output following a crisis is less than 1 percent when
a country possesses both types of policy space, but almost 10 percent when it has neither. The
difference is highly statistically significant and robust to the measures of policy space and the
sample. We also consider the mechanisms by which policy space matters. We find that monetary
and fiscal policy are used more aggressively when policy space is ample. Financial distress itself
is also less persistent when there is policy space. The findings may have implications for policy
during both normal times and periods of acute financial distress.

     The aftermath of financial crises varies greatly. Following Japan’s crisis in the 1990s, real

GDP growth slowed dramatically and persistently; following Norway’s crisis around the same

time, GDP fell only briefly, and then grew substantially faster than before the crisis. Even

following the global financial crisis of 2008—which by definition affected nearly every country in

the world—outcomes varied widely. Some countries, such as Australia and South Korea, came

through largely unscathed; and even the United States and the United Kingdom, where the crisis

was particularly severe, started to grow again less than a year after the crisis. Others, such as

Italy, Portugal, and Greece, remained depressed more than five years after the crisis began.

     In this paper, we consider one possible explanation for the variation in aftermaths: a

country’s ability and willingness to use macroeconomic policy. When Japan’s crisis became

severe in 1997, it was already at the zero lower bound on the policy interest rate, and its debt-to-

GDP ratio was among the highest in the world. Its monetary and fiscal policy responses were

decidedly lackluster—particularly relative to the magnitude of its financial problems. Norway,

in contrast, began its crisis with a nominal policy rate close to 10 percent, and with negative net

debt (as a result of its large sovereign wealth fund). Its macropolicy response, including an

expensive bailout of its financial system, was swift and aggressive. Following the 2008 crisis,

the central banks of the United States and the United Kingdom were able to cut interest rates at

least somewhat before hitting the zero lower bound. But by the time financial distress became

acute in the countries of southern Europe, the policy rate in the euro area was firmly

constrained. And, countries such as Australia, South Korea, the United States, and the United

Kingdom were able to use fiscal policy aggressively thanks to relatively low debt and high

borrowing capacity, whereas Greece and Italy’s high debt levels almost surely limited their

ability to use fiscal policy.

     Using a new series on financial distress in advanced economies in the postwar period, we

test whether economic outcomes following crises vary systematically with the amount of
                                                                                                    2


monetary and fiscal policy space a country possessed prior to distress. We find that GDP falls

much less in countries with macropolicy space than in those without. We also investigate the

mechanisms by which policy space matters. We find that countries with space use policy—

particularly fiscal policy—much more aggressively. Financial distress itself also appears to be

much less persistent in countries with room to use policy.

     Overview. Section I of the paper reviews the new semiannual series on financial distress

for 24 advanced countries over the period 1967–2012 presented in Romer and Romer (2017). A

defining feature of the new series, which is derived from a single real-time narrative source, is

that it scales the severity of financial distress. This feature enables us to control for variation in

the severity of distress when examining the aftermath of crises. Section I also reviews and

extends the evidence from the earlier paper that the aftermath of financial crises, even in

otherwise similar modern advanced economies, is highly variable.

     Section II examines the role of monetary and fiscal policy space before financial distress in

explaining the variation in the aftermath of financial crises. We measure monetary policy space

in a variety of ways. The simplest is just a dummy variable for whether the policy rate is above

the zero lower bound; more complicated versions take into account participation in a currency

union and the fact that the cutoff is likely smooth rather than abrupt. Our main measure of

fiscal space is the ratio of gross debt to GDP (multiplied by −1 so that higher values correspond

to greater space).    As alternatives, we consider the ratio based on net debt, as well as

specifications that account for possible nonlinearities and the effects of being subject to the

European Union’s fiscal rules. A benefit of looking at policy space before financial distress

rather than at actual policy during a crisis is that space is relatively exogenous. Whereas the

actual policy response is likely to be correlated with the severity of any post-crisis recession,

prior policy space is more likely to reflect trend inflation (which affects nominal policy interest

rates) or long-run patterns of fiscal prudence or profligacy.

     Our basic empirical specification uses the Jordà local projection approach to estimate the
                                                                                                  3


response of real GDP at various horizons after time t to financial distress at t. We test for the

importance of policy space by including an interaction term between distress and prior policy

space.   The overwhelming finding from this estimation is that policy space matters.            The

estimated coefficient on the interaction term is consistently positive and highly statistically

significant. The effects are also quantitatively large. For a country with both types of policy

space, the decline in output following a financial crisis is effectively zero, whereas for a country

without either type of space the decline is large (almost 10 percent) and highly persistent.

Though there is a range of estimated impacts of space depending on the particular measures of

policy space used, the finding that monetary and fiscal space matter is highly robust.

     Section III of the paper analyzes possible mechanisms by which policy space may affect the

aftermath of financial crises. Our main focus is on the policy response. We run the same sort of

Jordà regressions with interaction terms as in Section II, but with measures of monetary and

fiscal policy as the dependent variable. As one might expect, central banks cut policy rates more

in response to a financial crisis when they are away from the zero lower bound prior to the

distress—though not dramatically so. The fiscal policy response, on the other hand, varies

drastically with prior policy space.    Countries that face financial distress with debt ratios

substantially below average typically engage in aggressive fiscal expansion, whereas countries

with high debt loads typically run highly contractionary fiscal policy following a crisis. Given the

widespread evidence that monetary and fiscal policy have substantial real effects, these

systematic differences in the policy response depending on policy space likely account for much

of the finding that the aftermath of crises tends to be much milder when a country possesses

monetary and fiscal policy space.

     Section III also examines a second channel through which greater policy space could

cushion the adverse effects of financial crises: the persistence of financial distress. For this

analysis, we regress distress at various horizons after time t on both distress at t and the

interaction of distress and prior policy space. We find that financial distress dies down much
                                                                                                  4


more quickly following an innovation when a country has monetary and fiscal policy space. This

could be because space allows for policies that stabilize output, which aids financial recovery

indirectly, or because space allows for more aggressive government bailouts and restructuring of

the financial system. It could also be that crises are less likely to mushroom and spread if people

see that the government possesses the ability to rescue the economy and financial institutions.

Whatever the particular channel, the fact that distress is less persistent when there is

macropolicy space could help account for the positive relationship that we find between

economic activity and policy space following financial crises.

     Finally, Section IV discusses the possible implications of the results for policy. Our finding

that policy space matters substantially for the aftermath of financial crises strongly suggests that

if countries want to be able to combat future crises, they should aim to maintain policy space in

normal times. This could involve higher normal inflation, so that monetary policymakers have

more room to cut interest rates in a crisis, and more prudent fiscal policy in normal times, so

that debt loads are typically low.

     Related Literature. Relatively little previous work speaks directly to the issues that are

the focus of this paper. There is of course a voluminous literature on financial crises; see, for

example, Kaminsky and Reinhart (1999); Bordo, Eichengreen, Klingebiel, and Martinez-Peria

(2001); Reinhart and Rogoff (2009); Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor (2013); and Laeven and

Valencia (2014). Much of this research focuses on identifying crises and examining the output

consequences.

     Some of the research on crises examines the behavior of a broad range of variables,

including policy indicators, around the times of financial crises. For example, Reinhart and

Rogoff (2009, Chapters 10 and 14) show that government debt as a share of GDP often rises

sharply following crises—in considerable part because of high deficits stemming from large falls

in revenue. But they do not ask how the behavior of debt varies with the country’s prior fiscal

space or how the aftermath of crises varies with the fiscal response. Similarly, in recent work,
                                                                                                 5


Kose, Kurlat, Ohnsorge, and Sugawara (2017) present multiple measures of fiscal space and

discuss how space behaves around financial crises, but they do not examine the link between

policy space and the aftermath of crises that is the focus of this paper.

     On the fiscal policy side, the issues of how the level of government debt affects both the

conduct of policy and multipliers are potentially relevant to how the aftermath of financial crises

varies with government debt. A line of research begun by Bohn (1998) and extended by such

authors as Mendoza and Ostry (2008) finds that the stance of fiscal policy is on average more

expansionary when government debt is lower. But, this work does not focus on the question of

how debt affects the response of fiscal policy to shocks. And papers by such authors as Perotti

(1999), Corsetti (2o12), and Ilzetzki, Mendoza, and Végh (2013) investigate whether fiscal

multipliers vary with the level of debt. However, because we find that the fiscal response to a

financial crisis is highly contractionary in high-debt countries and highly expansionary in low-

debt countries, the answer to this question does not appear central to understanding why the

aftermath of a financial crisis is typically so much worse in high-debt countries.

     Finally, many observers have stressed that monetary and fiscal policy space can affect the

policy response to adverse macroeconomic shocks, and hence the output effects of the shocks.

Moreover, some of this work focuses on how space can be important to the response to financial

crises in particular. On the monetary policy side, Amano and Shukayev (2012) show in a

calibrated model that the times when the zero lower bound is likely to cause particularly large

output losses are when there are shocks that trigger a financial crisis, and hence that monetary

policy space may be particularly important to the effects of crises. On the fiscal policy side,

Obstfeld (2013) argues that the continued large scale and complexity of the financial system

makes future financial crises likely, and that low government debt makes it easier for

policymakers to use fiscal policy to respond to crises. Neither paper, however, presents direct

empirical evidence about the impact of policy space on output losses from crises.

I. NEW MEASURE OF FINANCIAL DISTRESS AND THE AFTERMATH OF CRISES

     In Romer and Romer (2017), we describe the derivation of a new scaled measure of

financial distress, and provide evidence that the aftermath of financial crises is highly variable.

Since both of these contributions are essential inputs to this study, it is useful to summarize

them briefly.


A. New Measure of Financial Distress

     Conceptually, our new measure of financial distress is designed to capture what Bernanke

(1983) calls a rise in the cost of credit intermediation. It focuses narrowly on the health of the

financial system, rather than on currency or sovereign debt markets. It seeks to identify times

when credit provision became more costly relative to a safe interest rate. Such a rise in the cost

of credit intermediation results in a reduction in credit supply for a given level of borrower

riskiness.

     We identify such increases in the cost of credit intermediation for 24 advanced countries in

the postwar period from a single real-time narrative source prepared by analysts at the

Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD):                  the OECD Economic

Outlook (OECD, various years). The OECD Economic Outlook provides concise, analytical

descriptions of economic and financial conditions in each OECD country twice a year (roughly

June and December) beginning in 1967.               To identify increases in the cost of credit

intermediation from this source, we read the entries looking for descriptions of higher funding

costs (relative to a safe interest rate), losses of confidence in financial institution or the existence

of factors likely to impair confidence (such as rising loan defaults or erosion of banks’ capital),

and increased information costs (say, because of widespread bank failures). We also look for

narrative descriptions of resulting credit rationing and other direct indications of disruption to

the supply of credit. Because the OECD Economic Outlook is available twice a year, our new

measure of financial distress is semiannual as well.

     A key feature of the new series is that it is scaled from 0 to 15. Zero corresponds to no
                                                                                                7


indication of financial distress; low positive numbers correspond to relatively minor amounts of

credit disruption; and high numbers correspond to severe financial crises and the breakdown of

intermediation. As discussed in detail in Romer and Romer (2017), we scale financial distress

by looking for gradations in the narrative indicators of increases in the cost of credit

intermediation.   The descriptions that we classify as a 7 or above appear to correspond

approximately to what other crisis chronologies call a systemic crisis. In such episodes, there

are substantial problems in the financial sector; these problems are central to the

macroeconomic outlook; and the government is likely to be taking emergency actions to stabilize

financial markets and restore credit flows.

     As described in the previous paper, we take various steps to ensure the independence and

accuracy of the new series. For example, we were careful not to consult data on outcomes before

our narrative work was complete, and we provide a detailed description of our reasoning for

each positive scaling of distress so that others can check our analysis. We also check the results

based on the OECD Economic Outlook against a range of other narrative sources. While the

alternative sources do not match the OECD in every instance, they are reassuringly close.

     Figure 1 shows the new measure of financial distress for the 24 countries in our sample

from 1967 (when the OECD Economic Outlook begins) to 2012. The most obvious characteristic

is that there was essentially no financial distress in OECD countries in the first 20 years of the

sample. This finding is consistent with the notion that the financial architecture of advanced

economies in the early postwar period was highly regulated and extraordinarily stable. There

was substantial financial distress in the United States and the Nordic countries in the late 1980s

and early 1990s. Japan experienced financial distress continuously between 1990 and 2005—

some of it extremely severe. Finally, during the 2008 global financial crisis every country in our

sample had at least some financial distress—though the level varied greatly across countries.


B. The Average Aftermath of Financial Crises

     As described in our earlier paper, to summarize how real GDP typically behaves following
                                                                                                                                   8


financial distress, we use the Jordà (2005) local projection method. We regress the logarithm of

real GDP at various horizons after time t on financial distress at t. Because we have a panel of

semiannual data for 24 countries, we include time and country fixed effects. To capture other

dynamics, we also include four lags of both GDP and financial distress. Thus, the equation we

estimate is:


(1)               𝑦𝑦𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡+𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼𝑗𝑗𝑖𝑖 + 𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽 𝑖𝑖 𝐹𝐹𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 + ∑4𝑘𝑘=1 𝜑𝜑𝑘𝑘𝑖𝑖 𝐹𝐹𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 + ∑4𝑘𝑘=1 𝜃𝜃𝑘𝑘𝑖𝑖 𝑦𝑦𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 + 𝑒𝑒𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡
                                                                                                                          𝑖𝑖
                                                                                                                               ,


where the j subscripts index countries, the t subscripts index time, and the i superscripts denote

the horizon (half-years after time t) being considered. yj,t+i is the logarithm of real GDP for

country j at time t+i. Fj,t is the financial distress variable for country j at time t. The α’s are

country fixed effects and the γ’s are time fixed effects. We estimate (1) separately for horizons 0

to 10 (that is, up through five years after time t). The sequence of β i ’s from these eleven

regressions provides a nonparametric estimate of the impulse response function of output to

financial distress.

      As discussed in detail in the previous paper, this specification includes as part of the

average aftermath of distress any contemporaneous relationship between output and distress.

Because distress is almost surely at least somewhat endogenous, the resulting point estimates

should thus be viewed as an upper bound of any causal effect of distress on economic activity.

      The data on real GDP for each country come from the OECD. 1 The OECD makes some

adjustments; for example, all of the series are on the same base year and denominated in 2010

dollars. However, the series are ultimately constructed by each country’s statistical agency, and

so may not be strictly comparable.                       Because the financial distress variable is semiannual

(corresponding to June and December), we convert the GDP data to semiannual as well (using

the observations for the second and fourth quarters of each year).



1 The data are from the OECD (http://www.oecd.org/statistics/, downloaded 4/10/2017). The data are
from the Quarterly National Accounts Dataset, series VPVOBARSA. GDP data are missing for a few
countries in certain years.
                                                                                                        9


     The policy measures that we use in Sections II and III are generally not available before

1980. For comparability with later results, in estimating equation (1), we also only use data

beginning in 1980:1. The new measure of financial distress is available through 2012:2 and we

use GDP data through 2015:2. As a result, the regressions for longer horizons make use of the

later GDP data, while those for shorter horizons do not.

     Figure 2 shows the estimated response of GDP to an innovation of 7 in our new measure of

financial distress. 2 A 7 corresponds to the lower end of the moderate crisis category on our

scale. The figure shows that, on average, GDP falls roughly 6 percent following a financial crisis,

and the effects are highly significant and quite persistent. 3 More than one-third of the decline

occurs in the contemporaneous half-year—when reverse causation is most likely. Though the

estimated average decline is unquestionably substantial, it is perhaps somewhat smaller than

the literature on the dire consequences of financial crises might lead one to expect.


C. Variation in the Aftermath of Financial Crises

     To investigate the variation in the aftermath of financial crises, we focus on episodes of

substantial distress. There are nineteen times when a country in our sample has a distress

reading of at least a 7. 4 For these episodes, we construct a simple forecast for the logarithm of

real GDP and look at the forecast errors. We interpret substantial differences in the forecast

errors as evidence of variation in aftermaths.

     To form the relevant forecast for each episode, we begin with the estimated coefficients

from equation (1) for the full sample of countries in the post-1980 period. We then use actual

GDP in the country up through one half-year before financial distress first reached 7 (or above),


2 The results are slightly different from those in Romer and Romer (2017) because the GDP data have
been updated and because we use a shorter sample period. The estimates in the earlier paper used data
starting in 1967:1 rather than 1980:1. The most notable difference in the results is that the estimated
negative aftermath of financial crises is somewhat less persistent when the shorter sample is used.
3 The standard errors used to form the confidence bands are conventional standard errors. As discussed

in Romer and Romer (2017), alternatives, such as heteroskedasticity-consistent and heteroskedasticity-
and serial-correlation-corrected standard errors, yield fairly similar results.
4 In several of these episodes, distress reached 7, fell below 7, and then hit 7 or higher again. We treat

such multi-peaked episodes as a single event.
                                                                                                         10


and actual distress up through the half-year that it reached that benchmark. Because we control

for the initial level of distress (and lags) in the forecast, the mean forecast errors across these

crisis episodes are roughly zero, rather than negative as one might expect. 5

     Figure 3 shows the forecast errors for the nineteen episodes, grouped into three categories.

Panel A shows the nine cases where the forecast errors are positive or just barely negative.

These are times when the aftermaths are decidedly better than predicted (conditional on there

being significant distress). Even within this category there is substantial variation: for example,

the positive forecast errors for Norway in its 1991 crisis top 12 percent; those for Denmark in the

2008 crisis reach a maximum of less than 3 percent. Panel B shows the four cases of moderately

negative forecast errors. Again, within this broad category there is great variety: for example,

Sweden following the 2008 crisis initially had modest negative forecast errors, which were

followed by substantial positive ones; Ireland, also following the 2008 crisis, initially had

positive forecast errors, which were followed by negative ones of more than 5 percent. Finally,

Panel C shows the six episodes with large negative forecast errors. These are times when the

outcomes were far worse than predicted.            In all cases the negative forecast errors have a

maximum of over 6 percent; in the case of Greece, the maximum is over 25 percent.

     Figure 3 makes clear that even conditional on the initial severity of distress, actual

outcomes relative to predicted vary enormously. In some cases output rises rapidly relative to

the forecast, whereas in others output not only plummets relative to the forecast, but continues

falling for years. The fact that the aftermath of crises varies so greatly across episodes suggests

that it is crucially important to try to understand the source of this variation.




5 This forecast specification is somewhat different from that in Romer and Romer (2017). The current

specification is more consistent with related exercises in Sections II and III. Because the specification in
the previous paper did not control for the initial level of distress, the forecast errors were, on average,
strongly negative in these crisis episodes. But the results—particularly the variation in forecast errors
across episodes—are otherwise very similar.
                                                                                                 11


II. THE ROLE OF MACROECONOMIC POLICY SPACE IN ACCOUNTING FOR THE VARIATION IN
    THE AFTERMATH OF FINANCIAL CRISES

     The possible explanation that we focus on in this paper is the contribution of

macroeconomic policy.      The first and most important thing we look at is the role of

macroeconomic policy space in accounting for the variation in the aftermath of financial crises.

By macropolicy space we mean the room that policymakers have to maneuver. For example, if

the policy interest rate is well above zero when a crisis starts, the central bank will have much

greater ability to use conventional monetary policy to deal with the effects of a crisis than if the

country begins the crisis at the zero lower bound. Similarly, if a country begins a crisis with a

low debt-to-GDP ratio, policymakers are more likely to be able to bail out the financial system or

to use fiscal stimulus to cushion the impact of the crisis than if the debt load at the start of the

crisis is already high.

     An important reason for looking at macropolicy space rather than at the policy response

directly is that the results are much less likely to be affected by endogeneity. We would expect a

country facing a more severe recession following a crisis to use policy more aggressively. As a

result, one might find that crises accompanied by a more aggressive policy response have worse

aftermaths—but causation would likely run from the aftermath to policy, not the other way

around.    Policy space before the crisis, on the other hand, is more likely to be driven by

fundamentals. Is a country typically fiscally prudent (like Germany), or fiscally profligate (like

Greece)? Does a country typically have moderate inflation, so nominal rates hover well above

the zero lower bound (like the Nordic countries in the 1980s and 1990s), or very low inflation, so

nominal interest rates are typically low (like Japan in the 1990s and after)?

     At the same time, we expect policy space to be correlated with the policy response. Indeed,

in Section III we provide direct evidence of this. So looking at policy space can capture the likely

contribution of policy, while avoiding at least some of the endogeneity issues.
                                                                                                12


A. Monetary Policy Space

     We start with the contribution of monetary policy space, and then consider fiscal policy

space. We also consider the explanatory power of the two types of space together.

     Measures of Monetary Policy Space. There are various ways to measure monetary

policy space. All of them begin with data on the level of the policy interest rate in each country.

Because such policy rates vary over time and across countries, collecting these series is not as

straightforward as one might expect. In all cases, we focus on a market rate (such as the federal

funds rate), rather than an administered rate (such as the discount rate). We collect the policy

rate data from the relevant central bank when they are available. We supplement this data with

related data on interbank interest rates. To convert the data to a semiannual series, we use the

observation at the end of the half-year. The data appendix provides a detailed description of the

sources, series, and splicing procedures used for each country in our sample.

     The simplest measure of monetary policy space (and the one we use as our baseline) is just

a dummy variable that is equal to 1 if the policy interest rate is greater than 1.25 percent at the

end of the previous half-year, and 0 otherwise. Though the particular cutoff level is admittedly

somewhat arbitrary, this measure captures the notion that if the policy interest rate is at or

below 1.25 percent, policymakers are severely limited in how much they can use conventional

monetary policy. We define the dummy based on the level of the policy rate at the end of the

previous half-year to limit the endogeneity of the measure of policy space with respect to

financial distress and economic activity.

     We consider variants of this simple measure along three dimensions. The first is simply to

consider other cutoffs. For example, perhaps an initial policy interest rate of 2 percent is also

functionally equivalent to being at the zero lower bound.

     The second variant is to take into account the fact that the cutoff between not having and

having space is surely not as sharp as a dummy variable implies. When it comes to being able to

respond to a crisis, starting at a policy interest rate of 1 percent is probably not very different
                                                                                                           13


from starting at 1.5 percent. For this reason, we also consider functions that, rather than

transitioning abruptly from 0 to 1 at some cutoff interest rate, transition smoothly around some

rate. For convenience, the functional form we use is the cumulative normal distribution. For

example, using a cumulative normal with a mean of 1.25 and a standard deviation of 0.625, the

measure of space is essentially 0 at a policy rate of 0 or less; 0.16 at a policy rate of 0.625

percent; 0.5 at 1.25 percent; 0.84 at 1.875 percent; and essentially 1 at 2.5 percent or more. The

smoothed measure could capture any reason for the transition not being sharp. One concrete

way to interpret it is as the probability that the policy response will not be constrained. We

consider a range of possible means and standard deviations of the cumulative normal

distribution, including some that imply that the transition from no space to space is quite

gradual. 6

     The third variant involves the treatment of the euro area, which accounts for half of the

countries in our sample in the latter part of the sample period. Even if the policy rate of the

European Central Bank (ECB) is not at zero, for a particular euro area country, the rate is likely

to be relatively unresponsive to country-specific conditions.                We therefore consider an

alternative form of the simple dummy variable that is 1 if the country has a policy rate above 1.25

percent and is not in the euro area.

     We also consider a more complicated approach that takes into account the fact that while

the ECB cannot set a separate policy interest rate for each member country in response to that

country’s financial distress, it may be able to respond to general euro area distress. The way we

model this feature of policy is to decompose distress in each euro area country in the period

when the euro is in effect into two components: the weighted average of distress in the euro

area as a whole, and the deviation of distress in that country from the average. The weights are


6 The obvious extreme of this sort of exercise would be to use the level of the policy interest rate as the

measure of monetary policy space. We do not go all the way to this extreme because there is not likely to
be a substantial difference in the ability to use monetary policy at an initial policy rate of, say, 6 percent
and one of 12 percent. Indeed, since high policy rates at the start of the crisis sometimes reflect strains in
international currency markets, one could imagine scenarios where a very high initial policy rate
corresponds to less ability to undertake monetary policy actions.
                                                                                                                                                    14


based on each country’s GDP in the first half-year of 2006 (which is the midpoint of the period

in our sample after the introduction of the euro). We then assume that monetary policy may

respond to the first component as long as the ECB’s policy rate is not constrained by the zero

lower bound (which, as before, we define as corresponding to a policy rate above 1.25 percent),

but that it does not respond to the second component regardless of the policy rate.

      Specification and Results. Section I described the basic regression framework that we

use to look at the aftermath of financial distress. We regress output at various horizons after

time t on distress at t, along with lags of both output and distress, and country and time fixed

effects. To account for possible interaction effects with monetary policy space, we simply add an

interaction term between financial distress at time t and the measure of monetary policy space,

also at time t (which as described before, is based on the policy rate at the end of period t−1).

We also include the level of the policy space measure to account for any systematic difference

between countries with and without space in normal times. And we again include four lags of all

variables. Thus, the equation we estimate is:


(2)                                  𝑦𝑦𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡+𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼𝑗𝑗𝑖𝑖 + 𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖 + 𝜗𝜗 𝑖𝑖 𝑆𝑆𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 + 𝛽𝛽 𝑖𝑖 𝐹𝐹𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 + 𝛿𝛿 𝑖𝑖 (𝐹𝐹𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 ∙ 𝑆𝑆𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 )
                                                                                                                                           𝑖𝑖
          + ∑4𝑘𝑘=1 𝜌𝜌𝑘𝑘𝑖𝑖 𝑆𝑆𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 + ∑4𝑘𝑘=1 𝜑𝜑𝑘𝑘𝑖𝑖 𝐹𝐹𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 + ∑4𝑘𝑘=1 𝜔𝜔𝑘𝑘𝑖𝑖 (𝐹𝐹𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 ∙ 𝑆𝑆𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 ) + ∑4𝑘𝑘=1 𝜃𝜃𝑘𝑘𝑖𝑖 𝑦𝑦𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 + 𝑒𝑒𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 ,


where yj,t+i is again the logarithm of real GDP for country j at time t+i, Fj,t is financial distress in

country j at time t, the α’s and γ’s are country and time fixed effects, and Sj,t is a measure of

policy space for country j at time t.

      Equation (2) makes clear that policy space is allowed to evolve as financial distress

progresses. That is, as t changes, policy space changes. As a result, the specification captures

the fact that as distress persists, macroeconomic policy space may change. However, because

policy space is defined in terms of the policy rate at the end of the previous half-year, it is always

lagged relative to distress.

      We again estimate the equation for horizons 0 to 10. As in Section I, we only use data
                                                                                                   15


beginning in 1980, and the end date varies with the particular horizon being considered because

the output data are available through 2015:2. For our baseline case, we measure monetary

policy space using the simple dummy variable equal to 1 if the policy interest rate is greater than

1.25 at the end of the previous half-year.

     The results of estimating equation (2) suggest that monetary policy space matters

substantially. The estimated coefficient on the interaction term (δ i ) is strongly positive and

significant at all horizons after one half-year. Indeed, for horizons of 3 to 8 half-years, the t-

statistic on the interaction term ranges from 2.5 to 3.7. Thus, the aftermath of financial distress

is significantly better when a country begins the period of distress with monetary policy space.

     Figure 4 summarizes the results by plotting the impulse response function for GDP to a

realization of our financial distress measure of 7 (a moderate crisis) in two cases. “Without

monetary policy space” corresponds to the case where the dummy variable is equal to 0; “with

monetary policy space” corresponds to the case where the dummy variable is equal to 1. 7 The

figure shows that the fall in GDP following substantial financial distress is dramatically smaller

when a country has monetary policy space than when it does not. At most horizons, the

difference is 4 to 6 percentage points. The peak decline is 9.5 percent when there is not

monetary policy space, but just 3.0 percent when there is.

     The figure also shows the two-standard-error confidence bands for the two impulse

response functions (based on conventional standard errors). At intermediate horizons they do

not overlap at all. Importantly, however, the confidence bands reflect uncertainty about both

the average decline in GDP following financial distress and how the decline varies with policy

space. Therefore, the appropriate way to test whether the responses with and without policy

space are different is to look at the statistical significance of the estimated coefficients on the

interaction term, not whether the confidence bands overlap.            As discussed above, those


7 The impulse response function for without monetary policy space is thus just the sequence of the
estimated β i ’s. The impulse response function for with monetary policy space is the sequence of the
estimates of β i + δ i .
                                                                                                         16


coefficients are highly significant.

     An example that illustrates the importance of this interaction effect is Japan following its

severe financial distress in the late 1990s. Recall that in the forecasting exercise discussed in

Section IC, Japan stands out as a case where the forecast errors are large and negative. The

behavior of output following its crisis was substantially worse than the prediction conditional on

lagged output, lagged distress, and the level of distress at the start of the crisis.

     Importantly, Japan had been struggling with slow growth and low inflation following the

bubble and bust of real estate prices around 1990. As a result, when financial distress became

acute in 1997, monetary policy had nowhere to cut. To see the impact of being at the zero lower

bound, we now consider a forecast based on our parameter estimates from equation (2). In

constructing the forecast for a particular episode, we use actual output up through one period

before distress reached 7, and monetary policy space, distress, and the interaction with between

distress and policy space up through the period when distress reached that level. We compare

this to the forecast based on an equation that excludes the interaction terms (but for

comparability includes the level of monetary policy space).

     The two forecasts for Japan are shown in Figure 5. Accounting for the interaction with

monetary policy space results in noticeably smaller negative forecast errors than the simple

forecast. 8 In this episode, much of the reason that the aftermath was worse than one would

predict based on lagged output and initial distress is that Japan lacked monetary policy space.

     Robustness. The finding that the aftermath of financial distress is decidedly better when

a country has monetary policy space is highly robust to the measure of monetary policy space

used. For example, raising the cutoff for the simple dummy variable for space from 1.25 to 2

percent weakens the results only slightly. The estimated coefficient on the interaction term is

consistently positive and significant for horizons 4 to 8. The maximum decline in GDP following


8The baseline forecast error is decidedly smaller than in Figure 3C because in this exercise we also include
the level of the monetary policy space variable as a control. This additional term soaks up much (though
not all) of the slowdown in growth that occurred in Japan after 1990.
                                                                                                     17


an impulse in financial distress of 7 is 8.2 percent when there is not monetary policy space and

3.7 percent when there is.

     Similarly, treating the transition from not having to having monetary policy space as

gradual rather than sudden has little effect on the results. If we model the transition as smooth

around an interest rate of 1.25 percent (concretely, if we consider the case described above of a

cumulative normal distribution function with a mean of 1.25 percent and a standard deviation of

0.625 percent), the estimated coefficient on the interaction term is positive after horizon zero

and significant for horizons 4 to 8. The maximum decline in GDP following a crisis is 10.1

percent without monetary policy space, and 3.9 percent with space. 9 Even moving to a much

smoother case does not change the estimates greatly. For example, we also consider the case of

a cumulative normal distribution function with a mean of 3 percent and a standard deviation of

1.5 percent—which implies that monetary policy is not effectively fully unconstrained until the

policy rate is 6 percent or higher. In this case, the maximum decline in output following a

financial crisis is 8.8 percent if the policy rate at the start of a crisis is zero, and 3.2 percent if

monetary policy is fully unconstrained. The coefficient on the interaction term is positive after

horizon 1 and statistically significant for horizons 4 to 9.

     Taking into account that being to the euro area reduces the ability of monetary policy to

respond to a financial crisis in a country yields slightly different, but qualitatively similar results.

For example, when we change the monetary policy variable that we interact with financial

distress to be 1 only when the policy rate is above 1.25 percent and the country’s monetary policy

is not determined by the ECB, the estimated coefficient on the interaction term is positive and

strongly significant at all horizons after 3 half-years. The maximum decline in GDP following an

impulse to financial distress of 7 is 7.8 percent without monetary space and 2.6 percent with




9 Though the regression uses a continuous variable for identifying monetary policy space, for describing

the results with and without monetary space, we define without space as corresponding to a value of the
policy rate of 0 (which, in the case considered, corresponds to a value of the policy space variable of
0.023), and with space as corresponding to a value of the space variable of 1.
                                                                                                                                                           18


space. 10 And when we modify the specification to allow euro area monetary policy to respond to

the overall level of distress in the euro area but not to country-specific distress, the

corresponding figures are 7.6 percent and 3.2 percent. 11 The coefficient on the interaction term

is somewhat less precisely estimated, but still significant at horizons 4 to 8.

        Returning to our baseline measure of monetary policy space (the simple dummy variable),

we also consider samples that leave out particular countries. For example, one might worry that

Japan, one of the most famous cases of a country facing a crisis at the zero lower bound, is

driving some of the results. But the results are in fact very robust to the sample of countries

considered. Indeed, when Japan is excluded, the difference in the aftermath of financial crises

with and without monetary policy space actually gets larger: without space, GDP declines 12.3

percent following an impulse of 7 in financial distress; with space it declines just 3.0 percent.

The estimated coefficient on the interaction term is highly significant at all horizons after 1 half-

year.


B. Fiscal Policy Space

        We now consider the interaction between the aftermath of crises and fiscal policy space.

        Measures of Fiscal Policy Space. Our measures of fiscal space begin with data on the

10   Our baseline version of this specification (with the fixed effects and lags not shown for simplicity) is
                                                                                             𝑖𝑖
𝑦𝑦𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡+𝑖𝑖 = 𝜗𝜗 𝑖𝑖 𝑆𝑆𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 + 𝛽𝛽 𝑖𝑖 𝐹𝐹𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 + 𝛿𝛿 𝑖𝑖 [𝐹𝐹𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 ∙ 𝑆𝑆𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 ∙ (1 − 𝐸𝐸𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 )] + 𝑒𝑒𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 , where 𝐸𝐸𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 is a dummy for whether country j is in the
euro area in period t. As before, 𝑆𝑆𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 is a dummy for whether the policy rate relevant to country j at the end
of period t–1 (that is, the policy rate of the country’s central bank for observations not in the euro area,
and the ECB’s policy rate for observations in the euro area) is over 1.25 percent. The logic for controlling
for 𝑆𝑆𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 rather than for 𝑆𝑆𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 ∙ (1 − 𝐸𝐸𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 ) (that is, for including the 𝜗𝜗 𝑖𝑖 𝑆𝑆𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 term rather than a 𝜗𝜗 𝑖𝑖 𝑆𝑆𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 ∙ (1 − 𝐸𝐸𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 )
term) is that one can think of reasons that not being at the zero lower bound might affect output (or be
correlated with factors that might affect output); but it is harder to see why being in the euro area would
directly affect output. And, it certainly does not seem reasonable to force not being at the zero lower
bound and not being in the euro area to have the same output effects. However, we have also considered
the specification that controls for both 𝑆𝑆𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 and 𝐸𝐸𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 (and their lags). When we do this, the maximum
output decline following an impulse of 7 to financial distress is 6.4 percent without monetary policy space
and 3.1 percent with space. Even in this case, the difference between the two responses is statistically
significant at horizons of three years or more.
11 In this case, the basic specification (with the fixed effects and lags again not shown for simplicity) is
                                                                                         ����
𝑦𝑦𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡+𝑖𝑖 = 𝜗𝜗 𝑖𝑖 𝑆𝑆𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 + 𝛽𝛽 𝑖𝑖 𝐹𝐹𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 + 𝛿𝛿 𝑖𝑖 [𝐹𝐹𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 ∙ 𝑆𝑆𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 ∙ (1 − 𝐸𝐸𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 ) + 𝐹𝐹 𝐸𝐸                           𝑖𝑖           ����
                                                                                                                                         𝐸𝐸
                                                                                           𝑡𝑡 ∙ 𝑆𝑆𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 ∙ 𝐸𝐸𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 ] + 𝑒𝑒𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 , where 𝐹𝐹𝑡𝑡  is the GDP-weighted
average level of financial distress in the euro area in period t. Thus, this specification allows for monetary
policy space to respond to financial distress if a country is not in the euro and its policy rate is not close to
the zero lower bound, and to respond to euro area distress, but not country-specific distress, if the country
is in the euro and the ECB policy rate is not close to the zero lower bound.
                                                                                                19


ratio of gross and net debt to GDP for the 24 countries in our sample. Like the policy interest

rate data, these fiscal indicators must be gathered from multiple sources. As discussed in detail

in the data appendix, we use data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) when available,

and supplement them with comparable data from the OECD when those series go back further

in time. The series are spliced together in levels. The debt data are annual; we convert them to

semiannual by assigning the annual value to each of the two half-years.

     We use as our baseline measure of fiscal policy space the ratio of gross government debt to

GDP in the previous calendar year. The idea is that a country with a lower debt-to-GDP ratio is

more likely to be able to use fiscal policy than a country with a higher debt-to-GDP ratio. So that

the measure of fiscal space has the same sign convention as the monetary policy space variables

(where a higher number corresponds to more space), we multiply the debt-to-GDP ratio by −1.

Thus, a lower debt ratio is a larger number and so corresponds to more space. Using the debt-

to-GDP ratio in the previous year limits the endogeneity of fiscal space with respect to output

and current fiscal policy.

     One alternative measure of fiscal space that we consider is the net debt-to-GDP ratio (again

multiplied by −1). Net debt includes government asset holdings, such as a sovereign wealth

fund. Presumably, a country with high government asset holdings (and so lower net debt) has

more fiscal space for a given amount of gross government debt than a country without such

asset holdings. One limitation of the net debt series is that there are somewhat more missing

observation than for gross debt. Another is that the very large negative values of net debt in

Norway and Finland may cause the observations from those two countries to have a

disproportionate effect on the results.

     Another alternative measure takes into account the possibility that fiscal space may not fall

linearly with the debt-to-GDP ratio over the entire relevant range. For example, perhaps at

some point a higher debt ratio does not matter because fiscal space is already effectively zero.

To capture this possibility, we consider a measure of fiscal space that has much in common with
                                                                                                          20


our smoothed measure of monetary policy space. Specifically, we let fiscal space be a nonlinear

function of the debt-to-GDP ratio, using a cumulative normal distribution with a given mean

and standard deviation for the functional form. As before, we multiply the measure by −1, so

that a larger number corresponds to more space. Though we consider various means and

standard deviations, the main case we consider with this measure sets the mean and standard

deviation at the mean and standard deviation of the debt-to-GDP ratio for our sample. These

parameters imply that at a debt-to-GDP ratio of roughly 130 percent, fiscal policy space has

essentially reached its lowest possible value. 12

     A factor in addition to debt loads that may affect some countries’ ability to use fiscal policy

is the European Union’s Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), which limits the allowable deficits and

debt levels of its members. Although the enforcement of the SGP rules is far from complete, the

rules may nonetheless affect the fiscal policy response to financial distress. We therefore also

consider specifications that include two measures of fiscal space rather than one. In these cases,

the second measure is a dummy variable for not being subject to the SGP. Concretely, it is a

dummy equal to 0 for members of the European Union starting in 1999:1 (when the main SGP

rules went into effect) and 1 otherwise. 13

     Specification and Results. Armed with these measures of fiscal space, we can test

whether the output consequences of financial distress depend on a country’s ability to use fiscal

policy. To do this, we estimate equation (2) using a measure of fiscal policy space as the S

variable. That is, we regress real GDP at various horizons on distress at time t, also including

12 Note that although we end up considering similar nonlinear functions as variants of our baseline
measures for both monetary and fiscal space, the routes by which we get there are different. Our baseline
measure of monetary policy space (a dummy variable that switches from 0 to 1 at a policy interest rate of
1.25 percent) is a highly nonlinear function of the interest rate. We then consider the cumulative normal
as a less extreme form of this nonlinear function. In contrast, for fiscal policy space, our baseline measure
is a linear function of the debt-to-GDP ratio. We then consider the cumulative normal as a nonlinear
variation on the linear baseline.
13 One limitation to this additional measure of fiscal space is that in our sample, being subject to the SGP

is correlated with other factors affecting the aftermath of financial distress. Most notably, the countries
that faced high sovereign risk spreads following the 2008 global financial crisis, and that in some cases
required bailouts that were conditional on severe austerity, were generally subject to the SGP. Since those
factors likely worsened the aftermath of the crisis in those countries, estimates of the impact of the SGP
are likely to be biased toward overstating any negative effect of the SGP.
                                                                                                            21


the interaction of distress and fiscal space (which, as mentioned before is based on debt figures

for the previous calendar year). Paralleling our approach to monetary policy, we also include

the level of fiscal space (as well as lags of all variables). As described above, we use the negative

of the gross-debt-to-GDP ratio as our baseline measure of fiscal policy space.

     The estimates indicate that fiscal policy space also matters greatly.                   The estimated

coefficient on the fiscal policy space interaction term is strongly positive and highly statistically

significant for all horizons after horizon 0 (with t-statistics ranging from 2.8 to 4.1). That is, as

the debt-to-GDP ratio falls (so fiscal space rises), the aftermath of financial distress is better.

     Figure 6 summarizes the results by showing the impulse response function to a realization

in distress of 7 with and without fiscal space. Because the fiscal policy space variable entered in

the regression is continuous, for this reporting exercise it is less obvious than with the monetary

policy space dummy variable what the two categories correspond to. For convenience, we define

“without fiscal space” as corresponding to a value of the debt-to-GDP ratio one standard

deviation above the sample average, and “with fiscal policy space” as corresponding to a value of

the debt-t0-GDP ratio one standard deviation below the sample average. The mean level of the

gross debt-to-GDP ratio in our sample is 61.4, and the standard deviation is 34.9. Thus, the

results for without fiscal space are for a debt-to-GDP ratio of roughly 96 percent, and those for

with space are for a debt ratio of about 27 percent.14

     The figure shows that the aftermath of a financial crisis when a country has fiscal policy

space is remarkably mild indeed. The fall in GDP with fiscal space is just 1.4 percent. The fall in

GDP following a crisis without fiscal space reaches a maximum of 8.1 percent. At nearly all

horizons, the two-standard-error confidence intervals for the two responses do not overlap.

     A case that exemplifies the importance of the fiscal policy space interaction effect is Italy

following the 2008 crisis. Italy began the crisis with a gross debt-to-GDP ratio of almost exactly


14 The impulse response function for without fiscal policy space is thus the sequence of the estimates of
β i – 96 · δ i . The impulse response function for with fiscal policy space is the sequence of the estimates of
β i – 27 · δ i .
                                                                                                      22


100 percent—just slightly more than one standard deviation above the average for our sample.

So its fiscal space was quite limited. We again construct two forecast errors for this episode:

one is based on our parameter estimates from equation (2) and so includes the interaction

effect, and the other is from a specification that excludes the interaction terms.

     The results are shown in Figure 7. As in Figure 3, the simple forecast error is large and

negative after the 2008 crisis. But, when we account for Italy’s lack of fiscal space, the forecast

errors are roughly zero. Virtually all of Italy’s large negative forecast errors in this episode go

away when we take into account the fact that Italy had little fiscal space, and low fiscal space is

typically associated with worse outcomes following a crisis.

     Robustness. These results for the importance of fiscal space are highly robust. For

example, using the net debt-to-GDP ratio (multiplied by −1) instead of the gross debt ratio, the

estimated coefficients on the interaction term are positive and highly significant at all horizons.

A lower debt ratio (which corresponds to more fiscal space) is associated with a milder

aftermath.    In this case, the fall in GDP following a crisis without fiscal space reaches a

maximum of 8.8 percent. The fall in GDP following a crisis when there is fiscal space is 1.6

percent. 15

     Similarly, when we replace the simple gross debt-to-GDP ratio with the nonlinear function

described above, the maximum decline in GDP without fiscal space is 8.8 percent and 0.8 with. 16

The estimated coefficient on the interaction term is again consistently positive, and the t-

statistic is over 3 for horizons 2 to 10.

     Another alternative specification of fiscal policy space includes both the (negative) gross

debt-to-GDP ratio and a dummy variable equal to 1 if the country is not subject to the European



15 Paralleling our approach for the gross debt-to-GDP ratio, in summarizing the results for the net debt
ratio we define without fiscal policy space as corresponding to a net debt-to-GDP ratio one standard
deviation (44.6) above the sample mean (29.8), and with fiscal space as corresponding to a net debt ratio
one standard deviation below the mean. Importantly, as before, the fiscal space variable itself is
continuous in the estimation.
16 Because the nonlinear function is based on gross debt, we again define with and without fiscal policy

space in terms of a gross debt-to-GDP ratio one standard deviation below or above the sample mean.
                                                                                                 23


Union’s Stability and Growth Pact. In this specification, we include not only the two interaction

terms, but also the level of both measures of fiscal space and the relevant lag terms. The

estimated coefficients on the interaction term for the non-SGP variable suggest that the output

decline following an impulse of 7 to distress when a country is not subject to the SGP is about 1

to 2.5 percentage points smaller at most horizons than when it is subject to the SGP. At the

same time, the effect is not statistically significant at any horizon. Importantly, including this

auxiliary indicator of fiscal policy space has little impact on either the magnitude or the

statistical significance of the estimated interaction effect involving our primary measure of fiscal

space (the negative of the gross debt-to-GDP ratio).

     Finally, returning to just our primary measure of fiscal policy space, we also experiment

with excluding certain countries from the sample. For example, it is natural to worry that

Greece plays an outsized role in the estimates. Greece began its 2009 crisis with a very high

debt-to-GDP ratio and has done abysmally. But, while the difference in aftermaths with and

without fiscal space is less dramatic when Greece is excluded, it is still large. The fall in GDP

following a crisis in cases without fiscal space reaches a maximum of 5.7 percent; the fall in GDP

in cases with fiscal space is 2.8 percent. The estimated coefficient on the interaction term,

however, is only significant for short horizons.


C. Combining Both Types of Policy Space

     The obvious extension to consider is to include interactions with both types of macropolicy

space.

     Specification and Results.          In this case, we expand equation (2) to include two

interaction terms. That is, we regress output at various horizons on financial distress at time t,

including interactions both between distress and monetary policy space and between distress

and fiscal policy space. We also include the level of both types of policy space. We focus on our

two baseline measures of policy space: the dummy variable for whether the policy interest rate

is above 1.25 percent and the (negative) gross debt-to-GDP ratio.
                                                                                                      24


     The results on the importance of policy space are slightly stronger for the two types of

policy together than for each separately. Figure 8 summarizes the results. The figure shows the

response of output to a moderate financial crisis (an impulse of 7 in our new measure of

financial distress) for two cases—with both types of policy space and without either type. 17 The

striking finding is just how small the negative aftermath of a financial crisis is when a country

has both types of policy space. The fall in GDP after a crisis is less than 1 percent and not

significantly different from zero. It also goes away completely after 3½ years. On the other

hand, being without either type of space is associated with a large and significantly negative

aftermath. The fall in GDP following a crisis when there is not policy space is almost 10 percent.

The confidence intervals for the two responses do not overlap at any horizon after horizon 0.

     In the specification with these two measures of policy space, the estimated coefficients on

both interaction terms are positive and substantial. Their relative sizes indicate that at most

horizons, about two-thirds of the overall difference between the output decline with and without

policy space shown in Figure 8 is due to fiscal policy space, and one-third to monetary policy

space. In addition, the estimated coefficients on the interaction term for monetary policy space

are only marginally significant, while those for fiscal policy space are strongly so. This could

indicate that fiscal policy space is somewhat more important.

     Robustness. This last finding is not particularly robust. For some measures of space and

samples of countries, the estimated interaction effects for monetary policy space appear more

important than those for fiscal policy space. For example, for the baseline measures of space in

the sample excluding Greece, the interaction of financial distress and monetary policy space

enters more strongly and significantly than the interaction with fiscal policy space. At the other

extreme, in some specifications (such as that including the more complicated treatment of the

euro area), the estimated coefficient on the monetary policy space interaction term is

17 In this way of summarizing the results, we define without policy space to correspond to a value of the

dummy variable for monetary policy space of 0 and a debt-to-GDP ratio one standard deviation above the
mean, and with policy space to correspond to a value of the dummy variable of 1 and a gross debt-to-GDP
ratio of one standard deviation below the mean.
                                                                                                       25


insignificant, and that on the fiscal policy space interaction term is even larger and more

significant.

      What is robust is that when interactions with both types of space are included, the

aftermath of a crisis is much worse without space than with. This is true across all combinations

of measures of monetary and fiscal policy space, and when various potentially unusual countries

are excluded.

     Forecasting Exercise. To get a sense of how much of the variation in the aftermaths of

financial crises can be accounted for by the interactions with policy space, we do a forecasting

exercise similar to those shown for individual countries in Figures 5 and 7. However, in this

case, we analyze the forecast errors for output following all nineteen episodes when distress

reached 7, and compare the forecasts excluding the interaction terms with ones that include the

interactions of distress and the baseline measures of both monetary and fiscal policy space. In

both the simple forecast and the forecast taking into account the interactions, we include the

level of the two policy space variables. In forming the forecasts, we use actual output data up

through one half-year before distress reached 7, and financial distress, policy space, and the

interaction terms up through the half-year distress reached that benchmark.

     A way of summarizing the results is to compare the variance of the forecast errors at

different horizons from the specifications without and with the policy interaction terms for all

nineteen episodes together. In the half-year when distress first reached 7, the variances of the

forecast errors are roughly equal.       After that, including the interaction terms reduces the

variance of the forecast errors substantially. After 1½ years, the variance of the forecast errors

including the policy space interaction terms is about 20 percent smaller than that of the forecast

errors without the interaction terms; after five years, it is 30 percent smaller. 18 This finding

suggests that differences in policy space across countries and episodes explain a substantial

fraction of the observed variation in the aftermaths of crises.

18If in forming the forecast without the interaction effects, we also exclude the levels of the two policy
space variables, the difference is slightly larger.
                                                                                                                                                      26


III. MECHANISMS BY WHICH MACROPOLICY SPACE MATTERS

      Having found that macropolicy space is important, the obvious next question is why. What

are the mechanisms by which policy space makes the decline in output following a financial

crisis smaller? The most obvious possibility is that policymakers use policy more aggressively to

respond to crises and the recessions that follow when they have policy space.                                                                     Another

possibility is that financial distress itself is less persistent when there is policy space.

      To see if policymakers use policy more aggressively when there is policy space, we run

panel regressions similar to those in Section II. But, in place of output on the left-hand side, we

use an indicator of policy as the dependent variable. We run the regressions separately for

monetary and fiscal policy, and assume that monetary policy space is the relevant interaction for

the monetary policy response, and fiscal policy space is the relevant interaction for the fiscal

policy response. Similarly, to test whether financial distress is less persistent when there is

policy space, we run a final set of panel regressions. We put distress on the left-hand side and

estimate how the response of distress to itself varies with policy space.


A. The Monetary Policy Response

      First, we consider the response of monetary policy to financial distress when countries do

and do not have monetary policy space.

      Data and Specification. Our focal measure of monetary policy is the change in the

policy interest rate. Our question is whether the change in the policy rate following financial

distress is greater if the country has monetary policy space. The particular specification that we

estimate is:


(3)                             𝑟𝑟𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡+𝑖𝑖 − 𝑟𝑟𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−1 = 𝛼𝛼𝑗𝑗𝑖𝑖 + 𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖 + 𝜗𝜗 𝑖𝑖 𝑆𝑆𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 + 𝛽𝛽 𝑖𝑖 𝐹𝐹𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 + 𝛿𝛿 𝑖𝑖 (𝐹𝐹𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 ∙ 𝑆𝑆𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 )
                                                                                                                                             𝑖𝑖
           + ∑4𝑘𝑘=1 𝜌𝜌𝑘𝑘𝑖𝑖 𝑆𝑆𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 + ∑4𝑘𝑘=1 𝜑𝜑𝑘𝑘𝑖𝑖 𝐹𝐹𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 + ∑4𝑘𝑘=1 𝜔𝜔𝑘𝑘𝑖𝑖 (𝐹𝐹𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 ∙ 𝑆𝑆𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 ) + ∑4𝑘𝑘=1 𝜃𝜃𝑘𝑘𝑖𝑖 ∆𝑟𝑟𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 + 𝑒𝑒𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 ,


where r j ,t+i is the nominal policy interest rate for country j at time t+i. Fj,t is again financial

distress in country j at time t, Sj,t is a measure of monetary policy space for country j at time t,
                                                                                                     27


and the α’s and γ’s are country and time fixed effects. Thus we regress the change in the policy

rate from t−1 to t+i on financial distress at time t and the interaction between distress and

monetary policy space (also at t). We estimate equation (3) for horizons 0 to 10. Because the

dependent variable is the change in the policy rate from t−1 to t+i, the estimated β i ’s and δ i ’s for

the successive horizons show effects on the cumulative change in the policy rate.

     As an alternative measure of monetary policy, we use the level of the policy rate (as

opposed to the change). For this specification, the dependent variable is just r j ,t+i, and the

appropriate control variables on the right-hand-side are the lagged levels of the policy rate

rather than the lagged changes. In this specification, the lagged values of the policy rate capture

longer-run patterns of mean reversion (such as the fact that deliberate monetary contractions to

reduce inflation eventually end). This is a disadvantage to the extent that the mean reversion in

policy rates is different following financial crises than in more normal periods. In contrast, in

the baseline specification, the lagged values of the change in the policy rate capture only

relatively high-frequency mean reversion.

     In our baseline estimates, we use as our measure of monetary policy space the simple

dummy variable for whether the policy interest rate was above 1.25 percent at the end of the

previous half-year. We also consider other measures, such as the dummy variable that also

codes participation in the euro area as being without monetary policy space.

     Countries often raise policy rates somewhat in the run-up to severe financial distress to try

to defend the exchange rate or to attempt to cool off asset price bubbles. However, the case of

Turkey in 2000 is particularly extreme. Turkey raised its policy rate to such heights that it was

able to cut its policy interest rate 120 percentage points when the financial crisis hit. Such an

extreme move will likely drive any estimate of the response of policy rates to financial distress.

For this reason, we think the most informative sample excludes Turkey. However, we also

report the results for the full sample.

     Results. When we estimate equation (3) using our baseline measure of monetary policy
                                                                                                 28


space and the sample that excludes Turkey, the estimated coefficient on the interaction term is

negative as expected, highly significant at horizons 1 to 5, and solidly significant at longer

horizons. Figure 9 shows the response of the policy interest rate to a realization of the financial

distress variable of 7 when a country does and does not have monetary policy space. When a

country does have monetary space, the policy rate falls 1.9 percentage points (and much of that

decline happens very quickly). When it does not have space, the policy rate actually rises

slightly, though the rise is not statistically significant.

     If one looks at what happened to the policy interest rate in episodes of acute financial

distress, the difference is more pronounced. In virtually all of those, it looks as if monetary

policy responds strongly to financial crises if the country has space, and essentially not at all

when it does not.

     Panel A of Figure 10 shows two cases where policymakers began a crisis with ample

monetary policy space. One is the United States in 1990, when there was substantial financial

distress related to the savings and loan crisis and other problems in the banking sector. The

other is Finland in 1993. To aid in the interpretation, we show the measure of financial distress

as well as the policy interest rate. The figure shows that the policy interest rate dropped

dramatically in both cases.

     Panel B shows two cases where monetary policy space was limited at least partway through

the period of high distress. One is Japan following its acute distress in 1997. Notice that the

policy rate could not fall at all despite very severe distress. The other is Portugal after the 2008

crisis. Portugal and the other countries of southern Europe suffered significant distress after the

ECB had already hit the zero lower bound. As a result, the policy rate had nowhere further to

fall, even though distress remained very high.

     Robustness. The results are similar to those in the baseline when other measures of

monetary policy space are used. For example, when a dummy variable equal to 1 if the policy

rate is above 1.25 percent and the country is not in the euro area is used as the measure of
                                                                                                 29


monetary policy space, the estimated coefficient on the interaction term is again highly

significant at all horizons after horizon 0. The response of the policy rate following a crisis is a

maximum decline of 2.1 percentage points when there is policy space, and a small and

insignificant rise when there is not.

     On the other hand, returning to the simple dummy as the measure of monetary policy

space, but using the level of the policy rate rather than the change, weakens the results

substantially.   The estimated coefficient on the interaction between financial distress and

monetary policy space is generally negative, but never statistically significant. At short horizons,

the decline in the policy rate in response to an impulse of 7 in financial distress is about a

percentage point greater when there is space than when there is not. However, at longer

horizons the difference is trivial.     The source of the similarity between the two responses

appears to be that in this specification, much of the decline in the policy rate during crises when

there is policy space is attributed to normal longer-run mean reversion or soaked up by the time

fixed effects. As discussed above, however, the forces driving mean reversion in normal times

are unlikely to be very relevant to the monetary policy response to financial distress.

     Our baseline sample for this analysis excludes Turkey. Not surprisingly, including Turkey

in the sample strengthens the results dramatically. The estimated coefficient on the monetary

policy space interaction term is strongly negative, with a t-statistic over 3 at all horizons after

horizon 0. The maximum decline in the policy interest rate in response to an impulse to

financial distress of 7 is 0.5 percentage point where there is not monetary policy space, and 9.5

percentage points when there is.


C. The Fiscal Policy Response

     Now consider the response of fiscal policy to financial distress when countries do and do

not have fiscal space.

     Data and Specification. Fiscal policy data are again a challenge. As described in the

data appendix, annual data on the actual budget surplus are available from the IMF and the
                                                                                                                                                                30


OECD for most countries back to 1980. But for advanced countries, where tax revenues and

some types of government spending fluctuate strongly with economic activity, the change in the

actual surplus can be a very misleading measure of fiscal policy.                                                                Unfortunately, official

estimates of the high-employment surplus (that is, the actual budget surplus abstracting from

automatic stabilizers) are typically not available before 2000.

         As a crude proxy for the change in the high-employment surplus as a share of GDP, we

start with the change in the actual surplus as a share of GDP over some horizon, and then

subtract the product of an estimate of the sensitivity of the fiscal balance to the output gap and

the change in the logarithm of real GDP over the same horizon. What this procedure does is to

take out any change in the surplus coming just from the effect of faster or slower than normal

growth on tax revenues and government spending. We use as our estimate of the relevant

sensitivity 0.4, which is a lower-bound estimate of the responsiveness of the fiscal balance to the

output gap for our sample of OECD countries. 19

         We then regress our proxy for the change in the high-employment surplus as a share of

GDP over various horizons after time t on financial distress and the interaction between distress

and fiscal policy space, both at time t. The specific equation we estimate is:


(4)                �𝐵𝐵𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡+𝑖𝑖 − 𝐵𝐵𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−1 � − 𝜏𝜏 ∙ (𝑦𝑦𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡+𝑖𝑖 − 𝑦𝑦𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−1 ) = 𝛼𝛼𝑗𝑗𝑖𝑖 + 𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖 + 𝜗𝜗 𝑖𝑖 𝑆𝑆𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 + 𝛽𝛽 𝑖𝑖 𝐹𝐹𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 + 𝛿𝛿 𝑖𝑖 (𝐹𝐹𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 ∙ 𝑆𝑆𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 )
                                                                                                                                                              𝑖𝑖
      + ∑4𝑘𝑘=1 𝜌𝜌𝑘𝑘𝑖𝑖 𝑆𝑆𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 + ∑4𝑘𝑘=1 𝜑𝜑𝑘𝑘𝑖𝑖 𝐹𝐹𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 + ∑4𝑘𝑘=1 𝜔𝜔𝑘𝑘𝑖𝑖 (𝐹𝐹𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 ∙ 𝑆𝑆𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 ) + ∑4𝑘𝑘=1 𝜃𝜃𝑘𝑘𝑖𝑖 (∆𝐵𝐵𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 − 𝜏𝜏 ∙ ∆𝑦𝑦𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 ) + 𝑒𝑒𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 ,


where Bj,t+i is the actual budget surplus in country j in t+i, τ is the assumed sensitivity of the

surplus to the output gap, and Sj,t is a measure of fiscal policy space for country j at time t. The

rest of the notation is as before. We include as controls lags of our proxy for the change in the




19Girouard and André (2005) report the change in the surplus-to-GDP ratio in response to a rise of 1
percentage point in the difference between actual and potential GDP for most OECD countries for three
years (1996, 2000, and 2003) based on the associated tax codes and other evidence about the cyclical
behavior of each country’s tax base and unemployment rate. For the 23 countries in our sample for which
they provide an estimate (Turkey is not included in their study), the average across the three years is 0.45.
                                                                                                                                                     31


high-employment surplus (the ∆𝐵𝐵𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 − 𝜏𝜏 ∙ ∆𝑦𝑦𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 terms). 20 We estimate the regression over

horizons 0 to 10 using the full sample of countries. As with the change in the policy interest

rate, because the dependent variable is the change in the high-employment surplus from t−1 to

t+i, the estimated βi ’s and δi ’s for the successive horizons show effects on the cumulative change

in the high-employment surplus.

        Given that our approach to estimating the high-employment surplus is inherently

imperfect, we also consider a specification that uses just the level of the actual budget surplus

(as a share of GDP) as the dependent variable. In this case, we include lags of the actual surplus

as control variables.

        In our baseline estimates, we use the negative ratio of gross debt to GDP as our measure of

fiscal policy space. As robustness checks, we consider the various alternatives described in

Section II. For example, we also use the more complicated specification of fiscal space that

includes both the negative of the gross debt ratio and a dummy variable for whether a country is

not subject to the European Union’s Stability and Growth Pact.

        One complication in the analysis of the fiscal policy response is that the surplus data are

only available annually. To maintain the parallel with the monetary policy regressions, we

convert the surplus data to semiannual by simply repeating the annual observation for both

observations in a year. As an alternative, we also run the regressions using annual observations

for all variables. 21 In the annual specification, we include two lags of all variables as controls.

The measure of fiscal space is the (negative) gross debt-to-GDP ratio in the previous year.


20  Throughout, we multiply the sensitivity parameter by the change in output, rather than by an estimate
of the change in the output gap. The reason is that the product of a country’s normal GDP growth and the
sensitivity parameter is constant over time, and so is captured by the fixed effect for the country. That is,
we can rewrite 𝜏𝜏 ∙ [�𝑦𝑦𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡+𝑖𝑖 − 𝑦𝑦�𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡+𝑖𝑖 � − �𝑦𝑦𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−1 − 𝑦𝑦�𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−1 �] as 𝜏𝜏 ∙ �𝑦𝑦𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡+𝑖𝑖 − 𝑦𝑦𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−1 � − 𝜏𝜏 ∙ �𝑦𝑦�𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡+𝑖𝑖 − 𝑦𝑦�𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−1 � = 𝜏𝜏 ∙
�𝑦𝑦𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡+𝑖𝑖 − 𝑦𝑦𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−1 � − 𝜏𝜏 ∙ (𝑖𝑖 + 1) ∙ 𝑔𝑔𝑗𝑗 , where 𝑦𝑦�𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 is potential output in country j at time t and gj is normal growth
(per half-year) in country j. Since 𝜏𝜏 ∙ (𝑖𝑖 + 1) ∙ 𝑔𝑔𝑗𝑗 does not vary over time within a country, subtracting it
from the left-hand side variable would only affect the estimates of the country fixed effects. Leaving it out
therefore does not affect the estimates of the key coefficient of interest, δi, and allows us to avoid having to
estimate trend growth for each country.
21 We convert real GDP and our financial distress variable to annual by averaging the semiannual

     Results. The results are remarkably clear-cut. When we use our baseline specification

and measure of fiscal policy space, the estimated interaction effect is consistently negative—

indicating that the high-employment surplus falls more following distress when there is fiscal

space. The interaction effect is also highly statistically significant: the t-statistic is above 3.5 at

eight horizons, and always above 2.5.

     Figure 11 summarizes the results by showing the cumulative change in the high-

employment surplus (as a share of GDP) following a realization of distress of 7 in countries with

and without fiscal space. Countries with space (which, for the purpose of the figure, we again

define as having a gross debt-to-GDP ratio one standard deviation below the mean) cut their

high-employment surplus as a share of GDP by a maximum of 3.5 percentage points in response

to a financial crisis. That is, they engage in substantial fiscal expansion. Countries without

space (which we again define as having a gross debt-to-GDP ratio one standard deviation above

the mean) actually raise their high-employment surplus (as a share of GDP) by even more. The

maximum rise is 4.1 percentage points. That is, they have substantial fiscal contraction.

     Given the history of countries with high debt facing financial crises, this finding is not as

surprising as it might seem. Countries with high debt are often forced into fiscal consolidations

after a financial crisis because deteriorating conditions swell their actual deficits, and investor

nervousness makes it hard for them to borrow. This difference in fiscal policy could clearly go a

long way toward explaining why countries without fiscal space have so much worse outcomes

than countries with space.

     If one looks at what happened to the high-employment surplus in key episodes, the

relationship between the fiscal policy response and fiscal space is obvious. Panel A of Figure 12

shows what happened to our estimate of the high-employment surplus in two cases with fiscal

space. 22 Again, we also show our measure of financial distress. One case is Norway following its


22Since our measure is defined in terms of changes, we need to choose a base period. In each episode, the
base period is set two half-years before financial distress reached 7. In addition, in contrast to when we
estimate equation (4), where each country’s trend growth is subsumed in the country fixed effect, to
                                                                                                         33


severe financial distress in 1991; the other is the United Kingdom after the 2008 crisis. Each

country began its crisis with a gross debt-to-GDP ratio substantially below the OECD average.

And each country had substantial declines in the high-employment surplus as a share of GDP.

     Panel B shows what happened to fiscal policy in two cases where the country experienced

financial distress starting with little fiscal space: Japan in 1997 and Italy in 2008. Each country

began its crisis episode with a gross debt-to-GDP ratio very close to 100 percent. In both cases,

the high-employment surplus rose following distress.

     Not surprisingly, the most extreme example of this pattern is Greece in recent years.

Greece began its extreme financial distress in 2009 with a gross debt-to-GDP ratio of 109

percent. Greece’s high-employment surplus as a share of GDP fell somewhat over the first year,

but then swung strongly positive. Our estimate of the rise in its high-employment surplus

surpassed 15 percent of GDP after three years.23 This extreme move to fiscal contraction was

obviously not a choice, but rather a condition for the coordinated IMF and euro area bailout.

     Robustness. The finding that fiscal policy is used much more aggressively in response to

financial distress when there is fiscal policy space is very robust. For example, when we use the

level of the actual surplus in place of our rough measure of the change in the high-employment

surplus, the estimated interaction effect is still negative and highly significant at horizons up to

two years after financial distress.      The maximum decline in the surplus (as a share of GDP)

when there is space is 4.0 percentage points. When there is not space, the actual surplus rises




actually form estimates of the change in the high-employment surplus we need an explicit measure of
trend growth by country. We use each country’s average growth over our full sample period, 1980:1–
2015:2.
23 Since this number is very large, it is perhaps useful to describe what in the procedure gives rise to it.

From a year before its financial distress reached 7 to three years after, Greece’s actual surplus rose by
roughly 4 percent of GDP (from −10.2 percent to −6.5 percent). In addition, using the change in
logarithms, actual GDP fell by 27 percent; since Greece’s average growth over our sample period is
roughly 0.8 percent per year, our approach implies that the difference between actual and potential
output fell by about 30 percentage points. Our sensitivity parameter of 0.4 then implies that this change
reduced the actual surplus relative to the high-employment surplus by about 12 percent of GDP. Thus, we
estimate an overall swing in the high-employment surplus of 16 percent of GDP. Although one can
imagine various refinements of this calculation, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the swing was
enormous.
                                                                                                           34


by a maximum of 0.9 percentage point. 24 That the difference between the two responses is

smaller when the actual surplus is used is hardly surprising. The actual surplus naturally tends

to fall after financial distress because output falls; because the output declines are larger in

countries with less fiscal space, this effect is larger in those countries. What is perhaps more

surprising is that the fiscal space interaction effect is so strongly negative that for countries

without fiscal space, even the actual surplus rises following a crisis.

     Returning to the change in the high-employment surplus as the measure of fiscal policy,

using broader measures of fiscal space yields very similar results to the baseline.                      One

interesting case measures fiscal space using both the continuous gross debt-to-GDP ratio

(multiplied by −1) and a dummy variable equal to 1 if a country is not subject to the European

Union’s Stability and Growth Pact. Because the SGP puts nominal limits on deficits, it is

possible that is has a direct bearing on the ability of EU countries to use fiscal policy to respond

to crises. In this specification, both estimated interaction effects are negative, implying that in

each case more space is associated with larger cuts in the high-employment surplus. The

negative interaction effect for the debt ratio continues to be highly significant at all horizons,

with a t-statistic over 5 at a number of horizons. The negative interaction effect for not being

subject to the SGP is generally not statistically significant at short horizons, but is strongly

significant at horizons of two years or more. This could suggest that the pact has some effect on

the ability of member countries to respond aggressively to financial crises with fiscal stimulus. 25

     Estimating equation (4) using annual data and two lags of all the control variables, if




24 The measure of fiscal policy space is again the negative of the gross debt-to-GDP ratio. For this

summary, we again define with fiscal policy space as corresponding to a debt ratio one standard deviation
below the sample mean, and without fiscal policy space as corresponding to a debt ratio one standard
deviation above the mean.
25 Importantly, as discussed above, these estimates may not reflect a causal impact of the SGP. Consider

Greece following the 2008 global financial crisis, for example. It was subject to the SGP, and so the large
increase in its high-employment surplus contributes to the estimate of a negative coefficient on the
interaction effect for not being subject to the SGP. But in fact, Greece’s large fiscal contraction appears to
have been the result mainly of a loss in market confidence and conditions imposed as part of its bailout
package, and not of the fact that it was subject to the SGP.
                                                                                                  35


anything, strengthens the results. 26 The estimated interaction effect is again negative—implying

that the high-employment surplus falls more when there is more fiscal space—and highly

significant. The maximum fall in the annual high-employment surplus is 4.9 percentage points

when there is fiscal space. When there is not fiscal space, the annual high-employment surplus

rises by a maximum of 4.1 percentage points.

     Finally, the behavior of fiscal policy in Greece following its 2009 crisis was so extreme that

it is natural to worry that it might be driving the regression results. For this reason, we consider

the sample that excludes Greece. In this case, the estimated coefficient on the interaction term

is still negative and highly significant at horizons up to four half-years. When the impulse

response function is evaluated at a debt-to-GDP ratio one standard deviation below the mean

and one standard deviation above the mean, the difference between the two is smaller than

when the full sample of countries is used, but still large in an absolute sense. The maximum

decline in the high-employment surplus when there is fiscal space in the sample excluding

Greece is 3.0 percentage points. When there is not fiscal space, the maximum rise in the high-

employment surplus is 2.1 percentage points.


C. The Persistence of Financial Distress

     Taken together, the results for monetary and fiscal policy strongly suggest that a key

mechanism by which policy space influences the aftermath of crises is through the policy

response. A possibly related mechanism has to do with the nature of the financial distress itself.

In Romer and Romer (2017), we show that one can explain much of the variation in the

aftermaths of crises with the severity and persistence of distress. That is, outcomes are worse

when distress is worse or more long-lasting. But in some sense, that finding just pushes the

mystery back a step. Why is some financial distress worse and more long-lasting than others?

     Policy space could play a role. It could be that policy space allows for policy that stabilizes

26The measure of fiscal policy is the annual analogue of our rough estimate of the high-employment
surplus, and the measure of fiscal policy space is the negative of the gross debt-to-GDP ratio in the
previous year.
                                                                                                                                36


output, and restoring growth helps heal the financial system. A more direct role could be that

fiscal policy space allows countries to bail out their financial systems, and so reduce distress; or,

monetary policy space allows the central bank to flood the financial system with liquidity more

easily, and so lower distress that way. Finally, perhaps the very existence of policy space is good

for confidence. Distress may not grow or persist because people know the government can

intervene if necessary.

      Specification. To look at this linkage, we regress financial distress at various horizons

after time t on distress at t, including an interaction term with policy space. As before, we also

include the level of policy space. That is, we estimate:


(5)                          𝐹𝐹𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡+𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼𝑗𝑗𝑖𝑖 + 𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖 + 𝜗𝜗 𝑖𝑖 𝑆𝑆𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 + 𝛽𝛽 𝑖𝑖 𝐹𝐹𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 + 𝛿𝛿 𝑖𝑖 (𝐹𝐹𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 ∙ 𝑆𝑆𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 )
                                                                                                                       𝑖𝑖
                  + ∑4𝑘𝑘=1 𝜌𝜌𝑘𝑘𝑖𝑖 𝑆𝑆𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 + ∑𝑘𝑘=1
                                                4
                                                     𝜑𝜑𝑘𝑘𝑖𝑖 𝐹𝐹𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 + ∑4𝑘𝑘=1 𝜔𝜔𝑘𝑘𝑖𝑖 (𝐹𝐹𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 ∙ 𝑆𝑆𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 ) + 𝑒𝑒𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 ,


where Fj, t+i is financial distress in country j at time t+i, and Sj,t is a measure of policy space. In

our baseline specification, we include separate interaction terms between both distress and

monetary policy space and distress and fiscal policy space. In this specification, we include the

levels of both space variables (as well as all the relevant lags as control variables). We estimate

equation (5) over horizons 1 to 10 for the full sample of countries. The response of financial

distress to itself with and without policy space can show whether the existence of policy space

makes distress less persistent.

      We again use as our baseline measure of monetary policy space the dummy variable equal

to 1 if the policy rate at the end of the previous half-year was greater than 1.25 percent. Our

baseline measure of fiscal policy space is the (negative) gross debt-to-GDP ratio. We test the

robustness of the results to different measures of policy space and to samples that exclude

potential outliers.

      Results. We find strong evidence that financial distress is less persistent when there is

policy space. The estimated coefficients on the interaction terms with both types of space are
                                                                                                       37


generally negative—indicating that distress dies out more quickly when there is space. For both

monetary and fiscal policy space, the coefficients on the interaction terms range from

insignificant to solidly significant. To the degree that there is a difference in the estimated

interaction effects, the monetary policy space interaction appears more important at short

horizons (but actually turns positive at longer horizons), while the fiscal policy interaction

appears stronger (and remains negative) at longer horizons.

     To give a sense of magnitudes, Figure 13 shows the response of financial distress to a

substantial innovation in distress (a 7 on our scale) with and without policy space. 27               An

innovation in financial distress dies off much more quickly when there is policy space. Without

either monetary or fiscal space, after 2½ years the initial 7 has fallen only to 4.4; with both types

of policy space, it has fallen to 1.8. The initial impulse is completely gone after three years when

there is policy space, but some distress remains even after five years when there is not.

     If one looks at the behavior of financial distress in key episodes, there is a clear relationship

between the persistence of distress and policy space. Panel A of Figure 14 shows financial

distress in two cases where the country had both monetary and fiscal policy space: Sweden in

1993 and Iceland in 2008. Each country entered its episode of financial distress with a policy

interest rate well above the zero lower bound and a gross debt-to-GDP ratio substantially below

the OECD average. In Sweden, the distress was resolved almost immediately; in Iceland, it

spiked to a very high level but then dissipated fairly rapidly. Panel B shows financial distress in

two cases where the country experienced high distress starting with little monetary or fiscal

space: Japan in 1997 and Italy in 2008. Each country began its crisis episode with a very low

policy rate and a gross debt-to-GDP ratio close to 100 percent. In both cases, financial distress

remained high for years.

     Robustness. Surprisingly, the results are quite similar to those in the baseline if we

27 As usual, with policy space corresponds to a value of the monetary policy space dummy variable of 1 and

a gross debt-to-GDP ratio one standard deviation below the sample average, and without policy space
corresponds to a value of the monetary policy space dummy of 0 and a gross debt-to-GDP ratio one
standard deviation above the sample average.
                                                                                                  38


estimate equation (5) including only the interaction between distress and monetary policy or

between distress and fiscal policy. The estimated interaction effects when the two policy space

interactions are entered individually are somewhat larger and more precisely estimated than

when the two are entered jointly. As a result, in either of these two alternative specifications, the

impulse response functions with and without policy space are quite similar to those in the

baseline. For example, in the specification with only the interaction with monetary policy space,

an impulse to financial distress of 7 falls to 4.9 after 2½ years when there is not monetary policy

space and 2.2 when there is. In the specification with only the interaction with fiscal policy

space, the difference is more noticeable at shorter horizons. After 2 years, an impulse to distress

of 7 has fallen to 3.9 when there is not fiscal policy space and 1.7 when there is.

      We also consider the effect of using different measures of monetary and fiscal policy space.

For example, we estimate equation (5) using as the measure of monetary policy space the

dummy variable that also takes into account the consequences of being in the euro area, and

using as the measure of fiscal policy space both the (negative) gross debt-to-GDP ratio and the

dummy variable for not being subject to the Stability and Growth Pact. In every case, the

estimated coefficients on the interaction terms are generally negative and frequently significant.

Distress consistently dies off much more slowly when there is not policy space than when there

is.

      Finally, the results are also robust to leaving out possible outliers. Japan and Greece faced

both prolonged financial distress and severe limitations on monetary and fiscal policy space, so

it is possible that they play a large role in the estimates. When we estimate equation (5) using

the baseline measures of both monetary and fiscal policy space but leaving out Japan, the results

are if anything slightly stronger. The estimated interaction effects for both monetary policy

space and fiscal policy space are still predominantly negative and typically significant or nearly

so. After 2½ years, an impulse to distress of 7 has fallen to 4.8 when there is not policy space

and 1.5 when there is. When we do the same exercise but leave out Greece instead, the results
                                                                                                 39


get slightly weaker. In this case, after 2½ years an impulse to distress of 7 has fallen to 3.9 when

there is not space and 2.2 when there is.

     The bottom line of this analysis is that policy space appears to affect the aftermath of

financial crises through various mechanisms. It is correlated both with more aggressive policy

responses and with less persistent financial distress. Both factors are likely to be associated with

less severe post-crisis downturns.


IV. CONCLUSION

     This paper seeks to explain why the aftermath of financial crises varies widely across

episodes—even within a quite homogeneous sample of countries in the postwar period. Our

evidence shows that macroeconomic policy plays a key role.

     Summary. The central finding of the paper is that the aftermath of financial distress is

much worse when a country lacks monetary and fiscal policy space than when it has one or both

of them. Indeed, the estimates suggest that for a country with both types of policy space, the fall

in GDP following a moderate financial crisis is quantitatively small and statistically

indistinguishable from zero. These results are robust to the measures of monetary and fiscal

space used. Moreover, an examination of the forecast errors for output in the nineteen episodes

of significant distress in our sample shows that policy space accounts for a substantial fraction of

the variation in aftermaths that we observe. Some crises appear to be less traumatic than others

because policy is much more able to respond.

     We also investigate the mechanisms by which policy space matters. We find that countries

that experience financial distress with monetary policy space cut their policy interest rate

substantially more than those that face distress with the policy rate already very low. Countries

that experience distress with a relatively low debt-to-GDP ratio cut their high-employment

surplus substantially, while those with a relatively high debt-to-GDP ratio actually run

significantly contractionary fiscal policy. We also find that financial distress itself is more
                                                                                                 40


persistent in countries without macropolicy space than in countries with space. This could be a

manifestation of the inability to use monetary and fiscal policy, or it could be another channel by

which a lack of policy space causes the negative aftermaths of crises to be more severe.

     Possible Policy Implications. The finding that having the ability and will to use

macroeconomic policy to respond to a crisis explains much of the variation we observe in the

aftermaths of crises is at once both unsurprising and radical. It is unsurprising because a vast

number of empirical studies find that both monetary and fiscal policy have important effects on

economic activity. Thus, it is completely sensible that having more policy space and actually

using policy more aggressively is correlated with less severe aftermaths of financial crises.

     The finding is nevertheless radical because much of the literature has stressed the

inexorable negative effects of financial disruptions. That has led many policymakers to think

that the aftermath of crises is out of their hands. Our evidence indicates strongly that this

simply is not true. Policymakers can to a large degree control their country’s fate.

     At the same time, the policy prescriptions suggested by the findings may be hard for

policymakers to follow. Our finding that facing a crisis with monetary and fiscal space is

associated with better outcomes suggests the need for difficult decisions in non-crisis periods if

policymakers want to be able to cushion the effects of future financial crises.            If fiscal

policymakers want to be in a position to pursue fiscal expansion in response to financial crises

and other shocks, they need to eschew persistent budget deficits and maintain relatively low

debt-to-GDP ratios. That is, fiscal policy would need to be highly responsible in good times.

     And perhaps counterintuitively, if monetary policymakers want to be able to combat future

crises, they may need to be a little less responsible in normal times. Very low inflation means

that nominal interest rates tend to be low, so monetary policy space is inherently limited. A

somewhat higher target rate of inflation might actually be the more prudent course of action if

policymakers want to be able to reduce interest rates when needed.

     Our finding that policy space matters substantially through the degree to which policy is
                                                                                                41


used during crises also implies difficult decisions. For example, it is not enough to have ample

fiscal space at the start of a crisis.   For the space to be useful in combating the crisis,

policymakers have to actually enact aggressive fiscal expansion. However, countercyclical fiscal

policy has become so politically controversial that policymakers might refuse to use it the next

time a country faces a crisis.

     One possible way to respond to these challenges is to focus on policy responses that are less

dependent on policy space or less politically controversial. For example, on the fiscal side,

packages that pair short-run increases in the deficit with long-run fiscal consolidations could be

less controversial than simple short-run stimulus, and might be available even to countries with

limited fiscal space. Similarly, budget actions that pay for an increase in government purchases

through increased taxes could provide useful stimulus after a crisis through the balanced-budget

multiplier without increasing debt levels. On the monetary side, it is possible that lender of last

resort policies, quantitative easing, negative policy interest rates, and robust expectations

management could provide short-run expansion even when conventional monetary policy space

is limited.

     Directions for Further Research. One obvious direction for further research involves

the optimal design and effectiveness of such alternative policies. For example, how could

intertemporal fiscal packages be designed so that they are likely to be credible and effective?

Similarly, is there evidence that balanced-budget multipliers are sufficiently large that a

plausible balanced-budget fiscal response to a crisis could have substantial effects? There are

also a wide range of research questions surrounding unconventional monetary policy. For

example, are there steps to enhance credibility or alternatives to conventional inflation targeting

that would make expectations management more effective—and so make it easier for a central

bank to use forward guidance or actions aimed at changing inflation expectations to respond to

a financial crisis?

     Returning to the basic questions of the paper, there are a number of remaining issues. One
                                                                                                    42


involves the appropriate measures of monetary and fiscal policy space. For example, we have

focused most closely on the debt-to-GDP ratio as our indicator of fiscal space. While pre-crisis

debt levels are likely to affect a country’s use of fiscal policy to respond to a crisis even if it did

not have to pay an interest rate premium before the crisis, sovereign interest rate spreads could

provide additional information on borrowing capacity across countries. Likewise, the recent

experience of advanced economies may suggest that the true lower bound on interest rates is

noticeably below zero.

     The treatment of the euro area’s common monetary authority and the European Union’s

fiscal rules also warrant further consideration. For example, given the likelihood of contagion,

what is the best way to model how the European Central Bank is likely to respond to a financial

crisis in a single euro area country? Similarly, are the fiscal rules encompassed in the Stability

and Growth Pact crucial determinants of the fiscal policy response to financial crises in the

European Union, or are those responses primarily driven by ideology and other considerations?

     A related issue concerns our evidence that macroeconomic policy space appears to

influence the aftermath of crises in large part through its impact on the policy response. In the

case of fiscal policy, this finding could reflect policymakers’ beliefs about appropriate fiscal

policy, the impact of fiscal rules, or genuine market constraints on borrowing. To the degree

that the link is not inherent or directly causal, it might suggest that fiscal policy could be used

more broadly to mitigate the negative aftermath of financial distress. Thus, further research on

the nature of this linkage between policy space and the policy response would be desirable.

     Finally, an important limitation of this study is the difficulty of establishing causation more

generally.   Our measure of financial distress itself mixes together exogenous variation in

financial distress and distress resulting from output declines. Likewise, even ex ante policy

space could be correlated with other factors affecting output in the wake of financial distress,

such as effective government or financial regulation. As a result, our findings about the impact

of policy space on the aftermath of financial distress could be contaminated by these other
                                                                                                     43


factors. Whether there might be sources of genuinely exogenous variation that could be used to

more firmly establish a causal relationship is therefore a very useful topic for further research.

Notes: See Romer and Romer (2017) for the details of the derivation of the new measure. The data are
available semiannually from 1967:1 to 2012:2. In the new measure, 0 corresponds to no financial distress;
1, 2, and 3 correspond to gradations of credit disruptions; 4, 5, and 6 to gradations of minor crises; 7, 8,
and 9 to gradations of moderate crises; 10, 11, and 12 to gradations of major crises; and 13, 14, and 15 to
gradations of extreme crises.

Notes: The figure shows the impulse response function for real GDP to an impulse of 7 in our new
measure of financial distress derived from estimating equation (1) for the sample of 24 OECD countries
over the post-1980 period using OLS. The dashed lines show the two-standard-error confidence bands.

Notes: The panels show the forecast errors for real GDP (defined as actual minus forecast) following
episodes of significant financial distress. The dates given are when distress first reached 7 or above. We
estimate equation (1) over the full sample, and then construct forecasts using actual GDP data up through
one half-year before distress reached 7 and actual distress up through when distress reached 7.

Notes: The figure shows the impulse response function for real GDP to an impulse of 7 in our new
measure of financial distress derived from estimating equation (2) for the sample of 24 OECD countries
over the post-1980 period using OLS. The measure of monetary policy space used is a dummy variable
equal to 1 if the policy interest rate is greater than 1.25 percent at the end of the previous half-year. The
“without monetary policy space” line corresponds to a value of the dummy of 0; the “with monetary policy
space” line corresponds to a value of the dummy of 1. The dashed lines show the two-standard-error
confidence bands.

Notes: The figure shows the forecast errors for real GDP (defined as actual minus forecast) following the
financial crisis in Japan. In this episode, financial distress first reached 7 or above in 1997:2. The
measure of monetary policy space used is a dummy variable equal to 1 if the policy interest rate is greater
than 1.25 percent at the end of the previous half-year. The forecast accounting for monetary policy space
is derived by estimating equation (2) over the full sample, and then using actual GDP data up through one
half-year before distress reached 7, and the measure of monetary policy space, the interaction term, and
actual distress up through when distress reached 7. The forecast not accounting for monetary policy space
is derived in the same way, except that the interaction term (both the contemporaneous value and lags)
between monetary policy space and financial distress is omitted from both the equation that is estimated
and the construction of the forecast.

Notes: The figure shows the impulse response function for real GDP to an impulse of 7 in our new
measure of financial distress derived from estimating equation (2) for the sample of 24 OECD countries
over the post-1980 period using OLS. The measure of fiscal policy space used is the (negative) gross debt-
to-GDP ratio in the previous calendar year. The “without fiscal policy space” line corresponds to a value
of the debt-to-GDP ratio one standard deviation above the sample average; the “with fiscal policy space”
line corresponds to a value of the debt-to-GDP ratio one standard deviation below the sample average.
The dashed lines show the two-standard-error confidence bands.

Notes: The figure shows the impulse response function for real GDP to an impulse of 7 in our new
measure of financial distress derived from estimating an expanded version of equation (2) for the sample
of 24 OECD countries over the post-1980 period using OLS. The specification includes interaction and
level effects of both monetary policy space and fiscal policy space (along with the relevant lags). The
measure of monetary policy space used is a dummy variable equal to 1 if the policy interest rate is greater
than 1.25 percent at the end of the previous half-year. The measure of fiscal policy space used is the
(negative) gross debt-to-GDP ratio in the previous calendar year. The “without policy space” line
corresponds to a value of the monetary policy space dummy of 0 and a value of the debt-to-GDP ratio one
standard deviation above the sample average; the “with policy space” line corresponds to a value of the
monetary policy dummy of 1 and a value of the debt-to-GDP ratio one standard deviation below the
sample average. The dashed lines show the two-standard-error confidence bands.

throughout the period of high distress; Panel B shows two examples where monetary policy space was
limited during at least part of the period of high distress. See the text and the data appendix for a

Notes: The figure shows the impulse response function for an estimate of the cumulative change in the
high-employment surplus to an impulse of 7 in our new measure of financial distress derived from
estimating equation (4) for the sample of 24 OECD countries over the post-1980 period using OLS. The
measure of fiscal policy space used is the (negative) gross debt-to-GDP ratio in the previous calendar year.
The “without fiscal policy space” line corresponds to a value of the debt-to-GDP ratio one standard
deviation above the sample average; the “with fiscal policy space” line corresponds to a value of the debt-
to-GDP ratio one standard deviation below the sample average. The dashed lines show the two-standard-
error confidence bands.

       to two half-years before distress reached 7. Panel A shows two examples where fiscal policy space was
       substantial throughout the period of high distress; Panel B shows two examples where fiscal policy space
       was limited during at least part of the period of high distress. See the text and the data appendix for a

Notes: The figure shows the impulse response function for financial distress to an impulse of 7 in itself
derived from estimating equation (5) for the sample of 24 OECD countries over the post-1980 period
using OLS. The specification includes interaction and level effects of both monetary policy space and
fiscal policy space (along with the relevant lags). The measure of monetary policy used is a dummy
variable equal to 1 if the policy interest rate is greater than 1.25 percent at the end of the previous half-
year. The measure of fiscal policy space used is the (negative) gross debt-to-GDP ratio in the previous
calendar year. The “without policy space” line corresponds to a value of the monetary policy space
dummy of 0 and a value of the debt-to-GDP ratio one standard deviation above the sample average; the
“with policy space” line corresponds to a value of the monetary policy dummy of 1 and a value of the debt-
to-GDP ratio one standard deviation below the sample average. The dashed lines show the two-standard-
error confidence bands.

                                            DATA APPENDIX

     This appendix describes the sources for our data on interest rates, government debt, and
budget surpluses. As we discuss, different organizations give somewhat different figures for
countries’ debt and surpluses, and there are some differences in the interest rate series across
countries. However, given the enormous differences across episodes in interest rates and fiscal
positions, minor conceptual differences and moderate measurement error are unlikely to be
important to our results.

      Interest Rates. When it is readily available, we use the announced target of the central
bank for its focal policy rate, such as the Federal Reserve’s target for the federal funds rate for
the United States. However, if the central bank describes monetary policy in terms of an
administered interest rate rather than a market rate (as is the case with many discount rates),
we do not use the central bank interest rate. For periods when a suitable central bank rate is not
available, we splice the central bank rate to an interbank rate. We generally use the immediate
call rate when it is available, and otherwise use the three-month interbank rate. Likewise, if the
central bank switches the rate that it targets, we splice the two target rates.

     In general, we perform the splices in levels. 28 However, in three cases described below
(involving Norway, the United Kingdom, and the United States), the relationship between two
interest rate series we are connecting was unusual at the point where we connect the series, so
that simply linking the two series with no adjustment appears to provide a more accurate
treatment of the usual relationship between the two series than splicing them in levels.

     Throughout, our interest rate observations correspond to the end of the half-year. For the
central bank’s target rate, our observations correspond to the target in effect at the end of the
half-year. For the interbank rates, we use the average for the last month of the half-year. The
policy rate targets were collected directly from central bank websites in January 2017. The
interbank rates, which are originally from the OECD, are from Federal Reserve Economic Data
(FRED, https://fred.stlouisfed.org/, downloaded 1/8/2017). However, because FRED is
missing the three-month interbank rate for Greece before January 2001 and the immediate call
rate for Japan after March 2015, we obtain those directly from the OECD
(http://stats.oecd.org/, downloaded 1/8/2017).

     With two exceptions, the different interest rates we consider for each country move
together very similarly. As a result, our exact choices of interest rates are of little importance. 29
We are able to obtain interest rate data for 89 percent of the observations for our full sample
period of 1980–2015, and for all of the observations where our measure of financial distress is
positive.

     The specifics of our interest rate data are as follows.



28 That is, if we use the central bank’s target rate back to period t and an interbank rate through period
t–1, we add the difference between the target rate and the interbank rate in period t to all the observations
using the interbank rate. This ensures that the change from period t–1 to period t in our series is the same
as that in the interbank rate. If yet more series are needed to go back further, we perform those splices in
levels as well.
29 The two exceptions, which are discussed below, involve the immediate call rate reported by the OECD

for Greece, which appears to be erroneous for the relevant period, and the immediate call rate reported by
the OECD for Sweden, which appears to be an administered rate for the relevant period. We do not use
these interest rates.

     For the eleven countries in our sample that have belonged to the euro since its inception,
we use the European Central Bank’s interest rate on main refinancing operations (MRO) for
1999:1–2015:2 (from https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/monetary/rates/html/index.en.html).
We splice this rate to the immediate call rate for France, Germany, and Spain (all back to
1980:1), and to the three-month interbank rate for Austria (back to 1989:1), Belgium (1980:1),
Finland (1987:1), Ireland (1984:1), Italy (1980:1), the Netherlands (1986:1), and Portugal
(1985:2). Neither interbank rate is available for Luxembourg before 1999, so our interest rate
series for Luxembourg begins in 1999. 30

    For Greece, which joined the euro at the beginning of 2001, we use the MRO rate back to
2001:1, then splice to the three-month interbank rate back to 1994:1. 31

     For Australia, we use the Reserve Bank of Australia’s target for the cash rate back to 1990:1
(from http://www.rba.gov.au/statistics/cash-rate/); for 1990:1, where the bank reports the
target as a range with a width of 50 basis points, we use the midpoint of the range. We then
splice that series to the three-month interbank rate back to 1980:1.

     For Canada, we use the Bank of Canada’s target for the overnight rate back to 2001:1
(which is when the Bank of Canada began to make that series the focus of its public discussions
of monetary policy—see http://www.bankofcanada.ca/core-functions/monetary-policy/key-
interest-rate/history-key-interest-rate/). The data for the past ten years only are available on
the bank’s website (http://www.bankofcanada.ca/rates/interest-rates/canadian-interest-
rates/). For 2001:1–2006:2, the data are from FRED (series INTDSRCAM193N, downloaded
1/8/2017). We splice this series to the immediate call rate, which goes back to 1980:1.

      For Denmark, the Danmarks Nationalbank describes policy in terms of several interest
rates. The one that it places the most emphasis on and that market rates appear to track most
closely is its interest rate on certificates of deposit. We therefore use this interest rate
back to 1992:1 (from http://www.nationalbanken.dk/en/pressroom/press_releases/Pages/defa
ult.aspx?date=FilterAll, http://www.nationalbanken.dk/en/marketinfo/official_interestrates/Pa
ges/default.aspx, and http://www.nationalbanken.dk/_vti_bin/DN/DataService.svc/OfficialRat
esXML?lang=en&interesttype=indskudsbevis), and then splice to the three-month interbank
rate back to 1987:1.

      For Iceland, we start with the Central Bank of Iceland’s interest rate on seven-day term
deposits back to 2014:2, and then splice its “deposit” or “current account” rate back to 2009:2
(both available from http://www.cb.is/monetary-policy/monetary-policy-committee/ and
http://hagtolur.sedlabanki.is/is/data/set/231e/#!ds=231e!2epz=4.l.6.k&display=line&s=9ky&ti
tle=CBI%27s+Interest+Rates). We then splice to the immediate call rate back to 1998:1, and
finally splice to the three-month interbank rate back to 1987:2.

     For Japan, we use the Bank of Japan’s target for the uncollateralized overnight call rate
(from https://www.boj.or.jp/en/mopo/mpmdeci/mpr_2017/index.htm/) for the period
1998:2–2012:2. For a few periods, the target is described as a range with a width of 10 basis
points; for these periods we use the midpoint of the range. The bank stopped describing

30 The June 1989 three-month interbank rate for Portugal is missing, so we use the May 1989 value
instead for 1989:1.
31 The OECD reports an immediate call rate for Greece for 1999 and 2000 that is identical to the euro area

call rate. However, this series is grossly contradicted by the behavior of the three-month interbank rate in
Greece in this period, as well as by an account of monetary policy in Greece during the transition to the
euro (http://www.bis.org/review/r000308b.pdf). Thus this series does not appear to accurately reflect
interest rates in Greece in 1999–2000, and so we do not use it.
                                                                                               60


monetary policy in terms of any target interest rate at the start of 2013. We therefore splice the
target to the immediate call rate both back to 1985:2 and forward to 2015:2.

     For New Zealand, we use the Reserve Bank of New Zealand’s official cash rate back to
1999:1 (from http://www.rbnz.govt.nz/monetary-policy/official-cash-rate-decisions), splice to
the immediate call rate back to 1985:1, and then splice to the three-month interbank rate back to
1980:1.

     For Norway, we use the “sight deposit rate” back to 1993:1, then splice to the overnight
lending rate for banks (also referred to as the “D-loan rate”) back to 1986:1 (both from
http://www.norges-bank.no/en/Monetary-policy/Key-policy-rate/Key-policy-rate-Monetary-
policy-meetings-and-changes-in-the-key-policy-rate/). We then splice this series to the
immediate rate back to 1982:1. Finally, because the average levels of the immediate rate and the
three-month rate are very similar over the course of 1982 but three percentage points apart in
the final month of 1982:1, we simply connect the immediate rate and the three-month rate
without any adjustment, rather than splicing the series, and thereby carry the series back to
1980:1.

     For Sweden, we use the Sveriges Riksbank’s repo rate (from http://www.riksbank.se/en/M
onetary-policy/Forecasts-and-interest-rate-decisions/Repo-rate-table/?all=1) back to 1994:1.
Although a series for the immediate call rate is available before then, it appears to be an
administered rate—it is constant for long periods and moves much less than the three-month
interbank rate or the rate on three-month Treasury securities. We therefore splice the repo rate
to the three-month interbank rate, which goes back to 1982:1.

      For Switzerland, we use the Swiss National Bank’s target for the three-month LIBOR rate
(from https://www.snb.ch/en/iabout/monpol/monstat/id/monpol_monstat_zielband) back to
2000:1. The target is always expressed as a range, usually with a width of one percentage point.
We use the bottom of the range, on the grounds that it is generally quite close to the immediate
call rate. We splice this series to the immediate call rate back to 1980:1.

      For Turkey, the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey reports both a borrowing rate and a
lending rate back to 2002:1 (both from http://www.tcmb.gov.tr/wps/wcm/connect/tcmb+en
/tcmb+en/main+page+site+area/cbrt+policy+rates/cbrt+interest+rates). At most times, the
lending rate is several percentage points above the borrowing rate. Because the immediate call
rate is generally very close to the borrowing rate, we use the borrowing rate. We splice this
series to the immediate call rate back to 1986:1.

      For the United Kingdom, we use the Bank of England’s official bank rate back to 2006:1,
then splice to what it called the repo rate back to 1997:1 (both from http://www.bankofengland.c
o.uk/monetarypolicy/Pages/decisions.aspx), and then link to the immediate call rate back to
1980:1. The immediate rate is generally very close to the repo rate. However, in the last month
of 1997:1, it is 28 basis points lower. Since this does not reflect the usual relationship between
the two series, we link the two series without any adjustment rather than splicing the immediate
rate to the repo rate.

      Finally, for the United States, we use the Federal Reserve’s publicly announced target for
the federal funds rate back to 1990:2 (from https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/op
enmarket.htm), then connect to the immediate call rate back to 1980:1. Similarly to the United
Kingdom, the immediate rate in the United States (which is the federal funds rate) is generally
very close to the central bank’s target. However, in the last month of 1990:2, it is higher by 31
basis points. Since this does not reflect the usual relationship between the two series, we link
                                                                                                    61


the two series without any adjustment rather than splicing the immediate rate to the target rate.

     Fiscal Data. Both the IMF and the OECD provide data on government debt and the
government budget surplus for the countries in our sample. Although their data are not
identical, they generally move reasonably well together. The OECD reports the debt series on its
website only back to 1995, and generally also reports data on the surplus back to the same year.
Older issues of the OECD Economic Outlook report fiscal data for earlier years, but those data
do not line up exactly with the data that the OECD currently reports. The IMF fiscal data
generally go back further than the data on the OECD website, and they often go back to 1980. In
order to have as much of the data as possible from a single consistent source, we therefore begin
with the IMF data. In cases where there are OECD data for years before those covered by the
IMF, we then splice the IMF data to the OECD data. In all cases, we use the versions of the
series that are reported as a percent of GDP.

      For government debt, we begin with the series for “general government gross debt” and for
“general government net debt” from the IMF World Economic Outlook October 2016 database
(https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2016/02/weodata/index.aspx, downloaded
 12/6/2016). We obtain the current OECD data on “gross debt of general government” and
“financial net worth, general government” (the latter multiplied by −1 so that it reflects debt
rather than assets) from the OECD website (downloaded 1/5/2017). For the few countries
where the current OECD data go back further than reported by the IMF, we splice the IMF series
to the corresponding current OECD series. As with the interest rate data, we perform the splices
in levels. When there are data in older editions of the OECD Economic Outlook that allow us to
take the series back further, we splice our series (again in levels) to the data in the Economic
Outlook for “gross financial liabilities” and “net financial liabilities.” We use the December 2002
edition of the Economic Outlook to carry the series back to 1985, and the December 1996 edition
to carry them back to 1980. Finally, for two countries (Greece and Luxembourg), the IMF has
no data on net debt. In these cases, we use the data from the current OECD website with no
splicing to the IMF data. (Earlier editions of the Economic Outlook do not report net debt data
for these countries, so we do not splice the series back in time in these cases.)

     For gross debt, we are able to obtain observations for 82 percent of our sample from the
IMF and an additional 12 percent from the OECD. For net debt, the figures are 66 percent and
22 percent. We are able to obtain the series for all of the observations in our sample when our
measure of financial distress is positive.

     For the surplus, we use the series for “general government net lending/borrowing” from
the IMF World Economic Outlook October 2016 database (downloaded 12/6/2016). For cases
where the data in older issues of the OECD Economic Outlook go back further, we splice the IMF
series for the surplus (in levels) to the OECD series for “financial balance.” 32 We again use the
December 2002 edition to carry the series back to 1985 and the December 1996 edition to carry
them back to 1980, and we again splice the series in levels.

     We are able to obtain observations for the surplus for 86 percent of our full sample period
of 1980–2015 directly from the IMF, and to fill in another 9 percent from the OECD Economic
Outlook. And again, we are not missing the data for any observation for which our measure of
financial distress is positive.

32 There are two cases where we could potentially use some current OECD data to carry the IMF data
back: Australia and the United States. However, for Australia, the current OECD series moves very
differently from the IMF series in the period of overlap, while the series in the 2002 Economic Outlook
does not. Since this difference raises concerns about the comparability of the current OECD and IMF
data, we do not to use the current OECD data in either of these two cases.

      The debt and surplus data are annual, while our measure of financial distress is
semiannual. We convert the fiscal data to semiannual by using the annual observation for year t
for both half-years of year t. However, as discussed in the text, when we examine the
relationship between fiscal space before a financial crisis and the aftermath of the crisis, we
measure fiscal space using the fiscal data two half-years before the crisis. This means that when
a crisis occurs in either half-year of year t, we are measuring fiscal space as of year t–1; thus our
measures of fiscal space do not reflect any developments in year t. And when we ask how the
surplus behaves when there is a crisis, we check our results by also estimating the relationship
using only annual data.
