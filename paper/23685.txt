                                         ABSTRACT

We use variance decompositions from high-dimensional vector autoregressions to characterize
connectedness in 19 key commodity return volatilities, 2011-2016. We study both static (full-
sample) and dynamic (rolling-sample) connectedness. We summarize and visualize the results
using tools from network analysis. The results reveal clear clustering of commodities into groups
that match traditional industry groupings, but with some notable differences. The energy sector is
most important in terms of sending shocks to others, and energy, industrial metals, and precious
metals are themselves tightly connected.

1       Introduction
Commodities and commodity markets play a central role in the global economy.1 Hence
commodity market developments are widely chronicled and followed.2 Commodities are a
key input to all countries’ production, and a key output of many emerging economies, so fluc-
tuations in commodity prices may contribute strongly to common business cycle fluctuations
in emerging economies and beyond, as emphasized by Fernández et al. (2015). Commodities
have also emerged as important financial asset classes (e.g., energy, agriculture, metals), with
properties different from those of “traditional” asset classes like stocks, bonds, and foreign
exchange, as emphasized by Kat and Oomen (2007a) and Kat and Oomen (2007b).
    Understanding connectedness, which is central to risk measurement and management,
seems particularly important in the commodities context, particularly for emerging economies
relying heavily on commodities production. Relevant aspects include connectedness across
firms, markets, and countries, both nominal/financial and real. In particular, we have in
mind things like connectedness of commodity company stocks (both within and across coun-
tries), connectedness of commodity prices, and links between commodity price connectedness
and country real output connectedness.
    Moreover, connectedness measurement in real time is of special relevance for policy.
Successful real-time policy (and all policy is real-time) demands real-time monitoring, often
exploiting high-frequency data.3 As we shall later describe in detail, the daily commodity
volatilities that we study in this paper are in precisely that tradition, built from key parts
of trade-by-trade intra-day price paths.
    Several approaches to connectedness measurement have been considered recently.4 Billio
et al. (2012) use pairwise Granger causality. Bonaldi et al. (2013) work with vector autore-
gressions (VAR’s), which allow for full multivariate dynamic cross-variable interaction and
hence richer connectedness assessment, focusing on connectedness due to cross-lag interac-
tions as opposed to innovation correlations. Diebold and Yilmaz (2009), Diebold and Yilmaz
(2012), and Diebold and Yilmaz (2014) also use VAR’s, but they use variance decomposi-
tions, which account for innovation correlations in addition to dynamic cross-variable inter-
actions.5 Demirer et al. (2016) extend the Diebold-Yilmaz framework to high-dimensional

     The Diebold and Yilmaz (2014) framework extends earlier variance-decomposition work by Diebold and
environments, which are increasingly relevant, by incorporating LASSO estimation.
    In this paper, we characterize global commodity market connectedness using the Demirer
et al. (2016) framework. This is of interest in a variety of contexts. One such key context
is private-sector investment management strategies, whose portfolio concentration risk is di-
rectly related to connectedness. Another is public-sector monitoring and policy formulation,
because connectedness tends to increase during commodity-market crises, which may then
spill over into the broader macroeconomy.
    We proceed as follows. In section 2 we discuss our commodity price indices, our con-
struction and verification of realized return volatility, and our framework for measuring
commodity volatility connectedness. In section 3 we provide benchmark results for static
connectedness, and in section 4 we provide results for dynamic connectedness. We conclude
in section 5, and we explore variations and extensions in several appendices.


2     Commodities Data and Volatility
In this section we describe our commodities data – prices, returns, and range-based return
volatilities – and their properties.


2.1     Price Indices
We study nineteen sub-indices of the Bloomberg Commodity Price Index: four energy com-
modities (crude oil, heating oil, natural gas, unleaded gasoline), two precious metals (gold,
silver), four industrial metals (aluminum, copper, nickel, zinc), two livestock commodities
(live cattle, lean hogs), four grains (corn, soybeans, soybean oil, wheat), and three so-called
“softs” (coffee, cotton, sugar). It is important to note that the category labeling is not ours;
rather, it is standard among industry participants, which will subsequently be of interest
later when interpreting our empirical results.6 Details on the underlying futures contracts,
and the exchanges on which they are traded, appear in Table 1.7
    The nineteen sub-indices that we study are those underlying the Bloomberg Commodity
Yilmaz, including Diebold and Yilmaz (2009) and Diebold and Yilmaz (2012), by using network visualization
methods to understand the variance decompositions. Importantly, moreover, as emphasized in Diebold and
Yilmaz (2014), the Diebold-Yilmaz framework allows measurement of connectedness at levels ranging from
highly granular to highly aggregative, with close connections to marginal expected shortfall or S-risk (Acharya
et al. (2010)) and CoVaR (Adrian and Brunnermeier (2016)).

 Price Index when we obtained our data sample.8 Our data are daily, 2006/5/11 - 2016/1/25,
 with holidays and weekends dropped. This results in 2,443 observations per series, for a total
 of 2443 × 19 = 46, 417 observations. We show time-series plots of log sub-indices in Figure
 1.


 2.2        Realized Volatility
 We define commodity returns as change in log price, and we study daily range-based realized
 commodity-return volatility. That is, following Garman and Klass (1980) we construct range-
 based realized volatility (variance) as:

                     σ̂it2 = 0.511(Hit − Lit )2 − 0.019[(Cit − Oit )(Hit + Lit − 2Oit )
                              −2(Hit − Oit )(Lit − Oit )] − 0.383(Cit − Oit )2 ,                          (1)

 where Hit , Lit , Oit and Cit are, respectively, the logs of daily high, low, opening, and closing
 prices for commodity i on day t.
     Range-based realized volatility is almost as efficient as realized volatility based on ultra-
 high-frequency sampling (it is based on the key pieces of the intra-day price path – open,
    8
        Subsequently Bloomberg (2016) slightly enlarged the set of underlying sub-indices.

                           4
close, high, low), much less tedious to construct, robust to microstructure noise, and widely
available, often for many decades.9
    In Appendix A we verify the key properties of realized volatility. Results for other markets
like equities (Andersen et al. (2001a)) and foreign exchange (Andersen et al. (2001b)) indicate
that daily realized volatilities are (1) generally distributed asymmetrically, with a right skew,
(2) approximately Gaussian after taking natural logarithms, and (3) very strongly serially
correlated. Despite the fact that the economics of commodity markets are quite different
from those of foreign exchange or equities, the results in Appendix A make clear that all
three properties hold for commodity returns. Given property (2), from this point onward we
work in logarithms. That is, even if we simply say “realized volatility” or “volatility”, we
mean the natural logarithm of range-based realized volatility as defined in equation (1). We
show time-series plots of the log realized volatilities in Figure 2.


3         Benchmark Results I: Static (Full-Sample) Connect-
          edness
3.1         Measuring Connectedness
We examine commodity return volatility connectedness using the framework of Demirer et al.
(2016), which builds on Diebold and Yilmaz (2014). In particular, for the benchmark results
that we report in sections 3 and 4:

    1. We use a V AR(3) approximating model, estimated using an adaptive elastic net with
       penalty parameter chosen by 10-fold cross validation.

    2. We identify the estimated V AR using the generalized approach of Koop et al. (1996)
       and Pesaran and Shin (1998), and then we examine variance decompositions at horizon
       H = 10 days.

    3. We summarize the variance decomposition matrix using connectedness statistics (pair-
       wise directional, total directional “to” and “from”, and system-wide).

    4. We visualize the variance decomposition matrix using network “spring graphs”.

    5. In Appendix B we explore different horizons (various h, fixed p = 3), and in Appendix
       C we explore different approximating models (fixed h = 10, various p).

Figure 2: Time Series Plots of Log Realized Volatilities




                           6
We perform static (full-sample) analyses in this section, and dynamic (rolling-sample) anal-
yses in section 4.
    Let us elaborate upon our approach to network visualization. Node shading indicates
total directional connectedness “to others”; the darker the stronger. The spring graph node
location layout represents a steady state in which repelling and attracting forces exactly
balance, where (1) nodes repel each other, but (2) edges attract the nodes they connect
according to average pairwise directional connectedness.10 Edge thickness also indicates
average pairwise directional connectedness. Finally, edge arrow size indicates pairwise direc-
tional connectedness “to” and “from”.


3.2     System-Wide Connectedness
System-wide connectedness is 40%. That is, on average almost half of a commodity’s future
volatility uncertainty is due to “non-own” shocks. It is interesting that the 40% system-
wide commodity return volatility connectedness is significantly lower than the system-wide
equity return volatility connectedness found by Demirer et al. (2016) for the world’s largest
banks. It makes sense, however, as large parts of commodity price movements come from
idiosyncratic fluctuations in national and regional macroeconomic fundamentals that drive
commodity supply and demand.


3.3     To-Degrees and From-Degrees
It is of interest to know the individual commodity degrees, particularly to-degrees, as we
are especially interested in which sectors are sending the most uncertainty to others. From
largest to smallest, the to-degree ranking is ULS Diesel, WTI Crude Oil, Unleaded Gasoline,
Soybeans, Gold, Zinc, Copper, Silver, Corn, Soybean Oil, Wheat, Aluminum, Nickel, Sugar,
Cotton, Live Cattle, Lean Hogs, Natural Gas, and Coffee. From largest to smallest, the from-
degree ranking is ULS Diesel, WTI Crude Oil, Unleaded Gasoline, Zinc, Gold, Soybeans,
Copper, Silver, Corn, Soybean Oil, Aluminum, Wheat, Nickel, Live Cattle, Cotton, Lean
Hogs, Sugar, Natural Gas, and Coffee. The rank correlation is 0.9794. Bar charts appear in
Figure 3, ordered by to-degrees from largest to smallest. It is interesting to note that the
to-degree ordering is almost identical to the from-degree ordering.
    In Figure 4, we show estimates of the the static (full-sample) “from” and “to” degree
  10
   The steady state node locations depend on initial node locations and hence are not unique. They are,
however, topologically unique up to rotation and flipping.

distributions, based on three-bin histograms. Their means are of course equal, and equal to
system-wide connectedness (again, 40%). Their shapes are similar but slightly different. The
“to” degree distribution has a slightly thicker right tail, consistent with a few commodities
sending a rather large amount of future uncertainty to others.


3.4    The Network Graph
In Figure 5, we show the static (full-sample) network graph. Several aspects are notable.
First, there is clear clustering, associated primarily with the traditional industry groupings
(energy, industrial metals, precious metals, grains, livestock, and softs), perhaps due to the
nature of production processes; e.g., upstream/downstream, substitutes/complements, etc.
This implies that a commodity volatility shock is likely to be transmitted to the commodity’s
sub-group, but not necessarily to all commodities. So we have an interesting situation:
rather low system-wide connectedness, but clear group clustering and high within-group
connectedness.

                 Figure 4: Full-Sample From and To Degree Distributions




   Let us elaborate on the group clustering.

  1. There is clear clustering in precious metals, grains, and livestock.

  2. There is clear clustering in energy and industrial metals, but in each case with a
     noteworthy exception. In the energy group, heating oil, crude oil, and gasoline cluster
     tightly, but natural gas is quite far away. In the industrial metals group, aluminum,
     nickel, and zinc cluster tightly, but copper is noticeably elsewhere, closer to precious
     metals and energy. Perhaps this “copper anomaly” is due to its role in production.
     Alternatively, perhaps it is not a copper anomaly, but rather an “aluminum-nickel-zinc
     anomaly” associated with the London Metals Exchange rules mentioned in Appendix
     A.

  3. There is no clustering in softs (coffee, cotton, sugar). Presumably this is because softs
     is largely a residual category.

Taken together, (1), (2), and (3) suggest that the traditional commodity groupings are
largely, but not entirely, accurate. Natural gas, in particular, is far from the other energy
commodities.


3.5    Six-Group Aggregation
We present full numerical results in a six-group (6 × 6) “connectedness table”, or “variance
decomposition table” (Table 2), obtained by aggregating the original (19 × 19) connected-
ness table within the six traditional commodity categories (energy, industrial metals, precious

                                               9

metals, grains, livestock, softs).11 The individual entries are pairwise directional connected-
ness, the row sums are total directional connectedness “from”, the column sums are total
directional connectedness “to”, and the grand sum in the lower right corner is system-wide
connectedness.12
    We show the associated network graph for the six-group aggregation in Figure 6. There
are several results. First, the energy, industrial metals, and precious metals groups them-
selves form a tight cluster. Second, there is a very large amount of total directional con-
nectedness to others from energy. Third, livestock and softs are largely peripheral and net
receivers, rather than transmitters, of shocks.
  11
     In principle we could of course have shown a (19 × 19) connectedness table earlier, but its size proved
unwieldy.
  12
     All sums exclude the main diagonal, because we are interested in non-own transmissions.

4      Benchmark Results II: Dynamic (Rolling-Sample)
       Connectedness
Here we study time series of connectedness, estimated using a rolling window with a width
of 150 days. We study both total system-wide and total directional (to and from) connect-
edness.


4.1     On the Economics of Commodity Connectedness Dynamics
Thus far we have introduced our commodity price index data, constructed the corresponding
returns and return volatilities, and provided a basic statistical characterization. Here we
delve into more economic aspects.
    Commodity prices differ in important ways from those of bonds and stocks. Unlike
bonds and stocks, commodity prices are determined more by traditional supply and demand
considerations. Perhaps with the exception of precious metals, which in significant part
serve as alternative investment vehicles to hedge against global uncertainty, demand for
commodities is closely linked to global income. In that regard, at times commodity prices
can be subject to highly-correlated demand-side shocks. This was indeed the case during
the global financial crisis, when prices of all major commodities dropped sharply as the
near-collapse of global financial markets led to the Great Global Recession of 2009.
    The emergence of China as a global economic powerhouse since the early 2000s provides
another example of how commodity prices are affected by global consumption demand. From
2001 to 2011, China’s industrial production quadrupled, its consumption of industrial metals
increased by 330%, and its oil consumption increased by 98% (see World Bank (July 2015)).
China’s phenomenal growth in commodity demand is reflected in a broad upward trend in
commodities prices that lasted until 2011 and then subsided as demand from China and

                                            11
              Figure 6: Full-Sample Network Graph, Six-Group Aggregation




other emerging-market economies subsided (see World Bank (October 2014)).
    Unlike commodity demand, which is driven at least in part by a common “global demand”
factor, commodity supply is more idiosyncratic. Supplies of energy, industrial metals, pre-
cious metals, and agricultural commodities can be affected by very different factors. For
example, while OPEC controls part of the global oil supply, a larger share of global oil
supply as well as supplies of metals can be affected by the decisions of exporting country
governments. In the case of agricultural commodities, moreover, weather conditions can play
an important role in the short run, while government policies (e.g., export and/or import
taxes) can have significant impact in the longer run. Therefore, due to the existence of rather
different processes in effect on the supply side, it is quite normal to observe different price
movements in different commodity markets.




                                              12
                   Figure 7: Rolling-Sample System-Wide Connectedness




4.2    System-Wide Connectedness
We show total system-wide connectedness in Figure 7. It fluctuated between 28.3% and
53.8% over the sample period from the end of 2006 to the end of January 2016. Commodity
return volatilities tend to generate lower connectedness than the global bank return volatil-
ities, global stock market return volatilities, and bond yield volatilities. There are several
reasons for this difference. Global bank return volatility shocks, in general, generate higher
connectedness, because even though they are located in different countries, big global banks
are subject to shocks to global banking as well as to international financial markets. Global
stock market return volatility connectedness (and for that matter global bond market yield
volatility connectedness) indices tend to be higher because return volatility shocks are likely
to be transmitted within the same asset class across countries. When there is an idiosyncratic
shock to one of the major stock markets or a shock common to a subset of stock markets it
is likely to be transmitted to others.
     Returning to dynamic system-wide volatility connectedness in commodity markets, we
observe a spike in total connectedness around late 2008 and early 2009. The U.S. recession
that started in the first half of 2008 triggered a global growth slowdown, which in turn
prompted commodity prices to start falling in mid-2008, several months before the climax of
the crisis was reached in the last quarter of 2008. The transformation of the U.S. financial
crisis into a global one, and the resulting downward spiral in the world economy, accelerated


                                              13
the downward process of commodity prices that lasted until mid-2009.
    As a result of these developments, system-wide connectedness increased from 32% at
the end of February 2008 to close to 40% by the end of May 2008. After a brief respite,
system-wide connectedness started to increase again, and following Lehman’s bankruptcy it
increased at a much faster pace from around 47% to 53.8% by mid-November.
    Once it became apparent that global financial crisis would not lead to a complete melt-
down of the financial system, commodity prices gradually turned upwards in early 2009,
which in turn led the system-wide commodity connectedness turn downwards. The decline
in connectedness was at first gradual, but it gained momentum in a couple of months time,
dropping as low as 35% by the end of August 2009. The system-wide connectedness did
not stay around 35% for a long time. After a significant correction due to the global finan-
cial crisis, commodity prices started to recover from September 2009 onwards, as markets
continued their upward journey, the volatility connectedness started to go up reaching as
high as 48% by April 2010. During this upswing, there was not a widespread trend in the
commodity return volatilities, but increased volatility in precious metals, especially in silver,
caused the system-wide connectedness to increase slightly.
    Commodity prices continued to increase until mid-2011, after which energy prices stayed
more or less steady in the next three years or so, followed by a sharp drop in oil prices in the
second half of 2014. In the meantime, agricultural commodities, as well as the industrial and
precious metals followed a downward trend that lasted until the end of our sample. While
the agricultural commodities’ prices declined by an average of 35%, that of precious and
industrial metals respectively dropped by 45% and 52% over this period. Oil prices did not
decline as fast as other major commodities because the impact of China on oil demand was
more limited than the case in other commodities, especially in industrial metals. Secondly,
the geopolitical risks in some countries in the Middle East and North Africa as well as
Ukraine, when combined with Saudi Arabia’s policy of adjusting its supplies to keep oil
price high, together played a role in oil prices fluctuating in a band of $80-$105 per barrel
for more than three years.
    System-wide commodity volatility connectedness reflects the developments over the pe-
riod. From the mid-2010 to early 2013 the system-wide connectedness fluctuated in the
narrow band of 40%-45%. System-wde connectedness followed a short-lived upward trend
early 2011 to early 2012, during which it reached as high as 48%. This increase was mostly
due to the worries about the political upheavals in the Middle East and North Africa. In
particular, the worries about the Suez Canal due to the civil conflict in Egypt and the sharp


                                               14
cut in Libya’s oil production due to the civil war in the country fed into the oil price volatility
which in turn contributed to the system-wide connectedness in commodity markets. After
the overthrow of Qaddafi regime in Libya 2011, the political crisis in Egypt was resolved
with a coup d’etat in mid-July 2013. Following the turn of events in Egypt, volatility in oil
prices subsided and the system-wide connectedness started to decline from around 37% in
mid-July 2013 to 28.5% within six months.
    After fluctuating around 30% for several months, system-wide connectedness started to
increase from its lows of 30% in July 2014 to reach 43% by the early 2015. The latest upward
move in system-wide connectedness was due to worries about the civil war in Ukraine and
whether it would lead to the temporary suspension of oil supplies from the Russian Federation
to the world market.
    At the same time, military actions of Russian-backed separatists increased confrontation
between Russia, on the one side, and the U.S. and the EU, on the other side. It is speculated
that as the tensions between the two sides increased, Saudi Arabia decided to change its
policy of playing the marginal supplier which aims to keep oil prices high. With this policy
change Saudi Arabia wanted to push high cost shale frackers out of business. Thanks to high
global oil prices shale frackers were able to profitably increase global supply of oil, which
threatened the dominant position of OPEC and in particular, Saudi Arabia, in the long-run.
Secondly, Saudi Arabia helped the U.S. to increase pressure on the Russian government,
which had become increasingly belligerent not only in Ukraine but in other civil unrests in
parts of the world. As a result, the oil price was almost halved from around $100 at the end
of July 2014 to around $50 by the end of the year.
    After staying above 40% for several months, system-wide connectedness dropped to 37%
in the summer of 2015, as the oil price ended its downward spiral and settled around $50
per barrel. However, news about China’s financial market troubles in August 2015 increased
tensions and system-wide connectedness not only in commodity markets but in all financial
markets. As a result, system-wide connectedness increased by more than five percentage
points within a month and later reached 44% by the end of October 2015.


4.3    Total Directional Connectedness
In this section we analyze the dynamics of directional connectedness of individual commodi-
ties as well as commodity groups, based on net total directional connectedness graphs (“to”
- “from”) in Figure 8.
    As our discussion of the dynamic system-wide connectedness in the previous section

                                                15
Figure 8: Rolling-Sample Net Total Directional Connectedness




                            16
showed, and as Figure 8 confirms, oil played quite an important role in the commodity
market connectedness. Its net connectedness is higher than all other commodities for an
overwhelming majority of the rolling sub-sample windows considered. Both in earlier and
later parts of the period, net connectedness of oil reached as high as 30-35% range. The only
sub-periods during which the net connectedness of crude oil was lower are the first half of
2007, and the period from the second half of 2013 to July 2014.
     Starting in the first quarter of 2008, the crude oil price skyrocketed from around $60 in
February 2007 to reach $141 per barrel by the first week of July 2008. After that moment,
however, the oil price started to come down as the worries about U.S. economic performance
intensified along with the signs of slowdown in many countries. As the downturn started in
the oil price, oil return volatility increased substantially. Along with the rising oil return
volatility, system-wide volatility connectedness increased from around 40% in early July 2008
to 53% by the end of October 2008. Over the same period net connectedness of WTI crude
oil increased from 10% to 35%, the highest net connectedness level generated by a commodity
for all rolling subsample windows considered (see Figure 8).
     By the end of October 2008, the crude oil price dropped to $60 per barrel. However,
the downward spiral in the price of oil continued until the third week of December, with
a minimum price of $31 per barrel. As the oil price lost its downward momentum, its net
connectedness oil dropped to around 10% by the end of 2008. Once the oil price recovers to
reach closer to $60 per barrel, we observe that net volatility connectedness (hence volatility)
of oil returns started to increase significantly and reached to 35% by mid-July 2009.
     Heating oil, soybeans and zinc are the three commodities that followed crude oil in
generating very high levels of net connectedness to other commodities over all subsamples
considered. Heating oil is also in the energy commodities group. Its net connectedness to
others follows a trajectory which resembles to that of crude oil.
     Soybeans have high net connectedness, not because they are an important consumption
item for households around the world, but rather because they are used in the biofuel pro-
duction. Soybeans’ net connectedness reached as high as 28% in March 2008 and last quarter
of 2008 and first half of 2009. Unlike crude oil, soybeans’ net connectedness increased in
January 2008 (exactly around the FOMC’s emergency conference-call meeting on January
22) and at the end of February and beginning of March 2008. During this period, crude
oil prices were still on an upward move with a net connectedness of only around 10%. A
similar asymmetric move between the net connectedness of crude oil and soybeans occurred
in the first half of 2009. While crude oil’s net connectedness declined from its peak at the


                                              17
end of October 2008 to a low of -6% in the first week of April 2009, during this period the
net connectedness of soybeans increased to reach 28% level.
    Zinc is actually the only commodity that generated net positive connectedness to others
throughout the period from 2006 to 2016. Throughout the period, zinc had small but positive
(between 5 to 10%) net connectedness from the beginning of the sample to the end of 2012.
Its net connectedness declined significantly since late 2012 to less than 5%, yet continued to
stay on the positive side.
    As for energy commodities, unleaded gasoline is the third in terms of generating net
connectedness to other commodities. Again its net connectedness followed quiet a similar
behavior over time to that of crude oil. The only energy commodity that is a net recipient of
connectedness from others is natural gas. Natural gas is the energy market with the weakest
link to the economic news flow, even when accounting for periods of recession. Reflecting
this fact, its connectedness to others and from others are much lower than those of other
energy commodities. As such its return volatility is likely to be affected by the return
volatilities of other energy commodities. That is why its net connectedness was negative for
an overwhelming majority of rolling sample windows, as shown in Figure 8.
    We also need to focus on the net connectedness of copper. While its net connectedness
was negative during the U.S. and global financial crisis in 2007 through 2009 and during the
2011 European debt crisis, copper has generated positive net connectedness since early 2012.
Copper prices declined by more than 50% since the end of 2010, from a high of $9,800 per
ton to a low of $4,700 per ton at the end of 2015. The decline in the price of copper and
its increasing contribution to system-wide connectedness are closely related to the Chinese
slowdown in recent years. Other industrial metals, such as zinc, nickel, and aluminum also
experienced significant price drops over the period, but none of them had net connectedness
as high as copper. We have already covered zinc above. The other two industrial metals,
aluminum and nickel, displayed both positive and negative episodes. When considered all
together industrial metals, industrial metals generated positive net connectedness to other
commodity groups (ranging from 5 to 20%) for almost all rolling window samples.
    Among the precious metals, silver has higher net connectedness than gold for most of the
period covered. During the global financial crisis, in the second half of 2009 and first half
of 2010, and since the end of 2011, silver’s net connectedness is much higher (sometimes as
high as 20%) than that of gold (see Figure 8).
    Soft commodities (coffee, cotton and sugar) and livestock (lean hogs and live cattle) all
have negative connectedness for almost all rolling sample windows, indicating that their


                                             18
prices on average are influenced by other commodities and/or commodity groups (see Fig-
ure 8).


5      Conclusion
We have estimated and examined the network graph for a set of major commodity sub-
index volatilities. The results reveal clear clustering of commodities into groups that match
traditional industry groupings, but with some notable differences. The energy sector is most
important in terms of sending shocks to others, and energy, industrial metals, and precious
metals are themselves tightly connected.



Appendices
A      Verification of Key Properties of Realized Volatility
Results for other markets like equities (Andersen et al. (2001a)) and foreign exchange (An-
dersen et al. (2001b)) indicate that daily realized volatilities are (1) generally distributed
asymmetrically, with a right skew, but approximately Gaussian after taking natural loga-
rithms, and (2) very strongly serially correlated. The economics of commodity markets are
quite different from those of foreign exchange or equities, however, so here we provide an
examination of fundamental distributional and dynamic properties of commodity volatilities.
    Let us start with distributional aspects. As obviously revealed in the Gaussian Q-Q plots
of Figure 9, the distribution of realized commodity volatility is strongly skewed right. This is
not surprising, because volatilities are bounded below by zero and experience occasional large
bursts. The real issue is whether log commodity volatilities are approximately Gaussian, as
with foreign exchange and equities. As shown in the Gaussian Q-Q plots for log returns in
Figure 10, the answer is mostly yes.13
    Finally, we consider dynamics. In Figure 11 we show volatility autocorrelations. They
decay, which is consistent with covariance stationarity, but they decay very slowly, indicating
highly persistent, if nevertheless mean-reverting, dynamics.
  13
    The only exceptions to approximate log-normality are three industrial metals (aluminum, nickel, zinc),
as clearly shown in the Gaussian Q-Q plots of Figure 10. All are traded on the London metals exchange
(LME), and they are the only commodities in our data set traded on that exchange.



                                                   19
B      Different Horizons (Various h, Fixed p = 3)
It is of interest to explore connectedness at different horizons h. On the one hand, one might
hope for results robust to horizon. On the other hand, upon further consideration, it is not
obvious why the results should be robust, or whether such robustness is “desirable”. This
point is related to different notions of network centrality; one can assess 1-step through the
adjacency matrix A, 2-step through A2 , and so on to ∞-step (eigenvalue centrality).
    First consider static connectedness. In Figure 12, we show static (full-sample) V AR(3)
network connectedness graphs for six variance decomposition horizons: h = 2, 10, 20, ..., 50
days. The different subgraphs are rotated to enhance multiple comparisons. The topology
appears strongly robust to horizon.14


C      Different Dynamics (Fixed h = 10, Various p)
We already noted the very high persistence in commodity return volatilities, as is common
across many assets and asset classes. Indeed there may even be long memory, as empha-
sized in Andersen et al. (2003). To allow for that possibility, we also explored a variety of
higher-order approximating models, estimation of which is feasible despite profligate param-
eterizations, given the regularization achieved by the LASSO.
    In Figure 13, we show static (full-sample) h = 10 network connectedness graphs for six
V AR lag orders, p = 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25. The different subgraphs are rotated to enhance
multiple comparisons. The topology appears strongly robust to lag order.




  14
    The scaling, however, differs across the subgraphs; otherwise the small-h graphs would be tiny and the
large-h graphs would be huge.
