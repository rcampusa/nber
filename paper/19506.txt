                                              ABSTRACT

Two separate narratives have emerged in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis. One interpretation
speaks of private financial excess and the key role of the banking system in leveraging and deleveraging
the economy. The other emphasizes the public sector balance sheet over the private and worries about
the risks of lax fiscal policies. However, the two may interact in important and understudied ways.
This paper examines the co-evolution of public and private sector debt in advanced countries since
1870. We find that in advanced economies significant financial stability risks have mostly come from
private sector credit booms rather than from the expansion of public debt. However, we find evidence
that high levels of public debt have tended to exacerbate the effects of private sector deleveraging
after crises, leading to more prolonged periods of economic depression. We uncover three key facts
based on our analysis of around 150 recessions and recoveries since 1870: (i) in a normal recession
and recovery real GDP per capita falls by 1.5 percent and takes only 2 years to regain its previous
peak, but in a financial crisis recession the drop is typically 5 percent and it takes over 5 years to regain
the previous peak; (ii) the output drop is even worse and recovery even slower when the crisis is preceded
by a credit boom; and (iii) the path of recovery is worse still when a credit-fueled crisis coincides with
elevated public debt levels. Recent experience in the advanced economies provides a useful out-of-sample
comparison, and meshes closely with these historical patterns. Fiscal space appears to be a constraint
in the aftermath of a crisis, then and now.

                              1.   Introduction

From Beijing to Madrid to Washington, the risks of excessive borrowing feature
prominently in the public debate. A seemingly simple lesson that many people
drew from the financial crisis is that high debts harbor risks. However, it is much
less evident which debts one should worry about. A priori, many economists
would probably point to the public sector where incentive failures of politicians
and the common-pool problem might lead to reckless debt financing. Private
households and companies, by contrast, are assumed to be acting in their en-
lightened self-interested, have some “skin in the game” and can be taken for
“consenting adults.”
    Surveying such crises, or even just the latest examples, whether it was pri-
vate debts that ultimately bankrupted sovereigns or excessive public debt that
undermined the banking sector is a question that is not easily answered. In some
Eurozone countries, the public sector was overwhelmed by the costs of cleaning
up the banking system and forced to seek bail-outs (e.g., Ireland and Spain).
The pattern in these cases aligns well with the link between financial crises and
sovereign debt distress that has been documented in detail by Reinhart and Rogoff
(2009a; 2010). In other countries, the main vulnerability was indeed concentrated
on the public sector balance sheet itself (e.g., Greece). When the economic outlook
worsened after the crisis, the sustainability of high public debts was called into
question. Doubts about the solvency of the sovereign quickly spread to banks
with substantial holdings of government debt (effects also seen in, e.g., Italy and
Portugal), setting in motion a “diabolic loop” (Brunnermeier et al. 2011).
    What the crisis made abundantly clear is that private and public debts cannot
be looked at only in isolation. Studying the interactions between the two from a
long-run historical perspective is therefore the main purpose of this paper. While
various studies have looked at private and public debt separately, a joint study
of the evolution of public and private borrowing is missing. With our study,
we aim to start to fill this gap. To do so, we rely on a novel long-run annual
panel dataset covering private bank credit and public debt and a wide swath of
macroeconomic control variables for 17 advanced economies from 1870 to 2011.
This is the near universe of advanced economies’ experiences in the past 140 years.
This long-run historical perspective allows us to work with a sufficiently large
number of observations to achieve statistically meaningful results.


                                        1
    We first present a number of new facts. Section 2 reveals that total economy
debt levels have risen strongly over time, but the bulk of the increase has come
from the private sector. Section 3 shows that private credit booms, more than
public debt booms, tend to be the main precursors of financial instability. Section
4 documents the cyclical properties of private and public borrowing. Private
borrowing is strongly pro-cyclical whereas public debt is usually countercyclical.
    The analysis in the remainder of the paper focuses primarily on the cyclical
features of Section 3 rather than the long term trends of Section 2. We track how
public debt levels and private credit booms influence business cycle dynamics
using local projections. We discover that both varieties of debt overhang, public
and private, matter, but in different ways. The credit boom and subsequent private
debt overhang primarily determine the depth of the recession and the speed of the
recovery. Meanwhile, the level of public debt (rather than its buildup) influences
the dynamics induced by the private debt overhang. Entering a financial crisis
with high levels of public debt is associated with considerably more painful
recessions and slower recoveries, potentially because high initial debt limits the
fiscal space of the government.
    Our results resonate with two active research areas in macroeconomics. One
strand of work focuses on the role of private credit. Like Schularick and Taylor
(2012), we find that financial crises often are credit booms gone bust. Crises
in turn tend to have long-lasting economic effects. A number of recent studies
have demonstrated that recoveries from financial crisis recessions tend to be
considerably slower and more protracted than normal as private credit booms or
overhangs hold back the economy.1
    The second strand of recent research related to our work has focused on public
debt. The surge of public debt in the wake of the crisis has not only led to doubts
about the efficacy of deficit spending, but also triggered fears about the negative
consequences of excessive levels of public debt. Reinhart and Rogoff (2010) and
Reinhart et al. (2012) argued that high public debt levels (specially beyond 90
percent of GDP) may become a drag on the economy.2 Irons and Bivens (2010)
question these findings, while Minea and Parent (2012) argue that the threshold, if
   1 See for example Cerra and Saxena (2008); Reinhart and Rogoff (2009a); Jordà, Schularick,
Taylor (2011, 2013); Mian and Sufi (2010). For different views on this question see Howard, Martin,
and Wilson (2011), as well as Bordo and Haubrich (2010).
   2 Checherita and Rother (2010) as well as Kumar and Woo (2010) have found supporting

evidence of slower growth when public debts are high.

it exists, is somewhat higher at around 115 percent of GDP. In a related part of the
literature, Corsetti et al. (2012) argue that if risk premia on public debt rise with
higher levels of public debt, the multiplier effects of fiscal policy shrink. Ilzetzki
et al. (2013) find a similar result for emerging economies.
    The key findings of this paper provide nuanced support for both strands of this
literature. On the one hand, we reaffirm the central role played by private sector
borrowing behavior for the build-up of financial fragility. In advanced economies,
the idea that financial crises typically have their roots in fiscal problems which
in turn take a toll on the banking sector is not supported by history as a general
matter. Emerging economies might be different in this respect. On the other
hand, our results also speak to the potential dangers of high public debt in some
situations. While high levels of public debt make little difference in normal times,
entering a financial crisis recession with an elevated level of public debt seems to
exacerbate the effects of private sector deleveraging and is typically accompanied
by a prolonged period of sub-par economic performance. That is, the long-run
data suggest that without enough fiscal space, a country’s capacity to perform
macroeconomic stabilization and resume growth after a major crisis downturn
may be seriously impaired.


   2.   The Historical Evolution of Public Debt and Private
                        Credit since 1870

The experience of the Euro Area periphery during the recent Global Financial
Crisis exemplifies the connection that exists between private credit growth and
financial crises on the one hand, and public debt and sovereign crises on the
other. In 2007, Spain had a budget surplus of about 2 percent of GDP and
its general government debt stood below 40 percent of GDP.3 By 2012, Spain’s
government debt had doubled to reach about 90 percent of GDP. What began as
a banking crisis driven by the collapse of the real estate bubble, quickly turned
into a sovereign debt crisis. A similar, possibly even more dramatic, story could
be told for Ireland. The lesson of these episodes seems to be that there was
next to nothing in key indicators of public finances that indicated the imminent
catastrophe. The build-up of financial risks mainly occurred on private balance

sheets. In other words, public and private sector debt cannot be looked at in
isolation. Yet the debate about mounting public debt levels in advanced economies
has often focused on a narrower view of the historical experience, paying little
attention to the development of private credit.
    This section provides an overview of the co-evolution of private and public
sector debt over the last 140 years. The data deployed in this paper are an
update of the dataset compiled in Schularick and Taylor (2012) with more recent
observations, more countries (now including the experiences of Belgium, Finland
and Portugal), and more variables (including data on the fiscal positions and
public debt of individual countries). It is important to note that the new dataset
builds on the research efforts of many economic historians in various countries
and brings data from various sources together in one place. Without the generous
support from colleagues around the world we would not have been able to compile
this novel source for macrohistorical research. In particular, the sample includes
observations from 1870 to 2011 at annual frequency for 17 advanced economies
representing over 50% of world output (and close to 100% of advanced economy
output) more or less consistently throughout the sample period (Maddison 2005).
    Our dataset builds on updated series for bank loans to the non-financial do-
mestic private sector collected from historical sources such as banking supervisory
statistics or national statistical yearbooks. In the subsequent analysis, we will use
this information about the asset side of banks’ balance sheets as a proxy for total
private sector debt growth. The main reason for using this proxy is data availabil-
ity. There are no reliable cross-country historical data for the size of corporate
bond markets or the lending activities of non-bank financial intermediaries. Some
evidence exists to suggest that a substantial share of private debt was held pri-
vately in the 19th century. Although precise numbers are hard to come by, both in
France and the U.K. privately held mortgage debt accounted for up to 10 percent
of GDP around the year 1900; in the U.S. and Germany, an even higher share
of farm and non-farm mortgages was likely held outside financial institutions
(Hoffman, Postel-Vinay, and Rosenthal 2000). In some countries, corporate bond
markets were sizeable too and played an important role in providing finance for
railroad construction and other overhead investment. Yet, despite the importance
of these other forms of financing, bank credit typically accounts for a large and
often predominant form of private sector borrowing in industrial countries.
    Using the comparative national balance sheets calculated by Goldsmith (1985)

                                         4
we can approximate the share of bank credit in total private sector liabilities
over time. The data from Goldsmith sometimes rely on bold assumptions and
are clearly not free of problems, but they allow us to check the broad trends.
Goldsmith’s data show that in 1913 borrowing from banks accounted for about
half of total private debt in many countries. Comparing our bank credit data to
the total financial liabilities given by Goldsmith for the year 1913 yields ratios of
around 50 percent for Belgium and the U.S., and closer to 60 percent for Germany
and the U.K., depending on assumptions about the share of mortgages held
outside the banking system. In 1930 bank credit equally accounted for 50–60
percent of total private sector debt both in the U.S. and the U.K., again based on
Goldsmith’s (1985) national balance sheet data. The comparison becomes easier
after 1945 as flow of funds data in some cases provide alternative information
on total private sector debt which we can compare directly to our series for bank
lending. In the U.S. bank credit accounted for 53 percent of private sector debt in
1960 and close to 60 percent in 1970 and 55 percent in 1980, but has been falling
since then to about 40 percent in 2000.
    Summing up, the share of private sector debt not covered by our database is
likely to have been larger in the years before World War I and in the past two
decades of rapid growth of lending by non-bank intermediaries, but accounted for
a substantial and often dominant share of private sector debt throughout the past
140 years. Moreover, bank and non-bank debt growth rates tended to correlate
closely in the years for which we have detailed data on both.
    Figure 1 displays the private-credit-to-GDP and public-debt-to-GDP ratio ratio
for the 17 countries in the sample, using as metrics our bank lending measure
and general government debt. Several features deserve comment. On the public
debt side, the dominant event in the 20th century is clearly World War II. The
war raised the level of public debt to unprecedented levels, often breaching the
100 percent debt to GDP level (and in the case of Germany, Japan, and the U.K.
shooting past 200 percent). In the reconstruction boom of the Bretton Woods era,
public debt levels gradually declined over the thirty years following the end of the
war, reaching a nadir of about 30–40 percent debt to GDP around the mid-1970s.
Since the late 1970s, public debt levels steadily increased until the mid-1990s
before improving somewhat in the decade before the crisis. The Global Financial
Crisis put an end to this gradual improvement. Fiscal balances have worsened
considerably and public debt has now shot up to levels last seen in World War II.

Notes: The sample period is 1870–2011 and the annual averages are shown for 17 advanced
countries. Total private credit is proxied by total bank loans to the nonfinancial sector, excluding
interbank lending and foreign currency lending based on Schularick and Taylor (2012) and updates
thereto. Public debt is the face value of total general government debt outstanding.


    However, these broad trends in public finance should be set against the startling
trends in private credit discussed by Schularick and Taylor (2012). Leading up
to World War II bank credit to the non-financial sector maintained a fairly stable
relationship with GDP. The median of bank lending to GDP was in the 40–50
percent range for most of the pre–World War II period. Private credit collapsed
in the Depression and during World War II when public debt expanded rapidly.
Bank credit recovered its prewar levels by the 1970s and surged to unprecedented
levels in the following decades, well over 100 percent of GDP in our sample.
(Bearing in mind our earlier discussion of bank versus total private credit, using
Goldsmith’s fragmentary data above, the levels of total private credit are probably
around twice these levels.) The implications of this financialization of Western
economies are profound and have become an active area of investigation.
    Visualizing the development of the two kinds of debts (private and public) in
our sample, Figure 2 shows the size of the banking sector (proxied by total bank


                                                                          6
lending) and public debt for three different years separated by roughly 40 year
intervals covering our sample. The top panel corresponds to 1928, the year before
the Great Depression began in most countries. The middle panel corresponds to
1967, just before the rapid climb in private and public debt discussed earlier and
visible in Figure 1. The bottom panel corresponds to 2007, the year before the
start of the recent Global Financial Crisis. Here bank assets includes loans to the
non-financial sector, plus interbank lending and bank holdings of securities.
    This exercise yields some interesting insights. First, the average level of public
debt to GDP in 1928 was about 60 percent, virtually identical to the average level
in 2007. Put differently, there has been very little change in public debt levels
from the 1920s until to the start of the Global Financial Crisis. Second, the average
level of bank lending to GDP in 2007 has doubled relative to the level seen in 1928,
and seen again in 1967. At those earlier dates few advanced countries had bank
lending over 90% of GDP; by 2007 most of them did. Almost all of the increase
in total (public and private) debt in the course of the 20th century was due to an
expansion of bank lending. Averaging across all 17 advanced countries, the ratio
of public debt to bank lending went from roughly 1:1 in 1928, to 1:1.5 in 1967, and
to 1:2 in 2007. Third, while public debts have increased in most, albeit not all,
Western economies in the late twentieth century, public debt has only risen half as
fast as bank lending since the 1970s.
    Summing up, aggregate debt (the sum of public debt and private credit) has
grown to historically unprecedented levels in Western economies over the last
century and a half. The break with the past is particularly evident since the
1970s. However, the increase in economy-wide debt levels has been dominated
by the behavior of the private sector (bank lending) and not by the public sector:
it is private sector borrowing from banks, not public sector debt, that reached
historically unprecedented levels in Western economies in the early 2000s on the
eve of the recent crisis.


3.   Sources of Financial Instability: Sovereigns versus Banks

Is private or public borrowing the greater risk to financial stability? Historical
evidence suggests that private sector credit booms often end in crises. The 2008
crisis clearly followed this historical pattern. In the U.K., Denmark, and Spain
credit to the private sector expanded by 70 percentage points (pps) to GDP in

the five years preceding the global financial crisis; in Ireland the credit to GDP
ratio rose by even more at over 100 pps. In the U.S. the increase was a still sizable
50 pps between 2002 and 2007. With the benefit of hindsight, the recent events
evidently followed in the footsteps of previous lending booms. The Scandinavian
and Japanese financial crises in the 1980s and 1990s also followed a period of
rapid credit expansion. More than a decade ago, Eichengreen and Mitchener
(2003) called the Great Depression a ”credit boom gone wrong.” In our long-run
dataset, three quarters of all episodes during which credit to GDP rose by more
than 30 pps (or more) over a five-year period ended in a systemic crisis.
    Clearly, not all financial crises fit this classification. Crises have also been
caused by exogenous events such as the effect of weather on agricultural pro-
duction and prices, changes in the terms of trade, or sudden stops in capital
flows. Especially in the 19th century, with the absence of a lender of last resort,
such shocks could quickly lead to banking panics and financial crises. The U.S.
experience in particular was marked by railroad construction booms and busts,
often in tune with the ebbs and flows of foreign capital inflows, and the vagaries
of farm crop prices and production.
    Yet also in the pre–World War I era, credit booms and periods of easy lending
often preceded financial crises. For instance, the 1893 depression was foreshad-
owed by strong growth in non-farm and farm mortgage lending. In the decade
before the 1893 crisis, loans extended by American banks roughly doubled relative
to GDP. Easy global credit fueled a multi-year construction boom in the 1880s,
in places as far afield as Argentina and Australia, that ended when international
capital inflows reversed in the wake of the Baring crisis of 1891. In Germany,
the Gruenderkrach in 1873 and the ensuing Gruenderkrise as well as the 1907
crisis also followed periods of sharp accelerations of credit growth relative to the
previous decades (Tilly 2003). In the 10 years preceding the 1907 financial crisis,
the credit to GDP ratio rose by more than 20 pps. relative to GDP in Germany
and by 30 pps. in neighboring Denmark.
    To study the role of private and public sector debt in generating financial
instability, this section builds on the classification framework developed in Jordà
and Taylor (2011) and Schularick and Taylor (2012) using our expanded long-run
17 country dataset. We start from a probabilistic model that specifies the log-odds
ratio of a financial crisis event occurring in country i, in year t, as a linear function
of lagged controls X, including changes in the private credit and public debt to

                                           9
GDP ratios and their levels,

                               P[Sit = 1| Xit ]
                         log                    = b0i + b1 ( L) Xit + eit ,                      (1)
                               P[Sit = 0| Xit ]

where L is the lag operator and the model allows for country fixed-effects.
    Given the predicted odds from this model, denoted p̂, we then evaluate
whether a classifier or assignment rule, I ( p̂ > c), can do better than the null (a
coin toss) in sorting the binary crisis event data given the threshold c. To proceed
with formal inference, we use the techniques discussed by Jordà and Taylor (2011).
We chart all combinations of true positives against true negatives in the unit box by
varying the threshold c between −∞ and +∞, and create a Correct Classification
Frontier (CCF). A classifier is informative if its CCF is above the null CFF of a
coin toss, which lies on the diagonal. Formally, we can test if the area under the
curve (AUC) exceeds 0.5 for the null to be rejected, and inference on families of
AUCs turns out to be simple as their asymptotic distributions are normal.
    In specifying the log-odds ratio in expression (1), we allow the controls to enter
as 5-year moving averages. This is a parsimonious way to summarize medium-
term fluctuations and to facilitate the investigation of the interaction between
public debt and private credit movements. We report estimates based on a variety
of specifications detailed below. The error term eit is assumed to be well behaved,
and wartime years are omitted from the estimation as in our previous work.
    Dates of systemic financial crises are based on an update to the study by Jordà,
Schularick, and Taylor (2013), which built on the timing of crisis events pioneered
by Bordo et al. (2001) and Reinhart and Rogoff (2009b) for historical times. The
Laeven and Valencia (2008, 2012) dataset of systemic banking crises is the main
source for post-1970 crisis events. Following the definition of Laeven and Valencia
(2012), a financial crisis is characterized as a situation in which there are significant
signs of financial distress and losses in wide parts of the financial system that lead
to widespread insolvencies or significant policy interventions.4 Since 1870, there
have been no less than 94 systemic financial crises in the sample of 17 countries
   4 The important distinction here is between isolated bank failures, such as the collapse of the
Herstatt Bank in Germany in 1975 or the demise of Baring Brothers in the U.K. in 1995, and
system-wide distress as it occurred, for instance, in the crises of the 1890s and the 1930s, in the
Japanese banking crises in the 1990s, or during the Global Financial Crisis of 2008. It is clear that
the lines are not always easy to draw, but the overall results appear robust to variations in the
crisis definitions.

used here. A complete list of systemic financial crises for our dataset can be found
in the data appendix.
    The key results are shown in Table 1 based on 17 advanced countries for the
period 1870 to 2011. Starting with the simple model based on credit used in
Schularick and Taylor (2012, Table 3), we run rival models with public debt added
as an alternative, or in combination with the private credit measure. The question
is, do any of these alternative variables add any information at all?
    The answer seems to be no. In columns (1) and (2), the AUC of the private
credit model for the full sample is 0.68 with a standard error of 0.03. The AUC
of the public debt model is 0.61 with a standard error of 0.03, which is virtually
identical to (and not significantly different from) the AUC of 0.59 for the null
reference model with only country fixed effects. The joint model has an AUC that
is virtually identical to the pure private sector credit model indicating that little
is gained by including public debt information in the long-run. We also checked

                                                11
the robustness of these results by including additional controls for the level of
credit and debt or an interaction between the two, but none of these specifications
affected our key results and the additional controls were not statistically significant,
as the table shows.
    In addition, we ran a number of robustness checks. We included GDP growth
relative to trend as a control to see if crises are more likely in times of slow growth.
We also split the sample to examine whether crisis dynamics differ between pre
and post–World War II. The results remained unaffected by the sample split—
credit remains a statistically significant indicator for financial instability in both
periods. In addition, growth trends turn out not to correlate closely with financial
fragility before World War II. The link is somewhat tighter after World War II, but
fails to be significant at standard thresholds.
    Summing up, the idea that financial crises have their roots in fiscal problems
finds little support over the long sweep of history. Some cases may of course
exist—like Greece today—but these cases have been the exception not the rule.
In general, like Ireland and Spain today, financial crises can be traced back to
developments in the financial sector itself.


 4.    Private Credit and Public Debt over the Business Cycle,
                           1870–2011

One explanation for the results of the previous section could be differences in the
cyclicality of private credit and private debt. How do private credit and public
borrowing evolve over the business cycle? Are they procyclical or countercyclical?
Have the dynamics of private credit and public debt changed in different eras and
under different monetary regimes? And how does the behavior of private credit
and public debt differ between normal cycles and those associated with financial
crises? These are the questions we address in this section.


4.1.   Methods
There are no official data on business cycle turning points going back 140 years
and covering all the countries in our sample. We investigate the business cycle
features of the data by generating two auxiliary dummy variables using the
intuition in the Bry and Boschan (1971) algorithm. At a yearly frequency this


                                          12
algorithm replicates the NBER’s dating of U.S. business cycle peaks and troughs
almost perfectly.
    The algorithm generates dates of peaks and troughs in economic activity for
each country in our sample separately. Conveniently, this simple algorithm does
not require any prior detrending of the data. Using real GDP per capita, a peak
corresponds to a local maximum whereas a trough corresponds to a local minimum.
Therefore, recessions refer to the period between a peak and the following trough,
whereas expansions refer to the period between the trough and the subsequent
peak. By definition, peaks and troughs perfectly alternate one another.
    Using these peaks and troughs we can compute three cyclical statistics of
interest for any given variable: amplitude, duration and rate. Amplitude denotes the
average change between turning points; duration refers to the average interval of
time elapsed between turning points; and rate is simply the ratio of amplitude over
duration and provides a per year rate of change.


4.2.   Five Stylized Facts
Using this dating method, we can sketch the broad contours of output, debt, and
credit in the modern business cycle. Remember that our sample of 17 economies
represents the near-universe of advanced economies for which long-run data exist.
The following five facts about the modern business cycle and encapsulated in
Figure 3 stand out.
    First, as panel (a) shows, the typical expansion has become longer lasting.
Expansions lasted less than 3 years before World War I, almost 4 years between
the two world wars, 6 years during the Bretton-Woods era, and 10 years since. As
expansions have become longer-lasting output per capita amplitudes in expansions
have gradually risen as well. It is striking that recessions have lasted 1 year on
average in all periods, but were deeper during the interwar era.
    Second, the annual rate of real GDP growth in the expansion (amplitude
divided by duration) has gradually declined. It averaged 3.5 percent per annum
(p.p.a.) before World War I, peaked at 5.2 p.p.a. in the interwar period, declined
to 4.3 p.p.a. in the Bretton Woods era, and currently averages about 2.7 p.p.a. In
other words, business cycles last longer but annual growth rates have come down.
    Third, private bank lending is distinctly pro-cyclical. It grows faster in ex-
pansions than in recessions, and increasingly so. In a typical cycle of the post

Bretton Woods era real private credit per capita increased by about 55 percent,
about double the growth rate of per capita GDP (see Figure 3(b), column 1).
    Fourth, public debt tends to grow faster in recessions than in expansions,
indicating there is some counter cyclical stance to pubic borrowing. Moreover,
the Bretton-Woods period stands out as the only period where public debt was
reduced in both expansions and recessions (Figure 3(b), column 2). In the im-
mediate postwar decades countries gradually reduced their World War II debt
obligations aided by the reconstruction boom and tight financial system control.
    Fifth, the combined sum of public debt and private credit (Figure 3(b), column
3) has grown at an unprecedented pace in the past four decades. It is evident from
the chart that the 1970s mark a major break in the dynamics of aggregate debt.
The combination of strong private credit growth and higher public borrowing put
the annual growth of total liabilities at 8.5 p.p.a. in expansions and 4.0 p.p.a in
recessions, a remarkable development in the history of the last 140 years.
    In sum, we find that business cycles have gradually become longer lasting and
much more credit-intensive. Private borrowing tends to be strongly pro-cyclical
while public borrowing displays some counter cyclical elements in advanced
economies. In modern economic history, the Bretton-Woods period stands out
as the only period of sustained public debt reduction, both in expansions and
recessions.


4.3.   Booms, Busts, and Crises
Not all cycles are created equal. Some cycles end in financial crises and severe
recessions, while others do not. The natural next step is to ask how the cyclical
behavior of credit differs between normal cycles and those that end in severe
financial crises.
    We therefore introduce a distinction between recessions that coincide with a
major financial crisis—we call these financial crisis recessions—and those without
major financial disruptions normal recessions . More precisely, we call a recession
financial if a major financial crisis erupts within a two year window around the
peak (the start of the recession). This classification is summarized in a data
appendix table and extends prior work in Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor (2013)
with added data for Belgium, Finland and Portugal and the post-2008 years, and
some refinements to the definitions of financial crisis dates.


                                        15
    Table 2 summarizes the universe of recessions and their classification using this
approach. The table is broken into three panels. Panel (a) corresponds to the full
sample, panel (b) to the pre-World War II sample, and panel (c) to the post-World
War II sample. The full sample contains 269 recession episodes of which 63 are
classified as financial crisis recessions and 206 are classified as normal recessions.
The proportion varies with each sub-sample. In the pre-World War II era 1 in
3 recessions was a financial crisis whereas after World War II the proportion
decreases to about 1 in 5.
    The table also includes information on changes in private credit, public debt ratios,
and public debt levels measured respectively as the percentage point change per
annum in private credit and public debt over GDP, and as a fraction of GDP, each
measured over the business cycle expansion. With respect to private credit, the
key result arising from the table is that private credit grows twice as rapidly before
financial crisis recessions than before normal recessions, regardless of the era.
From a business cycle perspective, this clearly reinforces the earlier finding that
financial crises tend to be preceded by a rapid accumulation of private liabilities.
    The public debt to GDP ratio, by contrast, tends to decline before normal and
financial crisis recessions. In the pre-World War II sample, public debt declines at
a rate of about 1 p.p.a. before normal recessions and 0.3 p.p.a. before financial
crisis recessions. After World War II the difference between normal and financial
cycles is starker. Whereas debt declines by a similar amount in normal recessions,
about 0.9 p.p.a, it increases at a rate of about 0.4 p.p.a. before financial crisis
recessions. However, this result is driven by the absence of financial crises under
the Bretton Woods System and the parallel reduction in public debt in the postwar
reconstruction boom. In fact, looking at debt levels as a fraction of GDP there are
hardly any difference across eras or across the type of recession.
    Summing up, we find that business cycles associated with financial crises
tend to exhibit much more credit-intensive expansions. Across all countries and
periods, public debt tends to decline in expansions that end in financial crises,
but these declines are small. The lesson seems to be that, at least in advanced
economies, the build-up of financial fragility typically occurs on private sector
balance sheets, not through the government’s budget.

      Table 2: Summary statistics for recessions, private credit, and public debt variables

Financial crisis and normal recession indicators are binary 0-1. Changes in private credit
and public debt are in percentage points change per year in the prior expansion. Public
debt level is the ratio relative to GDP at the business cycle peak.

       5.   Debt Booms and Overhangs: Private and Public

What does the long-run historical evidence say about the prevalence and effects of
private and public debt booms and overhangs? Do high levels of public debt affect
business cycle dynamics, as the public debt overhang literature argues? Are the
effects of either variety of debt overhang more pronounced after financial crisis
recessions? These are the questions that we explore in the next few sections. First,
some background on the existing tensions in the literature.
    The empirical observation that recoveries from financial crisis recessions seem
to be special (see e.g. Cerra and Saxena, 2008; Reinhart and Rogoff 2009a; and
Claessens, Kose and Terrones, 2011) has prompted researchers to look deeper into
the causes of slow recoveries. One key theme is that high and/or newly-elevated
levels of private indebtedness—a “debt overhang”—may hold back economic
recovery after financial crises. In the crisis, agents in the economy suddenly
realize that asset values were too high and leverage limits too lax. After this
“Minsky moment” households (or companies) repair their balance sheets and
adjust their debt levels. This deleveraging process in turn may weigh on aggregate
demand and be responsible for the sluggish recovery (Koo 2008; Mian, Rao, Sufi
2011; Mian and Sufi 2010).
    Krugman and Eggertsson (2012) present a model with heterogeneous house-
holds: some households are patient creditors, others are impatient debtors. When
credit conditions tighten in a crisis, indebted households have to cut back on
consumption to adjust to the new borrowing constraint. The real interest rate
needs to fall to induce higher spending by patient households, but the zero lower
bound may prevent full adjustment in the short run. Hall (2011), Guerrieri and
Lorenzoni (2011), as well as Philippon and Midrigan (2011), develop similar ideas.
Jordà, Schularick and Taylor (2011, 2013) demonstrate in related empirical work
that private debt overhang effects after credit booms are a regular feature of the
business cycle.
    Another strand of the literature warns of the effects of the overhang from
public, not private, borrowing. Reinhart et al. (2012) studied 26 episodes where
public debt to GDP accounted for more than 90 percent of GDP on a sustained
basis and found evidence that these public debt overhang episodes were associated
with a substantial slowdown of GDP growth relative to low-debt years. These
results echoed those of a much-debated earlier contribution by Reinhart and


                                        18
Rogoff (2010) that presented evidence that above a certain public debt to GDP
threshold the overhang of public debt goes hand in hand with a substantial
slowdown in economic growth.
   The empirical approach that we follow to address these issues is multifaceted.
After a short presentation of our key statistical methods (section 5.1), we will
revisit the historical evidence on private credit booms (section 5.2). More precisely,
we study if and how private credit booms influence the depth of recession and the
speed of the recovery. We find that private credit build-up during the expansion
tends to make the recession deeper and longer lasting, confirming and thus
extending the results in Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor (2011, 2013).
   In the next step (section 5.3), we take a closer look at the effects of public debt
booms. Importantly, we improve upon previous studies of public debt boom
episodes by moving beyond a simple unconditional analysis and including a
number of additional macroeconomic controls that could account for the much-
debated low growth correlation seen during times of high public indebtedness.
   Lastly (section 5.4), we look at the interaction between private credit buildups
and the level of public debt. We find that high levels of public debt exacerbate
the effects of private sector deleveraging. The combination of private sector
credit booms with high levels of public sector debt typically leads to considerably
deeper recessions and slower recoveries. Our results therefore lend support to
precautionary fiscal policy regimes to keep public sector debt low during normal
times—not because these debts necessarily endanger growth, but for a more
narrow, specific reason: to avoid the need for a parallel retrenchment of private
and public sector borrowing in times of crisis, and in the associated and typically
prolonged recession which follows.


5.1.   Statistical Design
The statistical toolkit we use relies on the local projection (LP) approach introduced
in Jordà (2005). Several reasons justify this choice.
    The sample of data available may appear abundant for most statistical analyses.
However, we are interested in characterizing a number of dynamic multipliers
from a multivariate perspective. Standard models are far too parametrically
intensive for the available sample. Moreover, some of the multipliers that we
calculate allow for asymmetries and nonlinearities in the form of modulation


                                         19
via the level of debt at the start of the recession. These features are difficult to
model with assumptions about the underlying global data generating process.
And in any case, this would impose numerical burdens that our sample cannot
easily bear. Instead, direct local analysis of the multipliers of interest using the LP
method is straightforward.
    Let K denote the dimension of the vector of macroeconomic aggregates of
interest, M denote the cross-section dimension of countries, and T denote the time
dimension of the sample. For any variable k = 1, ..., K we want to characterize
the change of the variable from the start of the recession to some distant horizon
h = 1, ..., H, or the change from time t( p) to time t( p) + h where p refers to peak.
That is, t( p) denotes the time period that corresponds to the pth peak or recession.
We focus on the change from the start of the recession to some future period so
that the results can be directly compared with results available in the literature
for unconditional responses.
    Let yitk ( p) denote a given macroeconomic aggregate observed for country
i = 1, ..., M at time t( p). The h period ahead change is denoted ∆h yitk ( p)+h . Some-
times ∆h yitk ( p)+h will refer to the percentage point change, given by the h-step
difference in 100 times the logarithm of the variable. An example is when yitk
refers to 100 times the logarithm of real GDP per capita. Other times it may refer
to the simple h-step difference, such as when yitk refers to an interest rate. These
differences are easily understood from the context and we abstain from introduc-
ing further notation to indicate the distinction. The macroeconomic aggregates yitk
are consolidated into the vector Yit = [∆y1it ... ∆yitJ yitJ +1 ... yitK ]0 . The first J elements
of this vector refer to variables expressed in first differences, such as 100 times
the logarithm of real GDP per capita, and the remaining K − J variables refer to
variables in the levels, such as an interest rate.
    Lastly, denote xit( p) the accumulated change of the variable x in the expansion
that ended at time t( p) for country i. Perturbations of this variable from its long-
run mean, e.g., accelerations of borrowing, will define the experiments whose
effects on other macroeconomic variables we wish to evaluate. The value of this
variable remains fixed for any value of h over which ∆h yitk ( p)+h is considered.
    Consequently, the path of the recession and the recovery, conditional on
information up to time t( p)—and denoted Yit( p) , Yit( p)−1 , ...—will vary depending
on xit( p) and we will be interested in characterizing how these recovery paths


                                               20
change as xit( p) changes from a given baseline level that here we take as the
long-run mean, xi , with respect to an experimental level xi + δ.
   That is, the average cumulated response for each variable in the K-dimensional
vector of macroeconomic aggregates is defined as:
                                                                                          
CR ∆h yitk ( p)+h , δ = Eit( p) ∆h yitk ( p)+h | xit( p) = xi + δ; Yit( p) , Yit( p)−1 , ...
                                                                   
 − Eit( p) ∆h yitk ( p)+h | xit( p) = xi ; Yit( p) , Yit( p)−1 , ... , k = 1, ..., K; h = 1, ..., H.                                   (2)

Under the assumption of linearity this cumulated response is simply the sum of
the 1 to h impulse responses:
                                                                                                                     
  IR       ∆yitk ( p)+h , δ       = Eit( p)        ∆yitk ( p)+h | xit( p)
                                                                       = xi + δ; Yit( p) , Yit( p)−1 , ...
                                                                             
   − Eit( p) ∆yitk ( p)+h | xit( p)           = xi ; Yit( p) , Yit( p)−1 , ... , k = 1, ..., K; h = 1, ..., H;                         (3)

that is,
                                                                       h                               
                                  CR       ∆h yitk ( p)+h , δ       =   ∑ IR           ∆yitk ( p)+h , δ       .                        (4)
                                                                        j =1

Expression (3) can be recognized as the definition of an impulse response in Jordà
(2005). The reason to work with expression (2) rather than with expressions (3)
and (4) is to provide a direct measure of the cumulated responses that do not rely
on the probably implausible assumption of linearity. To proceed we need a way
to estimate expression (2).                     
    In practice we estimate CR ∆h yitk ( p)+h , δ by assuming that the expectation
can be approximated by a local projection. In particular, this approximation can be
obtained by estimating the following sequence of fixed-effects panel regressions:
                                                                                                                                        

where αik are country fixed effects, u is the error term, θ N
                                                            k is the common constant

associated with normal recessions ditN( p) = 1 (0 otherwise); θ Fk is the common
constant associated with financial crisis recessions ditF ( p) = 1 (0 otherwise); a
history of l lags for the control variables Yit( p)−l with coefficient matrices Γkh,l .


                                                                    21
When xit( p) = xi then θ N k and θ k measure the average cumulated response in
                                   F
normal versus financial crisis recessions. Recall that these unconditional means
differ in the sample, and allowing for this distinction is consistent with our earlier
findings. When xit( p) = xi + δ, the marginal effect of the experiment δ is given by
the coefficients βkh,N and βkh,F depending on whether the recession is normal (N )
or financial ( F ). Here we could have assumed that βkh,N = βkh,F but we prefer to
omit this restriction, and allow the data to speak out.
    Our decision to use a panel estimator with fixed effects allows cross-country
variation in the typical path and in the average response to δ. This is a convenient
formulation that accounts for variation in the degree of financialization and other
macroeconomic differences across countries while still identifying the common
component of the response.
    If δ were exogenously determined, then expression (2) would provide the
causal effect of an increase x on the outcome y at time h. Formally, we cannot
claim this to be the case. However, we note that the amount of private credit or
public debt is a given quantity at the start of the recession. There is no direct
feedback mechanism except for a potential anticipation during the expansion
on the severity of an impending recession. We employ regression control on
observables Y with set of 8 macroeconomic variables and their lags to soak up
variation in economic outcomes that can be explained by conditions experienced
during the expansion.
    The Y variables that we include as controls are: (1) the growth rate of real
GDP per capita; (2) the growth rate of real loans per capita; (3) the consumer
price index (CPI) inflation rate; (4) the growth rate of real investment per capita;
(5) the growth rate of real public debt per capita; (6) short-term interest rates
on government securities (usually 3 months or less in maturity); (7) long-term
interest rates on government securities (usually 5 years or more in maturity); and
(8) the current account to GDP ratio. Note that our set of controls Y will include
data on lending and public debt, which will tend to attenuate any effects that we
measure through x. That is, we stack the odds against finding that credit or debt
have any independent effects on the shape of the recession and recovery.
    These variables are the controls included in the vector Y defined earlier. Start-
ing with private credit, we use one times the standard deviation of private credit
growth from its long-run average as our ”experimental” x variable. In other words,
we track how credit booms in the expansion change the conditional forecasts of

                                         22
other macroeconomic variables in the subsequent recession and recovery.
    Expression (5) serves as the platform from which we develop a more ambitious
exploration of the effects of high public debt levels and the interaction between
private and public debt overhangs. These extensions will require modifications to
our main estimating equation in expression (5) that we discuss as each experiment
is introduced below.


5.2.   Private Credit Booms
We start by determining how strong growth of private credit to GDP in the ex-
pansion alters the expected course of an economy through recession and recovery.
We look at the effect of a one standard deviation perturbation from the long-run
average across all countries in the annual change of private credit in the expansion.
This experiment builds on the analysis in Jordà, Schularick and Taylor (2013) but
relies on a larger and longer sample. The core results from that study remain
largely intact.
    Figure 4 reports the cumulated responses calculated using expressions (2) and
(5) for output, investment, prices, bank lending, and public debt. Price is the CPI
level; all other variables are real per capita. Table 3 reports the specific coefficient
estimates displayed for the responses of real GDP per capita in the full sample
(top row and first column in the figure).
    We begin by discussing the responses displayed in Figure 4. The top row
refers to the full sample analysis whereas the bottom row refers to the post–World
War II sample. In a normal recession output declines in year one about 1–2
percent, recovers its original pre-recession level by year two, and then continues
to grow in years three to five. However, financial crisis recessions are considerably
more painful. On average, they only reach bottom (–5 percent) around year two
or three and output does not quite recover its pre-recession level by year five.
If there is overhang from a previous credit boom, the recession can be about
two percentage points deeper at the through and the recovery is slower. Real
investment, can decline 20–30 percent in crisis recessions. Inflation tends to be
more repressed in financial crises and slightly more so after credit booms. Lending
activity continues mostly unabated during a normal recession, but it declines in
a financial crisis especially after a credit boom. Finally, public debt accelerates
faster in financial crisis recessions. All results are quite intuitive and echo recent

sample 3 out of 4 recessions are of the normal type, and 1 out of 4 is a financial
crisis recession. A formal test of the equality of the average responses in normal
and financial crisis recessions is provided in the row labeled Normal = Financial
(average effect). As the p-values show, there is unequivocal statistical evidence that
the paths of the recession/recovery differ considerably depending on the type of
recession.
    The two rows labeled Private credit report the marginal effect of private credit
accumulation during the boom on the average path of output growth in the
recession/recovery. The row labeled Normal = Financial (private credit) reports the
p-values of the test that the marginal effect differs by type of recession. Although
the effect in financial crisis recessions is about twice as large as the effect in normal
recessions and economically important (sometimes nearly one percentage point
less real GDP per capita growth per standard deviation), there is insufficient

                                                  25
evidence in the sample to distinguish the two statistically.
    As a robustness check we consider a sub-sample analysis based on post-World
War II data, although this sample only contains 11 financial crisis recessions. We
have already excluded the two World War periods from the analysis, but the
interwar period was unusually turbulent and marked by the Great Depression.
The bottom row of Figure 4 replicates the analysis in the top row using the shorter
and more contemporary sample from 1946 to 2011.
    Broadly speaking, the results hold up qualitatively and quantitatively. Financial
crisis recessions are more painful and take longer to recover from than normal
recessions although their severity has been somewhat tempered. However, the
marginal effect of private credit build up during the boom is not more noticeable.
The buildup of public debt is somewhat more rapid, perhaps explaining why
financial crisis recessions are somewhat less severe. As a result, the contraction in
bank lending is also somewhat less severe.
    Overall, the responses confirm that financial crises are more painful and
take longer to recover from than normal recessions even after conditioning on
macroeconomic aggregates and their lags. Moreover, a large accumulation of
private sector debt during the preceding expansion—a private sector credit boom—
tends to make recessions and recoveries worse.5


5.3.      Public Debt Overhangs
Using historical data for developed economies starting in the early 1800s, Reinhart
and Rogoff (2012) find that the larger the ratio of public debt to GDP is today,
the lower output growth will tend to be in the future. In this section we take off
from the main premise in Reinhart and Rogoff (2012) and ask if the level of public
debt relative to GDP has an effect on the expected path of the economy through
recession and recovery.
   Put differently, does high public debt make recessions worse and recoveries
slower? To estimate these effects, we can modify expression (5) above to measure
how the level of debt to GDP modulates the average response in the recession
conditional on controls.
   Specifically, we now estimate the following sequence of fixed-effects panel
   5 We  ran similar experiments for the accumulation of public debt in the expansion, as opposed
to the level which we study in the next section, but did not find strong effects.

where git( p) denotes the level of debt to GDP for country i at the start to the
recession at time t( p).
    Using expression (6) we then consider three experiments: the debt level is one
standard deviation below the mean, the debt level is at the mean, or the debt level
is at one standard deviation above the mean. Recall that from Table 2 that the
standard deviation of public debt is about 0.35 (it varies slightly depending on
the sample) and the average public debt level is about 0.5 as a fraction of GDP (or
50 percent of GDP). Thus the three experiments refer to situations in which debt
is about 15, 50, and 85 percent of GDP, what we may call low, medium and high
levels of debt relative to GDP (in these experiments, and below, perturbations in
public debt are relative to the country mean). We continue to allow the mean to
be country-specific to allow for variation in addition to the fixed effect.
    The results of these experiments are reported in Figure 5 for normal and
financial crisis recessions, using the full sample. Figure 5 displays the trajectory of
output, investment, inflation, bank lending and public debt in a normal recession
and in a financial crisis recession.
    The top row displays typical trajectories in a normal recession. The solid line
is the trajectory when the debt level at the start of the recession is at its long-run
average (along with a 95% confidence region); the dotted line when debt is one
standard deviation below mean; and the dashed line when debt is one standard
deviation above mean. The bottom row maintains the solid line as the trajectory
in a normal recession with the debt level at the start of the recession at is long-run
average (with a 95% confidence region) and then adds three additional trajectories,
all corresponding to a financial crisis under the three different assumptions on
the level of debt. As before, the dotted line corresponds to debt at one standard
deviation below the mean; the solid line (without confidence region) refers to
debt at the long-run average; and the long-dashed line corresponds to debt at one
standard deviation above the long-run average.
    Consider the trajectories for output first. Within the confines of our sample

Notes: Each path shows local projections of the cumulative change relative to peak for years 1–5 of
the recession/recovery period under different experiments. Top row refers to normal recessions.
Solid line with 95% confidence region refers to public debt at the historical mean and hence
replicates the average response reported in Figure 4. The dotted line corresponds to public debt
one standard deviation below mean, and the dashed line to public debt one standard deviation
above the mean. The bottom row refers to financial crisis recessions. The solid line with confidence
95% region replicates the trajectory displayed in the first row. As with the normal recessions, the
dotted line corresponds to public debt one standard deviation below mean, the solid line to public
debt at the mean, and the dashed line to public debt one standard deviation above the mean.
These results are conditional on the full set of macroeconomic aggregates and their lags, with

and our methods, the level of public debt at the start of the recession does not
meaningfully alter the path of the economy in normal times. The trajectory of
output when debt is low, at its long-run mean or high is virtually the same. Much
the same is generally true in financial crisis recessions for real GDP per capita, but

Notes: *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1. Robust standard errors (clustered by country) in paren-
theses. Results correspond to local projections of cumulative change in 100 times log real GDP
per capita relative to peak for years 1–5 of the recession/recovery. Public debt (followed by either
Normal or Financial) refers to the marginal effect of the public debt level above the historical mean
on the average path in Normal and Financial crisis recessions, respectively. Normal = Financial
tests the null that coefficients for each type of recession are the same for the intercept terms in
the row labeled average, and for the interaction terms in the row marked Public debt. In each
case the p-value of the tests is provided. The local projections are conditional on the full set of
macroeconomic aggregates and their lags, with coefficients not reported. See text.


the behavior of prices, lending and debt, and somewhat less so investment, display
notable differences. The higher the debt level at the start of the recession, the
more lending contracts and the more inflation increases. Interestingly, debt grows
at the same rate for the first two years regardless of debt levels, but thereafter high
levels of debt at the start of the recession result in considerable fiscal retrenchment
relative to when debt is low to begin with. Although the decline in lending and
debt do not appear to have much of an effect on real GDP per capita, there is a
small effect on lending starting in year three that is consistent with this pattern.
    Table 4 provides a detailed look at the coefficient estimates behind the re-
sponses reported for real GDP per capita in Figure 5. Specifically, the first two
rows correspond to the average response of real GDP per capita in Normal and


                                                 29
Financial crisis recessions and are relative similar in magnitude to the first two
rows in Table 3. The next two rows, labeled Public Debt and either Normal or
Financial, contain the marginal effect of public debt on the severity of the recession
and are estimated with a great deal of imprecision. As an example, if public debt is
running 35 percentage points of GDP (or 1 s.d.) below its long-run country-mean
at the recession peak, then the predicted path of the recession (the dotted line in
the first row and first column of Figure 5) can be calculated for each year as the
sum of the coefficient from the first row in Table 4 minus 0.35 times the coefficient
in the third row.
    Table 4 contains two formal tests. The line Normal = Financial (average) reports
the p-values of the per year test of equality that the average trajectory in recessions
is the same whether the recession is normal or a financial crisis recession. As in
Table 3 this null is easily rejected. Below it, the line Normal = Financial (public)
provides the p-values of the test that the marginal effect of the level of public debt
at the start of the recession has the same effect whether in normal or financial
crisis recessions. These coefficients are imprecisely estimated in the given sample
and the null cannot be rejected.
    We find evidence that although high levels of public debt do not significantly
affect the path of economies out of recessions, there are some interesting differ-
ences as to how the recovery occurs. The sample is noisy and we are unable
to confirm the results of Reinhart et al. (2012). However, our more granular
conditional estimations suggest that the negative effects of high public debt are
more visible on other macroeconomic variables. Lending seems to be particularly
strongly affected. When debt is low, the recovery from financial crisis recessions
seems to be characterized by more aggressive fiscal policy. When debt is high,
the opposite happens and there appears to be a considerable amount of fiscal
consolidation after two years.
    Interestingly, in the context of the current debate it seems that the austerity
measures pursued in high debt countries of the euro area are consistent with
the historical experience. The question that remains unanswered is whether this
result remains when the recession is preceded by a credit boom. We investigate
this question in the next section.

5.4.       Private Credit Booms with Public Debt Overhangs
So far we have established that private credit booms can be a real drag on the
economy but that the same cannot be said of high levels of public debt, at least
in times of financial crises. What if both come together? Are the after-effects of
private sector credit booms compounded when the public sector is constrained
by already high levels of public debt? The goal of this section is to look at the
effects of private credit booms and the effects of public debt overhangs discussed
in Reinhart et al. (2012) jointly. We will see that, broadly speaking, the interaction
matters. Both in normal and financial crisis recessions the drag from a private
credit boom is made worse by high levels of public debt.
    Looking at private and public debt jointly can be easily accomplished within
the statistical design presented in expressions (2), (5) and (6). Specifically, consider
extending this last expression as follows:
                                                                                                                  

                                                                              

       +δh,N dit( p) git( p) − gi xit( p) − xi + δh,F dit( p) git( p) − gi xit( p) − xi

                       l =0


The coefficients βkh,N and βkh,F capture the effect of accumulation of private sector
liabilities during the expansion. The coefficients have a similar interpretation
                                                                k
to the coefficients in expression (5). Next, the coefficients φh,N        k capture
                                                                   and φh,F
the effect of the level of debt at the start of the recession as discussed in the
previous section. Notice that the debt level g enters as deviations from country
                                                                                  k
specific means to allow for cross-country variation. Finally, the coefficients δh,N
       k correspond to the interaction of the public debt level with the private
and δh,F
credit overhang term. Their purpose is to allow for a modulated effect on x. That
is, these coefficients allow us to consider whether the effects of a private credit
binge during the expansion aggravate a financial crisis recession even more when
public debt levels are high to begin with.

the recession/recovery period under different experiments. Top row refers to normal recessions,
bottom row refers to financial crisis recessions. The solid lines depict the average response in
each type of recession with all variables at their mean, and in the normal case with a 95 percent
confidence region. The various non-solid lines indicate how the path of the economy differs with
two simultaneous perturbations: when private credit grows at the average level plus one standard
deviation in the previous expansion; and, in addition, when public debt is set one standard
deviation below mean, at the mean, or at one standard deviation above the mean. Each of these
public debt levels is represented with a dotted line when debt below mean, a short-dashed line
when debt is at the mean, and a long-dashed line when debt is above the mean. These results are
conditional on the full set of macroeconomic aggregates and their lags, with paths evaluated at
the means. See text.

debt to GDP at the start of the recession. The various dashed lines indicate how
the path of the economy differs with public debt one standard deviation below
the country mean (about 15 percent of GDP on average), at the long-run country
mean (about 50 percent of GDP on average), or one standard deviation above the
country mean (about 85 percent of GDP on average). Each of these debt levels
is represented with a dotted line when debt is at zero, a short-dashed line when
debt is at the mean, and a long-dashed line when debt is at twice the mean. In all
figures the average path of normal recessions is displayed as a solid line along
with a 95 percent confidence region.
     Let’s start with the top row. Broadly speaking, these five charts convey a
very similar message to the one discovered in the previous section. When the
experiment focuses on public debt levels above the historical average there are
few differences in real economic outcomes except for the paths of inflation and
lending.
     However, the real story appears in the second row, in financial crisis recessions.
It is clear that high initial levels of public debt to GDP can be a considerable drag
on the recovery if they coincide with a substantial private credit overhang. When
an above average private sector credit boom is unwound high levels of public
debt are problematic. Output stays severely depressed for many years and is far
off the previous peak even in year five.
     The behavior of investment reinforces this message of a potentially dangerous
cocktail of private and public sector debt overhang: after private sector credit
booms, high levels of public debt are associated with substantial shortfalls in
investment coinciding with prolonged declines in bank lending.
     Table 5 provides a granular look at the response of real GDP per capita. The
first two rows (labeled Normal recession and Financial recession respectively) contain
the coefficients summarizing the average path of each type of recession and
correspond rather closely to the coefficients reported in Tables 3 and 4. The row
labeled Normal = Financial (average) again reports the p-value of the test of the
null hypothesis that the average paths for each type of recession are statistically
indistinguishable. That hypothesis is soundly rejected as it was earlier.
     The next two rows, labeled Private credit report the coefficients capturing
the marginal effect of deviations of bank lending from its mean in normal and
financial crisis recessions. Again, these coefficients can be compared directly to the
coefficients reported in Table 3. A test of the null hypothesis that the private credit

                                          33
coefficients are equivalent in normal and financial crisis recessions is provided
in the row labeled Normal = Financial (credit). Here the null cannot be rejected
at conventional significance levels even though the coefficients in financial crisis
recessions are between two and three times larger and economically large. By
years 4 and 5, and additional one standard deviation above the mean is associated
with over two percentage points lower real per capita GDP growth.
    The next two rows of coefficients, labeled Public debt, are comparable to the
similarly labeled coefficients in Table 4. Compared to that table, the reported
negative effects in financial crisis recessions are larger, more accurately estimated,
and economically, quite different to the coefficients in a normal recession. A
formal test of equality of the coefficients across type of recession is provided in
the row labeled Normal = Financial (debt). The null is rejected for year 2 at the
90% confidence level and year 3 at the 95% but otherwise, the sample provides
insufficient evidence to reject the null. The block of coefficient estimates concludes
with two rows of coefficients reporting the interaction terms and labeled Public
debt × private credit. A few of the coefficients are statistically different from
zero. However, economically speaking the coefficient estimates suggest that this
interaction term captures an important friction for the recovery. A simultaneous
deviation of private credit and public debt one standard deviation above the mean
can result in about five percent less cumulative growth in real GDP per capita by
year five (an average of one percentage point per annum) through this mechanism
alone. A test of the null hypothesis that the effect is the same regardless of the
type of recession is reported in the row labeled Normal = Financial (interaction).
The null is easily rejected in years 2, 4, and 5, with p-values of 0.10, 0.02, and 0.02,
respectively, but not for years 1 and 3.
    The table includes two final formal hypotheses tests. These are designed to
evaluate the null that the effect of debt and the effect of the interaction term are
simultaneously insignificant. The rows reporting the p-values of the test in normal
and financial crisis recessions are labeled as Debt (marginal & interacted). We find
some evidence against the null, as in the case of normal recessions, the p-value
in year 1 is 0.02, and in financial crisis recessions the p-values for years three to
five are 0.09, 0.09, and 0.05 respectively. The sample sizes are rather limited and
insufficient to provide forceful all around statistical evidence. However, although
imprecisely estimated, the economic effects are much too large to be dismissed.
    In sum, high levels of public debt can be dangerous and our findings argue in

support of keeping public debt low for precautionary reasons. In particular, high
public debt is associated with prolonged spells of weak growth in financial crisis
recessions, potentially because the lack of fiscal space undercuts the government’s
ability to counteract the drag from private sector balance sheet repair.


                               6.   Conclusion

This paper provides a first look at over 100 years of the inter-relationships of
private credit and sovereign debt. We end with five main conclusions.
    First, while public debt has grown in most countries in recent decades, the
extraordinary growth of private sector debt (bank loans) is chiefly responsible for
the strong increase of total liabilities in Western economies. About two thirds of
the increase in total economy debt originated in the private sector. Shadow bank
liabilities, important in some cases like the U.S. and U.K. amplify this conclusion.
Sovereign and bank debts have generally been inversely correlated over the long
run, but have increased jointly since the 1970s. In modern times, the Bretton-
Woods period stands out as the only period of sustained public debt reduction,
both in expansions and recessions.
    Second, in advanced economies financial stability risks originate primarily
in the private sector rather than in the public sector. To understand the driving
forces of financial crises one has to study private borrowing and its problems.
In the very long run, if we run a horse race between the impact of changes or
run-ups in private credit (bank loans) and sovereign debt as a predictor of financial
crisis and its associated distress, private credit is the more significant predictor;
sovereign debt adds little predictive information. This fits with the events of 2008
well: with the exception of fiscal malfeasance in Greece most other advanced
countries did not have obvious public debt problems ex ante. Of course, ex post, the
fierce financial crisis recession would wreak havoc on public finances via crashing
revenues and rising cyclical expenditures.
    Third, with a broader and longer sample we confirm that private debt over-
hangs are a regular feature of the modern business cycle. We find that once a
country does enter a recession, whether it is an ordinary type or a financial-crisis
type of recession, if it carries the legacy of a large private credit boom then the
post-recession output path of the economy is typically adversely affected with
slower growth.

                                         36
    Fourth, our new data also allow us to see the distinct contribution of public
debt overhangs. We find evidence that high levels of public debt matter for the
path of economies out of recessions, confirming the results of Reinhart et al. (2012).
But the negative effects of high public debt on the performance of the economy
arise specifically after financial crises and in particular when private borrowing
also ran high. While high levels of public debt make little difference in normal
times, entering a financial crisis recession with an elevated level of public debt
exacerbates the effects of private sector deleveraging and typically leads to a
prolonged period of sub-par economic performance.
    Fifth, from a macroeconomic policy standpoint these findings could inform
ongoing efforts to devise better guides to monetary, fiscal, and financial policies
going forward, at a time when policymakers are searching for new approaches in
the aftermath of the Great Recession. On the private credit side, many countries
and international bodies are considering or implementing rules or guides for
macro prudential policies that incorporate private credit indicators. On the fiscal
side, sovereign stresses in advanced countries have also brought to the fore
questions of fiscal space and what limits on average or over the cycle may be
usefully employed, whether, for example, in the form of fiscal rules or in better
planning the timing of austerity. Our results give some historical underpinnings
to these efforts: when private or public debts are elevated the dangers posed by
crises and deep recession appear to be amplified.
    Three key facts emerge from our analysis of around 150 recessions and recov-
eries since 1870: first, in a normal recession and recovery real GDP per capita
falls by 1.5 percent and takes only 2 years to regain its previous peak, but in a
financial crisis recession the drop is typically 5 percent and it takes over 5 years
to regain the previous peak; second, the output drop is even worse and recovery
even slower when the crisis is preceded by a credit boom; and third, the path of
recovery is worse still when a credit-fueled crisis coincides with elevated public
debt levels. The current experience in the advanced economies provides a useful
out-of-sample comparison, and meshes closely with these historical patterns.

Appendix 2: Dates of Normal and Financial Crisis Recessions,
                         1870–2006
The local projections empirical analysis in the paper employs business cycle peaks from 1870 to
2006, excluding windows around the two world wars, with projections out to 5 years ahead, with
the annual panel sample data, with the last year’s projections from 2006 ending in 2011. As a
result, peaks from the 2007–2011 period are not used in the sample, meaning that the empirical
work does not include the Global Financial Crisis as an in-sample event. The peak dates which are
used are as shown in the table below, where “N” denotes a normal business cycle peak, and “F”
denotes a peak associated with a systemic financial crisis (a crisis within ±2 years of the peak).
The dating method follows Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor (2011) and uses the Bry and Boschan
(1971) algorithm. See text.
