             The Record and Improvability of Economic Forecasting




                                   ABSTRACT



     Have macroeconomic forecasts grown more or less accurate over time? This

paper assembles, examines, and interprets evidence bearing on this question.

Contrary to some critics, there are no indications that U.S. forecasts have

grown systematically worse, that is, less accurate, more biased, or both.

Neither do any definite trends in a positive direction emerge from comparisons

of annual and quarterly multiperiod forecasts and time-series projections for

the principal aggregative variables.

     The argument is developed and to some extent documented that major

failures of forecasting are related to the incidence of slowdowns and

contractions in general economic activity. Not only the forecasts of real GNP

growth and unemployment but also those of nominal GNP growth and inflation

often go seriously wrong when such setbacks occur. Forecasters tend to rely

heavily on the persistence of trends in spending, output, and the price

level. More attention to data and techniques that are sensitive to business

cycle movements and turning points could help improve their record.

                           I. Questions and Problems

     The question "Is Better Forecasting Possible?", would seem to be of

critical importance to both makers and users of macroeconomic predictions.

Indeed, the ability to produce accurate predictions of the course of' the

economy in the near-term future is probably the main criterion by which the

public judges the usefulness of our entire profession. It is true that this

popular standard fails to discriminate between wrong specifications of

econonomic models and wrong choices of assumptions about outside events,

whereas one may argue that an economist should be held mainly responsible for

the former rather than the latter source of forecast errors. But most

economists would agree that the proper test of the practical aspects of their

expertise consists in how well they can predict or "explain" postsample data.

     Critics often assert that the economic forecasts generally are poor.

However, it is not clear what standards they apply and whether such complaints

represent more than casual opinions. Large errors can occur for a variety of

reasons and need not be either systematic or symptomatic of forecasters'

inability.

     Logically, the inquiry into the improvability of forecasting should start

with some prior questions: How accurate have the forecasts been on the average

in the past? What are the sources and characteristics of superior forecasts?

For several reasons, however, these seemingly simple questions lack unique and

conclusive answers.

1.   The forecasts must be explicit, verifiable, and sufficient to permit a

responsible appraisal. But the recorded history of' macroeconomic forecasting

is of recent origin. Time series on specific, quantitative, and comparable

predictions are as a rule short. Few forecasters have been active consistently

over many years; many offer only small samples of observations with isolated
                                        2




 hits or misses that could be largely due to chance.

 2.   Some periods are easier to forecast than others. For example, once it is

 clear that a recession has just ended, it is a rather safe bet that the re-

 covery will continue in the months immediately ahead, but just when a mature

 expansion will end is usually quite difficult to anticipate.

 3.   Some variables are easier to forecast than others.   In general, the trend-

dominated and smooth series are better predicted than the cyclical and volatile

 series. Forecasting models differ greatly in size and complexity -- the number

and composition of enodgenous and exogenous variables. It is difficult to make

dependable comparisons across such models.

4.    Economic agents generally use the forecasts to help formulate and improve

their plans and decisions. They expect that the value of the resulting

reductions in their errors will tend to exceed the effective costs to them of

producing or acquiring the forecasts. However, these costs and returns are

typically difficult to estimate and unknown to an outside analyst. Users have

different needs, skills, and preferences ("loss functions"). The size of

forecasting errors may not be sufficient to determine their consequences for

the decisions based on the forecasts.

5.    Different summary measures of error may lead to different appraisals of a

given set of forecasts. The results will depend on whether the averages are

based on absolute or squared errors; on whether the errors are computed for

predictions of levels or changes; on the importance of measurement errors and

the treatment of data revisions. Absolute accuracy measures, which show

deviations from the obviously unattainable state of perfection (zero errors),

need to be complemented with relative accuracy measures, which compare

forecasts from different sources or of different types. Here the standard is

often some objective "benchmark" model, e.g., low-cost extrapolations of the
                                           3



 own history of the target series. The optimal standards vary with the

 properties of the time series in question.

 6.    Ideally,   forecasts should be unbiased, i.e., have random, nonâ€”autocor-

 related errors averaging zero, since forecasters should use the available

 information to eliminate all avoidable systematic errors. But success in this

 endeavor requires sufficiently large samples of comparable predictions on

series generated by sufficiently stable processes. If these conditions are not

met, the apparent bias may be spurious. A different reason for the same result

may lie in asymmetric loss f'unctions.

7.    Macroeconomic forecasts vary greatly with respect to the relative roles of

model and judgment, but in practice inevitably include elements of both. There

is no way to avoid judgment in the choice of the model itself and on how the

modeled regularities of the sample period are to be modified in light of new

and external events. Uses of objective, reproducible methods offer valuable

opportunities for learning, the results of which can be recorded and

published. This advantage is not provided by those forecasters who do not

disclose their assumptions and techniques or models. Experienced judgment may

be the most valuable property of a forecaster but it is not something that can

be readily transmitted to others.

      In sum, the quality of forecasts is a relative and multidimensional

concept. Forecasts vary in many ways: by source, techniques, variables and

periods covered, timing and horizon. It is generally difficult to allow for

these differences so as to make meaningful comparisons across forecasters and

over time, even after the event, with data on the corresponding actual values

on hand.

      The history of modern forecasting overlaps the "information revolution" of

the last thirty years, a period of rapid expansion in the scope and content of
economic data, measures, and literature. The process was (and is) the result

of a number of interacting developments on both the demand side and the supply

side: advances in data collection and processing, in economic theory,

statistics, and econometrics; the accelerating power of the computer; the

spread of modern management techniques propelled by competition; the growing

size and planning requirements of governments. As usual in times of

revolutionary change great expectations were born. Some of these promised too

much. This certainly applies to the notion of a road to dependable business

and economic policies built by a new science of optimum forecasting.



                     II. Some Evidence and Interpretations

     Is there a way to address what appears to be a complex question of trends

in forecasting accuracy without getting bogged down in the many differences

among forecasters, techniques, models, variables, horizons, and periods

covered?   I hope to show that the answer is a qualified yes. The problems

discussed above will not be resolved but the complications they pose can be

reduced by the design of the study, and some limited but pertinent results can

be obtained from the available record.

Annual Forecasts: Comparisons Across Time and Sources

    Table 1 arrays, by common coverage in time, measures of average error

without regard to sign for a large collection of annual ex ante forecasts of

nominal and real growth and inflation. These are the longest authenticated

time series of this kind that could be collected, but they reach back only to

1953 (for GNP) and 1959 (real GNP and the implicit price deflator).1 There are

gaps and overlaps in this compilation that one would wish away, but they



     1See notes to Table 1 for sources of the forecasts covered and references
to related studies.
                                        5




 reflect the availability of the data and could not be avoided. The forecasts

 are roughly comparable in timing, most having been made in October or November

 of year t for the year t+1, i.e., before the publication of the first official

 GMP estimates for the last quarter of year t.

     Table 1 has a highly diversified coverage. It includes averages from

 regular surveys of professional forecasters (columns 3, 5, and 7), various

 predictions selected for early and consistent coverage (column 4), forecasts by

 the successive teams of President's economic advisers (column 6), and by two

econometric service bureaus (columns 8 and 9). Individual and collective

judgments, informal and formal approaches, small and large models --    all   of

these are well represented. Each line refers to a period that covers a variety

of business conditions.

     The mean absolute error (MAE) measures assembled in Table 1 display no

systematic upward or downward trends, as can be seen by comparing the entries

within each of the columns 3-9 for the individual forecast sets. The overall

means in column 10 convey the same message. True, errors in the annual

predictions of nominal GNP growth rates were on the average larger in the last

eight complete years than in the eight previous years, for example, but the

opposite applies to the predictions of real GNP growth and inflation.

     To allow for any changes in the means of the predicted series across the

periods covered, benchmark MAE measures were computed for selected naive

models: 1kâ€”year moving average extrapolations for the annual percentage changes

in GNP and RGNP, lastâ€”year extrapolations for those in IPD.2 Comparisons of

the forecast errors (columns 3-10) with the naive extrapolation (XP) errors



     2These simple models perform relatively well for the respective
variables, and more elaborate time series models are neither needed nor
properly applicable here. Annual data comparable to those available to the
forecasters are short; also, see Table 1, note i.
                                        6




 (column 11) show that the former are in all but one case (line 10)

substantially smaller than the latter. Moreover, the relative errors, that is,

ratios of MAE for the forecasts to the corresponding MAE-XP measures (see

column 12), show a tendency to decline between the earlier and the more recent

periods. On this criterion, then, one would conclude that the annual forecasts

of nominal and real GNP growth may have actually improved, at least since the

late 1950's. (For inflation, the evidence is weaker, as shown in lines 10â€”13.)

     It is also interesting to note that, consistent with several studies such

as McNees (1975, 1976) and Zarnowitz (1967, 1972, 1979), it is difficult to

detect systematic differences in accuracy among the well-known professional

forecasters. In general, the MAE statistics for the forecast sets included in

Table 1 do not differ much. This is well illustrated by the following

tabulation:



                                Entries in Table 1, columns 3â€”9, for

                                        GNP     RGNP      IPD

Mean (x)                               1.2      1.1      1.0

Standard deviation (s)                 0.4      0.2      0.3

Fraction within     around x           15/20    11/12    8/12



     The reasons for the similarity of the forecasts, and hence for the

representativeness of the overall averages, are several. Forecasters use to a

large extent the same data, receive the same news, interact, and draw upon a

common pool of knowledge and techniques. The models used often differ

substantially, but their outputs are adjusted to reflect the most recent

changes in the economy, policies, etc., and it is known that these adjustments

reduce the variation among the forecasts (Zarnowitz 1972; Christ 1975).
                                        7




      Moreover, aggregation over forecasts from business outlook surveys, or

 other corresponding and contemporary predictions, works to reduce the effects

 of the outliers (Zarnowitz 1984). The aggregate (or average) forecasts are

 known to be more accurate over time than most of the individual forecasts from

 the given group.

 Quarterly Forecasts for the Year Ahead: Cyclical Errors

     Table 2 presents mean absolute errors and mean errors calculated over a

set of quarterly one-year-ahead forecasts from five widely used sources. The

period covered, 1971:2-1985:1, is subdivided in three different ways. Of four

equal (14â€”quarter) subperiods, it is the latest one, 1981:14_1985:14, that shows

the largest MAE. This applies to all four variables included: growth rates in

GNP, RGNP, and IPD, and the unemployment rate UR. But there is no systematic

increase in the errors from one period to the next, except for GNP. The mean

errors vary in sign and size irregularly across the four periods.

     Each of the periods listed in section A of the table includes some

especially turbulent times associated with unanticipated turning points in the

level of economic activity and rates of growth in output and prices. But the

last, 1981:4-1985:1, had the largest share of such events: the severe

recession in late 1981 and 1982, the slowdown of' mid-1984, and the surprisingly

strong disinflation. It is presumably this fact that explains why forecasts

for this subperiod were the least accurate.

     Indeed, the breakdowns according to cyclical characteristics (sections B

and C) disclose much larger and more systematic differences than the division

of the period into equal parts. For each variable, the MAE are much smaller

for the predictions relating to business expansions including peaks (4)4

quarters) than for the predictions relating to business contractions including

troughs (12 quarters). Also, the absolute values of the ME are in each ease
                                          8



much smaller for the first than for the second subset of the forecasts (section

B).

      While the dating of business cycles is based on the consensus of the major

turning points in comprehensive economic time series, the dating of growth

cycles is determined in a similar way from the principal turns in the detrended

values of such series. What this means in practice here is that periods during

which the economy's output grew at an average rate exceeding the longâ€”term

trend rate of about 3.3% per year are distinguished from periods during which

it grew more slowly. The high-growth phases include recoveries and booms, the

lowâ€”growth phases include slowdowns and recessions. For the so defined growth

cycles (section C), the contrasts between the phase forecast errors are less

sharp than for business cycles but no less regular. The forecasts relating to

the highâ€”growth phases (314 quarters) have smaller MAE than those relating to

the lowâ€”growth phases (22 quarters), for each variable. The absolute values of

ME are much smaller for high-growth than low-growth phases in three cases and

equal in one (GNP).

      To sum   up, forecasts of growth in income and output, of inflation and
unemployment all tend to be both less accurate and more biased for recessions

than for expansions. Similarly, the forecasts for the above-average growth

phases look better than those for the below-average growth phases under both

criteria. These results are consistent with the earlier ones showing that

large errors tend to cluster around business cycle turns, especially peaks

(Zarnowitz 1967, 1979).

      The statement just made is not the same as to say that forecasting

failures are due to large unanticipated disturbances. Such shocks can and do

occur under any economic conditions, yet they seem to cause large errors mainly

during slowdowns and contractions. This may be so because it is in these
                                        9




 phases, rather than in vigorous recoveries and strong widespread expansions,

 that the economy is particularly vulnerable. Various stresses and imbalances

 accumulate gradually as more and more industries approach high capacity

 operations. Costs of labor, capital goods, and credit typically rise; here and

 there prices and profits come under squeeze; real shortages appear, growth

 weakens, and investment begins to decline. Although these internal

developments, if permitted to take their course, could alone bring about a

downturn, it is also possible for some adverse shocks to speed up this

outcome. Yet the same shocks would probably have been weathered by the economy

in a less exposed state. The forecaster faces an extremely difficult problem

in that (a) it is very difficult to anticipate just when the stresses and

imbalances will do their work and (b) the timing of true random shocks that

matter is always unpredictable, even if their consequences are not.

     In addition, predicting a general downturn is always unpopular, and

predicting it prematurely ahead of others may prove quite costly to the

forecaster and his customers. On the other hand, most users are likely to

await eagerly an upturn during a recognized recession, so forecasts of a

recovery will be welcome and often accepted on the basis of early signs of

improvement. In this context, it should be recalled that early cyclical

indicators had in recent times much longer and more variable leads at peaks

than at troughs. (However, their signals of the last recovery came relatively

early in 1982, which probably induced some forecasters to err in predicting

the recovery too soon.) The peak errors show up during the recession and

slowdown periods, the generally smaller trough errors show up during the

recovery and speedup periods.

     Finally, there is the hypothesis that important macroeconomic functions

which are approximately linear as long as there is substantial slack in the
                                          10




 economy and relative price stability, become nonlinear at high levels of

 employment and capacity utilization with rising inflation. Econometric models,

 it is believed, may not be capable to capture the nonhinearities sufficiently

 well, hence would perform worse near the peaks of the cycle than at lower

 levels of macroeconomic activity (see, e.g., Evans 197)4, p. 185). This

argument, of course, refers to the endogenous sources of business fluctuations

 rather than the effects of exogenous disturbances.

Quarterly Multiperiod Forecasts From Econometric Services, Business Outlook
Surveys, and Time-Series Models

     Predicting the developments within the next year or two by quarters is far

more difficult than predicting how the economy will fare from year to year.

Errors of the forecasts for consecutive quarters typically offset each other to

some degree within any year. Also, forecasts for the year ahead can be

satisfactory when based on a good record for the first two quarters, and they

tend to be more accurate than forecasts with effective spans longer than two

quarters (Zarnowitz 1979).

     However, there is much demand for frequent and detailed predictions, and

forecasters have responded by producing quarterly or even monthly forecasts for

sequences of k-8 quarters ahead. The ambitious tendency to disaggregate

forecasts over time as well as over space received much support from the

falling computation costs in the 1960s and 1970s. With few exceptions, the

macroeconometric models now regularly used in commercial forecasting are large,

in several wellâ€”known cases very large.

     The great expansion of the models led to expectations of dependably good

forecasts, which however met with frequent disappointments. Soon the

theoretical basis of the conventional macro models came under sharp attack

(Lucas 1976) and some critics proceeded to challenge them with forecasts from

vector autoregressive (VAR) models (Sims 1980).
                                        11




      In econometric forecasting, exogenous variables are projected outside the

 model, and the model outputs of endogenous variables are as a rule subjected to

 judgmental adjustments. In contrast, there are no exogenous variables in the

 VAR models: each of the selected variables is predicted by regression on its

 own lagged values and those of the others. In the unconstrained model, the

 only use of economic theory and judgment is in choosing the variables. Since

 several lags are used for each variable in each equation, the number of

variables that the model can accomodate is small. The forecasting process is

mechanical and replicable, involving no judgment on the part of the model user.

     In practice, this lowâ€”cost approach frequently confronts the difficulty of

having to estimate many parameters from limited amounts of data with

measurement errors. To avoid overfitting and improve forecasts, constraints on

the coefficients are imposed in the so-called Bayesian vector autoregressions

(BVAR) with the aid of the model builder's prior distributions concerning the

stochastic properties of the processes and lags involved (Litterman 1986).

     In recent years, the autoregressive integrated moving-average (ARIMA)

approach has also been used to forecast selected aggregative variables (Nelson

1972, 1984). Univariate ARIMA models require less simple statistical

techniques and computer programs than VAR, and more experienced judgment. They

of course, capture neither the signals nor the noise from the multivariate

interactions that are involved in the application of the VAR models.

     Table 3 draws on recent studies (Lupoletti and Webb 1986; McNees 1986) to

compare the performance of these time-series models with several econometric

service bureaus and group forecasts from business outlook surveys. To

concentrate on the evolution over time, the reported statistics on the root

mean square errors (RMSE) are expressed at annual rates and averaged across the

forecast horizons for various periods between 1970 and 1985. In addition to
                                        12




 these absolute measures of average accuracy (part A), RMSE ratios are used to

 measure the accuracy of the forecasts relative to that of the corresponding VAR

 and BVAR projections (part B).

     Comparing the periods 1970â€”75, 1975-80, and 1980â€”83 (columns 4-6), one

 finds rises in the RMSE's for the econometric bureaus' forecasts of GNP, RGNP,

and TBR (see lines 1-3, 8-10, and 22_214). But measures from another

compilation show the forecasts for GNP and RGNP having smaller average errors

in 1980-85 than in 1980-83 (Cf. columns 6 and 10). For inflation, the largest

errors are found in 1970-75 and the smallest in 1975â€”80, but there the

differences over time are comparatively small (lines 15â€”17). Forecasts made

within two quarters from business cycle turning points show relatively large

RMSE's throughout (column 9). The large average errors of 1980:14_1983:LI.

reflect mainly the unexpectedly sharp and long business contraction of 1981â€”82.

     A simple VAR model (see Table 3, note b) performed generally worse than

the econometric services in the early and late 1970s but better in the early

1980s, for both GNP and RGMP.3 However, the VAR forecasts for inflation were

the best in 1970-75, among the best in 1980-83, and the worst in 1975â€”80. The

VAR predictions of interest rates compare poorly with the others in 1970â€”75,

favorably in 1975-80. Around the turning points, and overall, VAR did on the

whole not much worse than the econometricians, despite their much more complex




     3The VAR model was estimated for the period 1952:2â€”1969:L, and the
obtained coefficients and predictions were then used to forecast each variable
for 1970:1â€”1971:2; this procedure was repeated starting with each successive
quarter to produce forecasts with horizons of 1-6 quarters for 1970:1â€”
1983:4. Thus the results are postsample predictions comparable in this
respect to the authentic ex-ante forecasts. However, the data used in the VAR
computations were the latest revised estimates available to the authors,
whereas the econometric services used of course the preliminary estimates
available at the time of the forecast. This could well bias the comparisons
in favor of VAR, but there is some evidence that this is not the case
(Lupoletti and Webb 1986, Table 1 and text, pp. 267â€”269).
                                       13




 and expensive procedures (see the corresponding entries in columns 3-6 and 9,

 parts A and B).

     The ARIMA and BVAR models also produce mixed results but appear to be more

or less competitive with the other forecasters. Judging from the average RMSE

ratios, they outperformed VAR in four out of seven cases (columns 7 and 8).

     The last column in Table 3 sums up some accuracy comparisons of BVAR with

econometric and survey forecasts, based on a study by McNees (1986). Litterman

has been making BVAR predictions monthly since 1980 (see Table 3, note b).

Real growth was predicted much better by his model than by the other

forecasters in 1980-85, while inflation was predicted much worse.

     With respect to differences by forecast horizon (which are ignored in

Table 3), pairwise comparisons of the RMSE's for each VAR with each model

suggest that the relative performance of VAR improved with the length of

forecast. Cases in which VAR had smaller RMSE's than the other forecasts

account for 24%, 25%, 42%, and 142% of all comparisons for horizons of one, two,

four, and six quarters, respectively. Pairwise comparisons with BVAR show that

each of the forecasters included in Table 3 had smaller RMSE's for IPD and TRB

at all horizons. The reverse obtains for RGNP, where BVAR produced the best

results in half of the shortest and all of the longer forecasts. For GNP, BVAR

was worst in each case over horizons of 1-4 quarters but better than the others

in most of the comparisons for horizons of 6-8 quarters. When more variables

and more forecasters are included, BVAR comes out ahead in most of the

comparisons for the period 1980:2-1985:1 (see Granger's comment on McNees

1986). Fragmentary results for the more recent years, however, suggest some

deterioration. Thus Litterman's BVAR forecasts for 1984:4_1985:14 and 1985:14

1986:4 predicted high growth rates in real GNP and such of its components as

durable-goods consumption, gross private domestic investment, and residential
                                         114




 construction.   The corresponding realizations have been much lower in 1985 and

 (so far) in 1986. Most forecasters have been much less optimistic than BVAR,

 and more accurate.14




                 III. Conclusion, Implications and Further Thoughts

      There is no evidence, here or elsewhere, that macroeconomic forecasts in

 the United States have grown systematically worse, that is, less accurate, more

 biased, or both. Rather this paper argues and to some extent documents that

 the failures of forecasting are related to the incidence of slowdowns and

contractions in general economic activity. Not only the forecasts of real GNP

growth and unemployment but also those of nominal GNP growth and inflation tend

to go seriously wrong when such setbacks occur. This result seems strong,

though qualitatively not surprising: it confirms and extends earlier

indications of typically large turningâ€”point errors.

     The question that naturally arises at this point is, do such findings have

useful lessons for producers and users of macroeconomic forecasts? It is clear

that forecasters cannot afford to wait for long expansions to prove the

usefulness of their own activities. Instead, as our results demonstrate, there

is urgent need for the forecast makers to increase their ability to anticipate

the retardations and declines in aggregate demand, output, and employment--and



     14The following tabulation compares some of the forecasts from Litterman
1984 with the actual percentage changes for 1985 (fourth quarter over fourth
quarter):

for forecast users to pay particular attention to such efforts and reward any

resulting successes.

     To be sure, all this is much easier said than done, but it seems highly

probable that economic forecasting can be improved to some degree and that we

are far from having reached the limits of this process. After all, macroâ€”

forecasting as an explicit activity put to practical uses, yielding recorded

and testable results, and subject to the disciplines of market and research is

very young indeed. New and useful insights will not come easy here but will be

achieved; and new methods and new applications of old methods are being

developed continually.

     The four active, broad approaches to short-term forecasting of the economy

at large are time-series models, econometric models, anticipations surveys, and

cyclical indicators. Each of these corresponds to a particular aspect of the

entire task. Thus, timeâ€”series models are best equipped to exploit intensively

the information contained in the past history of the single or several series

to be predicted; macroeconometric models, to quantify the predominant

relationships that the theory suggests exist among a larger (but not overly

large) number of variables; anticipation surveys, to estimate aggregates of

plans or intentions of economic agents for variables over which these agents

exercise considerable control; and the indicators, to signal and confirm

certain recurrent business cycle events. These are distinct but interrelated

functions. In the present practice, none of them is performed very well

because of paucity of generally agreed upon and successfully tested economic

theories that would provide strict guidance for macromodeling and because of

inadequacies of the available data, estimation, and surveying techniques. Yet

there are significant advantages to using each class of models or methods for

the task it is best suited. In short, contrary to some partisan assertions and
                                           16




 criticisms, the four approaches are essentially complements, not competitors or

 substitutes. They need to be refined and used in combination so as to

 contribute to the improvement of the forecasts.

         To illustrate, the blending of time-series analytic and traditional

econometric methods can result in better selection and projection of exogenous

variables. The devices to be used for this purpose are tests for exogeneity

and extrapolations based on full information contained in the past history of

the series to be predicted and related forwardâ€”looking data (e.g., for federal

government purchases, recent Congressional appropriations and debates).

Further, time-series models can be contstructed for, and applied to, the

residual errors from econometric equations as these terms are often far from

being purely random. The transfer functions which thus combine regression with

timeâ€”series models would be expected to have greater predictive power than

either type of model alone.5

         Similarly, consistency with the lessons from anticipated surveys and

sequences of leading, coincident, and lagging indicators should enhance the

usefulness of any macroforecasting model. Probably the best way to achieve

this objective is to include the relationships involving the principal survey

data and indicators directly in the model. To mention just one important area,

promising because of strong elements of executive planning and long gestation

periods, forecasting business expenditures for new plant and equipment should

draw on surveys of backlogged and newly approved capital appropriations;

surveys of anticipated expenditures; construction contracts for plant buildings

197)4;on transfer functions, with applications, Pindyck and Rubinfeld 1981; on
exogeneity tests, Granger 1969, Sims 1972. On further developments and the
more radical and controversial "index models" (using restricted vector
autoregressions for business cycle analysis), see the collection of papers and
comments in Sims 1977.

 and new orders of nondefense capital goods industries.

      The long record of leading indicators in predicting business cycle turning

 points is encouraging. With the aid of suitable timeâ€”series analytic

 transformations and decision rules, it should be possible to reach considerably

 better results yet in this respect. The main practical problem for this

 approach lies in false signals; the errors of the other type--missed turnsâ€”â€”are

 rare and relatively unimportant. To reduce the risk of false warnings, a

 system of sequential signals from both leading and confirming indicators has

been proposed and tested with generally positive results (Zarnowitz and Moore

 1982 with an update in Moore 1983; Niemira 1983). Predictions with the

composite index or vector of selected leading indicators can improve on

autoregressive forecasts of changes in real GNP, industrial production, and the

rate of unemployment (Vaccara and Zarnowitz 1978; Auerbach 1982. Signals of

cyclical downturns from the leading index can take into account estimated

probability distributions of phase durations and percentage changes in the

index (Neftci 1982; Palash and Radecki 1985).

     Of particular interest is a technique which combines time-series models

with Monte Carlo simulations to generate repeated sample paths of the predicted

series and probability distributions over the relevant turning points (Wecker

1979). This analysis has recently been extended to multivariate models for

related indicator series, with explicit assessments of uncertainty in the

estimates and of turning-point probabilities (Kling 1986).

     To conclude, forecasters tend to rely heavily on the persistence of trends

in spending, output, and the price level. To the extent that inertia prevails

in the economy's movement, their predictions turn out to be roughly right, at

least directionally, most of the time. But the inertia, while helpful in this

sense, is only a part of the story, and such forecasts suffer from missing
                                       18




business cycle turns and underestimating recessions and recoveries with respect

to both their real and nominal effects. These errors are only in part due to

the impact of the many inevitable random disturbances to the economy that

cannot be anticipated. Although variable in their observed durations and

amplitudes, the expansions and contractions in the major economic aggregates,

both in levels and deviations from long-term trends, show many important

recurrent features. These regularities, as reflected in the relative movements

of cyclical indicators, should and can be better captured in the work of

macroeconomic forecasters.
