The Effect of Beverage Taxes on Youth Consumption and BMI: Evidence from Mauritius

                                         ABSTRACT

Taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) are relatively new and there is little evidence about
their impact on SSB consumption or body mass index (as opposed to prices, purchases, or sales),
their impact on youth (as opposed to on adults), or their impact in non-Western nations. This
paper adds to the evidence base on all of these dimensions by estimating the effect of an SSB tax
on the consumption and BMI of youth in Mauritius, an island nation in the Indian Ocean, which
we compare to Maldives, another island nation in the Indian Ocean which did not implement an
SSB tax during the time of our data. Results of difference-in-differences models indicate that the
tax in Mauritius had no detectable impact on the consumption of SSBs or the body mass index of
the pooled sample of boys and girls. However, models estimated separately by sex indicate that
the probability that boys consumed SSBs fell by 9.4 percentage points (11%). These are among
the first estimates of the effect of SSB taxes on youth consumption, and contribute to the limited
evidence base on the impact of SSB taxes on weight, or in non-Western countries.

Introduction

           In response to the rising prevalence of obesity worldwide, there are increasing efforts to

implement fiscal policies to promote healthy diets and prevent non-communicable disease (Teng

et al. 2019, World Bank, 2020; WHO, 2015). An important trend is the taxation of sugar-sweetened

beverages (SSBs), a category that includes sodas, colas, sports drinks, energy drinks, and

sweetened juice drinks. Taxes on SSBs have been adopted by numerous countries worldwide,

including Barbados, Chile, Finland, France, India, Ireland, Mexico, Morocco, Peru, the

Philippines, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, the United Kingdom, as well as several Pacific island

nations (Thow et al. 2018; World Bank 2020; Teng et al. 2019; Alvarado et al., 2019). 2 At a sub-

national level, taxes have also been introduced in several U.S. cities (including Philadelphia, San

Francisco, Oakland, Boulder, and Seattle) and Catalonia, Spain. Economists view such taxes as a

way to internalize the external costs of obesity and diabetes (to which SSBs are seen to contribute)

and address the "internal costs" of excessive consumption due to factors such as limited self-

control and time-inconsistent preferences (see, e.g., Allcott, Lockwood, and Taubinsky, 2019;

Teng et al. 2019; World Bank, 2020). Based on these considerations, the World Health

Organization recommends that nations tax sugar-sweetened beverages (WHO, 2015). Many of the

taxes on SSBs have been implemented in the past decade, and thus there is only incomplete

information about their effects.

           This paper contributes to the evidence on SSB taxes in four important ways. First, we

provide information about the impact of such taxes on the consumption of SSBs. In contrast, most

research on SSB taxes has studied the impact on retail prices (e.g. estimated the pass-through of

                                                        2
the tax) or the impact on sales/purchases. 3 The difference between studying sales/purchases and

consumption is that it is not possible to tell from sales/purchase data (such as retail scanner data

or home scan data) who consumes the products, or whether they are consumed at all. Moreover,

consumption may respond less than local sales if consumers engage in cross-border shopping (i.e.

switch to purchasing their SSBs in a nearby untaxed jurisdiction), something quite feasible for

U.S. city-level taxes (see, e.g., Cawley, Frisvold, Hill, and Jones, 2019; 2020; Allcott et al., 2019;

Powell, Leider, and Léger, 2020). This paper contributes to the literature on the impact of SSB

taxes on consumption, which studies the taxes in Mexico (Sanchez-Romero et al., 2020), Hungary

(WHO and National Institute for Food and Nutrition Science, 2015), Barcelona (Royo-Bordonada

et al., 2019), and the U.S. cities of Berkeley (Falbe et al., 2016; Silver et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2019),

Philadelphia (Cawley, Frisvold, Hill, and Jones, 2019; Zhong et al., 2018), and Oakland (Cawley,

Frisvold, Hill, and Jones, 2020).

         Second, we provide information about the impact of such taxes on body mass index (BMI).4

There is virtually no direct evidence on how the recent, large SSB taxes affect weight, BMI, or

obesity; existing evidence comes from simulation studies (see World Bank, 2020, sections 3.2.4

and 3.3). 5

         Third, we contribute to the literature by studying how youth respond to SSB taxes. Much

of the evidence regarding the effect of SSB taxes on consumption concerns adults. Building the

evidence regarding youth is important because youth may respond differently than adults to SSB

  Prior to the recent substantial excise taxes on SSBs, there existed variation across U.S. states in the sales tax on
SSBs, or modest excise taxes on SSBs, which were exploited to estimate the effect of SSB taxes on BMI by
Fletcher, Frisvold, and Tefft (2010a, 2010b, 2010c).

taxes; see, e.g. Dubois, Griffith, and O'Connell (2020). Our paper contributes to the literature

which has studied the impact on youth of the SSB taxes in Philadelphia (Cawley, Frisvold, Hill,

and Jones, 2019) and Oakland (Cawley, Frisvold, Hill, and Jones, 2020); in both of these papers

there was no detectable impact of the tax on consumption of SSBs among youths overall, but there

was evidence of a decrease in consumption in Philadelphia among youths who were the largest

baseline consumers (Cawley, Frisvold, Hill, and Jones, 2019).

       Fourth, we contribute to the literature by studying the impact of an SSB tax in a non-

Western country. Most of the evidence regarding the effect of SSB taxes comes from the Americas

(e.g. the United States, Mexico, and Chile) or Europe (e.g. Denmark, France, Hungary, Spain, and

the U.K.); see the review in World Bank (2020). By studying the impact of the tax in Mauritius,

we contribute to a literature that includes studies of the impacts of the SSB taxes in India, Saudi

Arabia, and South Africa (Nakhimovsky et al. 2016; World Bank, 2020). In general, data from

non-Western nations is under-represented in published research in health economics (Hirvonen,

2020) and the discipline of economics as a whole (Das et al., 2013).

       To our knowledge, this paper is unique in that it is the only one to estimate how an SSB

tax affects the consumption of SSBs and BMI among youth in a non-Western country. Using

individual-level survey data of youth from the World Health Organization's Global School-Based

Student Health Survey (GSHS), we estimate difference-in-difference models that compare the

change in outcomes in Mauritius, which imposed a tax on SSBs in 2013, to those in Maldives,

which did not implement such a tax. We cannot reject the null hypothesis of no effect of the SSB

tax on either SSB consumption or BMI for the full sample of youth, but when we estimate models

separately by sex, we find evidence that the tax significantly reduced the probability that boys

consume SSBs.

2. Methods

2.1 Settings ­ Mauritius and Maldives

       Both our treated country of Mauritius and the comparison country of Maldives are island

nations located in the Indian Ocean. Both countries became independent from the United Kingdom

in the 1960s and have a republican form of government. The population of Mauritius is 1.39

million, whereas that of Maldives is 391,000 (CIA 2021a, CIA 2021b). Mauritius was recently

classified by the World Bank has a high-income country, having until then been classified as upper

middle-income, whereas Maldives is still classified as upper middle-income. Both countries'

economies are heavily reliant on tourism. Real GDP per capita is $22,870 in Mauritius and $19,531

in Maldives (CIA 2021a, CIA 2021b). Mauritius is majority Hindu with a substantial Muslim

minority while Maldives is Islamic (CIA 2021a, CIA 2021b). On its Human Development Index,

which ranges from 0 to 1 and is a summary measure of health, education, and financial well-being,

the United Nations rates Mauritius as 0.804 (very high human development) and Maldives as 0.74

(high human development); see United Nations (2020).

       Mean BMI is similar in the two countries; for adult men it is 24.8 in Mauritius and 24.0 in

Maldives, while for adult women it is 26.0 in Mauritius and 25.4 in Maldives (NCD Risk Factor

Collaboration, 2016). We show later, in the empirical results section, that baseline SSB

consumption is very similar in the two countries. Overall, the many similarities between these two

countries suggest that Maldives is a suitable and appropriate comparison country for Mauritius in

this context.

       We estimate the impact of the excise tax on SSBs that was imposed in Mauritius on January

1, 2013. The tax, which applies to both locally manufactured and imported drinks, was equal to 3



                                                5
Mauritian rupees (roughly 8 US cents) per 100g of sugar content. In October 2016 that tax rate

was doubled from 3 to 6 rupees (roughly 16 US cents) per 100g of sugar content (World Bank,

2020; Mauritius Revenue Authority, 2021). The tax on a two-liter bottle of Coke (which has 220

g sugar) was 6.6 rupees from 2013-October 2016, and 13.2 rupees since October 2016. Given the

suggested retail price for a two-liter bottle of Coke of 63 rupees (Phoenix Beverages Limited,

2021), the tax was equal to roughly 10.5% from 2013-October 2016, and roughly 21% since

October 2016. 6

        The design of the tax is interesting, as Mauritius is one of only a small number of countries

(Chile, Cook Islands, France, Ireland, South Africa, Sri Lanka, and the United Kingdom) to tax

SSBs on the basis of their sugar content (World Bank, 2020; Saxena et al., 2019; Teng et al. 2021;

Nakamura et al., 2018). In contrast, most countries with SSB taxes levy a flat amount per ounce

on sweetened caloric drinks.

        In some studies, policy endogeneity is an issue; that is, there is concern that the treatment

country may differ in important ways from the comparison country precisely because the treatment

country but not the comparison country chose to enact the policy. Such concerns are somewhat

alleviated in this case by the fact that our comparison country - Maldives ­ also implemented a

fiscal policy to raise the price of SSBs, but they did so in 2017, after the time period examined in

this study. 7



2.2 Data




6
  For comparison, the one-cent-per-ounce SSB taxes in San Francisco and three other cities in California represent
slightly more than 10% of the pre-tax price of a 20-ounce SSB.
7
  Specifically, Maldives implemented an import tariff of 33.64 MVR/liter on energy drinks and 4.60 MVR/liter on
soft drinks in March, 2017; see WHO (2017).

                                                         6
        We use data from the World Health Organization's Global School-Based Student Health

Survey (GSHS), an international surveillance effort to help countries assess behavioral risk factors

among youths aged 12 to 17 years. The questions contained in the GSHS, and its years of

administration, vary across countries. We use two waves of data for each country: for Mauritius

there exist data for 2011 and 2017, and for Maldives there exist data for 2009 and 2014. Both

Mauritius and Maldives asked youth about their consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages. The

specific question is: "During the past 30 days, how many times per day did you usually drink

carbonated soft drinks, such as [COUNTRY SPECIFIC EXAMPLES]? (Do not include diet soft

drinks.)" The six possible answers are: a) I did not drink carbonated soft drinks during the past 30

days; b) Less than 1 time per day; c) 1 time per day; d) 2 times per day; e) 3 times per day; f) 4

times per day; g) 5 or more times per day. 8



2.2 Empirical Strategy

        We estimate the following difference-in-differences model:

                        Yict = +1TREAT+2POST+3TREAT*POST+4X+ic

Where Yic is the outcome for individual i in country c in time t. TREAT equals one for individuals

living in Mauritius, and 0 for those living in Maldives. POST equals one for the post-tax wave,

and zero for the pre-tax wave. X is a vector of control variables: an indicator variable for sex and

a set of indicators for age in years. 9

        Our primary outcome variable Y is the number of carbonated drinks consumed per day in

the past 30 days. This is reported categorically: 0, less than 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 or more. Less than


8

9
 Indicators for age include each year 12 through 17, plus one for 18 and older. The excluded reference category is
11 or younger. For both countries, the pre-tax waves had a top code of "16 years and older" and the post-tax waves
had a top code of "18 and older."

                                                         7
1 per day is coded as 0.5, and 5 or more is coded as 6. 10 Other outcomes we examine include: the

extensive margin of consuming SSBs (a binary variable for consuming a nonzero amount per day),

an indicator variable for whether the respondent reports drinking the highest category of 5 or more

SSBs per day, and body mass index (BMI), which is calculated using self-reported weight and

height.

          Our parameter of interest is the difference-in-difference estimator 3, which measures the

change in the outcome from before to after the tax in the treated country of Mauritius relative to

the comparison country of Maldives. Given that the tax raises the price of SSBs, we hypothesize

that 3<0; that is, that the tax will reduce consumption of SSBs and may result in a decrease in

BMI.

          Observations are weighted using GSHS sample weights, and standard errors account for

the complex survey design of GSHS. We initially estimate a pooled regression with both boys and

girls, and then estimate the model separately by gender.



3. Empirical Results

3. 1 Summary Statistics

          Table 1 presents summary statistics for the samples from Mauritius and Maldives.

Respondents in the two countries are quite similar prior to the tax. For example, the average

number of drinks per day prior to the tax is 0.94 in Mauritius and 0.95 in Maldives. Average BMI

prior to the tax is 19.65 in Mauritius compared to 19.03 in Maldives. Both samples are just over

54% female, and Maldives sample is slightly older (14.9 years compared to 13.9 for Mauritius).

Our pooled regression sample (both countries, both time periods) contains 11,627 observations for


10
  The proportion of sample respondents in each category of SSB drink consumption per day is as follows: zero
(21.56%), less than 1 (41.78%), one (18.51%), two (8.9%), three (3.99%), four (1.46%), and five or more (3.81%).

                                                        8
SSB consumption and 9,330 observations for BMI (the sample is smaller for BMI than for SSB

consumption because of non-response to the questions about weight and height).



3.2 Difference-in-Difference Results

        Table 2 presents results from our difference-in-differences (DiD) models. The top row

contains estimates of the difference-in-differences estimator (3, the coefficient on

TREAT*POST). The columns of Table 2 present results from DiD regressions for each outcome:

SSBs per day, whether consume any SSBs, consuming 5 or more SSBs per day, and BMI.

        Overall, our estimates of the effect of the tax among the entire sample of youth are not

statistically significant: we find that the tax increases consumption of SSBs by 0.109 drinks per

day (or 11.7%), lowers the likelihood of consuming any SSBs by 2.4 percentage points (3.0%),

and increases the probability of drinking 5 or more SSBs per day by 1.0 percentage points (41.7%).

Finally, we estimate that the tax lowered BMI by 0.084 units (0.43%); each of these estimates are

not statistically significant at traditional levels.

        Boys and girls may differ in their levels of SSB consumption and in their price elasticities

of demand. Table 3 shows that, in the pre-tax period, in both Mauritius and Maldives, boys are

significantly more likely than girls to report drinking SSBs, and boys report significantly higher

daily consumption of SSBs. 11 In order to allow for the possibility of heterogeneous treatment

effects, we estimate the difference-in-difference model separately by sex. Table 4 reports results

for girls; once again, none of the difference-in-differences estimates are statistically significant,

and the three estimates concerning SSB consumption are of the opposite sign expected (positive


11
  For comparison, SSB consumption is also more common among boys than girls in the U.S. Among youths aged 2-
19 years in the U.S., 70% of boys, versus 60% of girls, consume sugary drinks on a given day. The average daily
calorie intake from sugary drinks among U.S. teens aged 12-19 was 273 for boys and 171 for girls (Ogden et al.,
2011).

                                                       9
rather than negative). Table 5 reports results for boys; for them the tax lowers the probability of

consuming any SSBs by 9.4 percentage points (11%), which is statistically significant at the 1%

level. There is no detectable impact of the SSB tax on the other three outcomes for boys.



4. Discussion

        We estimate the effect of the tax on SSBs that was implemented in Mauritius in 2013.

Comparing changes over time in Mauritius to those in the comparison country of Maldives, we are

unable to reject the null hypothesis of no effect of the tax on SSB consumption or BMI for our

pooled sample of boys and girls. When we estimate models separately by sex, however, we

estimate that the tax reduced the probability that boys consume any SSBs by 9.4 percentage points

or 11%, which is statistically significant at the 1% level.

        This paper makes four important contributions to the literature on SSB taxes. First, we add

to the evidence base regarding how consumption of SSBs responds to an SSB tax. Much of the

previous literature examines the impact on sales, purchases, or prices. Second, we estimate the

impact of an SSB tax on BMI. In models estimated for the full sample of youths, as well as for

boys and girls separately, we fail reject the null hypothesis of no effect. These represent the first

estimates of the impact of SSB taxes on BMI for the new, large SSB taxes. 12 Third, this paper adds

to the relatively small literature on how youths in particular respond to SSB taxes. A strength of

this paper is that its sample size (over 11,000) is the largest of any study of how SSB taxes affect

youth consumption. Fourth, we provide evidence on the effects of such taxes in a nation outside

of the Western hemisphere. In contrast, the vast majority of existing evidence comes from Europe

(e.g. Denmark, France, Hungary, Spain, and the U.K.) or the Americas (e.g. the U.S., Mexico, and


12
  Fletcher, Frisvold, and Tefft (2010a, 2010b, 2010c) estimated the impact on BMI of sales taxes, or small excise
taxes, on SSBs in the U.S.

                                                        10
Chile). To our knowledge, this paper is the only study of how the consumption of SSBs by youths

responds to an SSB tax in a non-Western nation.

       When we estimate our models for boys and girls pooled, we are unable to reject the null

hypothesis that SSB taxes have no effect on whether youths consume SSBs, the frequency with

which they consume them, or BMI. This is consistent with the few other studies of youth

consumption, which examined data from Philadelphia and Oakland (Cawley, Frisvold, Hill, and

Jones, 2019, 2020) and also failed to reject the null hypothesis of no effect. However, there was

evidence in Philadelphia that the youth with the largest pre-tax consumption of added sugars

through SSBs experienced a significant decline in consumption of added sugars through SSBs

after the tax (Cawley, Frisvold, Hill, and Jones, 2019). In the subgroup analyses of this paper, we

find that the tax significantly reduced the probability that boys consume any SSBs. The results of

this paper, combined with the aforementioned ones from Philadelphia, represent the first evidence

that SSB taxes reduce SSB consumption for certain groups of youths.

       This paper has the following limitations. Although we have a pooled sample of over 11,000

observations, we have limited statistical power to detect smaller effect sizes, particularly when we

estimate models separately by sex. The 95% confidence intervals contain meaningful effect sizes;

for example, the estimated effect of the tax on SSBs per day for the pooled sample is a non-

significant increase of 0.109 drinks per day (or 11.7%), although that is the opposite sign than

predicted. For each country, we only have one time period prior to the tax and one after the tax,

which prevents us from assessing the identifying assumption of parallel trends (e.g. it is impossible

to examine trends prior to the tax). Our data are repeated cross-sections rather than longitudinal,

and thus we cannot observe changes over time for individual youth. Our measure of BMI is

calculated using self-reported, rather than measured, weight and height; as a result, it contains



                                                 11
some degree of reporting error. We have only two geographic clusters (nations) in our sample, so

we cannot cluster by geography. This is a common limitation in this literature, however (e.g. see

Cawley, Frisvold, Hill, and Jones, 2019, 2020) and some studies of national taxes have only one

geographic cluster (i.e. no data for a comparison country). Finally, this is an examination of a

single nation's SSB tax, and results may not generalize to other countries. However, it is a strength

that we add to the evidence base not only data from a new country whose tax had not been

previously studied, but also evidence from a non-Western nation, which is arguably under-

represented in health economics research (Hirvonen, 2020) and economics research more

generally (Das et al., 2013). Despite its limitations, this study provides important new information

on the effects of SSB taxes on youth. An important direction for future research is to study the

effects of the many other SSB taxes that have recently been implemented across the globe, which

would further add to the evidence base.
