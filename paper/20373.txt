                                            ABSTRACT

Over the last several decades, numerous medical studies have compared the effectiveness of two common
procedures for Coronary Artery Disease: Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) and Coronary
Artery Bypass Graft (CABG). Most evidence indicates that CABG – the more invasive procedure
– leads to superior long term outcomes for otherwise similar patients, though there is little consensus
as to why. In this article, we propose a novel explanation: patient offsetting behavior. We hypothesize
that patients who undergo the more invasive procedure, CABG, are more likely to improve their behavior
– eating, exercise, smoking, and drinking – in a way that increases longevity. To test our hypothesis,
we use Medicare records linked to the National Health Interview Survey to study one such behavior:
smoking. We find that CABG patients are 12 percentage points more likely to quit smoking in the
one-year period immediately surrounding their procedure than PCI patients, a result that is robust to
numerous alternative specifications.

    Moral Hazard and Less Invasive Medical Treatment for Coronary Artery Disease: The
                               Case of Cigarette Smoking



I. Introduction
        Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is a common and deadly disease. In 2010, over 350,000

people died of CAD in the United States, making the disease responsible for roughly one in

seven deaths (Murphy, Xu, and Kochanek, 2012). CAD is caused by a buildup of plaque on the

arterial walls leading to the heart, resulting in reduced blood flow. If the buildup is not checked,

CAD can result in an acute myocardial infarction (AMI, a.k.a. “heart attack”) due to insufficient

oxygen reaching the heart.

        A number of medical treatments are available to patients with CAD. First, and least

invasive, is “medical management.” Medical management involves non-surgical treatment

including prescription medication, lifestyle modification, and frequent monitoring. The second

treatment is a revascularization procedure known as Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI,

commonly referred to as angioplasty). A doctor (usually an interventional cardiologist)

performing PCI makes a small incision and arthroscopically inserts and inflates a balloon at the

site of the lesion to expand the vessel. PCI in the modern era usually involves the placement of a

wire mesh stent at the blockage site, which assists in keeping the arterial walls expanded to

maintain blood flow. The PCI procedure takes approximately 60 minutes and the patient usually

spends one night in the hospital.1 The third and generally most invasive treatment is Coronary

Artery Bypass Graft (CABG)2, a major surgical procedure that involves harvesting a section of

vessel from a different area of the body (either vessels in the groin or chest wall), opening the

chest cavity via a sternectomy, and connecting one healthy part of the diseased artery to another,

surgically bypassing the lesion. CABG surgery takes approximately four hours and patients

generally spend at least a week recovering in the hospital.3

        Of the two procedures, PCI is the more recent, having been initially used in the late

1970s, more than a decade after CABG was first performed. Its use expanded rapidly upon FDA

approval of the coronary stent in 1994 (Cutler and Huckman, 2003). By 2010, the CDC

estimated that there were 954,000 PCI procedures and 395,000 CABG procedures performed in

the United States, with roughly half of them performed in patients over 65 (CDC, 2010).4

        Since the development of PCI, there have been numerous studies comparing the

effectiveness of the two procedures in various populations (see Hlatky et al., 2009, Weintraub et

al., 2012, and Mohr et al., 2013 for three recent studies that summarize prior research). While

the results vary, the emerging consensus is that CABG patients have worse short-run outcomes

than similar PCI patients – partly due to higher perioperative mortality – but better long term

outcomes. Results from a large observational study (Weintraub et al., 2012) are reproduced in

Figure 1, showing that the survival curve for CABG patients is initially lower than for PCI

  Less invasive CABG procedures have been in development and increasing use in recent years, though these were
very infrequent during the period we examine.

  These counts are based on ICD-9-CM procedure codes beginning with 361 for CABG and 0066, 3606, and 3607
for PCI. Note that the PCI codes used by the CDC to estimate the number of procedures are slightly different than
those we use to identify PCI patients in our main analysis.

                                                                                                                    2
patients, but that this trend is reversed a year or more after the procedure. A meta-analysis of ten

randomized controlled trials shows a similar pattern (Hlatky et al., 2009).

         While studies show that otherwise similar CABG patients have better long run outcomes

than PCI patients, there is little consensus as to why.5 In this paper, we propose a novel

hypothesis: patient offsetting behavior. Specifically, a patient who undergoes CABG rather than

PCI is more likely to change her behavior in a way that promotes good health and a longer life:

5
  Most authors either omit a discussion of mechanisms entirely (e.g. Weintraub et al., 2012) or imply that CABG
may have mechanical benefits in the long run. For example, in commenting on the superiority of CABG in the
recent SYNTAX randomized trial, Taggart (2013, p. 606) states that “… CABG and PCI achieve their benefits
through quite different pathophysiological effects. Pathologically, most coronary artery disease is located in the
proximal coronary arteries and bypass grafts to the mid-coronary vessels not only make the complexity of proximal
disease irrelevant but also offer prophylaxis against the development of de-novo proximal disease. By contrast,
although PCI can be highly effective in directly treating less complex proximal coronary artery disease, its benefits
are mitigated by the development of new disease proximal to, within, or immediately distal to the stent….”

                                                                                                                            3
she is more likely to quit smoking, begin exercising, improve her diet, and avoid excessive

alcohol intake. This might happen because the more invasive nature of CABG – a patient’s heart

and lungs are bypassed during the surgery, she is in the hospital for a week, has a longer post-

operative recovery period, and is left with a major scar and residual pain from the sternectomy –

sends a stronger signal to the patient that she has a serious health problem.

       This hypothesis is consistent with a prior economic research on moral hazard, showing

that individuals change their behavior when their perceived risks change. Peltzman’s (1975)

study of the effects of automobile safety regulation is a classic and seminal example. He

develops a model in which the legal mandate to install various safety devices on automobiles

lowers the price of fast and reckless driving because it lowers the probability that the driver will

die in an accident. Hence the demand for this activity rises. Empirically, he finds that the

increase in this offsetting behavior (reckless driving) is so large that the regulations at issue had

little impact on highway deaths and actually increased pedestrian deaths. More recently, Dave

and Kaestner (2009) investigate the impact of health insurance access on health behaviors of the

elderly, showing that access to Medicare at age 65 leads to a reduction in preventative behaviors

and an increase in risky health behavior amongst the elderly. Peltzman (2011) demonstrates how

medical technology breakthroughs can lead to offsetting behavior by showing that the age

cohorts that benefited the most from the introduction of antibiotics experienced worse mortality

rates from risky health behaviors. Kaestner, Darden, and Lakdawalla (2014) find that the use of

statins leads to a small increase in body mass index and moderate (20–33%) increases in the

probability of being obese, possibly because it changes the user’s perceived risk of consuming

high calorie fattening foods.

         In this study, we test one potential behavioral response to surgery – smoking – and see

results consistent with patient offsetting behavior. Patients who undergo CABG – the more

invasive procedure – are 12 percentage points more likely to quit smoking than PCI patients.

Our results are robust to a number of different specifications, including a simple grouped-by-year

regression using 11 observations, done in the spirit of Donald and Lang (2007).



II. Data

         We use individual Medicare data merged with responses from the National Health

Interview Survey (NHIS). The Medicare records identify those patients who have been

diagnosed with CAD and show which of them have undergone PCI or CABG, along with the

exact date of each diagnoses and procedure. The Medicare data also allow us to control for

disease severity and other conditions that might be correlated with procedure type and induce

quitting, such as a myocardial infarction (a.k.a. “heart attack”). The NHIS provides information

on smoking and quitting behavior, as well as individual characteristics.

         The Medicare data are provided by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services

(CMS). To identify CAD patients and the type of treatment they underwent, we use the

Medicare Standard Analytical Files, including the Inpatient, Outpatient, Skilled Nursing Facility,

Carrier, Durable Medical Equipment, Home Health Agency, and Hospice claims files. These

files contain one or more records for each individual.6 Each record contains the ICD-9-CM

codes for all diagnoses made and procedures performed during that stay or claim. We identify

CAD patients as those who have at least one diagnosis code beginning with 410, 411, 412, 413,

6
  A single record in the Inpatient file corresponds to a stay in a hospital. A single record in the Skilled Nursing
Facility file corresponds to a stay in a Skilled Nursing Facility. A single record in the Outpatient file corresponds to
a claim by an institutional outpatient provider (Hospital outpatient clinic, rural health clinics, etc.). A single record
in the Carrier claim file corresponds to a claim by a non-institutional outpatient provider (physicians, physician
assistants, etc.)

                                                                                                                       5
or 414. We identify PCI patients as those CAD patients with at least one procedure code

beginning with 0066, 3601, 3602, 3605, or 3606. We identify CABG patients as those CAD

patients with procedure codes beginning with 361.7 Finally, we identify medically managed

patients as those patients who have been diagnosed with CAD, but do not have a concurrent or

subsequent PCI or CABG procedure.8

        The NHIS is an annual survey of approximately 85,000 individuals in over 30,000 U.S.

households run by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), part of the Centers for

Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). All participants are asked questions about their general

state of health and disability. Each year, a subset of approximately 30,000 individuals is asked

about their smoking habits. These respondents are asked if they have ever smoked 100 cigarettes

in their life. For those who say yes, they are asked if they currently smoke every day, some days,

or not at all. If they do not currently smoke, they are asked when they quit, a question they can

answer in days, weeks, months, or years. We use the responses to these questions to create a

synthetic panel, identifying whether a person smoked on each date prior to their NHIS interview.

Each person is categorized as either an always smoker, a never smoker, or a quitter who smoked

up to the day she reports quitting.9

        The individual NHIS responses have been linked to Medicare data by the CDC and CMS

and made available as a restricted-use dataset to researchers. The linkage is based on social

security number, date of birth, and gender. To be linked, the data must match on all three fields.

To date, the CDC and CMS have linked the 1994-1998 NHIS surveys to Medicare data from

  For both PCI and CABG, we exclude the small number of patients who do not have a concurrent or prior CAD
diagnosis.
8
  A patient who is diagnosed with CAD before her NHIS interview date and has PCI or CABG after her NHIS
interview date is counted as medically managed at the time of the NHIS interview..
9
  This categorization vastly over-simplifies the complexity of smoking and quitting behavior, but still allows us to
investigate our key question: what is the difference in quitting behavior between CAD patients undergoing medical
management, PCI, and CABG.

                                                                                                                  6
1991-2007 and the 1999-2005 NHIS surveys to Medicare data from 1999-2007. The linkage is

described further in the appendix.



III. Initial Analysis

         In total, 12,265 NHIS respondents were linked to Medicare data and diagnosed with

CAD.10 Of these individuals, between the date of their diagnosis and the date of their NHIS

interview, 10,713 patients were treated only with medical management, 771 patients underwent

PCI but not CABG surgery, and 781 patients underwent CABG surgery.11 Though our focus is

on the two procedures – PCI and CABG – we include medically managed patients in all analyses

for two reasons. First, due to the substantially greater number of medically managed patients,

including them improves the precision of our covariate estimates (e.g. determining the impact of

having a heart attack on smoking). Second, since medical management is the least invasive

treatment for CAD, we might expect medically managed patients to quit at the lowest rate. This

result, which we find in the data, supports our theory that changes in smoking behavior are

related to treatment invasiveness. Our main finding, however – that CABG patients quit

smoking at a higher rate than PCI patients – is robust to excluding medically managed patients

from the analysis entirely.




10
   To be included, patients had to be diagnosed with CAD after the start of our Medicare data, but before the date of
their NHIS interview (so that we have information on their smoking behavior both before and after their treatment).
11
   These counts are weighted by the NHIS probability weights. The unweighted totals are 10,772 medically
managed patients, 723 PCI patients, and 770 CABG patients. Unweighted, 99 patients underwent both PCI and
CABG surgery. These patients are included in the CABG category, because that is the more invasive treatment. Our
results are robust to including them in the PCI category or excluding them altogether.

                                                                                                                   7

or CABG) are more likely to be younger, male, and white. PCI and CABG patients appear to

have largely similar demographic characteristics, though CABG patients are somewhat more

likely to be male. When comparing medical conditions, both PCI and CABG patients are

substantially more likely than medically managed patients to have had their first Acute

Myocardial Infarction (AMI, a.k.a. “heart attack”) within six months of initiating treatment. A

number of other comorbidities – including congestive heart failure and valvular disease – show

up most frequently in CABG patients, followed by PCI patients. In some of our regression

specifications, we control for the covariates shown in Table 1.

       Table 2 shows the smoking status of each group of respondents – medical management,

PCI, and CABG – as of the date of the NHIS interview. Two items merit notice. First, CABG

and PCI patients are more likely to have ever smoked than medically managed patients (i.e. the

percentage of respondents who never smoked is lower for CABG and PCI patients). Second,

most people who have ever smoked have quit smoking by the time of the NHIS interview, a

trend that is most pronounced for CABG patients. While 61.0% of CABG patients in our study

smoked at some point in their life, only 9.1% smoke as of their NHIS interview. PCI patients

have a lower proportion of quitters, followed by medically managed patients.

         The data in Table 2 are consistent with the broad hypothesis in our study – patients who

undergo a more invasive treatment for CAD are more likely to quit smoking. However, they

could also be consistent with a story in which people who undergo CABG are also more likely to

quit smoking for reasons unrelated to their surgery. If our hypothesis is true, we should see that

the differential quitting behavior between CABG, PCI, and medically managed patients is driven

by quits that occur close to the date of the treatment.

          Note: This table includes every NHIS respondent who was diagnosed with CAD in our data prior to their
          interview date. It shows their smoking status exactly six months before and exactly six months after
          diagnosis (CAD) or surgery (PCI/CABG). Data are weighted by the NHIS probability weights.



         Table 3 focuses on those quits that take place immediately around the initiation of

treatment, where the initiation of treatment is defined to be the diagnosis date for medically

managed patients and the procedure date for PCI and CABG patients. The “before” period is

exactly six months before the treatment date, while the “after” period is exactly six months after

treatment date.13 Among the 10,713 patients diagnosed with CAD who receive only medical

management, approximately 15.7% smoked six months before their diagnosis and 14.2% smoked


13
  Creating a “quit window” around the treatment is necessary for two reasons. First, it is unlikely that many
individuals quit on exactly the day their treatment began. Second, our smoking data, which are based on
individuals’ recollections, are insufficiently precise to pinpoint the exact day of quitting. Our conclusions do not
change with other reasonable definitions of the quit window.

                                                                                                                       10
six months after their diagnosis. The quitters represent a 1.6 percentage point reduction in the

number of smokers and a 10.1 percent reduction. The corresponding numbers for PCI are a 2.7

percentage point reduction and a 17.4 percent reduction. For CABG, they are a 4.5 percentage

point reduction and a 30.1 percent reduction.

         Further evidence is provided by Figures 2 and 3. In Figure 2, we calculate the percentage

of the population smoking at twelve points in time, measured in years relative to the date of

diagnosis (in the case of medically managed patients) or procedure (in the case of PCI and

CABG patients).14 In the CABG series, for example, the year -3.5 shows the percentage of

CABG patients who were smoking exactly three and a half years prior to their procedure date. In

the 10 years prior to the treatment date, the three series track each other reasonably closely. At

the first point on the graph – 9.5 years before treatment – CABG patients were roughly one

percentage point more likely than PCI patients to smoke, who were, in turn, roughly one

percentage point more likely than MM patients to smoke. In the period immediately prior to

treatment, the three groups smoked at roughly equal rates. The differences between the three

series emerge most starkly in the period immediately after treatment initiation. Six months after

their treatment begins, CABG patients were substantially less likely to smoke than either PCI or

MM patients.




14
  Because we have data on only the most recent quit date for each individual, we assume that each smoker was
smoking in all years before their quit date. Since we are using Medicare data for our analysis, most people are over
65 when they received their diagnosis or procedure, and it is unlikely that they started smoking for the first time in
the ten years immediately prior. It is possible that individuals quit and restarted during this time period, and we do
not distinguish them from continuous smokers.

                                                                                                                    11

                        Figure 3 displays the same data in a different format, showing the annual quit rate for

patients in each of the three groups relative to the date of treatment. For the group that receives

only medical management, roughly 5% of smokers quit each year in the nine years prior to being

diagnosed, a rate that doubled to 10% during the year of their diagnosis with coronary artery

disease. The PCI and CABG series show a similar trend, though they represent fewer

individuals and are somewhat noisier. In the years prior to their procedure, roughly 5% of

smokers quit each year, though this percentage began to rise the year before the procedure date.

During the procedure year – defined to be the six month window on either side of the procedure

date – the quit rate jumped to 17% for patients receiving PCI and 30% for patients receiving

                                                                                                                                                    12
CABG. In the year following treatment, the quit rate for all three groups dropped back to

approximately 5%. Figures 2 and 3 provide reasonably compelling evidence that at least a

portion of the increased quit rate for more invasive treatments observed in Table 2 is related to

treatment received, and not simply a spurious correlation.

IV. Results

                                           To further explore the relationship between treatment for coronary artery disease and

smoking behavior, we fit two related models of quitting smoking. The first is a discrete time

linear probability hazard function with 11 periods: 9 before treatment and 2 after. We fit the

                                                                                                                                                        13
model using individual data, allowing us to control for time-varying events – like CAD diagnosis

or a patient’s first AMI – that may occur prior to, concurrent with, or after a PCI or CABG

procedure.15 The second model is a multi-period quit function using grouped data, inspired by

Donald and Lang (2007). In this model, we build a synthetic panel, grouping the individual data

by period and treatment type into 33 cells (3 treatment types and 11 periods), and run difference-

in-differences regressions with 11 data points.

         Before presenting the results of these models, it is useful to point out the relationship

between a smoking participation function and a quit function. As an identity16

                                     1 qt ,                                                   (1)
                             s t 1

where st and st-1 are the smoking participation rates in periods t and t-1, respectively, and qt is the

quit rate in the window defined by periods t and t-1. All rates are defined as fractions and can be

interpreted as probabilities at the individual level. Take natural logarithms of the identity to

obtain

                                  st
                            ln          ln (1  qt )  qt .                                   (2)
                                 st 1

15
   In this study, CAD diagnosis cannot occur after a PCI or CABG procedure, since we delete any PCI or CABG
patients who did not have a prior or concurrent CAD diagnosis in our data.
16
   Let St be the number of smokers in period t, and let St-1 be the number of smokers in period t-1. Let Qt be the
number of quitters in period t (the number who smoke in period t-1 but do not smoke in period t). Assume as is the
case in our data that there are no starters or re-starters. Then
                            St  St-1 - Qt.
Divide both sides of the identity by N, the size of the population:

                            St
Solve the last identity for N to obtain equation (1).
                            S t 1

                                                                                                               14
The approximation in the last part of equation (2) is better for smaller values of q (q  0.2 is

generally used as a rule of thumb). However, even for a quit rate as large as 0.3 (the largest rate

in our data), ln(1 – q) = - 0.350, which is close to 0.3. Equation (2) indicates that a regression in

which the first difference of the log of smoking participation is the dependent variable should

have approximately the same coefficients with the signs reversed as one in which the quit rate is

the dependent variable. It also suggests that it is useful to begin with a log smoking participation

function to arrive at a specification of a quit function. In particular, if the log smoking

participation function contains individual fixed effects, these effects are eliminated by taking

first differences to obtain the quit function.



Model 1: Discrete-time Linear Probability Hazard Model (Individual Data)

        To implement the first model, we develop a synthetic panel with 12 points in time, as

shown in Figure 2. For CABG and PCI patients, there are 10 points in time prior to treatment

(from 9.5 years before to 0.5 years before) and two points in time after treatment (0.5 years after

and 1.5 years after). For medically managed (MM) patients, there are the same 10 points in time

before diagnosis and the same two points in time after diagnosis. To focus on the key aspects of

the model, we ignore the socioeconomic and demographic variables for the time being, assume a

single Elixhauser comorbidity, and suppress the subscript i for an individual. Let fg be a person-

specific fixed effect. Let at be a dummy variable that equals 0 at each point in time before

treatment for PCI or CABG and equals 1 at each point in time after treatment. Specifically, at

equals 1 in periods 11 and 12. This variable is not relevant for MM patients (see below). Let dt

be a dummy variable that equals 0 at all points in time before diagnosis and equals 1 at all points

in time after diagnosis. Let ht be a dummy variable that equals zero before a patient’s first AMI


                                                                                                   15
(in our data) and equals 1 after a patient’s first AMI. Finally, let et equal 0 before an Elixhauser

comorbidity is reported and equals 1 thereafter.

        The log smoking participation model for PCI and CABG patients (g = p or c)



                          ln sgt = fg - gagt - hgt - egt - αdgt - t,                        (3)



where we assume a linear trend in the absence of treatment. The model for MM patients is the

same except that amt coincides with dmt, so that we constrain m to equal zero. After pooling and

taking first differences, one obtains



- (ln st – ln st-1)  qt =  + α(dt – dt-1) + pp(at – at-1) + cc(at – at-1) + (ht – ht-1) + (et – et-1). (4)



Strictly speaking, time-invariant individual characteristics, such as formal schooling, can only be

added to equation (4) by assuming that they interact with the linear trend in equation (3). Our

results are not affected by allowing the trend to be nonlinear or by allowing individual

characteristics to interact with the indicator for the period after treatment in addition to their

interactions with a linear trend.

        We fit equation (4) as a discrete time linear probability hazard model. We include only

individuals who smoke at the first point in time for which we compute smoking participation (9.5

years before treatment or diagnosis), dropping everyone who never smoked or had previously

quit. Each person is assigned a qit variable that is equal to one in the period in which they quit

and zero in all other periods. Individuals are deleted once they quit. The model in equation (4)

has at most 11 observations per person corresponding to the 11 time periods in Figure 3.


                                                                                                               16
Individuals who smoke in all periods are the censored observations. The first period is defined by

the window starting 9.5 years before treatment and ending 8.5 years before treatment. The last

period is the window from 0.5 years after treatment to 1.5 years after treatment. The key

window is period 10 and spans the dates from half a year before treatment or diagnosis to half a

year after. That is the only period in which at – at-1 is equal to 1. Since there are repeat

observations on all persons except those who quit in period 1, we cluster standard errors at the

individual level. Standard errors that ignore clustering are, however, very similar to those that

take account of it. This would be the case if the unspecified disturbance term in the log smoking

participation function in equation (3) is a random walk. In that case, we eliminate serial

correlation by taking first differences.

         Results are shown in Table 4. Note that After stands for at – at-1, Diagnosed stands for

dt – dt-1, and AMI stands for ht – ht-1 in the table. Column 1 shows the simplest specification,

with controls only for diagnosis with CAD and treatment with either PCI or CABG. The

Diagnosed indicator is equal to one in the period when MM patients, PCI patients, or CABG

patients are diagnosed, whether the diagnosis occurs in the same period as the treatment or not.17

Being diagnosed with CAD is associated with a 5.0 percentage point increase in the probability

of quitting, on top of the typical yearly quit rate of 4.9 percent (reflected in the coefficient on the

constant term). Being treated with PCI or CABG is associated with an incremental 9.0 or 22.5

percentage point increase in the quit rate, respectively. This assumes that diagnosis and

treatment occur in the same period. If not, the diagnosis coefficient must be subtracted since

Diagnosed equals zero for PCI and CABG patients diagnosed in a period prior to their

treatment period but equals one for all MM patients. That results in a 4.0 percentage point

17
  In results not shown, we find no evidence of a differential diagnosis effect based on treatment received.
Therefore, in all results shown, we assume that there is a single diagnosis effect that does not vary by treatment.

                                                                                                                      17
increase for PCI patients and a 17.5 percentage point increase for CABG patients. Since 40

percent of PCI patients and 43 percent of CABG patients are diagnosed before treatment, the

average percentage point increases in the quit rates are 7.0 and 20.4, respectively.18 Regardless

of how these computations are made, the difference between the coefficients on PCI and CABG

treatments is 13.5 percentage points and is significant at the                                      level.

  For MM patients, the increase in the quit rate is 0.0501. Since 60 percent of PCI patients are diagnosed in the
same period as treatment, the average predicted increase in the quit rate for these patients is 0.0897 + 0.60*0.0501 =
0.1198. The difference between that increase and the increase for MM patients is 0.0697 or 7.0 percentage points.
Since 57 percent of CABG patients are diagnosed in the same period as treatment, the average predicted increase is
0.2250 + 0.57 * 0.0501 = 0.2536. The difference between that increase and the increase for MM patients is 0.2035
or 20.4 percentage points.

                                                                                                                                       18
           In columns 2-5 of Table 4, we add additional control variables that may be associated

with both selection into treatment and the propensity to quit smoking. In column 2, we add a

control for a patient’s first AMI. In column 3, we further control for the Elixhauser comorbidity

conditions. In column 4, we add controls for demographic characteristics. And, in column 5, we

add controls for the period, the calendar year, an individual’s age and age squared as of the

treatment date, and the number of years she has smoked as of the baseline period (9.5 years prior

to treatment). An AMI proves to be a strong predictor of quitting smoking, increasing the

predicted probability of quitting by between 7.5 and 8.3 percentage points, depending on the

specification. Moreover, once we add AMI, the estimated size of the PCI coefficient declines

and is no longer statistically significant at conventional levels. In our final specification, we find

that patients undergoing PCI are 2.6 percentage points more likely to quit smoking, though given

the imprecision of our estimate, we cannot rule out the possibility of no association.19 While the

coefficient on CABG also declines, it remains large and strongly statistically significant, both in

comparison to medically managed patients and PCI patients. In our fifth specification,

undergoing CABG surgery in the same period in which CAD was diagnosed is associated with a

roughly 14.1 percentage point increase in the probability of quitting smoking. The increased quit

rate associated with CABG is substantially larger than the increase associated with less invasive

treatments for CAD, and approximately twice the increase associated with an AMI. Moreover,

in every specification, the difference between the CABG and PCI coefficients is consistently

large – ranging from 0.115 to 0.141 – and significant at the 0.05 level.




19
     As discussed above, this estimate is for a PCI patient who was diagnosed and treated in the same period.

                                                                                                                19
Model 2: Multi-Period Quit Model Using Grouped Data

        To illustrate that our results are not sensitive to a flexible specification of period effects

and to account for clustering of disturbance terms by group and period at the individual level, we

aggregate the data into 11 periods for each of the three groups of patients. There are 33 cells in

the aggregate sample, corresponding to the 33 data points shown in Figure 3. We obtain two quit

series. The first is unadjusted for covariates and is identical to the quit rates that appear in Figure

3. The second quit series adjusts for effects due to diagnosis, AMI, and Elixhauser

comorbidities. It is obtained from the individual data by estimating a discrete time hazard

function for the probability of quitting that includes 11 period dummies interacted with each of

three treatment dummies (one for CABG, one for PCI, and one for MM), and the diagnosis,

AMI, and Elixhauser variables defined in equation (4). The 33 coefficients associated with the

period-treatment interactions are quit rates by group and period adjusted for the effects of the last

three variables just mentioned.20

        In the spirit of Donald and Lang (2007), we use this data to perform simple difference-in-

differences regressions with 11 observations. To illustrate the model that we estimate, consider a

log smoking participation function for two groups (g = c or p, c = CABG, p = PCI):



                          ln sgt =  + c + cat + 11 period dummies + gt.                       (5)



Here at, as defined in equation (3), is an indicator that equals 1 in each of the two periods after

treatment and gt is the error term. Take the difference between each group in a given period to




20
  We do not adjust for demographic and socioeconomic characteristics since the inclusion of these characteristics
has a very minor impact on the adjusted quit rates.

                                                                                                                    20

group effect ():



               ln sct – ln sct-1 – (ln spt – ln spt-1)  qct – qpt = (at – at-1) + error.   (6)



       Equation (6) is a regression forced through the origin with 11 observations. The

dependent variable is the difference between the quit rate of CABG patients and the quit rate of

PCI patients in each period. The independent variable, (at – at-1), equals 1 in the window

spanning the period from 6 months before treatment to six months after treatment (period 10)

and equals 0 in each of the other 10 periods or quit windows.

       This approach has a number of attractive features. First, aggregation accounts for

clustering in the disturbance term in an individual-level log smoking participation or quit

equation by group and period. Second, if the error term in equation (5) is a random walk, then

serial correlation is eliminated once first differences are taken. Third, the regression specified by

equation (6) implicitly controls for a full set of period effects. Finally, by focusing on the

difference in the quit rates in each period, we are asking whether this difference during the

treatment period is sufficiently unusual compared to past and future values that it is unlikely to

have arisen by chance. If the quit rates in the two series normally track one another but do not

during the treatment year, we would expect that there is something unusual about the treatment

year. On the other hand, if the quit rates in the two series often diverge wildly, then a substantial

divergence in the treatment year might simply be due to chance.

       Six aggregate quit regressions are contained in Table 5. The three in the top row employ

the unadjusted quit series, while the three in the bottom row employ the adjusted quit series. In


                                                                                                     21
column 1, the dependent variable is the difference between the CABG and PCI quit rates; in

column 2, it is the difference between the CABG and MM rates; and in column 3, it is the

difference between the PCI and MM rates. Three separate regressions are obtained for each

series because of evidence that the residual variance is not the same for each dependent

variable.21 To be consistent with the notation in Table 4, the variable at – at-1 is termed After in

the table.

  Consider the following two regressions
                           qpt – qpt-1 – (qm – qmt-1) = p(at – at-1)
                           qct – qct-1 – (qmt – qmt-1) = c(at – at-1),
where m denotes medical management. Estimates of p, c, and  c - p could be obtained from a pooled regression
of the form
                           qgt – qgt-1 – (qm – qmt-1) = cc(at – at-1) + p(1 – c)(at – at-1).
We do not follow that approach because the residual variance in the first regression is not equal to the corresponding
variance in the second regression.

                                                                                                                   22
       Focusing on the first column of Table 5, one sees that the difference between the CABG

quit rate and the PCI quit rate in treatment period is between 12 and 13 percentage points,

regardless of whether one uses the raw data or adjusts the quit rate for covariates. In the second

column, we see that the difference in the quit rate between CABG and MM patients drops when

one adjusts for covariates, but remains large (14.2 percentage points) and strongly statistically

significant. In the final column, we see that while the unadjusted quit rate for PCI patients is 7.3

percentage points larger than for MM patients, once one adjusts for a patient’s CAD diagnosis

and other medical conditions, the difference between the two quit rates is substantially smaller

and not statistically distinguishable from zero.



V. Potential Mechanisms

       In the analysis above, we demonstrate that CABG patients are substantially more likely to

quit smoking than those who have less invasive treatment for CAD. When combined with other

potential lifestyle modifications, this change in behavior may help explain why CABG patients

experience better mortality and morbidity outcomes over the long term than otherwise similar

PCI patients. This finding is consistent with a model in which patients undergoing CABG

receive a stronger and more persistent signal about the severity of their disease, leading them to

improve their behavior. However, other explanations are also possible.

       One alternative explanation is that CABG patients quit because they are forced to go

“cold turkey” during the length of their hospital stay. For the week that they are in a hospital,

most CABG patients are presumably unable to smoke, potentially kick-starting the quitting

process and making it easier for them to stay off cigarettes when discharged. PCI patients, by




                                                                                                    23
contrast, typically spend a day or less in the hospital, which might account for their lower quit

rate in the period surrounding their procedure.

        To test this theory – and provide a falsification test for our main results – we study two

common procedures that are unrelated to smoking but require relatively long hospital stays: total

knee replacement and total hip replacement.22 23 These procedures – taken together – were

performed over one million times in 2010, with over 500,000 procedures taking place in patients

65 and older (CDC, 2010). These two surgeries – which involve replacing a knee or hip joint

with a metal or plastic replica – are generally done to relieve arthritic pain, and patients spend at

least three to four nights in the hospital recovering.24 Smoking is largely unrelated to knee or hip

pain and so undergoing knee or hip replacement surgery would be unlikely to convey any new

information to a smoker about the value of quitting.

        To test the impact of a long hospital stay on smoking, we identify total knee and total hip

replacement patients using the same linked NHIS / Medicare data as in the main analysis. Figure

4 reproduces the CABG quit rate from Figure 3 and adds a series showing the quit rate for

patients who undergo knee or hip replacements.25 When we combine knee and hip replacement

recipients, we have data on 155 patients who smoked nine and half years prior to their surgery,

slightly below the 206 CABG smokers in our data. In the years prior to their procedure, the quit

rate for knee/hip and CABG patients are fairly similar, with the knee/hip quit rate somewhat

higher five to nine years prior to surgery and the CABG quit rate somewhat higher one to three

years prior to surgery. However, while the quit rate for CABG patients jumps dramatically in the

one year window surrounding their procedure, we see no similar increase for knee/hip patients.

Consistent with the visual evidence shown in Figure 4, regression results (not shown) show no

significant relationship between total knee or hip replacement surgery and quitting. It appears

unlikely that a substantial portion of the observed CABG impact on quitting is caused by going

“cold turkey” during a patient’s hospital stay.

                                           Alternatively, one might explain our main results by the doctor a patient sees. CABG

procedures are performed by heart surgeons, while PCI procedures are performed by

interventional cardiologists. If these two types of doctors systematically give different advice to

                                                                                                                                                    25
smokers on the importance of quitting, this might be the mechanism through which the CABG

quit rate rises above the PCI quit rate near the treatment date. Though different than our main

hypothesis – that CABG sends a stronger and more persistent signal to the patient about his or

her health problems – this mechanism is similar. Rather than the scar on a CABG patient’s

chest, it may be her heart surgeon who convinces her to quit smoking. Either way, the patient

updates her opinion on the value of quitting smoking based on the CABG experience. And,

while this alternative explanation – that heart surgeons are more persuasive smoking cessation

advocates – seems less likely to us, it arguably provides more actionable policy

recommendations.



VI. Conclusion

       Coronary Artery Disease is a frequently occurring and deadly disease. There are several

common treatments – including medical management, PCI, and CABG – and each has benefits

and costs associated with it. In this paper, we have examined one previously unexplored benefit

of more invasive treatment: those who undergo a procedure, particularly the more invasive

CABG surgery, are more likely to quit smoking. In our preferred regression model, we estimate

that CAD patients who undergo CABG are 12 percentage points more likely to quit smoking in

the one-year window surrounding their surgery than patients who undergo PCI. During the same

one-year window, CABG patients are 14 percentage points more likely to quit smoking than

medically managed patients. These results are robust to a number of alternative specifications.

       While we do not have data on behaviors other than smoking, we suspect that patients

undergoing more invasive surgery are also more likely to improve their diet, limit excessive

consumption of alcohol, and (when recommended) exercise more. Taken together, these



                                                                                                  26
behavioral responses may offset the inherent risks of a more invasive surgery and help explain

why the longer term outcomes for CABG patients exceed those of similar patients receiving PCI.

Our findings also highlight the importance of emphasizing healthier behaviors to those patients

who have less invasive medical treatment.

Note: the M edicare years labeled on the chart are potentially useful for our study because they represent a M edicare record that is linked
to a later NHIS interviews. M edicare records linked to earlier NHIS interviews provide no information on quitting behavior after CAD
treatment.


          For those respondents who were diagnosed with CAD prior to their NHIS interview date,

we have the ability to look at their smoking behavior before and after their diagnosis. For the

subset of CAD patients who underwent PCI or CABG, we can also look at their smoking

behavior before and after their procedure. For example, for individuals interviewed in 1994 who

had PCI, we can look at their smoking behavior before and after their procedure only if they

underwent PCI between 1991 and 1994 (and within 1994, only if their procedure was before the

date of the NHIS interview). If a person had PCI before 1991, then we have no record of their

procedure. If a person had PCI after 1994, then we have no record of their smoking behavior

after their procedure.

          Each person in the linked dataset, therefore, has a “diagnosis window” within which they

must be diagnosed with CAD to be included in our study. The longest window is for a person

who was interviewed in 1998 – she will be included if she was enrolled in Medicare and

diagnosed with CAD between 1991 and 1998 (prior to the interview date). The shortest window

is for a person who was interviewed in early 1999 – she will be included only if she was enrolled

in Medicare and diagnosed with CAD on an earlier date in 1999 than the date of her interview.
