                                           ABSTRACT

       This paper analyzes employment and earnings differentials between Spanish speakers and
English speakers in the United States, using data from the 1970, 1980. and 1990 U.S. censuses.
The results show that Spanish speakers, both men and women, do not perform as well in the
labor market as English speakers. The results also reveal that Spanish-English earnings and
unemployment differentials increased slightly in the 1970s, most likely because of rapid growth
in the number of Spanish speakers. By contrast, these differentials increased sharply in the
1980s, also a period of rapidly increasing supply. However, there is no evidence that the
widening of differentials in the I 980s reflects an increase in the labor market rewards to English
language proficiency. Rather, they appear to be the result of Spanish speakers having relatively
little of those labor market characteristics, most notably education1 whose market value increased
dramatically during the 1980s.

            Language, Employment, and  Earning, in the United States:
                 spanish-English Differential, from 1970 to 1990


     People of Hispanic origin constitute the largest ethnic minority in the
United States. One important characteristic of most members of this
minority is that their native tongue, Spanish. is not the major language of
the United States labor market. Although Hispanics will have an advantage
in those jobs that require Spanish, problems with spoken English may delay

their    integration into the mainstream economy and affect their economic
well-being.
     Many investigators   have studied the economic status of Hispanic
Americans. Recent studies have generally found that language skill, or more
precisely, a deficiency in being able to cotranunicate in English, is an
important factor in explaining the relatively low earnings of Hispanic
Americans. Most of this research is based on the Survey of Income and
Education (SIE), a large sample survey conducted by the U.S.       Bureau of the

Census   in 1976 that contains   many questions   on language use and ability.
Another   important source of data for studying Hispanic Americans is U.S.

population censuses, which contain direct information on language starting

in 1980, though not in as much detail as in the SIB. However, an important

advantage of census data over the SIE is that they permit researchers to

make comparisons over time.

     The purpose of this paper is to measure and analyze employment and

earnings gaps between English speakers and Hispanics/Spanish speakers using

data from successive U.S. censuses. In so doing, we extend our earlier work

(Bloom and Grenier 1992a) and the existing literature by including data from

the 1990 census and by analyzing earnings gaps among women. Since

relatively few datasets that include measures of individuals' labor market
characteristics and outcomes contain direct information on individuals'

mother tongue, spoken language, language proficiency, and so on, studies of

the labor market effects of language skills often assume a close connection

between language and ethnicity and use the latter, which is reported in most

surveys, as an indicator of the former. Empirical support for the use of

Hispanic ethnicity as a proxy for Spanish mother tongue is provided in Bloom

and Grenier (l992a)

     The paper begins with a brief survey of the economic literature on

earnings   gaps   between Hispanics and non-Hispanic Whites in the United States

(i.e., Spanish-English earnings gaps)        It   then describes the conceptual
framework we use to guide our empirical analyses. It continues with a
description of the data and a presentation and discussion of the empirical

results.



Rsvi.w of th. Literaturs

     Economists generally treat language as a kind of "human capital," which

can be developed in the same way that individuals develop other productive

skills (Bloom and Grenier 1992b) .       For example, individuals can acquire or

improve their language abilities by attending school, conversing with

others, engaging in self-study, and so forth. Although most people

corununicate predominantly in their mother tongue throughout their lives,

learning another language is not uncommon. Members of linguistic minorities

are particularly likely to acquire the dominant language of thesociety in

which they live. What is significant for economists is that the development

of language skills is not without costs. Learning a language typically

requires resources to pay for instruction and materials and, perhaps more

important, the conunitment of time, which also has value. As a basic

proposition of economic analysis is that individuals respond to incentives,


                                     2
economists generally believe that individuals seek to acquire those language

skills whose expected financial benefits exceed their expected costs. The

anticipation of various nonpecuniary benefits, for example, widening

intellectual horizons or gaining social acceptance, though difficult to

measure, will also play a role in these decisions.

       In 1969, the average annual earnings of prime-age Hispanic men in the

U.S. were 32 percent lower than for non-Hispanic white men. By 1989 the

shortfall had risen to 39 percent. The size of this differential has

stimulated a great deal of economic research over the years (and also of

sociological research, although that literature is not reviewed here) .       In
examining this research, it is useful to divide the economic studies on the

earnings   of Hispanic Americans into three generations. The first
generation, which consists of studies done mainly during     the   1960s and early
l970s, analyzed gross earnings gaps between     Hispanics (typically just

Mexicans) and non-Hispanics. These studies usually considered only one

major cause of the earnings gap: differences in educational attainment.

The second generation of studies, carried out from the mid-l9lOs to the

early l980s, used multiple regression analysis to examine the role of a

longer list of labor market characteristics, such as age, marital status.

and region of residence, in addition to educational attainment, to explain

earnings   gaps between non-Hispanics and the different Hispanic subgroups.
Although   none of the first or second generation studies had language

ability, per Se, as a central focus of analysis, mainly because of data

limitations, we review them here because they provide the intellectual roots

for   more recent labor market research that   focuses directly on language

ability. Finally, the third generation of studies, those conducted from the

early l960s on, emphasized the role of English language skills as an



                                  3
independent and potentially important determinant of earnings and other

labor market outcomes.


First-Generation Studies

      Fogel's (1966) study is perhaps the earliest attempt to provide an

analytical explanation for the relatively low earnings of Hispanic

Americans. Using a sample of men from the 1960 U.S. census,        Fogel analyzed
differences     in median incomes between Whites and various national origin

groups,   including Mexicans and Puerto Ricans. He      also constructed an index

of   educational   attainment for the same groups, which he compared to their

average incomes. One of his key findings was that differences in

educational attainment accounted for a sizeable portion of the differences

in   median   income, especially for Mexicans.
      Adopting a similar approach, Poston, Alvirez, and Tienda (1976)
decomposed earnings differences between non-Hispanics and Mexicans into a
portion due to differences in schooling and a portion due to differences in

the labor market reward for schooling (i.e., the schooling coefficient in

multiple regression analysis)         Comparing data from the 1960 and 1970 U.S.

censuses, they found that the portion of the earnings difference due to

differential labor market rewards assigned to schooling for Hispanics and

non-Hispanics increased during the 19605.

      Carliner (1976) used data from the 1970 Current Population Survey to

estimate rates of return to years of schooling for Whites, Blacks, and

different Hispanic groups. He found that the rate of return to education

was about two percentage points lower for Mexicans than for Whites. Rates

of return to schooling were also lower for Blacks relative to whites, but

they were higher for Cubans     and   for Central and South Americans. For Puerto

Ricans and other Spanish-speaking groups, they were about the same as those



                                      4
for Whites. These results must be interpreted with caution, however,

because   some of Carliner's   samples were   quite   small.


Second-Generation   Studies
     The second generation of studies combined the economic theory of human

capital   with multivariate statistical techniques to assess the contribution

to earnings differences of multiple characteristics of workers in addition

to their education. For example, using a sample of male workers from the

1970 U.S. census, Long (1977) decomposed White-Hispanic earnings

differentials into portions due to differences in workers' characteristics

and differences in the labor market rewards assigned to those

characteristics. The characteristics he considered include education, age,

region of residence, marital status, and hours worked. His results also

revealed higher returns to education for Cubans        than for   Mexicans or Puerto

Ricans, but not as high as for Whites. Long's major findings were that

about   half of the earnings differentials between Whites and Hispanics could

be attributed to differences in their labor market characteristics, a

finding later confirmed by Gwartney and Long (1978) in their analysis of the

1960 and 1970 U.S. censuses.

     Carliner (1980) used data for men from the 1970 U.S. census to

correlate earnings and labor market characteristics for eight ethnic groups,

including Puerto Ricans, Chicanos, and Cubans. Carliner was particularly

interested in the evolution of earnings across first, second, and third

generation Americans. One      of   his key findings was that increases in human

capital  are particularly important in explaining cross-generation increases
in the earnings of Puerto Ricans and Cubans. Among the labor market
characteristics whose connection to earnings he studied, Carliner included a
dummy variable for English mother tongue as a proxy for language skills.


                                      5
(Mother tongue was reported in a version of the public use sample of the

1970 U.S. census that unfortunately did not include another key labor market

variable: year of immigration.) However, he found that the coefficient of

this variable was insignificantly different from zero.

      Reimers (1983, 1984) used the Survey of Income and Education to analyze

earnings data for men belonging to five Hispanic groups, as well as for non-

Hispanic Whites and non-Hispanic Blacks. She found strong evidence of

differential labor market rewards for particular characteristics among

Puerto Ricans, Central and South Americans, and other Hispanics relative to

Whites, but not for Mexicans or Cubans. Although language ability was only

of peripheral interest in her studies, Reimers included a variable for

English-speaking ability in her regression specifications, and found that it

had a negative effect on earnings that was insignificantly different from

zero for all groups except Puerto Ricans.

       Also deserving of mention is DeFreitas' C1991) detailed statistical

analysis   of   the economic position of Hispanics in the United States, carried

out   using decennial census data from 1950 through 1980. the 1976 SIE, and
data from the Current Population Survey through 1987. DeFreitas documented
a large earnings gap between Hispanics and non-Hispanic Whites that has
widened steadily since the l960s. He also showed that the earnings of low-
skill Hispanics fell in the l98Qs relative to those of high-skill Hispanics.
a development that mirrors broader changes in the U.S. wage structure
(discussed further below)

Third-Generation     Studies

       The third and current generation of studies takes as its central focus
the role of language skills in earnings determination. These studies are
also done in the context of human capital theory, with language itself


                                    6
treated as part of an individual's human capital. In other words, the

studies view the ability to cocmnunicate in the language of the labor market

as an independent contributor to someone's productivity, and therefore to

their earnings. Investigators had recognized the potential importance of

language earlier (for example, Chiswick 1978; Carliner 1980 Reimers 1983,

1984) ,   but   the lack of data limited careful testing of detailed hypotheses

related to language.

       The SIE, which was conducted in early 1976, provided the long-awaited

data breakthrough needed for more detailed study of the effects of language

skills on earnings. The SIE included questions about different aspects of

language, some of which referred to an individual's past situation (e.g.,

mother tongue and language used at school), while others referred to

conditions at the time of the survey (e.g., language used at home, language

usually spoken by a person in different situations, and the ability to

understand and speak English).

       One of the difficulties researchers who worked with the StE faced was

how to best exploit the large amount of information on language. McManus,

Gould, and Welch (1983) considered all the language variables and defined

seven levels of language proficiency based on the effect of groups of

language variables on earnings. They then used their index in an earnings

equation and found that language proficiency explains a great deal of

earnings variability. However, Chiswick (1991) pointed out a serious

technical   problem related to the use of earnings data in the construction of
the   language proficiency index. This problem likely leads to upwardly

biased estimates of the strength of the language-earnings relationship.

      other researchers have used the StE's language questions to define and

test novel new hypotheses. McManus (1985) included a simple indicator based

on proficiency of understanding and speaking English in his earnings model,


                                    7
and found a significant impact on earnings. Grenier (1994) estimated

several specifications of wage equations for Hispanic men that included

various language indicators (e.g., speaking deficiency, language usually

spoken, and childhood language) .       Most of those indicators had statistically

significant effects in his earnings equations, thereby providing evidence

that language proficiency plays a role determining earnings.

     Tamer (1988) estimated earnings regressions for foreign-born men. She

used a simple measure of English deficiency and an index that incorporated

English-speaking ability, language used at home, and the language an

individual used most often. She found a significant positive effect of

English language ability on earnings for Hispanics.

     Icossoudji (1988) simultaneously modeled earnings and occupational

choices for Hispanic and Asian immigrants, distinguishing between

individuals on the basis of their fluency in English. She found that

immigrants who did not speak English well tended to occupy lower positions

on the occupational ladder.

     Some more recent studies have used data sets other than the SIE to

evaluate the effects of language skills on earnings. McManus (1990) used

the 1980 U.S. census to examine the effects of English proficiency within

and outside Hispanic enclaves. He found evidence that Hispanic men with

limited English skills experience less of an earnings shortfall when they

locate themselves in areas with a higher proportion of Hispanics.

     Rivera-Batiz (1990) analyzed the 1985 National Assessment of

Educational Progress, which includes a measure of English language

proficiency based on scores from a reading test, in contrast to the self-

assessed measure included in the SIE and most other large databases. He

used a sample of first and second generation immigrants, mostly Spanish-



                                    8
speaking, and found that English reading deficiency was a major factor

limiting immigrants' earnings levels.

        In addition, Rivera-Batiz (1991) found that, together with English

reading deficiency, inadequate quantitative skills explain a substantial

portion of the earnings gap between Hispanic and non-Hispanic White young

adults in the United States. He also found that women were more       negatively
affected     by English deficiency than men.

        In   subsequent work also based on the National Assessment of Educational
Progress, Rivera-Batiz (1992) found that when self-assessed measures of
English proficiency were used to predict wages, the link between the two
variables was weaker than when test-based measures were used. He suggests
that measurement error in self-assessed English proficiency may result in an

understatement of the importance of language skills as a determinant of

labor    market outcomes.
        Chiswick (1991) analyzed data from a survey of   male illegal aliens

apprehended in the Los Angeles area in 1986. most of them Hispanics.

Analyzing measures of English speaking and reading ability at the time of

the survey, as well as a measure of speaking ability before coming to the

United States, he found that reading ability affects earnings more than

speaking ability.

        Bloom and Grenier (1992a) compared the earnings of Hispanic and non-

Hispanic White men using data from the 1970 and 1980 U.S. censuses. They

found   evidence of a large earnings gap between Spanish- and English-speaking
men in the United States in the l970s. They also found evidence that the
increasing     supply of Spanish speakers in the United States, caused mainly by

rapid immigration, was responsible for a slight deterioration in the

relative wages of Hispanic workers during the 1970s.

    Smith (1992) analyzed 1980 U.S. census data for Hispanic men and found


                                     9
that English language ability has a sizeable and significant effect on their

wages. He concluded that English ability explains roughly half of the

earnings   differential between Hispanic irmnigrants and native-born Americans.
     In    sum, empirical   economic analyses have established two key results:
(1) that the earnings gap between Hispanics and non-Hispanics is caused
partly by Hispanics having less human capital than non-Hispanics, and partly

by Hispanics having a lower rate of return on their human capital than non-

Hispanics; and (2) that English language proficiency is an important

component of Hispanics' overall stock of human capital. These results are,

however, generally based on earnings data for men only, with few studies

based on data collected after 1980. The recent release of the public use

samples of the 1990 U.S. census allows us to help fill both gaps in the

literature.



Theoretical Framework

   Our theoretical framework for studying the relative earnings of Spanish

speakers    is based on economists' standard model of supply and demand. We
start   by considering a local economy whose population consists of two

language communities: Spanish speakers and English speakers. In the

interest of efficient communication between workers, employers, and

consumers, members of these language communities will tend to sort

themselves    so that most   interactions    take place among people who speak the
same language, which they can do,      for    example, by forming   enclaves   in which
either    Spanish or English dominates.

        The average wage and employment levels of individuals in each language

community    are determined in labor markets through the interaction of labor
supply and labor demand. Labor supply is determined by the size of the


                                      10
cousnunity and the labor effort forthcoming from each member at different

possible wage levels, which presumably depends in part on their skills.

Labor demand   refers to the amount of labor that   employers wish to hire at

different   wage levels, which mainly reflects   worker productivity and the

value of the good or service being produced. In general, for a given labor
demand schedule and set of institutional constraints (such as the minimum
wage), increases in the supply of labor lead to some combination of
increased employment, increased unemployment, and        lower   wages.
Alternatively, for a given supply of labor and     set   of labor market
constraints, increases in the demand for labor lead to some           combination   of
increased employment, reduced unemployment, and higher wages.
     Employment, unemployment, and earnings may     differ       among each language
connunity because of differences in their supply of labor or in the demand
for their labor. In addition, these     differences may vary       over time in
response    to differential shifts in labor supply or labor demand. For

example, an increase in the size of a particular language group caused by,

for example, immigration, will tend to increase the group's supply of labor,

and possibly also the demand for its labor, which implies increased

employment levels at an average wage that may be higher or lower depending

on the relative strength of the supply increase (wage-depressing) and the

demand increase (wage-enhancing). This framework does not rule out the

possibility that some workers will e employed in jobs in which their

language proficiency limits their productivity (i.e., jobs in which their

native tongue is not the primary language of communication) .             It also allows
for the possibility that some workers will become bilingual in an attempt to

expand their job opportunities and earning capacity.

     Assuming that individuals derive social and cultural          benefits from
living   in communities in which their mother tongue predominates, one might


                                   11
also expect the average wage of a linguistic minority to be relatively lower

in areas in which that community represents a larger share of the overall

population (because lower wages are required to induct individuals to locate

and work in such areas) .    Self-selection   might reinforce this effect insofar

as out-migrants from regions with a high proportion of minority-language

speakers   might place less value on these community characteristics or be
more ambitious and aggressive, and therefore more successful in the labor
market. Our empirical analysis examines these hypotheses through repeated
comparisons of regions with high and low proportions of Hispanics. Although
the nature of our data does not allow us to disentangle the effects of the
multiple   forces possibly influencing earnings differentials between the two

groups, we can measure the net effect and isolate some of its components.



Data and Sample

       We analyze the 1/1,000 public use samples of the 1970 and 1980 U.S.

censuses and a 2/1,000 sample from the 1990 U.S. census (drawn from a 1/100

sample tape). Ideally, we would have liked to define linguistic groups on

the basis of mother tongue, but we could not as this information is reported

only   in the 1970 census. As an alternative, we used Hispanic ethnic     origin

as a proxy in all the censuses. In Bloom and Grenier (l992a) we ran some

basic regressions using the 1976 SIE, which contains information on both

ethnic origin and mother tongue, and showed that the results are very

similar no matter which variable is used.

       Our analysis   focuses on two groups: individuals who reported a
Hispanic   origin (without regard to their origin subgroup, as the definition

of   these subgroups changed somewhat across censuses), and a control group of
non-Hispanic Whites. A key variable in the analysis is proficiency in


                                    12
English. for which census information is limited, While there is no

information on that characteristic in our 1970 census sample, the 1980 and

1990 censuses include an identical question on English speaking proficiency..

For the purpose of this study, individuals who reported that they can speak

English well or very well are defined as bilingual, while those who reported

that they do not speak English well or that they do not speak it at all are

defined as monolingual.

     Our sample includes individuals aged twenty-five to sixty-four. Men

and women are considered separately. For men we also perform a separate

analysis for those aged twenty-five to thirty-four, because we expect their

labor market outcomes to be more sensitive to, and therefore more reflective

of, changing supply and demand influences. By contrast, the employment and

earnings of older workers may reflect decisions and understandings that were

established long ago, for which it is difficult to account.

     For the analysis of earnings we include individuals who reported

positive wages and salaries (and no self-employment income) .   These earnings

figures refer to the calendar year preceding the year in which the census

was taken. Thus, the earnings data reported in the 1970. 1980, and 1990

censuses actually correspond to the years 1969, 1979, and 1989. We divide

the United States into regions with high proportions of Hispanics and

regions with low proportions. The distinction is made based on the relative

size of the population of Hispanic origin in states and metropolitan areas

in 1970. Arizona, California, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, and the

metropolitan areas of New York State and Florida are areas with a high

proportion of people of Hispanic origin. All other regions of the United

States have a low proportion of people of Hispanic origin. The regions are

divided in the same way in all three censuses.

     Some of the earnings comparisons are done with multiple regression


                                 13
analysis, using a standard set of control variables to account for

differences in human capital and other productivity-related characteristics.

.1l three censuses defined these in the same way, although some mild

assumptions occasionally have to be made to permit comparisons. For

instance, information on education is reported in a slightly different way

in the 1990 census than it is in the 1970 and 1980 censuses.

      The control variables include education measured in years, education

squared   to allow for nonlinearities, age, age squared, four dummy variables
for weeks worked during the previous year, six dummy variables for hours
worked during the week preceding the census, dummy variables for region of
residence (northeast, north central, south, and west), and dummy variables
for   years since migration for those born outside the United States (one to

five years, five to ten years. and more than ten years).



R.sults

       Table 1 reports descriptive statistics on the composition of the

samples   used to make   earnings   comparisons. The most striking fact is the
extraordinary increase in the proportion of Hispanics between      1970 and 1990.

For instance, in the heavily Hispanic regions. Hispanic men accounted for 12

percent of male workers in 1970, but 22 percent in 1990. This substantial

change reflects annual growth rates in the number of working age Hispanic

men   that   exceeded $ percent during each intercensal period, more than three

times the rate of increase among the non-Hispanic men. Hispanics also

increased     their relative presence in the labor market in regions with low
proportions of Hispanics, but to a much smaller extent.




                                      14
        Table 2 reports earnings comparisons between Hispanic workers and   non-
Hispanic White workers (which is interpreted, based on previous analyses

described earlier, as a comparison between individuals with Spanish as their

mother tongue and those with English as their mother tongue). For the sake

of strict comparability with the multiple regression results reported below,

which   are based on logarithmic earnings equations, earnings differentials
are measured in log points. These are calculated by taking the difference
between groups in the mean of the natural logarithm of their earnings.
These differences are roughly comparable to standard percentage differences
in earnings between the groups, and are not affected by changes in the value
of the U.S. dollar over time.




      The results presented in table 2 reveal four noteworthy patterns.

First, Spanish-English earnings differentials are sizeable and are larger

for   men than for women, a finding similar to that reported   by Shapiro and

Stelcner (1987) and Grenier (1988) in their studies of French-English

earnings differentials in Quebec. Among the men, earnings differentials are

slightly smaller for the group aged twenty-five to thirty-four than for the

group aged twenty-five to sixty-four.

      Second, Spanish-English earnings differentials are substantially larger

in the heavily Hispanic regions than in the regions with a low proportion of

Hispanics. This result is consistent with the view that labor markets with

larger proportions of minority language speakers value language skills

differently than markets with smaller proportions.

                                               differentials tended to
    Third, for men, spanish-English earnings

increase during the two decades under study.   The increase is particularly

                                                       during the l980s. The
sizeable in the heavily Hispanic regions, especially

earnings gap also increased for women in those regions during the 1980s,

after decreasing during the 1970s. For women in the regions with a low

proportion of Hispanics. the earnings gap was stable in the 19705 and

declined in the 19805.

     Fourth, earnings differentials are greater for monolingual Spanish

speakers than for bilingual Hispanics. They also appear to have increased

more during the l980s for monolingual Spanish speakers than for bilingual

Hispanics. especially in the heavily Hispanic regions.

     To test whether these basic patterns and changes in raw earnings

differentials can be accounted for by the underlying labor market

characteristics of the broadly defined groups under study, we use multiple

regression analysis to re-estimate these differentials    for workers who are

statistically comparable in terms of their marital status, region      of


residence, period of itmaigration. age, and education. We also standardize

 the results for differences in weeks worked per year and hours worked per

 week, so that the regression results may be interpreted as hourly earnings

 differentials.

      The results of this analysis are reported in table 3, which shows     that

 the pattern of regression-corrected differentials is not at all similar to

 that of the raw differentials. First, all the corrected differentials are

 smaller than the raw differentials. This change indicates that differences

 in education, age, marital status, and other control variables between the

 Spanish   and English comparison groups account for much (generally more than
 halt) of the differences in their earnings. Indeed.     many of   the estimated
 earnings   differentials for women are no longer significantly different from


                                   16
zero after one introduces regression controls.




     The most important result     in   table 3 is the absence of any widening of

Spanish-English earnings gaps in the 1980s. Given the substantial widening

of the raw earnings differentials apparent in table 2, the        results   in table

3 provide a clear indication that the l900s deterioration of Hispanics'

relative earnings is associated with a deterioration in either the non-

language components of their human capital or in the value assigned to that

human capital in the labor market.

     To explore this issue further, table 4 reports estimates of the rate of
return to schooling for twenty-five to sixty-four year old men in the 1970,
1980, and 1990 U.S. censuses. The estimates declined slightly in both the
high and low proportion Hispanic regions in the l970s, and increased           sharply

in both regions in the 1980s. This pattern of results is consistent with
other recent research on changes in the structure of wages in the United
States    during the past two   decades (see, for example, Blackburn, Bloom, and
Freeman 1990, 1991, 1993; Katz and Murphy 1992; and Bound and Johnson 1992)

By and large, the estimated differences in the rates of return        to    schooling

between people with Spanish and      English   mother tongues are small,

insignificant, and show little trend over time. As the Spanish speakers

have less average education than the English speakers, increased wage

premiums associated with educational attainment clearly represented a labor

market development of the l980s with adverse implications for the Spanish

speakers. thus, an important factor that contributed to the deteriorating



                                     17
economic position of Spanish speakers in the l9SOs appears to have been a

change    in   the overall   structure of wages that hurt   the   Spanish   speakers not

because    of their mother tongue or country of origin, but rather because of
their    relatively low levels of schooling. As     noted earlier, DeFreitas
C   1991) reached a similar conclusion in his analysis of the widening earnings

gaps between Hispanics and non-Hispanics.




        Table 3 shows that the Spanish-English earnings gaps remain larger in

the   heavily    Hispanic regions than in regions with low proportions of

Hispanics      even after controlling for individual labor market
characteristics. This result highlights the local nature of labor and
product    markets and suggests that the degree to which Spanish speakers are

geographically      concentrated may be an important determinant of their
economic position in the aggregate. It also suggests that a large supply of

minority-language speakers depresses wages more among those whose primary

language    is not the dominant language of the labor market than it drives
their   wages upward by creating demand for services in the minority language.
However, positive self-selection of Hispanics into low proportion Hispanic
regions    may   also account for lower earnings differentials in those regions,
a hypothesis that is supported by the observation that Spanish-English
education gaps are narrower       in the low-proportion Hispanic regions than in

the   heavily Hispanic regions. This hypothesis also derives support from the
fact that the difference in the spanish-English earnings gap between the low
and high proportion Hispanic regions is smaller for women than for men,
presumably because the self-selection phenomenon operates primarily among

                                       18
men. In addition, the stability of the regression-corrected earnings

differentials during the l970s and 1980s, despite the sharp            increases   in the

relative supply of Spanish speakers in the heavily Hispanic regions,

suggests a more important role of demand shifts than          is   indicated by the

simple comparison of ,earnings differentials across regions.

        Turning   now from the wage side of the    labor market to the employment

side,    table S   reports   employment-to-population ratios (EPR) • labor force
participation rates CLFP) ,       and   unemployment rates CUR) for selected
demographic groups and regions. These indicators of labor market activity
and success are related, for each subgroup and time period, by the following
identity: Efl =       LFP Il-UR) .   this formula allows us to decompose changes in
employment-to-population ratios into changes in labor forces participation
rates and unemployment rates.




        For men, the employment-to-population ratio fell from 1970 to 1990,
though by a larger amount for individuals of Spanish mother tongue than of
English mother tongue. This difference is caused primarily by relatively
larger increases in the unemployment rates of the Spanish speakers than by
differential      changes in their labor force participation rates. Indeed, by

1990 the unemployment rates of Spanish-speaking men were more than twice

those of English-speaking men in          the heavily Hispanic regions.
        Spanish-speaking women also have lower employment-to-population ratios
than    English-speaking     women, though these rates increased for both groups
from 1970 to 1990. Unemployment rates for Spanish-speaking women were


                                         19
higher than for    English-speaking women, and increased steadily throughout

the period under study.

     Table    6 reports gross differentials in unemployment   rates as well as

adjusted   differentials   that use multiple regression analysis to remove the

influence on unemployment of the following set of characteristics; marital

status, age, region, period of immigration, and education. In other words,

the differentials reported in the second panel of table 6 refer to

individuals    who are statistically comparable in terms of this set of
characteristics.




     Table 6 shows that unemployment rate differences between the Spanish

and English speakers are statistically explained by differentials in their

labor market characteristics, especially in 1970 and 1980. Nevertheless,

the portion of excess unemployment among Hispanic men (and women) that could

not be explained by their labor market characteristics was statistically

significant in (1980 and) 1990. The estimates also indicate that labor

market characteristics can account for increases in the relative

unemployment rates    of Spanish speakers in the 1900s (upper panel of table 6)
without reference to mother tongue or     ethnicity.



Suary
     This study has analyzed differential labor market outcomes between

Spanish speakers and English speakers residing in the United States.

Consistent with most previous studies' conclusions, the results presented

here show that the earnings of Spanish speakers fall short of those of


                                     20
English speakers, even controlling for cross-group differences in non-

language dimensions of human capital. Language-earnings differentials are

wider among men than among women, and are also quite wide in the more

heavily Hispanic regions of the United States, an indication either that the

return to language skills varies according to the linguistic composition of

local labor and product markets, or that there is considerable self-

selection in the location decisions of Spanish speakers. Earnings

differences between monolingual Spanish and      English   speakers are larger than

those between bilingual Spanish and    English   speakers.

     This study also extends previous studies of language-earnings

differentials by analyzing 1990 census data, by focusing on labor market

outcomes   among women as well as among men, and by examining labor market
outcomes on the quantity side of the market (i.e., employment, labor force
participation, and tmemployment) in addition to earnings differentials.
     The results reveal rapid growth in the number of Spanish speakers and
slight increases in Spanish-English earnings and unemployment differentials
in the 1910s. By contrast, these differentials increased sharply in the
l980s,   also a period of rapidly increasing supply. However, there is no

evidence that these widening differentials reflect an increase in the labor

market rewards to English language proficiency. Rather, they appear to be

the result of Spanish speakers having relatively little of those labor

market characteristics, most notably education, whose market value increased

dramatically during the 19808.
