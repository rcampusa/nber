Nominal Wage Rigidities in Mexico: Evidence from Social Security Records

NBER Working Paper No. 10383

JEL No. J31, J33
                                          ABSTRACT
This paper analyses the existence and extent of downward nominal wage rigidities in the Mexican
labor market using data from the administrative records of the Mexican Social Security Institute
(IMSS). This longitudinal, firm-level dataset allows us to track workers employed with the same
firm, observe their wage profiles and calculate the nominal-wage changes they experience over time.
Based on the estimated density functions of nominal wage changes and other moments of the
distribution, we are able to calculate several standard tests of nominal wage rigidity that have been
proposed in the literature. Furthermore, we extend these tests to take into account the presence of
minimum wage laws that may affect the distribution of nominal wage changes. The densities and
tests calculated using these date are similar to those obtained using administrative data from other
countries, and constitute a significant improvement over the measures of nominal wage rigidities
obtained from household survey data. We find considerably more wage rigidity than previous
estimates obtained for Mexico using data from the National Urban Employment Survey suggest.
Furthermore, we find evidence that the extent of nominal wage rigidities has been falling over time.
We also document the importance of minimum wages in the Mexican labor market, as evidenced
by the large fraction of minimum wage earners and the widespread indexation of wage changes to
the minimum wage increases.

1. Introduction


       There is a growing consensus about the importance of labor regulations in
determining the productivity of labor itself as well as total factor productivity. Thus, the
effect of certain types of labor regulations may well extend beyond the traditional
deadweight losses associated with taxation implied by static partial equilibrium models.
This consensus is emerging at the crossroad of two strands of the literature.


According to the first strand, the existence of certain types of labor regulations may act as
a barrier to the adoption of new technologies and best organizational practices, which can
adversely affect total factor productivity (TFP) and thus per capita income. In particular,
Parente and Prescott (1994, 1999, 2000) and Prescott (1998) have argued theoretically,
and shown in a series of case studies, that regulations —including labor-market
policies— can effectively block the adoption of more productive technologies and better
organizational methods. Since differences in per capita income across countries are
accounted for by differences in total factor productivity, these regulations or “barriers to
riches” are at the center of the development theory they propose to explain relative per
capita income levels.


The second strand of the literature is mainly empirical, and uses establishment- and firm-
level data to decompose the growth in total factor productivity into different sources (see,
for example, Foster, Haltiwanger and Krizan (2000 and 2002), Griliches and Regev
(1995), Haltiwanger (2000), Oley and Pakes (1996)). According to these decompositions,
growth in TFP can occur within existing firms (with firms increasing their factor
productivity through the adoption of new technologies and better organizational
practices), through resource reallocation across firms (with resources reallocated from
less productive to more productive firms), or through the entry and exit of firms with
different levels of total factor productivity (with less productive firms exiting the market
and more productive firms entering the market).




                                                                                           1
The analysis of productivity growth occurring through the reallocation of resources
across firms, industries and sectors or through the entry and exit of firms has received a
great thrust from the availability of new longitudinal datasets at the firm or establishment
level. These analyses reveal several important facts (see Davis, Haltiwanger and Schuh
(1996), Davis and Haltiwanger (1999) and Haltiwanger (2000)). First, there is a lot more
reallocation of resources across firms and industries at any point during the business
cycle than the aggregate net statistics would suggest. Second, much of the growth in
productivity occurs through reallocation between firms and industries and through the
entry and exit of firms, rather than through productivity growth within existing firms.
Thus, to the extent that rigidities or inefficiencies introduced by bankruptcy and labor
laws or other regulations prevent the reallocation of labor and other resources to their
most efficient uses, productivity growth may be seriously hindered.


A recent contribution that is at the intersection of these two strands of the literature is
Lagos (2004), who builds a model where the level of aggregate TFP is an explicit
function of the economic environment in general (including, for example, the firm-level
technology and the distribution of shocks), and labor-market policies in particular.
According to this model, labor-market policies affect the job creation and job destruction
decisions and thus the productivity composition of active firms. Since the level of TFP is
related to the average productivity of active firms, labor-market policies can increase or
reduce the aggregate level of TFP in an economy.


While theory and evidence are increasingly pointing to the importance of a market that
allows for unimpeded adjustments to labor, policies have lagged behind. From an
economic policy standpoint, the implementation of a labor market reform to attain greater
flexibility has been outstanding for the past two decades in Mexico and other Latin
American countries (see Lustig and Edwards (1997) and Pagés and Heckman (2003)).
The majority of the labor regulations in Latin America date back to the first half of the
twentieth century, and have experienced only minor reforms since. While some countries
in the region have adopted measures to increase the flexibility of their labor markets,
these attempts have been halfhearted. The issue of labor reform has become even more



                                                                                          2
pressing in light of the increase in international competition from China and other South
East Asian countries, most of which have “at will” hiring and firing policies and thus
very flexible labor markets. As the macroeconomic environment has become more stable
and inflation gradually converges to the levels of developed countries, the typical
clearing mechanism in the labor market —according to which unanticipated increases in
inflation induced sharp decreases in real wages— is no longer available.


In this paper we focus on two particular types of labor regulations which may give rise to
inefficiencies in the allocation of labor both within the firm and across firms, industries
and sectors: nominal-wage rigidities and minimum wages. The existence and extent of
downward nominal wage rigidities has given rise to one of the longest standing debates in
macroeconomics. Many macroeconomic models postulate the existence of such rigidities,
and their results crucially hinge on this assumption since the effects of monetary policy
largely depend on their existence and magnitude. Despite this debate, there is surprisingly
little empirical evidence on their existence and magnitude (for exceptions, see
Castellanos (2003), Card and Hyslop (1997), Crawford and Wright (2001), Dwyer and
Leong (2000), Farès and Hogan (2000), Faruqui (2000), Kahn (1997), Lebow, Saks and
Wilson (2003), and Wilson (2002)). While most of the literature on downward nominal
wage rigidities has focused on their implications for the conduct of monetary policy, it is
possible, as will be argued below, that the effects of these rigidities extend to other areas
of the economy. We also analyze the interaction of downward nominal wage rigidities
and minimum wages, an issue which has not been analyzed before and which is
potentially important in Latin American countries, where the fraction of minimum wage
earners is high relative to more developed economies and the practice of indexing wage
changes to the minimum wage increases is pervasive.


The issue of downward nominal wage rigidity in Mexico is particularly interesting for at
least four reasons. First, the Mexican economy has undergone a remarkable process of
economic liberalization during the past two decades, including a major shift in openness
to trade and foreign investment. This fact should imply a greater need to reallocate labor
across firms, industries and sectors increased relative to the period when the economy



                                                                                           3
was closed. Second, the process of disinflation that the Mexican economy has undergone
during the past two decades, and the resulting stabilization of nominal variables, may
have increased the importance of nominal wage rigidities. Thus, while nominal wage
rigidities may not have been relevant for firms during the period of high inflation when
real wage declined even in the absence of nominal wage decreases, the current
environment of low and stable inflation makes this feature potentially binding. Third, in
contrast to many countries where downward nominal wage rigidity may be an artefact of
a person’s perception that a nominal-wage decrease is “unfair”, in Mexico the law
specifically forbids nominal wage cuts (see Federal Labor Law (LFT), Article 51). Thus,
while for most countries it remains an open question why nominal wages do not adjust
downwards to help clear the labor market during recessions (see Bewley (1999)), it is less
of a puzzle in Mexico since this provision is part of the legal framework. Fourth, the
nominal wage rigidities imbedded in the current legislation may interact with other
regulations in the law such as minimum wages, mandated benefits and other restrictions
such as firing costs, since a firm that complies with one regulation is very likely to
comply with all other regulations. Furthermore, the firms that typically comply with the
regulations tend to be the large industrial firms, many of which are among the most
productive in the economy.


Another important issue in our paper is the analysis of the effects of minimum wages in
the Mexican labor market. Minimum wages in Mexico might have different effects than
in other countries due to the high fraction of minimum-wage earners and the common
practice in the Mexican economy of indexing wages changes and other contracts —
including administrative fees, fines, an even mortgage payments— to minimum wage
increases. Our analysis confirms the importance of minimum wages in Mexico, as shown
by the high fraction of minimum-wage earners and the indexation of wage changes to the
minimum wage increases. Thus, the minimum wage is as a key variable in the Mexican
economy through the influence that increases in the minimum wage exert on other price
changes.




                                                                                        4
The main contribution of this paper is to bring together the measurement of downward
nominal wage rigidity and the rigidities introduced by the existence of minimum wage
laws in a unified and coherent framework. In particular, the present analysis provides
evidence on the existence and extent of downward nominal wage rigidity in the Mexican
economy using data from the administrative records of the Mexican Social Security
Institute (IMSS). This dataset is similar to the establishment-level dataset used by Lebow,
Saks and Wilson (2003) for the U.S., making the results more comparable between the
two countries. In order to test for the existence and magnitude of DNWRs, this paper
calculates several standard measures and tests proposed in the literature. Furthermore, it
modifies the tests proposed by Kahn (1997) to account for the possible effect of a large
fraction of minimum wage earners and widespread indexation of nominal wage changes
to the minimum wage increases. By using data from the IMSS administrative records
developed and used by Kaplan, Martínez and Robertson (2003a and 2003b) to analyze
worker and job flows and employment displacement costs, we are able to obtain very
accurate measures of nominal wages and nominal-wage changes. Thus, this paper greatly
improves upon the previous evidence reported by Castellanos (2003) on nominal wage
rigidity in Mexico using household survey data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first time that tests on nominal wage rigidities have been obtained for a developing
county using this type of data, and the first time that the standard tests of nominal wage
rigidities have been modified to explicitly incorporate the effects of the minimum wages
simultaneously.


The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section reviews in more detail the
literature on nominal wage rigidity, while section 3 describes the data used in the paper.
Section 4 describes an overview of the institutional and legal framework that regulates
labor in Mexico. Section 5 presents some simple statistics. Section 6 describes the
econometric models we estimate and presents our main results. Finally, Section 7
summarizes the main findings of the paper.

2. Downward Nominal Wage Rigidity (DNWR)


The empirical literature on Downward Nominal Wage Rigidity (DNWR), despite the
obvious importance of the issue for the conduct of monetary policy, has received
relatively little attention until recently. The first generation of studies were based on
microeconomic data on wages from household survey, such as the Panel Study of Income
Dynamics (PSID) or the Current Population Survey (CPS), and focused on establishing
the existence and extent of DNWR (see Altonji and Devereux (1999), Card and Hyslop
(1997), Castellanos (2003), Dweyer and Leong (2000), Kahn (1997) and McLaughlin
(1994, 1999)).1 More recently, this literature has shifted from using household survey
panel data to using establishment- or firm-level panel data from administrative record,
such as the data used in the calculation of the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Employment
Cost Index (ECI) (see Lebow, Saks and Wilson (2003)). The advantage of the second
generation of studies is that they are based on more accurate measures of wages since
they are obtained from administrative records and not from self-reported household
surveys. Even more accurate measures of wages and wage changes have been obtained
using data for a small, non-random sample of firms that track both jobs and individuals
(see Wilson (2002)). The current state of this literature can be summarized as follows: as
the accuracy of the data on wages has progressively increased through the use of better
datasets, more evidence on the existence of significant DNWR has been found.


The detection of nominal wage rigidities usually begins by estimating the probability
density functions of wage changes over consecutive periods (typically a year) using
longitudinal data on individual workers or jobs. The existence of DNWR is then first
established through analyzing the shape of the density functions as well as through
estimating certain moments of the distributions. To the extent that wages exhibit
DNWRs, the estimated densities should be asymmetric (right skewed), with few
observations corresponding to negative wage changes and much of the density’s mass



1
  A notable exception is Bewley (1999), who analyzes the causes of nominal wage rigidities through a
series of extensive interviews with key labor market participants in the some labor markets in the
Northeastern U.S.


                                                                                                  6
piled up at zero, reflecting the fact that negative wage changes are legally or
institutionally prohibited. The analysis is then formalized through the estimation of
sample statistics and measures of DNWR, such as those proposed by Kahn (1997),
Lebow, Stockton and Wascher (1995) and Lebow, Saks and Wilson (2003). In general,
these measures try to compare the actual distribution of nominal wage changes with a
hypothetical distribution of nominal wages under no rigidities (see below for a
description of some of these tests).


The only evidence on downward nominal wage rigidities for the case of Mexico is by
Castellanos (2003), who estimates a series of standard measures of DNWR using
microdata from the National Urban Employment Survey (or ENEU for its acronym in
Spanish) for the period 1994-2001. In particular, this study exploits the rotating panel
structure of the ENEU data, which tracks workers over five consecutive quarters, in order
to estimate distributions of wage changes. Since there is no way of knowing from the data
whether an individual remains employed with the same firm over any two consecutive
quarters, it is assumed that a worker who is employed in the same economic sector and
has the same position and occupation over consecutive periods is employed with the
same firm. The data on nominal wages come from self reported wages, and is thus likely
to be measured with error. Both of these drawbacks when using household survey data
imply that the extent of nominal wage rigidity is likely to be underestimated, since
workers who are wrongly classified as job stayers will appear as having experienced a
nominal wage change, and some of the measurement error in wages will be attributed to
wage flexibility.


The results in Castellanos (2003) suggest that, according to the estimated densities of
wage changes and from standard measures of DNWR, including those proposed by Kahn
(1997), Lebow, Stockton and Wascher (1995), and Lebow, Saks and Wilson (2003),
nominal wages in Mexico exhibit few rigidities when compared to other countries. Only
for a small number of industries (large, formal firms) there is evidence of substantial
nominal wage rigidities. Unfortunately, the estimations reported are not directly
comparable to those obtained using data from administrative records for other countries



                                                                                       7
(such as Lebow, Saks and Wilson (2003) for the U.S., or Dweyer and Leong (2000) for
Australia), since there is no way of knowing with certainty if workers actually remained
employed with the same firm, there is no uniform measure of wages such as wage per
hour and there is much more measurement error in wages than with data from
administrative records.



3. Data


The data used in this paper come from the administrative records of the Mexican Social
Security Institute, or Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS). These administrative
records constitute a unique database of all the private-sector firms affiliated with the
IMSS and their employees. Although this type of longitudinal, establishment-level
database has been used for academic purposes in other countries, such as in the U.S. and
several European countries, this is one of the few database of its kind for a developing
country.


It is important to stress that these data come from the actual records used by IMSS to
administer the social security system; thus, they were not originally intended for use as a
public database. In fact, this information only became amenable to statistical analysis
after Kaplan, Martínez and Robertson (2000a and 2000b) gained access, cleaned and
processed the administrative records. The number of employees ranges from roughly 5
million in the middle 1980s to roughly 12 million in recent years. It is also important to
highlight that the database is not a representative sample of all firms in the country, but
rather a census of all formal (i.e., legally established with the Mexican Social Security
Institute) firms, their establishments and their employees.


The Social Security Law and its accompanying code establish that every private-sector
employer has the legal obligation to affiliate each of their employees with the IMSS.2

2
  All definitions and regulations regarding the registration of employers and their employees to the IMSS
are contained in the Social Security Law (Ley del Seguro Social, or LSS) and its accompanying code
(Reglamento de la Ley del Seguro Social en material de afiliación, clasificación de empresas, recaudación y
fiscalización).


                                                                                                         8
Every affiliated firm is given an employer register number (Registro Patronal) for each
county (municipio) in which the firm has an establishment or plant. If a firm has multiple
establishments or plants within a county, it will have a single register for them as long as
all establishments and plants are in the same sector of activity. Thus, firms can have
multiple registers depending on the number of establishments they have in different
municipalities, and can also have multiple registers within a municipality if the
establishments or plants are dedicated to different activities. Once affiliated with the
IMSS, each employees is assigned a unique social security number (Número de
Seguridad Social), which has recently began to be replaced by a unique personal
identification number (Clave Única de Registro de Población).


Wage in the IMSS data are reported in a standardized measure, called the base salary
(salario base de cotización, or SBC). The SBC is a comprehensive measure of wage plus
benefits, including payments made in cash, bonuses, premiums, room and board,
commissions, benefits in kind and any other amount paid or benefit received. The SBC is
also standardized in the sense that it is reported as a daily wage, even if the employees are
paid on a weekly, fortnightly or monthly basis. Employers are also obliged to report the
number of hours and number of days worked, and social security contributions are paid
monthly and calculated based on the daily SBC and the number of days worked per
month. We do not, however, have access to information on hours or days worked.
Employers have the legal obligation to report to the IMSS, within the next five working
days, if any of the following occurs: suspension, resumption, termination, or change of
activities; change in name, registry or address; and any change in the SBC of any worker.
In sum, the SBC is a comprehensive measure of wages plus benefits which is consistent
over time and is required to be continually updated by firms when it suffers any change.


It is important to underscore that the SBC is capped below at the minimum wage in the
corresponding geographic area of each establishment, and is currently capped at 25 times
the minimum daily wage prevalent in Mexico City for all establishments. The cap was at
10 times the minimum wage prior to 1995. While a large fraction of the workers affiliated
to the IMSS earn exactly the minimum wage (11.7% in 2002 according to official IMSS



                                                                                           9
statistics), only a small share are capped above (2.3% in 2002). In order to insure that
none of the results in this paper are not driven by this feature of the data, we repeated all
estimations with and without the groups of workers whose base wage is capped below
and above.


Regarding the accuracy of the SBC, it is important to note that employers have an
incentive to underreport base wages in order to lower the social security contributions
they pay. Employees, on the other hand, have no incentive to underreport wages since
many of the benefits they receive are proportional the base wage their employees report
to the IMSS. Thus, unless workers are appropriately compensated in cash by their
employers for the decrease in benefits, they will not agree with a decrease in the wage
reported to the IMSS.3 Although there are incentives for employers to underreport wages,
the IMSS has been accorded the legal status of autonomous fiscal authority. This implies
that it can engage in coercive actions to collect contributions —including seizing firm’s
assets—, which greatly enhance its ability to enforce the law.


The administrative data from the IMSS records offer several advantages over existing
household survey datasets such as the National Urban Employment Survey (ENEU),
which make the calculations obtained using administrative data more reliable. First, with
the administrative records it is known with certainty whether a worker remains employed
with the same firm over time, since there are unique individual codes that identify
establishments (Registro Patronal) and workers (Número de Seguridad Social or Clave
Única de Registro de Población). In contrast, with household survey data one has to
assume that a worker who is employed in the same economic sector, position and
occupation over consecutive periods is employed with the same firm, although there is
actually no information in the questionnaire that could help identify an individual firm.

3
  For example, in case of disability the insurance is based on a replacement rate of 100% of the base salary
while the disability lasts, and 70% of the base salary if the disability is permanent. In case of illness, the
health insurance is based on a replacement rate of 60% of the base salary while the illness lasts (up to 52
weeks). In case of maternity, the insurance is based on a replacement rate of 100% of the base salary for 42
days before and after giving birth. In the case of the retirement insurance, and old-age unemployment and
old-age insurance (Cesantía en Edad Avanzada y Vejez), employer plus employee contributions are equal
to 2% and 4.175% of the base salary, respectively. Since these contributions are deposited in an individual
retirement account, there is a strong linkage between contributions and future benefits.


                                                                                                          10
This method evidently does not precludes the possibility that workers may have switched
jobs but remained in the same sector, position and occupation. If this is the case, one
would classify a worker as a job stayer while in fact he would be a job mover. Second, as
stressed above, the definition of base wages reported in the administrative data (salario
base de cotización) is consistent over time and, given that they are the wages on which
employers pay payroll taxes, they are less prone to be measured with error.4 In contrast,
the data on wages from household surveys are typically measured with error since they
are based on self-reported wages.


On the other hand, the drawback of administrative records relative to household survey
data is that they include a very limited set of information on individual and firm
characteristics that could be used as covariates. Nevertheless, for the purposes of this
paper, which is to analyze nominal wage rigidities for those workers who remain
employed with the same firm over a period of time, the two advantages highlighted
before far outweigh the drawback of having limited information on individual
characteristics.


In this paper we use quarterly observations for the period 1985-2001. In particular, for
each quarter we calculated the nominal wage changes over the previous year for all
workers who remained employed with the same firm and then extracted a random sample
of 500,000 workers on the following dates: March 31, June 30, September 30, and
December 31. That is, we extract data from the last day of each quarter. The ability to
know exactly to what date the wage observations refer to is of crucial importance for our
ability to incorporate an analysis of minimum wages into the work. Minimum wages are
often changed multiple times in a year (particularly in years with high inflation), and the
dates of these changes can vary from year to year. Since we know the exact dates of the
wage measurements, we know exactly which minimum-wage regime was applicable to
each wage observation.

  In fact, the SBC is a standard measure of wage plus benefits which corresponds closely to the measure of
total compensation from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Employment Cost Survey used by Lebow, Saks
and Wilson (2003). In this sense our results are comparable to theirs, except for the fact that the ECS
follows jobs rather than persons.

4. Institutional Features of the Mexican Labor Market

The Mexican labor legislation is characterized, as in many other Latin American
countries, by generous mandated benefits and a high level of job protection. At the same
time, the labor market is characterized by a high degree of non-compliance with these
labor laws and regulations, as reflected in the high share of workers that in fact do not
receive some or any of the mandated benefits. In Mexico, the main labor laws mandate
that employers should comply with several regulations, provisions and restrictions,
including minimum wages, minimum age of employment, maximum length of the
working day, overtime pay, social security contributions, severance payments, seniority
premia, maternity leave, on-the-job training provisions and non-discrimination policies,
among others. There is even a provision unique to Mexico that mandates employers to
share profits with their employees (reparto de utilidades).


According to several measures of labor legislation flexibility (in hiring, in firing, and in
working conditions), Mexico is one of the countries with the most rigid labor laws in the
world (see Botero, Djankov, La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes and Shliefer (2003)). In contrast,
Mexico’s main trading partners and closest foreign competitors, including the U.S.,
Canada and most South East Asian countries, have a highly flexible labor market, with
few if any impediments to how labor is allocated within or between firms. This fact
evidently places Mexico at a disadvantage relative to these countries. One reason why
this fact could be ignored in the past is that real wages in Mexico displayed a remarkable
degree of downward flexibility, which provided much of the correction needed to regain
competitiveness. This adjustment in wages typically came through unexpected increases
in inflation. At any rate, the adjustment mechanism afforded by real wage flexibility is no
longer available in the current environment of low and stable inflation. Thus, flexibility
in the labor market will have to come from some other source.


Labor legislation in Mexico is extremely detailed and complicated, since it is contained in
several laws and in thousands of articles. It is also outdated. The Constitution dates back



                                                                                         12
to 1917, and the main article related to labor (Article 123) has experienced only minor
reforms since. The Federal Labor Law (LFT) was enacted in 1970, and has also
experienced only minor reforms, mostly in the direction of increasing the mandated
benefits for workers and reducing the flexibility with which labor can be employed. This
law was written back when the economy in Mexico was mostly closed to external
competition and foreign direct investment was limited, following the prescriptions of the
import substitution model. In this context, it made sense, from a redistributive point of
view, to have a labor legislation generous towards the employees since firms had rents to
be shared. Of course, whether a generous labor legislation is the best way of extracting
rents and redistributing them is highly disputable. Nevertheless, many of the rents that
existed under a closed economy have disappeared since 1985, when the country began a
trade liberalization process by joining the General Agreement of Trade and Tariffs
(GATT). Today, Mexico has a mostly open economy, and has signed free trade
agreements with the U.S., Canada, the European Union, and fourteen other countries.
Thus, to the extent that Mexico competes with Asian countries to attract FDI, all of which
have more flexible labor markets, the current labor laws and regulations have become a
binding constraint for those firms and industries that compete on a global scale. The same
is true of the United States, Mexico’s largest trading partner and the final destination of
over 85% of Mexican exports, which has an “at will” hiring and firing policy and one of
the most flexible labor markets in the world.


It is important to underscore that some of the features of the labor market in Mexico may
be the result of an explicit legal regulation, in contrast to other countries in which they
may be the result of an implicit arrangement or of social convention. This is the case, for
example, of the prohibition in the Mexican labor legislation to lower nominal wages
(LFT, Article 51). In particular, a worker whose nominal wage or benefits have been
reduced can take legal action against his or her employer and request for compensation as
if he or she had been dismissed without just cause. Thus, while nominal wage rigidities
are a well known —albeit little understood— fact in other labor markets, in Mexico one
only has to look at the law to find its origin. One particularly detrimental aspect of the
way in which the current labor regulations operate is the irreversibility of the rigidities



                                                                                        13
induced (a sort of ratchet effect). This is, once an inefficiency or rigidity is introduced
into the labor market through the law, there is little or no possibility of going back and
renegotiating it, even if the firm faces the threat of bankruptcy. One example of this
ratchet effect is the legal prohibition to reduce any wage or non-wage benefits. Thus,
while gradual increments in wages and other non-wage benefits over any pair of
consecutive years may not be binding for any particular firm or industry, the average
differences between an extended period may become burdensome and may be impossible
to revert.


Another important aspect of labor legislation is how it interacts with other laws and
regulations, and particularly with the bankruptcy law (Ley de Concursos Mercantiles).
Since past due wages, severance payments and seniority premiums are usually some of
the biggest components of a firm’s contingent liabilities, and labor has the highest
priority claims in case of bankruptcy (LFT, Article 113), the current labor legislation may
prevent inefficient firms from shutting down or may unnecessarily delay an inevitable
bankruptcy procedure. As stressed by the literature on labor reallocation, these
regulations may become an important barrier to the efficient entry and exit of firms,
which is one of the main sources of productivity growth in the economy.


Another important institutional detail of the Mexican economy is the widespread use and
incidence of minimum wages. In addition to being a minimum wage in the traditional
sense (with which firms may or may not comply), many contracts use the minimum wage
and minimum wage increases as an index. Many union contracts explicitly use the
minimum wage as an indexing device for wages and many firms and workers implicitly
use the minimum wage in their bargaining. In this sense, the minimum wage in Mexico is
really more than a minimum wage: it is a benchmark commonly used to index contracts.


In summary, the current labor legislation and regulations in Mexico and the benefits they
mandate makes it costly for firms to hire and fire employees and to modify the working
conditions. Furthermore, these regulations introduce a high degree of uncertainty for
potential firms or employers when making entry and hiring decisions. One of the results



                                                                                        14
of these rigidities is that they prevent or limit firm from rapidly adjusting their factor
demands to new economic shocks. As stressed above, the efficient reallocation of
productive factors across firms and industries is one of the main sources of productivity
growth in the economy.

5. Simple Statistics


We begin by presenting some simple statistics from our data. For each quarter in the
years 1986- 2001 we restrict the sample to those workers who were employed in the same
firm four quarters (one year) earlier. For these workers, we calculated the percent with
exactly the same nominal salary they had four quarters earlier. We present a chart with
these results below.

                                                                                                                  Quarter-Year


There are at least two striking features of this chart. One is that there are three quarters
that look dramatically different from the rest. Specifically, the percent of workers with
exactly the same nominal salary as four quarters earlier was extremely high in the fourth
quarters of 1992, 1997, and 1999. While one might be tempted to dismiss these
observations as measurement error, the explanation is quite simple and confirms the


                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      15
accuracy of the wage data. A new minimum wage was implemented on November 11,
1991 and was not changed until January 1, 1993. Therefore, when we compare a
worker’s wage on December 31, 1992 to the worker’s salary on December 31, 1991, we
know that the minimum wage had not changed during this period. We can explain the
apparent anomalies in the fourth quarters of 1997 and 1999 similarly. This feature is the
result of the high fraction of workers earning the minimum wage, as well as of the fact
that many firms use the minimum wage as a reference when taking wage increase
decisions. We will address this point later in this section.


The second noteworthy feature of the above graph is that the percent of workers with no
change in the nominal salary after four quarters was increasing until about 1995 and has
been decreasing since. We now contrast these trends with the trends of the percent of
workers with nominal wage increases and with nominal wage decreases. We present
these graphs below.

We focus particularly on the trends since 1995. Note that the percent of workers
receiving nominal-wage decreases has been increasing since 1995, as is the percent of
workers receiving nominal-wage increases. One might interpret these trends as evidence
that nominal wage rigidities have become less pronounced in recent years.


Given that the data on wages are capped above and below, we next depict the fractions of
workers with an increase, a decrease and no change in their nominal wage since the
previous year in a single graph. The first one excludes those workers whose wage is more
than 9 times the minimum wage (Figure 4). Recall that the wage cap was 10 times the
minimum wage prior to 1995 and was subsequently raised to 25 times the minimum
wage. The second graph excludes both those workers earning less than 2 times the
minimum wage and those workers whose wage is capped above (Figure 5).

As can be seen, the exclusion of those workers whose wages are capped above makes no
difference in terms of the behavior over time of the different fractions. In contrast,
excluding those workers whose wage is capped below at the minimum wage clearly
eliminates the spikes during the last quarters of 1992, 1997 and 1999. Nevertheless, the
trends before and after 1995 in the fractions of workers who experience a nominal wage
decrease or a nominal wage increase are still clearly visible, while the increase in the
fraction of workers experiencing a nominal wage decrease is more evident now. Thus, as
will be argued below, the results of this paper are not affected by the inclusion or
exclusion of workers whose wages are capped.


We now turn to looking at some kernel-density estimates of the probability density
function of changes in the log wage (see Appendix A for the kernel densitiy estimates of
each quarter). We present below a graph with a kernel density of the changes in the log
wages between the third quarter (actually September 30) of 1999 and the fourth quarter of
2000.

One vertical line signals where a nominal change of zero is located on the horizontal axis.
There definitely appears to be a spike in the density at this point. The other vertical line
signals that the change in the log of the minimum wage from September 30, 1999 to
September 30, 2000 was 0.0959. It seems clear that the density has a larger spike at this
point. The densities of the changes in log wages for all quarters have this same feature.


The simplest explanation many log-wage changes being exactly the change in the log of
the minimum wage turns out to be the correct one—a substantial number of workers in
the IMSS data earn exactly the minimum wage. If we look at other periods, however, this
simple explanation is not complete. Below we present a kernel-density estimate of the
distribution of log-wage changes from September 30, 1986 to September 30, 1987. We
eliminate, however, all workers who earned less then two times the minimum wage in
1986. We also eliminated those who earned more than nine times the minimum wage.5

    In this period, wages were top coded at ten times the minimum wage.


                                                                                            20
The above figure is representative of the results we observe in the late 1980s. We find
substantial evidence that wage changes are indexed to changes in the minimum wage,
even for those earning substantially more than the minimum wage.6 That is, the largest
spike in the distribution of log wages is exactly the change in the log of the minimum
wage. This effect has been called the “lighthouse effect” in earlier work. For the rest of
the paper, however, we will focus on the distribution log wage changes for all wage
earners. That is, we will treat wage rigidities that arise from workers earning the
minimum wage as a phenomenon to be estimated and studied.


We conclude with one more kernel density estimate. It might be interesting to look at one
of the three periods when the same minimum wage applied in both periods. Below we
present the kernel density estimate of changes in the log wage between December 31,
1998 and December 31, 1999.

In this case, the density looks smooth throughout with the exception of one large spike at
zero. Thus, this spike in the density encompasses three phenomena: nominal-wage
changes of zero are common, the high fraction of minimum-wage earners and the fact
that nominal-wage changes proportional to the change in the minimum wage are common
too. We interpret the above estimates as evidence of the indexation or lighthouse effect of
minimum wages in the Mexican labor market.



6. Tests of DNWR

We now turn to some of the formal tests of Downward Nominal Wage Rigidity (DNWR)
that have been proposed in the literature.

The Kahn Test (kahn)

This test, proposed by Kahn (1997), consists of two parameters that are estimated through
a system of r seemingly unrelated equations (SURE). Each equation uses the fraction of
wage changes located at the region between r and r-1 percentage points below the median
as a dependent variable (proptr). A constant (pr) and a set of dummy variables indicating
the histogram bar’s position at (dzerotr) or below zero (dnegtr) are the equation’s
explanatory variables. The parameter n measures the proportion in which the bars
containing negative wage changes are cut due to DNWR (if n=0 there is no DNWR and if
it n<0 there is DNWR) and z measures the proportion in which the bar containing zero
wage changes is increased due to long term contracts, menu costs, or other reasons for
accumulating observations there (z>0). The size of r depends on the range where the rth
bars are more likely to lie above or below zero across time because this raises the test’s
power. Trials for r=15, 20 and 25 suggested that r=15 provides the soundest estimates.
Thus, the form of the SURE is:

The Augmented Kahn Test (aug. kahn)

An augmented version of the Kahn test further distinguishes observations located at the
bars within -1, 0 and 1 percentage points, adding robustness to noise around zero to the
parameters (provided that there is enough variation in the dummy variables). This
modifies the original test as follows:

where the dneg1tr indicates that the rth histogram bar is located at -1 percent and dpos1tr
that the rth histogram bar is located at +1 percent. The new parameters are the fraction of
observations included in the bar that contains zero (θ), in the bar that contains -1 percent
(δ), and in the bar containing +1 percent (1-θ-δ). Notice that when θ=1 and δ=0 this
system collapses to the previous one.

A Kahn Test that considers the effect of the minimum wage

As mentioned before, the distributions of annual nominal wage changes constructed with
the IMSS data display another noticeable accumulation point. This point corresponds to
the increase of the nominal minimum wage. A simple first approximation to analyze this
pattern consists on adding to the simple Kahn test a couple of parameters that measure
the proportion in which the bars containing wage changes that are lower than the
minimum wage change are reduced ( n̂ ) and the proportion in which the bar containing
the minimum wage change is increased due to indexation ( ẑ ). The first of them is
associated to a dummy variable indicating the histogram bar’s position below the
minimum wage (dmwlowtr), while the second one to a dummy variable indicating the
histogram bar’s position at the minimum wage change (dmwtr). As a result, the SURE
becomes:

A menu cost interpretation suggests that the parameter ẑ of this test should have a positive
sign, as the original z has. But what sign should n̂ have is less obvious.

An augmented version of this test that distinguishes noise around the zero and the
minimum wage change can be estimated through the addition to the system of the dummy
variables dneg1tr , dpos1tr , dmwlow1tr , and dmwhigh1tr . The last two dummies indicate

histogram bars located at -1 percent and +1 percent from the minimum wage change,
respectively. The new SURE is:

On the other hand, we observed that during the periods of high inflation in 1986-1988
and 1995-1997 the bar of the zero wage change was more than 15 percentage points
below the median wage change. In addition, several times during those episodes the
nominal minimum wage increased at an annual rate higher than 15 percent. So in order
that the model could capture both considerations and still preserve sufficient variation in
the explanatory variables, instead of just including more 1 percent bars below the median
into the sure, we made a twofold modification. We changed the reference point of the test
from the 50th percentile to the 75th percentile and increased the size of the bars from 1 to
4 percentage points.


7. Results


The results of various specifications are presented below. We begin with two tables, both
of which use data from the entire period 1986:1 – 2001:4. The first table uses the median
of the wage-change distribution as the reference point with histogram-bar widths of one
percent. The second table uses the 75th percentile of the wage-change distribution as the
reference point with histogram-bar widths of 4 percent




            All wage earners bar size 1% and reference point = 50% percentile, 1986:1-2001:4

Qualitatively the results were similar across specifications. Histogram bars that
encompass changes in the log wage of either zero or the change in the log of the
minimum wage are both estimated to be higher than they would in the absence of menu
costs or long term contracting. (This can be seen from the two “z” parameters).
Histogram bars that encompass reductions in the nominal wage are estimated to be
smaller as a result of nominal-wage rigidities. This result is consistent with studies from
other countries. It is in this sense that we do find evidence of downward nominal-wage
rigidities.


Histogram bars are estimated to be larger when they encompass changes in the log wage
that are lower than the increase in log of the minimum wage (but above zero). One
possible explanation is that workers who had been earning slightly more than the
minimum wage receiving salary increases sufficient to reach the new minimum wage.


There is ample reason to suspect that wage rigidities might be waning over time. The
early years of the sample were characterized by high inflation, making wage indexation a
more pressing concern for workers. Furthermore, the fact that the economy was



                                                                                                27
substantially less open to trade in the early years might lead one to suspect that the wage
distribution would be less flexible. To address this point, we present tables where we
divide our sample into two sub periods: 1986:1-1993:4 and to 1994:1-2001:4. We present
these results below, using both the median and the 75th percentile as reference points.

When we break the sample period 1986:1-2001:4 into two sub-samples corresponding to
1986:1-1993:4 and to 1994:1-2001:4, we indeed find evidence that nominal-wage
rigidities have become less important over time, as have the effects of minimum wages.
We do not find evidence that “bunching” of log-wage changes has diminished (the z
parameters do not appear weaker to be less important in the later period). We do find,
however, that the positive effects on histogram bars encompassing positive changes in the


                                                                                                29
log wage less than the change in the log minimum wage have attenuated over time. We
also find that the negative effects on histogram bars encompassing reductions in the
nominal wage have attenuated over time. It is in this sense that the distribution of changes
of log wages appears to be more flexible in more recent years. Changes in log wages
appear to be less affected both by minimum wages and by nominal-wage rigidities.


Reductions of the magnitudes of the “n” parameters after 1994 accord well with the fact
that indexation was more prevalent during the years of the inflation stabilization plans
than afterwards.7 Substantial wage indexation as part of stabilization plans has been
reported for other Latin American economies like Chile (Cortázar, 1997), Argentina
(Pessino, 1997), and Brazil (Devereaux, 1994).8 Less flexibility downwards in the former
period than in the latter is reflected in less negative values for the corresponding n
parameters. However, even with more liberalized trade, in the absence of any labor law
changes to promote market flexibility this pattern presents a puzzle for future research.


8. Conclusions


We studied the distributions of changes in the log of wages for tax-registered employees
in the private sector in Mexico. In particular, we focused on employees who do not
change firms from one year to the next. We found it common that the nominal wage does
not change from one year to the next. We also found it common that a change in the log
wage is equal to the change in the log of the minimum wage. This latter finding is driven

7
  Aspe (1993) describes that in Mexico one of the main objectives of stabilization plan adopted during the
late eighties and early nineties was to correct wage momentum. Agreements with the workers focused on
moving away from short-term contracts with complete ex-post indexation toward longer contracts defined
in terms of expected inflation (ex ante indexation). To this end, in December 1987 there was an immediate
minimum wage rise of 15 percent during December of 1987 and a 20 percent rise in January 1988,
followed by a monthly review according to anticipated inflation. The period for the review shifted from a
monthly to a yearly basis within a few months.
8
  For instance, Cortázar (1997) reports that in Chile, during the period of 1973-79, the military government
replaced decentralized negotiations between entrepreneurs and workers with a policy of wage
readjustments determined by government authorities. The rate of variation of nominal wages (around their
medium-term trend) throughout those years was basically an exogenous variable determined by the central
authorities. Equations estimated to test the hypothesis that the percentage of growth of nominal wages can
be expressed as a fraction of the percentage wage readjustment decreed by the government during this
period yields coefficient for this variable higher than 90 percent.


                                                                                                        30
both by employees earning exactly the minimum wage as well as by the fact that wage
contracts for those earning more than the minimum wage use the minimum wage as an
index. We further estimate that wage changes are bunched in the region between the two
benchmarks (zero and the increase in the log minimum wage), while reductions in the
nominal salary are rare.

                    The following figures depict the kernel density estimates of the probability density
                    functions of the change in the log nominal age for each quarter between March 31, 1986,
                    and December 31, 2001. As before, the first vertical line signals where the nominal
                    change of zero is located on the horizontal axis while the second vertical line signals the
                    change in the log of the minimum wage from each quarter. Several features are apparent
                    from these graphs. First, as mentioned above, in almost every case there are two large
                    spikes in the density function, one at the zero change in the nominal wage and another
                    one at the minimum wage change. The only three exceptions are the densities
                    corresponding to December 31, 1992, December 31, 1997, and December 31, 1999. In
                    these cases there is a large spike at the point corresponding to zero change in the nominal
                    wage, but not to the point corresponding to the minimum wage increase. As explained
                    above, these dates correspond to periods the where the same minimum wage from the
                    year before was in effect. Another interesting feature of these graphs is that there are
                    always observations to the left of the zero change in nominal wages, which implies that
                    some of the workers are experiencing nominal wage decreases. Finally, it is interesting to
                    observe the evolution of these densities over time, and how the distance between the zero
                    and the minimum nominal wage increases grew closer up to the first quarter of 1995, then
                    widened up until the fourth quarter of 1998 and has shrunk since then.
