Abstract:
This paper discusses recent advances in our understanding of differences in human abilities and
skills, their sources, and their evolution over the lifecycle.


Keywords: skills, abilities, lifecycle, skill gaps, remediation policies


        The study of human skill formation is no longer handicapped by the taboo that once made
it impermissible to talk about differences among people. It is now well documented that people
are very diverse on a large array of abilities, that these abilities account for a substantial amount
of the variation found among people in terms of their socioeconomic success, and that gaps
among children from various socioeconomic groups open up at early ages, and, if anything,
widen as children become adults. The family plays a powerful role in shaping these abilities.
From a variety of intervention studies, we know that these gaps can be partially remedied if the
remediation is attempted at early enough ages. The remediation efforts that appear to be most
effective are those that supplement family resources for young children from disadvantaged
environments. Since the family is the fundamental source of human inequality, programs that
target young children from disadvantaged families have the greatest economic and social returns.
I make this case through a series of arguments, bolstered by graphs and tables extracted from
Heckman and Masterov (2004), Cunha and Heckman (2003) and Carneiro and Heckman (2003).


        First, abilities matter. A large number of empirical studies document that cognitive
ability affects both the likelihood of acquiring advanced training and higher education, but also
the economic returns to those activities. Abilities also matter in determining participation in
crime, teenage pregnancy, drug use and participation in other deviant activities. Education has an


                                                   1
independent causal effect on participation in crime, the likelihood of producing an out of
wedlock birth, drug use and the like apart from its role as a conduit of ability. The evidence that
cognitive ability matters tells us nothing whatsoever about whether it is genetically determined.
The frenzy generated by Herrnstein and Murray's book The Bell Curve, because of its claims
about genetic determinism, obscured its real message which is that cognitive ability is an
important predictor of socioeconomic success.


       Second, abilities are multiple in nature. IQ has to be distinguished from what is measured
by achievement tests, although it partly determines success on achievement tests. Achievement
tests in turn have an independent effect on socioeconomic success apart from the effect of IQ,
which is strongly correlated with success on achievement tests. Noncognitive skills
(perseverance, motivation, self-control and the like) have direct effects on wages (controlling for
schooling), schooling, teenage pregnancy, smoking, crime and achievement tests. Both cognitive
and noncognitive skills affect socioeconomic success. Both are strongly influenced by family
environments.


       Third, ability gaps between individuals and across socioeconomic groups open up at
early ages, for both cognitive and noncognitive skills. They are strongly correlated with family
background factors like parental education and maternal ability, which, when controlled for in a
statistical sense, largely eliminate these gaps (see Figures 1A-B and Figures 2A-B). Inputs of
schooling quality and resources have relatively small effects on ability deficits but only
marginally account for some of the divergence evident in Figure 1A (see De Los Santos,
Heckman and Larenas, 2004). Parenting practices have strong effects on emotional development
and motivation.


       Fourth, it is possible to partially compensate for adverse family environments. Evidence
from randomized trials conducted on intervention programs targeted at disadvantaged children
who are followed into adulthood suggests that it is possible to eliminate some of the gaps evident
in Figures 1a and 2a. Enriched early interventions at the youngest ages raise IQ. The
Abecedarian program provided an enriched intervention for disadvantaged children starting at
age 4 months. The children who received the intervention score consistently higher than the



                                                2
children who do not, even long after the treatment is discontinued (see Figure 3). If we wait to
intervene until age 4 or later, no lasting effects on IQ have been found (see Figure 4 for the Perry
Preschool data). However, effects on motivation and, hence, achievement test scores are found.
Children are less likely to commit crime and have out of wedlock births and are more likely to
participate in regular schooling. Early interventions have a substantial effect on adult
performance (see Figures 5-7) and have a high economic return (see Table 1).


       Fifth, different types of abilities appear to be manipulable at different ages. Thus, while
factors affecting IQ deficits need to be addressed at very early ages for interventions to be
effective, there is evidence that later interventions in the adolescent years can affect noncognitive
skills (see Tables 2 and 3 for evidence on this point). This evidence appears to be rooted in the
neuroscience that establishes the malleability of the prefrontal cortex into the early 20s. This is
the region of the brain that governs emotion and self-regulation.


       Sixth, the later the remediation, the less effective it is. The study by O’Connor, et al.
(2000) of adopted Romanian infants documents this for very early interventions (see Figure 8).
The later the Romanian orphan is rescued from the social and emotional isolation of the
orphanage and placed in an adoptive environment, the lower is his or her cognitive performance
at age 6. Moreover, classroom remediation programs designed to combat early cognitive deficits
have a poor track record. Public job training programs and adult literacy and educational
programs, like the GED, that attempt to remediate years of educational and emotional neglect
among disadvantaged individuals have a low economic return, and for young males, the return is
negative.


       Figure 9 summarizes the findings of an entire literature. The economic returns to the
marginal investment at early ages are high. The economic return to investment at older ages is
lower. The technology of skill formation derived from economic theory and estimated on
longitudinal data suggests a strong self-productivity of investment. Investment at an early age
produces a high return through this self-productivity. Complementarity (synergy) of investment
reinforces self-productivity. Early investment in cognitive and noncognitive skills lowers the cost
of later investment by making learning at later ages more efficient. Notice in Figures 5, 6a and 7c



                                                 3
that those who receive early interventions are less likely to repeat grades or require special
education programs while in school. This complementarity highlights the value of early
investment. It also demonstrates that there is no trade-off between equity (targeting programs at
disadvantaged families) and efficiency (getting the highest economic returns), provided that the
investments are made at early ages. There is such a trade-off at later ages.


       The empirically established complementarity also suggests that early investments must be
followed up by later investments to be effective. Nothing in the new economics of human skill
formation suggests that we should starve later educational and skill enhancement efforts. The
main finding from the recent literature is that we should prioritize, and shift our priorities, in a
marginal fashion by redirecting a given total sum of expenditure on skill investment to earlier
ages relative to how it is currently allocated.


       The costs of delay implied by the evidence on self-productivity and complementarity are
dramatically illustrated by Figure 10 from Cunha and Heckman (2003, 2004). Using data from
the U.S., they establish that, for children from very poor backgrounds, a strategy of late
remediation is economically inefficient. Late remediation, no matter how extensive, cannot
restore children from disadvantaged environments to the level of performance they would have
attained had they received economically efficient early interventions that compensate for
disadvantage in the early years.


       Nothing in the recent literature says that investments should not be made in older
persons. The phenomenon of neurogenesis informs us that learning can continue into advanced
ages. What is missing from that literature is a discussion of the relative costs and returns to
investments in older persons compared to younger persons. What we do know is that investments
in more able workers at any age generate higher returns than investments in younger workers,
and ability is formed at early ages.

                         Let y denote parental earnings. Let x*, z* denote the early and late investments in a complete
                         markets economy. Let x(y), z(y) denote the early and late investments in the Aiyagari/Laitner
                         economy for agents with zero bequests. This economy restricts the ability of families to borrow
                         freely. The early and late remediation are values ∆x(y) and ∆z(y) where ∆x(y) = x*- x(y) and
                         ∆z(y) = z* - z(y). The cost of the early remediation is C1 = ∆x(y) + ∆z(y)/(1+r), where r is the
                         steady state equilibrium interest rate of the Aiyagari/Laitner economy. Let h* denote the steady
                         state stock of human capital in the complete markets economy. The late remediation is the value
                         δ that solves g(δ) = h* - (γx(y)φ + (1-γ)δφ )ρ/φ, where the second term is the production function
                         for human capital (φ is the subsitution parameter, 1/(1 - φ) is the elasticity of substitution, and ρ
                         is the scale parameter as estimated in Cunha and Heckman (2003, 2004). The cost of late
                         remediation is C2 = δ/(1+r)
