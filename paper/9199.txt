Integration of Unemployment Insurance with Retirement Insurance
Joseph Stiglitz and Jungyoll Yun
NBER Working Paper No. 9199
September 2002


                                       ABSTRACT

       This paper analyzes a social insurance system that integrates unemployment
insurance with a pension program through an individual account, allowing workers
to borrow against their future wage income to finance consumption during an
unemployment episode and thus improving their search incentives while reducing
risks. This paper identifies factors which determine the optimal degree of
integration. A fully integrated system is one in which no reliance is placed at all
on a separate tax-funded unemployment insurance program. We show that when
the duration of unemployment is very short compared to the period of employment
or retirement, the optimal system involves an exclusive reliance on pension-funded
self-insurance. This system imposes a negligible risk burden for workers while
avoiding attenuating search incentives. We also argue that a joint integration of
several social insurance programs with a pension program through an individual
account is desirable unless the risks are perfectly correlated to each other.

I. Introduction



 The East Asian crisis brought home to much of the developing world a lesson that the

Great Depression brought home to more advanced countries seventy years ago—the

importance of a safety net. But as countries like Korea go about constructing their safety

nets, they are cognizant of the complaints that have been raised against unemployment

insurance systems: they attenuate incentives. To be sure, there are adverse incentive

effects (or, as they are today generally referred to, moral hazard effects) in all insurance

programs. What worries critics is that the risk reduction benefits might, on the face of it,

be outweighed by the adverse incentive effects. For most individuals, a typical spell of

unemployment is less than six months (and that spell would presumably be shorter,

possibly much shorter in the absence of unemployment insurance.) Over a working time

of, say, forty-five years, an individual with three such spells would lose perhaps 4% of

his lifetime income—a risk which presumably the individual could easily absorb if he

had sufficient savings or could borrow against future earnings. With the bulk of savings

used for retirement, and mostly dedicated to social security programs, the amount

individuals have to buffer themselves against these income shocks is limited; and well

documented limitations in capital markets make it difficult for individuals to borrow

much against future earnings. Thus compulsory old age public pension programs, while

they help resolve one problem—the tendency of individuals not to save enough for their

old age, because of the proclivity of public “bail-outs”—exacerbate another.

  This naturally leads to the suggestion of an integrated unemployment and pension

program, which we will call the integrated unemployment insurance (UI) system. Such




                                                                                               1
                                                                                                2


integration makes particular sense with individual accounts, which are increasingly

forming the basis of even public pension programs.1 In such programs, benefits are

related to contributions by simple formulae; in the simplest form, there is no

redistribution. Such programs are like defined contribution pension programs, though

some of the contributions can be used to “purchase” insurance (e.g. against inflation or

interest rate fluctuations) which is not available on the market. But it is easy to impose

redistributions on top. For simplicity, in this paper, we will ignore the redistributive

components.2

 Under the integrated UI system through an individual account, an individual who is

unemployed can have his unemployment payments taken out of his individual account.

Thus, the individual obtains the liquidity to maintain his standard of living; the

compulsory and universal nature of the contributions provide, in effect, perfect collateral,

so that early on in his life, his account balance could become negative. The fact that

normally the risk is small means that the individual can bear this risk—when it is spread

out over his entire life; and since the individual bears the risk, there is no attenuation of

job search incentives.

 If, however, the loss from unemployment is large enough, it is optimal to have some

true unemployment insurance—the individual should not bear the cost even over his

lifetime. In general, individuals should not rely exclusively on the pension-funded self-

insurance under the integrated UI system. In this paper we take this ‘lifetime’

unemployment insurance to be tax-funded, but the results would be identical with a

mandatory private insurance program with competitively determined premia.3 Taking this

into account, we characterize in this paper the optimal benefit structure of the integrated




                                                                                                2
                                                                                             3


UI system, that is, the optimal combination of the two types of benefits—tax-funded and

pension-funded. The lower the risk-aversion, or the greater the elasticity of search with

respect to the insurance benefit, the less reliance should be placed on tax-funded

insurance as opposed to (what might be viewed as implicit) pension-funded self-

insurance. In an extreme case, if a worker is risk-neutral, then there should be no need for

tax-funded unemployment insurance, and if there is no incentive problem associated with

unemployment insurance, there is no need to rely on pension-funded self-insurance. Not

surprisingly, the larger the risk, which in turn is related to the length of the period of

unemployment relative to the working period, the greater the need for tax-funded

insurance. In the limit, if the period of unemployment is vanishingly minute, then the

individual can bear all the risk through pension-funded self-insurance with no welfare

loss.

   Unemployment is, of course, only one of many risks that individuals face. There are,

for instance, the risks of disability and health, as well as unemployment. The idea of

integration can be applied to each of these risks, leading us to consider what we call an

integrated lifetime insurance program. Under the integrated lifetime insurance pension

savings can be used to provide cover for these risks. The Provident Funds of Malaysia

and Singapore provide prototypes of such an integrated program. The problem is that

while the loss from any one of these risks may be small, there is some chance the

individual may experience all of these losses. In that case, the funds available to an

individual at the time of retirement may be reduced to an unacceptably low level .If the

government has to provide lifetime insurance to cover such contingencies—in effect,

bailing out the individual account because it would provide an unacceptably low level of




                                                                                             3
                                                                                              4


pension, the borrowing by an individual to smooth consumption to cover any one of these

risks would have an adverse disincentive effect much as the tax-funded benefit does.

These considerations might appear to diminish the relevance of joint integration.

  We argue in this paper, however, that so long as the risks are not perfectly correlated

then it always pays to integrate all the social insurance programs with the pension

program rather than to have separate insurance programs covering each risk. The key

point is that the integrated lifetime insurance system allows a given amount of pension

savings of an individual to be used for the benefits under all the risks. This benefit of

joint integration—having a common pool from which to draw upon—gets larger as the

correlation gets smaller.

   In the next section we present a basic model for an integrated UI system to

characterize its optimal benefit structure and to show how it varies with the relative size

of unemployment risk and other parameters. Section 3 provides an informal presentation

for an integrated lifetime insurance system to argue for its optimality. Some concluding

remarks are given in Section 4.




II. The Model

 Consider an infinitely-lived worker who spends (M+2) periods working and retires for

the remaining N periods, as depicted in Figure 0. In period 2 a worker becomes

unemployed with probability q. The length of unemployment depends upon his search

decision. In this paper we assume that a worker can choose either ‘no search’ or ‘search’.

If he searches, he gets reemployed immediately after the unemployment shock. If he does




                                                                                              4
                                                                                           5


not search, he remains unemployed for one period. Thus, depending upon his search

decision, a worker with an unemployment shock can either be employed or unemployed

in period 2. The cost of search e is a random variable, which is distributed with

distribution function F(e). There is a threshold search cost e′, such that he chooses to

search (or not to search) if e < (or >) e′. Thus the probability of being unemployed in

period 2 is q(1-F(e′)).

 Suppose there is a public pension program,4 to which an individual worker is mandated

to contribute a certain portion of his income. Although it does not matter whether the

pension program is of a defined-contribution or of a defined-benefit type, here we will

assume for simplicity that an individual’s pension is determined simply by his

contributions. In addition to mandatory savings, an individual may also have voluntary

private savings for retirement or to cover the risk of unemployment in the future.

 Under the integrated UI system, the unemployment benefit comes from two sources:

from a formal unemployment program, funded by an unemployment insurance tax, and

from the past and prospective mandated pension savings. If the period of unemployment

is small enough and/or the mandated level of savings is high enough, and if the individual

is allowed to borrow as much as he wants from his individual account, there would be no

additional precautionary savings to cover the risk of unemployment. . In other words, an

individual would save just for retirement.

  The main objective of the integrated UI system is to provide efficient consumption

smoothing and lifetime risk absorption, while minimizing the adverse search incentives.

We approach the problem in several stages. We first pretend the government could

control perfectly consumption at every date in every state and circumstance (that is,



                                                                                           5
                                                                                                                                 6


whether the individual does or does not face an unemployment shock) as well as search

(which will presumably depend on the cost of search e) to characterize the first-best

optimum. We then analyze the constrained optimum, where the government cannot

directly control whether individuals search the government knows however, that their

search decisions will depend on the benefits provided. We next characterize a set of

unemployment insurance tax and benefits as well as mandated savings and retirement

benefits the government needs to achieve this constrained optimum, examining, in

particular the factors that determine the optimal degree of integration. In doing this we

will assume for the expositional simplicity that there is no discounting for money and

utility. This will enable us to identify more clearly the welfare gains associated with the

integrated UI system.

   Let C1 be the consumption in period 1 for an individual. From period 2 on, there are

two different work-states possible for an individual: ‘unemployed in period 2’ (U) and

‘employed in period 2’ (N). A worker with one work-state chooses his consumption

pattern over time differently from the one with the other work-state.

  Let C n ,t , C u ,t (for t >1) be the amount of consumption at time t for an individual with

work-state N, U, respectively. Then, assuming that consumption C and search effort e

are separable in the utility function, we can represent his expected utility as follows:



                                                                 M + N +2                                  M + N +2

where {C1 , C n ,t , C u ,t }t satisfies the following constraint:



                            M + N +2                     M + N +2
C1 + (1 − q(1 − F (e' ))      ∑ C n,t + q(1 − F (e' ))
                              t =2

                                                                    u ,t   = ( M + 2 − q(1 − F (e' )) w.   (2)




The above constraint indicates that the sum of the expected consumption over a lifetime

should be equal to the expected lifetime wage income earned. This can also be

interpreted as an aggregate constraint based upon the law of large numbers.



  First Best Solution

  Maximizing the expected utility function V subject to the above constraint, with

respect to consumption at each date and in work state {C1 , Cˆ n ,t , Cˆ u ,t } and with respect to

the threshold search cost ê , we have



   Cˆ 1 = Cˆ n ,t = Cˆ u ,t = Cˆ ,



              M + 2 − qˆ
          =              w                                            (FB-1)
              M +2+ N



for all t (>1)—there is complete consumption smoothing - and



                         eˆ = U ' (Cˆ ) w ,                                       (FB-2)



                                                                                                                 7
                                                                                            8




where qˆ ≡ q(1 − F (eˆ)) . In our model, search always yields a job, which generates a wage

of w and a marginal utility of U’w; it pays to search so long as the cost of search (in

utility terms) is less than the cost.

 The first-best expected utility Vˆ of an individual would then be



                                               e            ˆ
                  Vˆ = ( M + 2 + N )U (Cˆ ) − ∫ edF             (FB-3)
                                                           0




Second best optimum

  In fact, however, the government cannot directly control individual search behavior. If

the government guaranteed consumption irrespective of search, no individual would have

an incentive to search. The threshold search cost e′ chosen by an individual worker will

be the one that maximizes his expected utility V without taking into account its effect

upon the constraint (2). Thus, we have



              M + N +2                   M + N +2
       e' =    ∑t =2
                         U (C n ,t ) −    ∑U (C
                                           t =2
                                                    u ,t   ).    (3)




The optimal outcome that the government can achieve given its inability to control

individual search behavior, otherwise called the second-best optimum, can be

characterized by maximizing the expected utility V(.) subject to the constraint (2) and the

individual search behavior constraint (3). A detailed analysis of the second-best optimum

will be given later in this section, where the optimal benefit structure of the integrated UI



                                                                                            8
                                                                                                  9


system is characterized. But one can see that the additional constraint (3) implies that the

                                           *
second-best set of consumptions {C1 , C n*,t , C u*,t } and threshold search cost e * satisfies



              *
   C n*,t = C n ,
                  *
                                               (SB-1)
   C u*,t = C u



for all t = 2, --, M+N+2, and



       *       *
   C n > Cu

       *      *       *
   C n > C1 > C u                      (SB-2)



                            *          *
   e * = ( M + N + 1){U (C n ) − U (C u )} .                      (SB-3)



 The condition (SB-1) says that, from period 2 on, the consumption in each period should

be equal for each work-state N or U, which is also required for the first-best. The

condition (SB-2), however, states that per period consumption for those with work-state

U should be less than that for those with work-state N. This is due to the moral hazard

associated with a search incentive, and distinguishes the second-best from the first-best.




II.1. The Second-Best Savings, Borrowings and UI Benefits




                                                                                                  9
                                                                                                    10


 To identify a set of savings, borrowings and UI taxes and benefit that generates the

second-best consumption pattern for an individual, we will first figure out how those

variables determine the consumption level in each period for each state. In this model the

UI tax T is paid only in period 15, and the unemployment benefit B paid in period 2

consists of the benefit r funded by UI tax T and the benefit R funded by lifetime savings.

The benefit R is self-insurance for an unemployed worker, which can be financed either

by his pre-unemployment private savings or by borrowings from his future pension

savings. The distinction between these two is important in this paper, for reasons which

will be discussed later.

 The condition (SB-1) for consumption smoothing implies that the savings of an

individual with a given work-state should be the same for all periods, because in this

model a worker faces the same wage for each period while there is no discounting. Let

s1 , s u , and s n be the savings rate in period 1, the savings rate for those with work-state U

and N, respectively. Then, we have



  C1 = w(1 − s1 − T )
  C n ,t = w(1 − s n ),      t = 2,−−, M + 2
             ( M + 1) s n + s1

The valuation functions I(.) and J(.) measure the payoff as of period 2, depending on

whether the individual is or is not employed in period 2, respectively. For the purpose of

simplicity, we will hereafter normalize the wage at unity.

  Before characterizing the second-best optimum, we will briefly outline the underlying

intuitions. In determining the second-best savings, borrowings and UI benefit, the

consumption smoothing across periods or across work states is critical. The maximization

                                                                             *   *
problems (8) and (9) suggest that the optimal savings and borrowings {s n , su , R * } are to

be set solely based upon intertemporal consumption smoothing for those in a given work

state N or U. The optimal savings s1* in period 1 and the optimal UI benefit r* (and its tax

T*) are also affected by consumption smoothing across periods and across work states,

respectively. As for s1* and r*, however, another consideration may also apply. Although

an individual takes UI tax T as given in choosing his search strategy as implied by (6), T

depends upon the unemployment probability q , which is in turn affected by an

individual search decision. In determining s1* and r*, therefore, we have to take into

account their effects upon T. In other words, s1* and r* will be set to facilitate

consumption smoothing across periods and work states, taking incentive effects into

account. Differentiation of (6) with respect to r and s1 will provide us with the following

results about their effects upon individuals’ search decision:

                                                                                           12

The proof of the Lemma can be found in the Appendix. Lemma (i) shows that an

individual worker’s search decision is adversely affected by the tax-funded UI benefit r.

This is the source of well-known welfare cost associated with the UI system. Lemma (ii)

shows that the savings in period 1 would also negatively affect search effort decision,

because a worker with greater private savings would not take as serious the reduction in

his account balance. In other words, an individual search decision is negatively related to

one’s post-unemployment lifetime consumption. To the extent that savings in period 1 is

only a small portion of one’s post-unemployment lifetime consumption, therefore, its

effect on e′ would also be minimal. In particular, we will assume that q is so small

relative to M and N that



                                q
                                   ≈0.                                                 (A)
                              N +M



Under the assumption (A) the effect of s1 upon UI tax T would become negligible,

because, by Lemma (ii),



                       ∂T ∂e'
                               ≈ 0,
                       ∂e' ∂s1



        ∂T
where       = qf (e' )r1 by (7). Since the assumption (A) enables us to ignore the search
        ∂e'

incentive effect of s1 in determining its optimal value, the optimal savings s1* in period 1

will be determined only by consumption smoothing across periods in the model.6

  Proposition 1 suggests that the second-best savings, borrowings and UI benefit can be

characterized as a function of exogenous parameters, H , δ , M , N , q . Here δ represents

an Arrow-Pratt measure of absolute risk aversion and H indicates search elasticity or the

sensitiveness of reemployment probability to the increase in threshold search cost e' .7

in period 1 is determined as a retirement savings based on intertemporal consumption

smoothing for given r*, not as a precautionary savings against unemployment risk.

Without the government provision of pension-funded borrowing, however, the savings s1

in period 1 would also have to serve as a precautionary savings against unemployment

shock. This is the case for the conventional UI system, which will be discussed later. By

(ii) and (iii) the optimal savings after period 1 are also to be determined solely by

intertemporal consumption smoothing for given UI benefit r*.

 As for the second-best self-insurance R* (using pension savings), it is also determined

by intertemporal consumption smoothing as shown in (iv). Although the government

provides an unemployed worker with tax-funded benefit r*, it may be short of his optimal

consumption level, due to the concern about search incentives. Given the limitation of the

tax-funded benefit r* , an unemployed worker may rely on a certain amount R* of

pension-funded self-insurance that supplements r*.8

 On the other hand, the optimal UI benefit is set by (v) to balance consumption

smoothing between the two work states N and U,.,(which represents the provision of

insurance) with the concern about incentives. The first term δX * of (v) reflects the

marginal insurance benefit provided by r, while the second term U ' (a)) Hr * represents its

marginal incentive cost.

 Note that the marginal insurance benefit of r is positively related to X , the amount of

consumption reduction per period due to unemployment. This implies that the risk

burden that an individual has to bear due to the limitation of r depends upon the amount

of consumption reduction per period, not upon the total consumption reduction. The

amount of total (lifetime) consumption reduction due to unemployment is (1-r). If an



                                                                                            15
                                                                                              16


unemployed individual would not be able to borrow, therefore, the risk burden of

unemployment he has to bear would be positively related to (1-r). Under the integrated

UI system in which an individual can borrow, however, he can spread out the reduction

in lifetime income over the working and retirement period. This reduces the risk burden

associated with the incomplete provision of insurance against unemployment . This is

how integrated UI system improves the trade-off between insurance and incentive,

thereby enhancing welfare.

  Taking into account the fact that the optimal self-insurance R* and tax-funded UI

benefit r* are partial substitutes for each other(by (iv) of Proposition 1), the relatively

small marginal insurance benefit of r under the integrated UI suggests a smaller tax-

funded UI benefit under the integrated system. Some of the tax-funded UI benefit is

replaced by self-insurance . A complete set of comparative statics about the mix of self-

insurance and tax-financed insurance is presented in the following Proposition.

 The proof of Proposition 2 is included in the Appendix. As the search elasticity

(indicated by H) increases, the potential incentive cost of unemployment insurance grows,

making it more desirable to rely on pension funded self-insurance; but the fact that

insurance is more distortionary means that, in addition, the total unemployment benefit

(tax funded plus pension funded self-insurance) decreases. Greater risk-aversion of a

worker (a higher δ) implies a greater need for insurance against the risk of

unemployment, as well as greater reliance on tax-financed benefits more than pension-

funded self-insurance.

 Consider some extreme cases. When a worker is risk-neutral, i.e., when δ = 0, r * = 0 :

there is no need for unemployment insurance. Note from Proposition 1 (iii) that

             *
R * = 1 − su in this case, which implies that the pension-funded self-insurance R takes

care of all the necessary consumption smoothing for those with the work-state U.

Reliance on pension-funded self-insurance is also desirable when the reemployment

probability of a worker is very sensitive to his search effort, i.e., when H is very large.

  On the other hand, if a worker is very risk-averse ( δ is very large) or if his

reemployment probability is constant irrespective of his search effort ( H = 0), no

pension-funded self-insurance will be necessary. In this case, r * = 1 by Proposition 1 (v),

implying that after receiving the tax-funded benefit, which provides complete insurance

so that it is equal to the wage the individual would have received had he been employed9,

an unemployed worker saves some of the benefit so as to smooth out his consumption

over time.

  More importantly, Proposition 2 (iii) shows how the optimal benefit package for the

unemployed changes with the length of working and retirement periods. The increase in



                                                                                              17
                                                                                           18


M and N with a kept constant indicates that the unemployment duration gets shorter

relative to the length of working life. Under this circumstance the optimal benefit

package for the unemployed entails a larger amount of pension-funded borrowing and a

smaller amount of tax-funded benefit. The reason for this result is that the risk associated

with unemployment viewed from a life-time perspective gets smaller, so that when it can

be effectively smoothed as under the integrated UI system, the risk burden becomes

negligible. That is, a worker who borrows from his pension can ease the burden of

reduction in his lifetime income by spreading it out more effectively over the longer post-

unemployment and retirement periods, i.e., by increasing his savings during the post-

unemployment period and reducing his consumption during retirement.




II.2. Government Intervention for the Second-Best Outcome

     : The Integrated UI System



II.2.1. The Relevance of Integration

 In this subsection we will see whether or not we need government intervention to

support the second-best optimum we have described. There are two possible reasons for

government intervention: first, all the second-best variables may not be decentralized by

individual choices in competitive markets; and second, the second-best outcome may not

be realizable under imperfect capital market as it involves individual borrowing against

future income.




                                                                                           18

 Let us first look at the decentralization issue, assuming for the moment that the capital

market is perfect. It is easy to verify that the second-best UI benefit r * can be supported

as an equilibrium in a competitive insurance market. Since the government budget

condition (7) is equivalent to the zero profit condition for an individual insurance firm,

the maximization problem for r* will be identical to the one for an equilibrium amount of

insurance in a competitive market.10

 In examining whether or not the other second-best variables – savings {s1 , s n , s u } and

borrowings rate R * - can be decentralized by individual choices in a competitive capital

market, we will presume that r = r*. Let {s1 , s n , su , R i } be an individual’s choices of
                                                  i    i   i




savings and borrowings rates given {r * , T * } . An individual makes these choices by

maximizing his expected utility (5) without the budget constraint (7) or without taking

into account the effect of his search incentive on the UI tax (or premium) T. However,

the equations (8) and (9) imply that both individual and second-best optimization

                                                                        *
problems for s n , s u , R are the same, i.e., that if r = r * , s1 = s1 ,



                    i      *    i     *
                  s n = s n , su = su , R i = R * .



As for s1i, on the other hand, it will be determined solely by intertemporal consumption

smoothing because an individual takes T as given in choosing s1i. Since this turns out to

be the case for the optimal savings s1* by the assumption (A), s1i = s1*. Thus, we have

established the following Proposition:




                                                                                                19
                                                                                           20


Proposition 3

 Under the assumption (A), the second-best outcome can be decentralized by individual

choices in competitive markets, i.e.,



        i     *    i     *     i     *
      s1 = s1 , s n = s n , su = su , r i = r * , R i = R * .




  Conversely, if assumption A is not satisfied, individuals in making their own savings

decisions the first period fail to take into account the moral hazard effect associated with

that savings. Hence, the greater the savings, the less the search intensity should they be

unemployed, and accordingly the greater the burden on the unemployment insurance

system. This is a standard externality-like effect that arises in insurance markets. In this

case, it takes the somewhat surprising form that individuals will save too much. In this

particular model, the government might be able to control the level of savings (assuming

it is observable) by taxing savings that exceed s1* at sufficiently high rates such that

individuals will not save excessively. But more generally, the government will have to

intervene to obtain a third best outcome by taxing activities that are substitutes for search

and first period consumption and subsidizing activities that are complements. (See

Greenwald and Stiglitz, 1986, and Arnott and Stiglitz, 1990) For the analytical simplicity

we will not pursue these issues by assuming (A) in this paper.

  Proposition 3 suggests that the government does not need to intervene if capital

markets are perfect, so that individuals can borrow against future income.11 But because

capital markets are not perfect, the government may have to intervene whenever an



                                                                                           20
                                                                                               21


individual has to borrow to sustain his optimal consumption. Suppose that the

government sets the mandatory savings rate in period 1 to be αs1 , where α ∈[0,1] . The
                                                                    *




amount of withdrawal an unemployed worker can make in period 2 would then be

(1 − α ) s1 . Note that α would not affect any individual choice in this model so long as
          *




α ≤ 1 , because s1* is the level of savings that an individual wants to make in period 1.

The amount of necessary borrowing for an unemployed individual will then be

( R * − (1 − α ) s1 ) . Thus, the integrated UI system will be needed to support the second-
                  *




best optimum if the amount of borrowing required to sustain the second best optimum is

positive, i.e., if



    (1 − α ) s1 < R * .
              *
                                                  (10)



Condition (10) suggests that the integration of UI with a pension is likely to be relevant,

or welfare enhancing12 , when (i) the optimal borrowing R* is large (which will be the

case when the optimal tax-funded benefit r* is small), (ii) the pre-unemployment savings

is small, or (iii) the level of mandatory savings (α) is high.

    Under certain circumstances an unemployed worker would not need to borrow much

for his consumption. If the optimal pension-funded self-insurance R* is small for the

reasons presented above, for example, then the amount that an unemployed worker can

withdraw (1 − α ) s1 may be large enough to cover R*. In this case, the integration of UI
                      *




with a pension would not be necessary. Furthermore, if the tax-funded benefit r* is very

large, R* may be non-positive, i.e., an unemployed worker may want to save out of the




                                                                                               21
                                                                                             22


tax-funded benefit r*, in which case an integrated UI system would again not be relevant.

However, we can present a certain set of parameter values for which integrated UI is

always relevant. More specifically, Proposition 1, 2 and the condition (10) can give us

some important results on the conditions for the relevance of integrated UI system. First,

we can establish the following.



Proposition 4-1

 For any given set of exogenous parameters {α , q, H , δ , N } , there exists M (< ∞) such

that (10) holds if M > M = M (α , q, H , δ , N ) .




 The proof is delegated to the Appendix. Proposition 4-1 demonstrates that an integrated

UI system is desirable if M (the post-unemployment working period) is long enough.

The reason for this should be obvious: With a long working period (given a fixed

retirement period), the savings rate required to finance retirement is lower.13 Also, long

working period tends to render small the risk burden of self-insurance R, leading to more

self-insurance and less tax-funded benefit (by Proposition 3 (iii)). The reduction in s1*

and the increase in R* imply the greater need for the integrated UI by (10). Note that

integrated UI is relevant for large M because s1* → 0 while R* > 0 as M goes to infinity.

 To examine other conditions for the relevance of the integrated UI, we will keep the

                                                           M +2
ratio of employment duration to retirement duration, a(≡        ) , constant, and will
                                                            N




                                                                                             22
                                                                                              23


suppose that a ≥ 1 . Then, we can establish the following Proposition on the relevance of

integrating UI with the pension program.



Proposition 4-2

     Suppose that a ≥ 1 and that a is kept constant. There exists a set of finite parameter

values {M o , H o , δ o } for any given set of the other parameter values such that (10) holds

if

 (i) M ≥ M o = M (α , q, H , δ , a) ,

 (ii) H > H o = H (α , q, M , δ , a) ,

 (iii) δ < δ o = δ (α , q, M , H , a ) .




The proof can be found in the Appendix. The result (i) shows that another feature of an

individual career structure – the relative length of unemployment period - may also affect

the relevance for an integrated UI. As both working and retirement periods get longer

relative to unemployment duration, the pre-unemployment savings s1* increases just a

little due to the slight reduction in UI tax T (by Proposition 1 (i) and (v)) while the

pension-funded self-insurance R* increases (by Proposition 2 (iii)). Since the increase in

R* outweighs the increase in s1*, for large enough M (and N) integration becomes

unambiguously desirable. This result can be seen another way: (10) will hold for large M

                    *      1           a
and N because s1 →             , R* →      as M and N go to infinity while a > 1 .
                          1+ a        1+ a




                                                                                              23
                                                                                              24


 Proposition 4-2 also shows that the integration of UI with a pension program would be

necessary when workers are not so risk-averse and reemployment is relatively sensitive to

search activity. When the economy is subject to serious incentive distortion, the tax-

funded benefit decreases (by Proposition 1 (v)) and thus the need for borrowing grows

(by Proposition 1 (iv)). The integration is necessary for large H because as H goes to

infinity, all the consumption for the unemployed will be financed by self-insurance R (by

Proposition 1 (iv) and (v)), which is greater than s1. If H = 0, i.e., if there is no incentive

problem, there would be no need for pension-funded self-insurance, so that no integration

might be necessary. If workers were risk-neutral, on the other hand, there would be no

need for tax-funded benefits (by Proposition 1 (v)), implying the need for full integration.

As workers become more risk-averse, however, the optimal tax-funded benefit would rise

and thus need for integration would be reduced.



II.2.2. Mandatory Savings

  It is obvious that the greater the level of mandatory savings, the greater the desirability

of integration. More specifically, we can state the following Proposition, with its proof

being delegated to the Appendix.



Proposition 4-3

  ∂M          ∂M o                      ∂H o        ∂δ o
     < 0,                        < 0,        < 0,        >0.
  ∂α           ∂α    a = const
                                         ∂α         ∂α




                                                                                              24
                                                                                          25


  As α approaches unity (all of first period savings are mandatory) then integration is

always desirable so long as in the second best optimum, there is some pension-funded

self-insurance, which there will be so long as individuals are not very risk averse and/or

there is no moral hazard problem associated with search. This suggests that an economy

with a strong public pension program should integrate unemployment insurance with the

pension program.

  In improving welfare relative to the conventional unemployment insurance,there might

seem to be an alternative to integrating the public pension program with the

unemployment insurance scheme: reducing α to zero or eliminating the public pension

program. This is not the occasion to provide a full rationale for the existence of such

programs. Our analysis is simply predicated on the observation that governments have

chosen to provide such programs; if they do so, then our analysis has demonstrated that

the unemployment insurance scheme should be integrated with it. But our analysis goes

further: as we shall show in the next section, a program integrating unemployment

insurance and pensions increases welfare relative to a purely private (non-mandatory)

pension scheme, with imperfect capital markets, because it allows, in effect, for

borrowing against future income.

       While we do not provide here an analysis of the role of mandatory pension

programs, we note that there are a number of factors which may make such schemes

more or less attractive. For instance, societies in which there is more concern that elderly

individuals do not fall below a certain threshold level—but in which at the same time

there are many individuals willing to take advantage of society’s compassion—will find

it desirable to have at least a minimal mandatory program.14 If the incidence of




                                                                                          25
                                                                                           26


unemployment is particularly high among those with low income—for whom the

mandatory savings constitute a large fraction of their total savings—then integration will

be desirable. In the United States, for instance, those at the bottom of the income

distribution have little savings to which they can get access, and at the same time face

higher risks of unemployment. Similarly, integration is likely to be of particular value in

developing countries, where monitoring informal work may be difficult (so designing

unemployment insurance schemes is more problematic) and where the poor both face

high risks of unemployment and have low savings.



II.3. Welfare Performance of the Integrated UI

II.3.1. Comparison Between the Conventional UI and Integrated UI

 We have stressed that the welfare advantage of an integrated UI system over the usual

UI system arises from capital market imperfections. Without the government provision of

pension-funded borrowings, when (10) holds, an unemployed worker would not only

have to use savings made in period 1 in an effort to maintain the optimal consumption

level, but he would have to undertake some additional (precautionary) savings in period

1 to supplement the tax-funded benefit r for his consumption while unemployed.

 To present a clear comparison between the conventional UI system and the integrated

system, we will assume that no mandatory savings is prescribed by the government, i.e.,

                                                 *
that α = 0. Suppose also that (10) holds, i.e., s1 < R * so that integration is necessary for

the second-best optimum. Then, we can show that the consumption level of an

unemployed worker under the conventional UI system in the periods prior to the

unemployment shock will be lower than the second-best level that can be achieved by the



                                                                                           26
                                                                                          27


integrated system. Let r̂ be the (tax-funded) UI benefit paid by the conventional UI

system, and let ŝ1 be the savings that an individual makes in period 1 under UI. Then we

can prove the following results.



Proposition 5

                                *
 Suppose that α = 0 and that s1 < R * . Then,




(i)   r * < rˆ , R * > ŝ1 ,

(ii) r * + R * > rˆ + sˆ1 .




 The proof of the Proposition 5 is delegated to the Appendix. The Proposition confirms

the earlier intuition: Under the conventional UI system, if a worker’s optimal retirement

savings s1* in period 1 is not enough to replace the optimal pension-funded benefit R*, he

would have to make additional savings in period 1 to ameliorate the consequences of the

unemployment shock. Since this precautionary savings involves some efficiency costs,

however, the savings made in period 1 would still be short of the optimal self-insurance

R* for the unemployed. Although the tax-funded benefit will increase to partially fill the

gap, because of the costs associated with the distortion, it would be insufficient to secure

the optimal consumption for the unemployed.



II.3.2. Welfare Performance of the Integrated UI:

      A Limiting First-Best Argument


                                                                                          27

 The welfare advantage of the integrated UI system stems from its ability to ease the risk

burden caused by the insufficiency of (optimal) UI benefits by spreading out income loss

over one’s lifetime. In this subsection we will explore how much the integrated UI

system can improve welfare. In particular, we will show that where the post-

unemployment working period (M) or the retirement duration (N) is very long, the

integrated UI system can approximate the first-best optimum.

 The condition (6) for the threshold search cost can be rewritten as



                                              *             *
             e * = ( M + 1 + N ){U (1 − s n ) − U (1 − su )}

                                                          2

         1+ a             1+ a




  The proof of Proposition 6 can be found in the Appendix. It highlights one of the

several important aspects of an integrated UI system. As the period of post-

unemployment or retirement gets longer compared to the unemployment period, the

integrated UI system makes arbitrarily small the amount of welfare distortion associated

with pension-funded borrowings. This occurs because under the system the adverse risk

effect becomes arbitrarily small, while maintaining the desired level of search incentives.

In the limiting case, the pension-funded self-insurance would have no risk effect with no

attenuation of incentives; there is a complete replacement of tax-funded benefit by




                                                                                                 29

pension-funded self-insurance. Full integration thus allows the achievement of the first-

best optimum.

  As previously noted, if a ≥ 1 , then the integrated UI system will be relevant in

approximating the first-best optimum. If a < 1 , however, the relevance of the integrated

UI would depend upon the mandatory savings rate α.




II. 4. Remarks

II.4.1. Multiple Unemployment Shocks and Participation Incentives

 We have dealt with, up to now, a simple case where an individual experiences only one

unemployment shock in his career. In fact, however, people may experience several

unemployment shocks, which are to be covered by the integrated UI system. We will

briefly mention the effectiveness and benefit structure of the integrated UI system under

this circumstance.

 Replacing tax-funded benefit by pension-funded borrowing would still alleviate

incentive cost associated with tax-funded benefit while reducing risk burden associated

with borrowing. The benefit of the integrated UI system would be especially marked

when the unemployment shocks occur earlier (rather than later) in one’s career. Only if

there is a risk of substantial correlation among the unemployment shocks, so there is a

risk of substantial lifetime losses as a result of these shocks, do the benefits of integration

become limited. Proposition 2 argued that if the unemployment shock was small relative

to lifetime income (and if the unemployment shock came early in life) then integration

was likely to be of particular value. Conversely, with multiple, highly correlated shocks,




                                                                                             30
                                                                                             31


there is a risk that, in effect, the unemployment shock is large relative to lifetime, so that

the gains from integration may be small.

 The question then is whether or not total unemployment duration for an individual is

short compared to his lifetime, which can be explored empirically. Feldstein and Altman

(1998) demonstrated in a simulation study based on PSID that if an individual deposits a

modest amount out of his income to his savings account to finance his unemployment

benefit (that under the current UI system), the terminal balance of an individual savings

account is positive for most of individuals. Similar studies by Vodopivec and Yun (2002)

on developing countries such as Malaysia and Estonia reveal that for most individuals the

amount of hypothetical lifetime unemployment benefit for an individual is only a small

portion of lifetime savings . These results seem to support the relevance of an integrated

UI system.15

 Intertemporal consumption smoothing implies that the optimal amount of borrowing

(from one’s pension) at a certain point in time is positively related to the level of his

pension expected at that time. Thus, the integrated UI system may involve a different

benefit mix for the unemployed depending upon their employment history. For an

unemployed worker who has a relatively long period of unemployment experience and

low level of expected pension savings in the future, for example, the amount of the

desired borrowing (out of the pension program) will be small. These arguments suggest

that the amount of borrowing offered to the unemployed by the integrated UI would

decrease in the total duration of previous unemployment.

 Another issue related to the relevance of integrated UI system relates to individual

incentives to participate in the system, where such participation is voluntary. The




                                                                                             31
                                                                                           32


participation incentive problem would be particularly prevalent among the young workers

in the informal sector who are relatively more subject to unemployment risk than others

and who have yet to accumulate large pension savings.16 Once they have borrowed more

than the entire balance in their individual accounts, they may desire to quit the system

because of their repayment liabilities (if they are allowed to do so). This adverse

incentive problem will clearly limit the amount of borrowing that the integrated UI can

offer the unemployed in the informal sector. However, the concern about adverse effects

on participation would not change the desirability of integration;. but instead changes

the benefit mix offered by the system. In particular, it reinforces the argument given

above that the optimal amount of borrowing for the young may be negatively related to

the total duration of unemployment they have experienced. The detailed analysis

regarding this issue will be left for future research.



II.4.2. Myopic Behavior



 The integrated UI system enables an individual to self-insure himself against

unemployment by using his pension and thereby maintaining his search incentive. The

favorable incentive effect of self-insurance is thus based upon the presumption that an

individual has the burden of repayment for the borrowing he makes during

unemployment. Some may argue, however, that an individual worker is so myopic in

reality that he may not act as if he has such a repayment burden, even when he does. In

particular, especially for the young unemployed workers, the repayment of borrowing

may be too remote to affect their search incentives; for such individuals, the impact on




                                                                                           32
                                                                                               33


search of benefits financed through self-insurance is no different from that from

government provided insurance.

  For such individuals, search can only be affected by differences in income experienced

in the short run; that is, only limitations on the total benefit (r + R) will induce search.

   In practice, even myopic individuals can respond to changes in consumption in the

near term induced by success or failure in obtaining a job. Earlier, we noted that if an

individual is not myopic, he will reduce his consumption (or increase his savings) after

being reemployed in order to spread out the burden of borrowing, as indicated by the

savings sn* and su* characterized in Proposition 1. This implies that a rational individual

in fact would start to pay for his borrowings just after a period of unemployment.

 By the same account the government can mandate a myopic individual to save more for

his retirement after experiencing unemployment.17 Thus our model suggests that the

government can use this differential mandatory savings policy or experience-rated policy

to help induce search. With myopic behavior, the government might need to impose a

greater burden for repayment earlier in an individual’s life in order to induce the second

best level of search.

    The welfare analysis of economies with myopic individuals is complicated by the

difficulty of ascertaining the appropriate valuation function. Traditional economic

analysis is concerned with individual’s expected utility over their entire life. But with

myopic individuals, there is no loss to the individual’s expected utility (viewed at the

beginning) to payments made out of retirement benefits to finance unemployment

benefits.

                                                                                            34


II.4.3. Distributional Issue



  It has often been argued that the integrated UI system with individual accounts

aggravates inequality among individuals. High-wage workers, who tend to get

unemployed less frequently than low-wage workers, are able to accumulate more savings

than under the tax-funded UI system.18 In response to this argument, we can raise the

following two points.

  First, there is another aspect of the integrated UI system that has a favorable

implication for distribution. A key point of the integrated UI system is that it allows a

worker to borrow against his future savings to finance a part of his unemployment benefit.

This would be particularly beneficial to the low-wage workers who do not have much

precautionary savings on their own against possible unemployment. Many studies have

shown that income distribution among individuals at a particular point in time is more

unequal than distribution of lifetime incomes.19 This implies that a young low-wage

worker, who has a higher probability of becoming unemployed, has a high chance of

moving up within the income strata of a society in the future. Thus it would be more

beneficial to a low-wage worker than to a high-wage worker to use his future income to

finance current consumption when he is unemployed.

  Second, the government can provide an explicit subsidy to compensate for the implicit

subsidy under the unintegrated system. Appropriately designed explicit subsidies can

mimic the distributional impacts of the implicit subsidies, and would entail no

incremental adverse incentive effects.




                                                                                            34
                                                                                            35


III. Toward a Joint Integration of Multiple Social Insurance Programs with

  Pension: An Integrated Lifetime Insurance



We have argued that allowing a worker to withdraw from his pension to finance his

consumption when faced with an unemployment shock can yield some welfare

improvement. The idea of integration can be applied to other forms of social insurance

than UI, such as health and disability insurance, that cover various shocks an individual

may face in his life. We can then think of a comprehensive integration system that jointly

integrates several social insurance programs with a pension program through an

individual account. We refer to this as an integrated lifetime insurance system. If an

individual experiences only a few shocks, so that the amount of corresponding income

loss is small compared to his retirement savings, the previous argument for integration

should still apply. Suppose, however, that an individual experiences so many of those

shocks that were there heavy reliance on borrowing against future pension savings, his

retirement account would be so drained that retirement consumption would fall below the

socially acceptable level; there would have to be a government bailout. Since early in his

life, the individual does not know what shocks await him in the future, there would seem

to be a risk associated with any integration. Given this possibility associated with multi-

risk case, we will in this subsection briefly examine the relevance of a joint integration of

social insurances with pension.

  Before providing the more detailed arguments, we note that qualitatively there is an

obvious answer to these concerns. The degree of integration—of borrowing against

future pension income—can be state dependent. In effect, the amount of tax funded




                                                                                            35
                                                                                           36


insurance provided against risks later in an individual’s life depends on his cumulative

experience. An individual with no experience of unemployment early in life will self-

insure against small health and disability risks later in life.

  In general, the integrated lifetime insurance system consists of several social insurance

programs integrated with the public pension program, providing an individual facing a

particular shock with tax-funded benefit and pension-funded borrowing. As in the

integrated UI, the benefit mix for a particular shock would depend not only upon risk-

aversion and incentive of an individual but also upon the parameters affecting the pattern

of consumption smoothing. An important factor determining the benefit mix (the

magnitude of the pension-funded borrowing) of an integrated social insurance is the

amount of pension savings that is expected to be available at the time of retirement. If an

individual under shock expects to have a relatively large amount of pension savings at the

time of retirement, he would be offered a benefit mix consisting of large borrowings and

a small tax-funded benefit.

  There are a couple of reasons for the positive relationship between pension-funded

borrowing offered by an integrated social insurance for an individual and his pension

savings expected at the time of a shock. First, the greater amount of retirement savings

for an individual implies that more borrowing is necessary for intertemporal consumption

smoothing in the event of a shock. Second, lower expected pension savings for an

individual implies a higher probability that the government bails him out to sustain a

certain minimum level of retirement consumption. As the government bails out a low

pension savings of an individual, the pension-funded borrowing to finance consumption

in the face a shock would in fact have adverse disincentive effects. This is because the




                                                                                           36
                                                                                             37


individual would know that his borrowing to sustain his consumption might not be

repaid as he experiences more shocks in the future. In other words, the reason for

reliance on pension-funded borrowing is to eliminate the adverse incentive effects of

insurance; the possibility of a government bailout means that there is still some implicit

insurance, and therefore there is still some adverse incentive effect. Note, however, that

this adverse disincentive effect of borrowing is less severe than a tax-funded benefit to

the extent that there is some probability that the borrowing is repaid.

  The expected pension savings available to an individual at the time of retirement

depends upon the amount of income loss caused by the shocks he experiences and the

amount of borrowing under the integrated social insurances. Hence, the desired amount

of pension-funded borrowing offered by an integrated social insurance for an individual

will also be determined by two factors.20 First, the amount of borrowing for an individual

under shock would be negatively related to the number and the sizes of other shocks that

he has experienced in the past and is expected to go through in the future. If he has

already experienced several shocks and borrowed substantially against his future pension,

for example, he may not have been able to accumulate much savings for his retirement.

This will lower his expected pension savings, implying that should he experience another

shock, he should not rely much on pension-funded borrowing. If shocks are highly

positively correlated with each other, the benefit mix of an integrated social insurance

involves less self-insurance and more tax-funded benefits. Second, the level of

integration for a particular social insurance program— the amount of pension-funded

borrowing offered by an integrated social insurance against that particular risk—is

constrained by the amount of pension-funded borrowing offered under other integrated




                                                                                             37
                                                                                           38


social insurance programs. This is because a given amount of pension savings has to be

shared for self-insurance against the shocks dealt with under several integrated social

insurance programs.

  This suggests that as more social insurance programs are integrated with the pension

program, the level of integration for each will be lowered. This raises the question :

Would it be relevant to integrate all the social insurance programs with the public pension

scheme or to exclude some of them from the integration? The answer is that all the social

insurances should be jointly integrated unless one risk is perfectly, positively correlated

with another. With the risks being imperfectly correlated to each other, there is always

some positive probability that an individual suffering from a shock later in his life has not

experienced any other shock before, in which case some borrowing against his pension

may be offered to him, and this will attenuate the adverse incentive effect of the tax-

funded insurance program...

  The basic idea behind the integrated lifetime insurance system is thus that there should

be no constraint on the fund that confines its use to a specific set of shocks only. Such a

constraint unambiguously lowers welfare. The joint integration allows us to have a

common pool of pension savings that we can draw upon in funding benefit payments

under different shocks. For those who have not experienced any shock and thus have not

received benefits, for example, the system allows a relatively large amount of their

pension savings to be used for the upcoming shocks (and retirement). Also, more pension

savings can be used to finance the borrowing against an early shock if other subsequent

shocks are expected to occur with a low probability before retirement.

  The extent of welfare improvement from an integrated lifetime insurance would




                                                                                           38
                                                                                           39


depend upon the correlation among the risks. If all the risks were perfectly, negatively

correlated to each other, the joint integration would be able to give us the maximum

welfare benefit by setting the highest possible level of integration for each social

insurance. As the risks are more positively correlated to each other, the level of

integration for each social insurance program that can be set by the joint integration

system would become lower. When all the risks are perfectly correlated with each other,

there is no advantage of sharing a common pool of savings, and hence no advantage in

integration. Unless the risks are perfectly positively correlated, however, the integrated

lifetime insurance system will always bring some welfare gain.21

  These arguments for the integrated lifetime insurance system lend support to the

Provident Fund in Singapore, Malaysia, and recently in Hong Kong. The Provident Fund,

to which individuals contribute a portion of their wage earnings, covers several risks,

such as disability, medical, and retirement risks. It should be noted, however, that there is

an important difference between the Provident Fund and the integrated lifetime insurance

introduced here: while the integrated lifetime insurance allows an individual to withdraw

more than what he has contributed, the Provident Fund limits the amount of individual

withdrawal to what he has accumulated in his account. Thus the levels of insurance and

intertemporal consumption smoothing it can provide to individuals are considerably

limited, compared to the integrated lifetime insurance system that allows them to access

to future income.




IV. Conclusion




                                                                                           39
                                                                                             40


 The failure of markets to provide adequate insurance against certain risks has long been

recognized. This, combined with the fact that social norms do not allow individuals in

their old age to suffer from insufficient income, even when their misfortune arises partly

because they have chosen to save insufficiently, provides a rationale for a public,

compulsory pension program. This paper has developed a further advantage to the public,

mandatory program; it allows for the collateralization of future wage income in a way

which is not easily possible otherwise, thus allowing individuals to in effect self insure

against a variety of risks.

  This paper has addressed two related issues. The possibility of pension-funded self-

insurance does not eliminate the desirability of some tax-funded insurance, except under

extreme circumstances. We have identified the factors on which the optimal degree of

pension-funded self-insurance depends. Our analysis is consistent with the suggestion in

the introduction of a heavy reliance on pension-funded self-insurance.

  When there are multiple risks (including the risk of multiple bouts of unemployment),

again some reliance on pension-funded self-insurance is in general desirable, unless the

risks are perfectly correlated. The integrated lifetime insurance system can always

generate a welfare gain from allowing a common pool of pension savings to be shared to

finance the benefits for those facing various shocks. The general principle naturally leads

to the suggestion of a fully integrated lifetime insurance system through a joint individual

account, an extension of the Provident Fund of Singapore and Malaysia,22 where major

risks including disability and health are integrated with the public pensions program..

     (1 − s n ) =                  =
                         N           N + M +1
                                            *
                      *           Ms n + s1 − R * M + r + s1
     r + R * = 1 − su =                          =
                                        N          N + M +1


Thus, differentiating (6) with respect to r and s1, we get the desired results from (8) and (9).




Proofs of propositions:



<Proposition 1>

The optimal choices of sn*, su*, R* will imply by (8) and (9) that



                          *
      *    M + 1 + s1
1 − sn =                                              (A1)
           N + M +1




                                                                                                   42
                                                                                                           43


                            *
         *     M + r + s1
1 − su       =            .                                  (A2)
               N + M +1


Then, by assumption (A) and envelope theorem, the optimal savings s1* will satisfy



dV ∂V
   =
ds1 ∂s1
                                                         *                       *
                    *                      M + 1 + s1           M + r * + s1
    = −U ' (1 − s1 − T ) + (1 − q )U ' (              ) + qU '(              )               (A3)
                                           N + M +1              N + M +1
   =0



The condition (A3) leads to the result (iv) by the assumption (A). Substituting the result (iv) into (A1) and

                                                                                                     *
(A2), and using the assumption (A), we get the desired results (i) and (ii). Since r + R = 1 − s u by (9),
                                                                                       *       *



we have the desired result (iii) by (ii). Finally, the necessary condition for r1* will be



                        *                                                                     *
      M + r * + s1                *                     *                  M + r * + s1
q [U ' (           ) − U ' (1 − s1 − T * ) − U ' (1 − s1 − T * ) Hr *U ' (              )]
       N + M +1                                                             N + M +1       (A4)
    =0


                                                     *
                                     M + r * + s1
Dividing both sides of (A4) by U ' (              ) and using (A3) and the assumption (A), we can
                                      N + M +1
rewrite (A4) as the desired result (v).

<Proposition 4-1>

As M → ∞, R* → 1 by Proposition 1 (iii) and (v). Also, s1* → 0 by Proposition 1 (iv) because r* → 0 as M

→ ∞. This implies that (10) holds for large M. When M = 0, on the other hand, R* < 0 and s1* > 0, implying

that (10) does not hold when M = 0. These arguments establish the desired result.

Note that Ω( R ( r )) < 0 , because R (r ) > s1 ( r ) and by the above condition for s1(r). Thus,

s1 ' (r ) < R(r ) , implying the desired result (i). The optimal tax-funded benefit r′ for a given precautionary

savings s1′ should satisfy

    See Orzag, Orzag, Snower and Stiglitz (1999) for a more general discussion. Folster and Trofimov (1999)

also presented a theoretical analysis of individual savings account for social insurance.
2
    However, some detailed redistribution issues associated with the integration will be discussed later in this

    paper.
3
    Since in our model, there are no adverse selection problems.
4
    There are some reasons, including a moral hazard problem, why the government has to mandate

    individuals to make savings for pension. One of the reasons for a mandatory pension is that an individual

may not save for retirement because they may expect the government to bail him out when he does not

have savings at the time of retirement.
5
    Alternatively, we can model an individual as paying the UI tax whenever he is employed rather than in

period 1 only. The difference in modeling would not affect the main results of this paper, however, so long

as an individual can maintain his optimal consumption in each period for a given state by adjusting his

savings or borrowings appropriately.
6
    This is also exactly the way an individual determines his savings s1, as will be shown later. In the more

general case, savings in the first period does affect search intensity. Assume, for instance, that the

individual lives only 6 periods, three work periods, three retirement periods, and faces unemployment in

the second period. If, for some reason, he had no savings from the first period, failing to search in the

second would reduce consumption per period in retirement by 50%. On the other hand, if he had been very

risk averse, had anticipated that he might be unemployed, and that he might be unlucky and face a high

search costs, and so had set aside 60% of his income (so that he has complete smoothing in the worse case

scenario), then the benefit to searching—the cost of not searching—is much less, and so the threshold e

above which the individual does not search is much lower.

    H and δ are evaluated at the optimum. Assuming that the risk aversion     δ   and search elasticity H are

assumed to be constant for all consumption levels and e' , respectively, we can see that the second-order

condition for r* is satisfied.

8
    Theoretically R* could be negative as r* becomes greater than one’s optimal consumption level in period 2,

in which case a part of the tax-funded benefit has to be left for retirement consumption. Although this can

be perceived as another type of integration between UI and pension, we will disregard this possibility in

this paper.

    Remember that the wage has been normalized at unity.
10
     Note that all the individuals are of the same risk type in this model, so that insurance firms are not

subject to adverse selection problems caused by privately-informed individual heterogeneity. Once we

allow for individual heterogeneity, then the second-best UI benefit r* for all types of individuals would not

be supported as a competitive equilibrium.
11
     There are, of course, other reasons that government intervention might be desirable. We focus here on

problems of moral hazard. All insurance markets also face problems of adverse selection. In general, such

markets are not constrained Pareto efficient. See Greenwald and Stiglitz [1986] and Arnott, Greenwald,

and Stiglitz [1994]
12
     This is because the second best optimum cannot be sustained without such integration.
13
     From Proposition 1 (i), the level of savings prior to the unemployment, s1 is lowered.
14
     For a more extensive discussion of the role of government in risk bearing, see Stiglitz [1992]. The fact

that mandatory pension savings cannot be withdrawn until retirement means that there is a considerable

welfare burden placed upon individuals who may experience several shocks other than unemployment

during their lifetime. These concerns may have placed some limits on the extent of mandatory savings.

Integration may, accordingly, lead to still further welfare benefits (beyond those formally modeled in this

paper: integration allows an increase in the level of mandatory savings, and thus an improvement in the

quality of the safety net provided to the elderly.

induce individuals to move from the formal to the informal sector; there may be large costs associated with

this distortion.
17
     In fact, our model already incorporates this type of mandatory savings: an individual is mandated to save

the optimal level su* after experiencing unemployment, which is greater than the optimal savings level sn*

for those with no unemployment experience in period 2.
18
     In fact, in experience rated systems described before, the extent of redistribution through the UI system is

limited.
19
     See Bjorklund (1993) and OECD (1996).
20
     This implies that the benefit mix offered by an integrated social insurance for an individual would also

depend upon individual employment history as well as the nature of a shock he suffers from.
21
     There are some studies which indirectly suggest that shocks are not highly correlated for an individual

during his lifetime: Bjorklund (1993) showed based upon Swedish data that lifetime income is more

equally distributed among individuals than annual income. OECD (1996) also reported that the upward

income mobility for low income individuals is higher than for high income individuals.

savings account for social insurance.

    However, some detailed redistribution issues associated with the integration will be discussed later in this paper.



3
    Since in our model, there are no adverse selection problems.



4
    There are some reasons, including a moral hazard problem, why the government has to mandate individuals to make savings for pension. One of the reasons for

a mandatory pension is that an individual may not save for retirement because they may expect the government to bail him out when he does not have savings at

the time of retirement.



5
    Alternatively, we can model an individual as paying the UI tax whenever he is employed rather than in period 1 only. The difference in modeling would not

affect the main results of this paper, however, so long as an individual can maintain his optimal consumption in each period for a given state by adjusting his

savings or borrowings appropriately.




                                                                                                                                                                  1

    This is also exactly the way an individual determines his savings s1, as will be shown later. In the more general case, savings in the first period does affect

search intensity. Assume, for instance, that the individual lives only 6 periods, three work periods, three retirement periods, and faces unemployment in the

second period. If, for some reason, he had no savings from the first period, failing to search in the second would reduce consumption per period in retirement by

50%. On the other hand, if he had been very risk averse, had anticipated that he might be unemployed, and that he might be unlucky and face a high search costs,

and so had set aside 60% of his income (so that he has complete smoothing in the worse case scenario), then the benefit to searching—the cost of not searching—

is much less, and so the threshold e above which the individual does not search is much lower.



7
    H and δ are evaluated at the optimum. Assuming that the risk aversion    δ   and search elasticity H are assumed to be constant for all consumption levels and e' ,

respectively, we can see that the second-order condition for r* is satisfied.



8
    Theoretically R* could be negative as r* becomes greater than one’s optimal consumption level in period 2, in which case a part of the tax-funded benefit has to

be left for retirement consumption. Although this can be perceived as another type of integration between UI and pension, we will disregard this possibility in

this paper.
