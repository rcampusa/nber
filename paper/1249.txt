                     Trade Unions and Productivity:
                    Some New Evidence on an Old Issue

                                ABS TRACT


         This paper summarized some new evidence concerning the impact of

collective bargaining on productivity for workers of a given quality

working with the same amount of capital. The new findings, which are

based on econometric investigations, indicate that in many sectors,

in particular manufacturing and construction, unionized work places are

on average more productive than those that are nonunion. This positive

union productivity effect is not an immutable constant. For example,

in the underground bituminous coal industry, unionized mines were

significantly less productive than nonunion mines in 1975 althougl-i they

were significantly more productive in 1965.

         The routes by which unions affect productivity have not yet

been carefully delineated, and they appear to differ from sector to sector.

In manufacturing, reduced turnover and improved management seem to be

key; in construction, better trained workers and more rationalized

hiring and supervision seem to be primary.

         Finally, while the union/nonunion productivity differential is likely

to be positive, it is on average not large enough to offset the

greater compensation and capital intensity under unionism. Hence,

higher productivity and lower profitability appear to go hand in hand
under collective bargaining.

     The impact of trade unionism on productivity has long been one of the

major bones of contention among analysts of unionism. As Derek Bok and John

Dunlop wrote in 1970: "For more than a century and a half, economists have

debated the effects of 'combinations of workmen,' or collective bargaining, on

the efficiency of business enterprises. The literature is replete with

conflicting appraisals of the impact of work stoppages, work rules, regulation

of machinery, apprenticeship, and training on employee efficiency and

managerial decisions."1

     Do unions decrease or increase labor productivity? According to standard

economic theory, unions raise wages and management responds by increasing the

capital intensity of its work place and the "quality" of its work force, which

increases the productivity of labor. This "productivity effect" of unions is

accepted by most discussants of the issue at hand. The real controversy

arises when the question becomes: Controlling for differences both in the

amount of capital labor has to work with and in labor quality, is productivity

higher or lower in workplaces which are unionized? That            is,   if we compare

union and nonunion workplaces which   are       identical in   terms of their   productive

inputs, does collective bargaining lead to human resources practices which

increase or decrease productivity?

     This paper summarizes some new evidence concerning the latter question of

workers of the same skill and using the same capital. The first section lays

Out two opposing views of the issues: one which focuses on "the union wage

(or more accurately, wages plus fringes) effect" and management responses to

it, and one which focuses on the non—wage effects of unionism. Section II

describes how a standard tool of economic theory and econometrics —— the
                                       2



production function —— has been used to help analyse the question while

section III summarizes the results of the production function investigations.

In the fourth section we turn from the level of productivity to its growth.

The evidence presented indicates that whatever unions do, they are not

preventing firms either from adopting new technologies, or from taking the

other steps which cause productivity to grow. In the fifth section we take a

glimpse inside the black box which links trade unions and productivity. While

we cannot identify all of the factors at work, we can offer evidence on some

important ones.



                  I.   "Monopoly" and "Voice/Response" Effects

     We have argued elsewhere that unions have two types of effects:

"monopoly" effects and "voice/response" effects.2 The monopoly effects deal

with unions' impact on the level of employee compensation (wages plus

fringes), and the ramifications of union—induced changes in that level; the

voice/response effects deal with what unions do once their monopoly effects

have been netted out (see Figure 1). According to the monopoly model, firms

respond to unionism by altering capital (and other inputs) per worker and

improving the quality of labor until the contribution of the last unit of

labor just equals the union wage rate. While under some circumstances unions

may use their monopoly power to lower productivity through restrictive work

practices, competition in product markets is unlikely to permit such practices

for very long except in markets sheltered from competition. An employer who

pays a higher cost of labor and gets less rather than more productivity out of

his workforce will go out of business in a competitive product market.

     While the monopoly model predicts that unionized firms will have higher

productivity than otherwise comparable nonunion firms, it is important to

realize that the monopoly—wage induced gain in productivity is socially

harmful. In the absence of other interferences with perfect competition, the

wage effect causes labor and capital to be allocated in such a way that their

contribution to national output is not as high as it would be if competitive

market prices determined where these factors were being utilized. Workers who

would have been employed in the union sector are forced to take lower

productivity jobs in the nonunion sector. Machines that would have been

employed in nonunion enterprises are now used in the union sector to raise the

productivity of unionized labor. And the size of the union sector is smaller

than it would have been in the absence of union monopoly wages. The social

cost of union monopoly wage gains can be interpreted as an estimate of the

lost productivity due to the set of monopoly effects associated with unionism.

     The voice/response routes by which collective bargaining raises

productivity are, by contrast, potentially socially desirable, since they

result not from inefficient allocation of resources but from improved

efficiency within firms. For example, reductions in turnover due to unionism

raise productivity by lowering costs of training and recruitment.3 In

industries like construction productivity gains result from unionized

apprenticeship programs that produce better workers. Managerial responses to

unionism that take the form of more rational personnel policies and more

careful monitoring of work activity raise productivity by reducing

organizational slack. The voluminous case studies by Harvard Business

School's Sumner Slichter, James Healy, and Robert Livernash and by other
                                       5




 researchers have shown the effectiveness of the managerial response to

 unionism is perhaps the most important determinant of what unions do to

productivity. Some managements will adjust to the union and turn unionism

into a positive force at the workplace; others will not. Over the long run,

those that respond positively will prosper while those that do not will suffer

in the market.4

     Just as the monopoly analysis allows for the possibility that restrictive

work rules reduce productIvity, the voice/response analysis allows for the

possibility that some work rules, such as seniority or rules restricting

managerial flexibility, can reduce productivity. Perhaps most importantly,

the voice/response analysis points to the "state of industrial relations" in a

sector as a key factor in either raising or reducing productivity. If

industrial relations are good, with management and unions working together to

produce a bigger "pie" as well as fighting over the size of their slices,

productivity is likely to be higher under unionism. If Industrial relations

are poor, with management and labor Ignoring common goals to battle one

another, productivity Is likely to be lower under unionism.

     The empirical question is whether productivity—augmenting or

productivity—reducing behavior dominates in the economy.



            II. Union Productivity Effects: Theory and Evidence

     The new tool used to study the impact of unionism on productivity is the

production function, which traditionally makes output per worker depend on

capital per worker, other inputs used per worker, and indicators of the

quality of the workers (as reflected in their level of schoolIng, for
                                      6




instance). To determine the effects of unionism on productivity, one adds to

the traditional variables a variable giving the fraction of the work force

that is unionized. In statistical analyses the estimated effect of the

fraction unionized reflects what unions do to productivity above and beyond

changes in the amount of physical inputs used per worker. To isolate the

union effect in this framework, one must have good measures of output,

capital, and the quality of labor, and one must specify properly the nature of

the production relation itself.

     Table 1 summarizes the results of studies using the production function

technique on the relation between unionism and productivity. As the table

shows, the studies differ in their measures of labor productivity, with some

measuring it as dollars of value added (or shipments) per worker and others in

physical units (tons, square feet) per worker. Value added is a dollar

measure (price times quantity) that has the advantage of including the full

spectrum of goods produced by a firm, valued at their market prices. It also

has a disadvantage, however: unless the prices charged by union and nonunion

firms are the same, any finding of higher value added per worker in the

organized establishments could reflect not the higher physical output per

worker, but rather a higher price per unit of output. In industries where

markets are truly national, with a single price for each output, and where

unionized and nonunionized firms are equally likely to specialize in high—

priced or in low—priced outputs, the possible confusion of price with quantity

is small, but in industries where markets are partly local, it could lead to

misleading inferences. Physical measures of output alleviate this problem but

at the cost of being limited to the few distinct goods that can be so

measured. Most modern firms produce a wide variety of products with too many

dimensions to be captured by a single physical measure. Because neither

measure is perfect, researchers have analyzed both value—added and physical

measures of labor productivity.

     The first study, by Professor Charles Brown of the University of Maryland

and James Medoff, compared value added per worker across states in the same

industry, and found that, with other factors (including capital per worker)

the same, productivity was 20 to 25 percent higher in the more heavily

unionized states. They also found, however, that unionized firms used more

capital per worker than predicted in the analysis, a fact that suggests that

they have not perfectly modelled the production process. Because the

estimated union effect depends critically on how capital affects output, they

report lower figures of 10 to 15 percent under various assumptions regarding

the productivity of capital. Follow—up work for manufacturing (the authors

and Professor Jonathan Leonard of the University of California, Berkeley) has

produced a smaller positive union productivity effect than Brown and Medoff

for 1972, using a different measure of capital, but a larger effect of 1977.

Analysis focused on a single manufacturing industry, wooden household furniture,

yielded an estimate of 15 percent higher productivity in union than in non-

union plants. In construction, Professor Steven Allen of North Carolina

State University has estimated union—nonunion productivity differences in

value added (deflated by an area price index, to deal with the danger that

in this sector the higher value added reflects higher prices of union built

buildings) ranging from 17 percent to 22 percent.    Not all value
                                       9




added studies have, however, obtained positive union productivity effects. In

a study of productivity in businesses," defined as parts of certain large

firms that can be considered separate, Professor Kim Clark of the Harvard

Business School found a slight negative union impact. Clark's findings make

it clear that the production function technique can yield negative as well as

positive union impacts and that the union effect is likely to differ across

different parts of the economy —— a point to which we will return later.

     Analyses of physical productivity, summarized in the bottom half of the

table, have in two cases found positive union effects and in one case found an

effect that went from positive to negative over time. Clark estimated that

productivity in cement was 6 to 8 percent higher in organized than in

nonorganized plants in 1974. In construction, Allen obtained data from the

U.S. Department of Labor on 83 office building projects and found that,

measured by square feet constructed per worker, the union projects had 11

percent to 39 percent higher productivity. Consistent with Allen's finding of

higher productivity in union construction, two case studies that examined

labor usage in the bids of union and nonunion contractors for identical

buildings found that union contractors estimated a need for 20 to 25 percent

fewer workers for the project than were needed by nonunion contractors.5

Finally, our analysis (in conjunction with Marguerite Connerton of the U.S.

Department of Labor) of tons of coal produced in underground bituminous coal

mines (virtually all underground tonnage in the United States was captured)

yielded quite different results in different time periods: positive union

productivity effects in 1965, small positive to small negative effects in

1970, sizable negative effects in 1975, and smaller negative effects in 1980.
                                      10




The switch in the union effect from positive to negative shows that the union

productivity effect is highly variable over time, dependent on labor and

management policies and relations, which can improve or deteriorate.

     Two of the studies in Table 1 used a before—after method of analysis,

examining the relation between changes In productivity and changes in

unionism. Both found productivity increasing with the advent of unionism. In

analysis of 1972—1977 changes in manufacturing productivity, we and Leonard

obtained a positive but statistically Insignificant union effect, which showed

that productivity did better in areas where unionism grew more (declined less)

but not by a well—defined magnitude. Clark compared productivity In six

cement plants that went union in the 1960s and found increases in productivity

of 6 to 8 percent.

     While the bulk of the work has focused on the U.S., an analysis for

Japanese manufacturing yielded results comparable to those in the original

Brown—Medoff study. For 1973, Muramatsu found a positive but insignificant

union productivity effect of 5 percent in Japanese manufacturing. For 1977 we

found that the unionized parts of Japanese manufacturing had a 19 percent

productivity advantage. The difference in results between the years may be

due to data problems or to differences over time in the relevant set of

intervening union effects.

     In sum, most studies of productivity find that unionized workplaces

are more productive than otherwise comparable nonunion workplaces. Because

unionized labor costs are also higher, however, one should not infer from this

that firms should be eager to be organized. Statistical evidence indicates

that the productivity increases cannot offset the greater capital intensity

and labor costs under unionism. Higher productivity does not mean a higher

rate of return on capital.6
                                       U

                  III. Unions and the Growth of Productivity

     While unions may have a positive effect on productivity at a given point

in time, they may cause productivity to decline over time. This would happen

if unions prevented firms from adopting new technologies; it would also happen

if unions led to a retardation in the growth rate of capital.

     Historically, some unions have opposed technological change. "The

Window—Glass Workers, with a strong craft tradition, tried to prevent the use

of glassworking machines when they were Introduced In 1908...In time, however,

the new processes displaced the old, since they were much more efficient, and

the window—glass union had to be formally disbanded in 1928. Other unions

have endorsed practices such as rigid piece rates which reduce the economic

benefits of technological change to employers."7

     Because unions that oppose technological change tend to go out of

business, the general union attitude toward technological change is not one of

stubborn opposition. While not all unions encourage technological change to

the extent that John L. Lewis' Mine Workers did in the 1950s and 1960s (when

the UMW favored rapid mechanization of the mines, high productivity, and high

wages, at the expense of employment), many unions view change favorably —— as

long as they can protect their members against serious harm. In the 1980s, as

well as earlier, indeed, some unions have even pressed management to modernize

their plants with new investments, as they realize that failure to do so means

ultimate loss of jobs.8

     Union policy toward technological change, whether pro or con, however, is

not the only determinant of the impact of organization on productivity growth.

Union wage increases may themselves speed up the rate of "technological
                                      12




advance by inducing management to substitute new machinery for labor or by

inducing management to pay for the development and introduction of new

technologies. On the other hand, however, high wages reduce profitability of

the union sector, discouraging further investments in the area.

    To see unionism is positively or negatively related to the growth of

productivity, as opposed to the level of productivity, we have analyzed the

impact of the proportion of workers unionized on the rate of growth of value

added or value of shipments in three data sets. The results of our analysis,

which are summarized in Table 2, suggest that while highly unionization

industries have, indeed, had somewhat slower growth of productivity than low

unionized industries, the observed relation is too weak statistically to

support any conclusion that unionism reduces dynamic efficiency. Some highly

unionized industries have rapid productivity growth while others have less

rapid growth. Because unionized sectors tend to be "older" industries, one

expects some negative relation between productivity and unionism because of

the life cycle of industries (a new industry typically enjoys more rapid

productivity growth than an older established sector) even if unionism did

nothing harmful to the rate of industrial progress. Consistent with our

results, analysts of the relationship between productivity growth and research

and development spending that includes unionism as a "control variable" shows

no clear pattern, with negative relationships between the fraction organized

and growth of productivity in some periods and positive relationships in other

periods.9 On the other hand, a recent study by Hirsch and Link of the growth

of total factor productivity between 1957 and 1973 in 192—digit nonunionized

industries yielded a negative significant coefficient on both a unionism

variable and a change in unionism variable. Over all, current empirical

evidence offers no support for the bald assertion that unionization is

associated with lower (or higher) productivity advance but suggests the value

of further work.

The Recent Slowdown in Productivity Growth

     The claim that productivity has historically grown more rapidly in

periods of lower organization of the workforce is simply false. The U.S.

economy has enjoyed rapid growth of productivity in periods of relatively weak

unionization (the 1900s, for example) and rapid growth in periods of strong

unionization, notably the decades immediately following the Second World War.

While so much changes over time that it would be foolhardy to read any

causality into hIstorical associations, the fact is that in both the post—

World War II period and over a longer period stretching back to 1900, (war

years and the Great Depression years excluded) there is essentially no

connection between productivity growth in the United States and unionization.

In a year when unionization has been above average, rates of growth of

productivity have been above average, while in years when unionization has

been below average, so too have rates of growth of productivity (see Table 3).

While it is still possible that union—induced changes in the overall economy

are inimical to rapid productivity growth, the historical data do not show

such a pattern.



                      IV. A Glimpse Inside the Black Box

       The impact of collective bargaining on productivity is not an immutable

constant. In fact, the impact appears to depend greatly on both the "internal

climate" of a workplace and the "external climate" in which management and

labor operate. We have seen that in many settings unions have a positive

impact on productivity, even after the "monopoly" effects of the institution

are netted out. Isn't this finding inconsistent with what managers say unions

do? What precisely are the channels through which unions affect productivity?

A black box which takes unionism and transforms it into greater productivity

net of capital intensity and labor quality would be much more credible if its

workings were understood.



Management Flexibility Under Unionism

     That unions reduce managerial flexibility is one of the most frequent

charges brought against unions by managers. Jurisdictional limitations on

what workers can and cannot do; restrictions on the activity of foremen and

other nonunion workers to perform the work of members in the bargaining unit;

restrictions on contracting work out; insistence on operating by the rules

even when it may be more efficient to break them are all different ways in

which unions impair managerial flexibility.

     To evaluate the impact of unionism on the flexibility of operations we

have examined the degree to which union and nonunion management substitute

nonproduction labor and capital for production labor when the relative costs

of the latter change. If unionism reduces flexibility, the extent of such

cost—minimizing substitution is likely to be less in a unionized setting. Our

analysis of substitutability between production and nonproduction labor among

industries and among plants within industries show that unionism is associated

with less substitutability between production and nonproduction labor but

not between production labor and capital. We estimate that a 10 percent

increase in the wage of production workers relative to the wage of

nonproduction workers causes a 1.9 percent substitution of nonproduction for
                                       17




production labor in a union setting compared to a 2.8 percent substitution in

a nonunion setting.11

     Even substantial reductions in flexibility are, however, unlikely to have

a great effect on productivity. When production lines are machine—run,

flexibility is simply not important. When operations are more amenable to

managerial decisions, the good manager can substitute better advance planning

for flexibility. Perhaps most importantly, flexibility ——   defined   in terms of

the substitutability among inputs in a production function ——   is   a second

order rather than first order factor in affecting the level of productivity.''

In the construction industry, where complaints about restrictive union work

rules are commonplace, experts in the economics of the industry almost

uniformly agree that the rules' effect on productivity has been vastly

exaggerated: 12


          "relatively few union workers are covered by contracts
          of this nature"

           ...their (work rules) adverse effect is much less than
          has been widely alleged"

          "Although no reliable quantitative estimate can be made
          of those rules on efficiency, their total impact would
          appear to be very small"

          "There is no question that at various times and places,
          various locals of the building trades unions have resisted
          technological innovation in tools or materials and have
          established unduly restrictive work rules or practices.
          Yet, the results of our survey, as of other field research,
          do not support the contention that this has been a widespread
          or consistent policy."


     All told, reductions in flexibility, while irritating to management, have

only modest effects on productivity.

Some Positive Channels

     Suppose the reduction in productivity due to reduced management

flexibility has been oversold. In what ways does unionism in fact raise

productivity and by how much?

     These are extremely difficult questions to answer, for they require

knowledge not only of differences in the characteristics of organized and

unorganized workplaces but also of the actual ways in which the workplaces operate.

Our current knowledge suggests that several factors underlie the union—

productivity linkage. In manufacturing, the fact that unions substantially

reduce quit rates appears to explain some of the union productivity effect.

Brown and Medoff estimated that one—fifth of the union/nonunion productivity

differential in the average manufacturing industry was attributable to the

lower turnover under unionism. Muramatsu found that all of the 1978 Japanese

union effect on productivity was to to lower quits. In construction, Allen

attributed 10 pe'cent of the union productivity advantage to the reduced need

for supervision under unionism; and 8 percent to the greater use of

standardized components by union contractors.13 In the cement industry, Clark

found some changes in worker behavior likely to raise productivity (lower

turnover in half of the plants studied, and, according to the union, improved

morale in two of six), but he found the most important changes in managerial

performance (Table 4). In every plant which became unionized, top management

replaced the plant manager and many foremen and introduced more professional

managerial practices, weeding out authoritarian or paternalistic practices.

Supervisors   "tightened the ship," "kept a close eye on things," and introduced

                                     In one plant, turnover rises.

Management Responses

     Supervisors                     Six plants replace supervisors.

Management Practices

     Before Union                    One plant rated management practices
                                     "professional." Three plants rated as
                                     "authoritarian." One plant rated as
                                     "authoritarian" or "paternalistic." One
                                     plant rated as "paternalistic."

     After Union                     Three plants report major improved methods
                                     of management: productivity targeting;
                                     performance review meetings; periodic
                                     meetings with workers; introduction of
                                     standards; new reporting and accounting
                                     systems; better supervisor/worker
                                     relations.

                                     Two plants report minor improvements: more
                                     formalized contract procedures; changes in
                                     way supervisors deal with people; gradual
                                     changes in system of monitoring
                                     performance.

                                     One plant reports little change: only
                                     difference is in supervisor/worker
                                     relations.

new modes of operation likely to raise productivity. This finding gains

credence from the fact that it is similar to the central conclusion of

Slichter, Healy, and Livernash in The Impact of Collective Bargaining on

Management that •The challenge that unions present management has, if viewed

broadly, created superior and better balanced management, 'even though some

exceptions must be recognized."14

     In some industries productivity is advanced by explicit labor—management

cooperative ventures. In the men's tailored clothing industry, for example,

labor and management established a committee to develop and introduce

automatic sewing machines to enable U.S. workers and firms to compete with low

wage foreign competitors, hiring Draper Laboratories, formerly a part of the

Massachusetts Institute of Technology, to do the technical work. According to

John T. Dunlop,

          The program has several distinct features. The Department
          of Commerce is contributing financially, although no more
          than the private—sector contributions from labor and
          management. The managements and the union in the clothing
          industry have been joined by two leading textile manu-
          facturers and a leading synthetic yarn company to constitute
          a broad sectoral group to improve coordination and produc-
          tivity improvements. These joint responses of labor and
          management e beyond those that could be achieved at the
          work place.


     While joint efforts are relatively uncommon, increased pressures from

foreign competitors may induce other industries and unions to engage in

similar cooperative activities in the future.

               V. The Union Productivity Effect Across Climates
     The effect of collective bargaining on productivity is not an immutable

constant. In fact, the new literature on the union productivity effect

indicates that the effect varies widely across settings. Is this variation

systematic? In which climates will the positive effects of unionism flourish?

     An Important implication of the voice—response model Is that productivity

is likely to depend on the state of labor—management relations in shops. When

those relations are poor, management is likely to have trouble getting high

productivity. When they are good, workers and management may pull together

for the benefit of the firm. Three studies have examined the link between

productivity and the state of industrial relations at a plant and all three have

found strong support for this proposition. In an analysis of productivity at

18 General Motors plants Professors Harry Katz and Thomas Kochan of M.I.T. and

Kenneth R. Gobeille found higher productivity where plant managers rated the

industrial relations climate good or where the rate of grievances filed by

workers was low (indicated that workers viewed the state of labor—management

relations as good). In a detailed study of paper mills, Bernard Ichniowski of

the National Bureau of Economic Research obtained similar results: a plant

with a low rate of grievances filed in a given period had notably better

productivity than the same plant when it had a high rate of grievances filed

(see Figure 2). In addition, he has estimated that low grievance plants have

correspondingly higher profits, because of the better procbuctivity, by as much

as a third compared with high grievance plants. In the third study, Professor

Michael Schuster of Syracuse University examined productivity at nine

manufacturing plants over a period of five years, during which a cooperative

union management program was introduced. He found an increase in productivity

in six of the eight plants for which productivity could be measured.'6

     The striking change in the union effect in the coal industry from

positive in the 1960s to negative in the 1970s shown in Figure 3 appears to be

at least partially due to a deterioration in the state of industrial relations

in the sector. In the 1950s, when John L. Lewis ran the United Mine Workers

of America (LJMW) the union was a strong, centralized organization

 (dictatorial, in many respects), whose policy was to favor mechanization,

rapid technological change and rising wages at the expense of employment. The

result, as can be seen in Figure 3, was extremely rapid productivity growth.

After Lewis' death, however, the union was wracked with internal dissent, as

one leader replaced another while workers engaged in wildcat strikes to voice

their complaints about work conditions. One union president, Tony Boyle, was

convicted of hiring gunmen to murder an insurgent leader. His successor,

Arnold Miller, was widely criticized as ineffective, and the next leader, Sam

Church, was turned out of office for failing to represent member's desires.

Instability in underground coal mining reached such a state that in 1976 there

were 1,383 work stoppages ——   over ten times the number fifteen years earlier —
— and 3.5 percent of total working time was lost due to wildcat strikes, over

fifteen times as much as in 1961. Sensing the weakness of the union, some

coal managements sought to take advantage of the situation, delaying

settlement of grievances, and giving the union as much trouble as they

could.'7 While other factors, such as the Mine Safety and Health Act of 1972,

contributed to the reduction of productivity, the deterioration in industrial

relations in the sector is, in our view and that of many industry

participants, a major cause of the observed decline. Indeed, as the union

began to stabilize in the 1980s, productivity began to rise once more. The

lesson is that unionism per se is neither a plus nor a minus to productivity.

What matters is how unions and management interact at the workplace.



The External Climate

     If industrial relations in coal could deteriorate to such an extent that

unionized mines became markedly less productive than nonunion mines, what

prevents conditions from deteriorating elsewhere in the organized part of the

economy, with commensurate adverse effecis c'n productivity? Why does coal in

the 1970s appear to be the exception, rather than the   rule?
     We believe the answer lies with the extent of competition found in the

product market for the output produced by unionized labor. Like everyone

else, unions, management of organized plants, and covered workers are more    likely to
devote   effort to productivity—augmenting activities when they face the gun of

competition. Indeed, in a competitive sector, only the unions and management

that are able to raise productivity to offset union wage gains will survive in

the long run. Sectors which are sheltered from competition, by contrast, may

or may not adopt productivity—improving activities. From this perspective the

collapse of productivity in unionized coal is understandable. Coal is a

natural resource that can be produced only in certain areas, so that the entry

of competitors is limited. In the 1970s, the price of coal soared because of

the shift in demand from oil to coal, allowing the organized mines to earn

reasonable returns and stay in business despite their higher labor costs per

unit of output. In 1975, when the estimated union productivity effect was

very sizably negative, and when average productivity in underground mining was

40 percent lower than in the 1969 peak year, the rate of return on investment
                                      26




in the entire industry was over four times what it had been in 1969. Of

course, the unionized producers suffered a serious loss of market share, from

about 70 percent of production in the late 1960s to 44 percent of production

in 1980. But they still remained in business.'8

     It also appears that the union productivity effect appears to be greatest

where product markets are most competitive, a pattern pointed out by Addison

and Hirsch.'9 They noted that Clark in his study of the cement industry found

the largest union effect in the Southwest where nonunion competition was

greatest and that Mandelstamm's20 case studies of the residential construction

sector identified competition from contractors in Detroit as a key determinant

of the high level of productivity in heavily unionized Ann Arbor.



                                  Conclusion

     What unions do to productivity is one of the key factors in assessing the

overall economic impact of unions. The new quantitative studies indicate that

productivity is generally higher in unionized establishments than in otherwise

comparable establishments that are nonunion, but that the relationship is far

from immutable and has notable exceptions. Higher productivity appears to run

hand in hand with good industrial relations and to be spurred by competition

in the product market, while lower productivity under unionism appears to

exist under the opposite circumstances.

growth of productivity and growth of unionism. From their data, however, it

is apparent that there is a positive correlation between the level of unionism

and productivity growth as well as between the changes.
