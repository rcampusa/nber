Student Loan Nudges: Experimental Evidence on Borrowing and Educational Attainment

                                          ABSTRACT

We estimate the impact of student loan “nudges” on community college students' borrowing and
provide the first experimental evidence of the effect of student loans on educational attainment.
Nonbinding loan offers listed in students' financial aid award letters, that do not alter students'
choice sets, significantly affect borrowing. Students randomly assigned to receive a nonzero loan
offer were 40 percent more likely to borrow than those who received a $0 loan offer. Nudge-
induced borrowing increased both GPA and credits earned by roughly 30 percent in the year of
the intervention, and in the following year, increased transfers to four-year colleges by 10
percentage points (nearly 200 percent). We predict that the average student would be better off
receiving a nonzero loan offer for any discount rate below 12.4 percent. Students' borrowing
responses to the nudge are most consistent with a model in which nonzero offers provide
information about loan eligibility, suggesting that for most students, nonzero offers are welfare
enhancing. Given that over 5 million U.S. college students receive $0 loan offers, our results
indicate the potential to achieve large gains in educational attainment through changes to the
choice architecture around borrowing.

1     Introduction

U.S. undergraduate enrollment has increased by more than 30 percent since 2000, with two-year institutions

absorbing the majority of new students. The plurality of students now attend open-access community colleges

and face poor odds of success.1 At the same time, numerous studies provide evidence that community college

graduates receive substantial labor market returns.2 While financial aid has been shown to help low-income

students enter and complete college (Deming and Dynarski 2010), the design of federal student aid programs

may hinder students’ ability to take advantage of these resources. In particular, a growing literature suggests

that student decisions are influenced by debt aversion (Field 2009; Caetano et al. 2011), cognitive costs

associated with complexity (Dynarski and Scott-Clayton 2006; Bettinger et al. 2012), issues of self-control

(Cadena and Keys 2013), and framing effects (Pallais 2015; Evans et al. 2016).

    Students also may be highly responsive to choice architecture – the design of the environment in which

individuals make choices (Thaler et al. 2012). Institutions choose how options for student loans are presented

to students, potentially altering the choice architecture around students’ borrowing options. Although

colleges must make federal loans available to all qualifying students, they have discretion over whether

a loan “offer” is included in students’ financial aid award letters. Thus, loan offers may serve as nudges

by altering the framing or salience of borrowing options, even though students’ choice sets are unaffected.

Offers could affect borrowing decisions if they are perceived as providing information about loan availability,

establish a reference point for students who are inattentive to alternatives, or induce anchoring around the

offered amount.3

    We study the effect of student loan nudges on borrowing and educational attainment with a field exper-

iment at a large community college. Students were randomly assigned to receive either a loan offer of zero

or a nonzero offer of $3500 (for “freshman”) or $4500 (for “sophomores”).4 Students who received a nonzero

loan offer were 40 percent more likely to borrow than those who received a $0 offer, with each additional

borrower taking-up a $4000 loan, on average.

    Nonzero loan offers also generated sizable gains in educational attainment. While we find no evidence of

economically meaningful or statistically significant enrollment effects in the year of the experiment, nonzero

loan offers significantly increased credit accumulation and students’ grade point averages (GPAs). Using the
   1 For example, among community college students who entered in fall 2010, only 30 percent completed a certificate or associate

degree while 9.3 percent earned a credential from a four-year institution (Shapiro et al. 2016).
   2 See, for example, Jepsen et al. (2014), Bahr et al. (2015), Dadgar and Trimble (2015), Liu et al. (2015), Stevens et al.

(2015), and Turner (2016).
   3 Both inattention and anchoring have been shown to influence consumers’ decisions in other financial markets. For instance,

Keys and Wang (2016) show that borrowers exhibit anchoring with respect to minimum credit card payments while Stango
and Zinman (2014) provide evidence of limited attention with respect to bank overdraft fees. However, despite the growing
importance of student loans in households’ balance sheets, less research has focused on borrowing decisions relative to consumers
decisions in other credit markets (Zinman 2015).
   4 Our experimental site classifies students as freshmen if they have accumulated less than 30 credits.




                                                               2
random assignment of loan offers as an instrument, we provide the first experimental evidence of the effects

of student loans on educational attainment. On average, students earned 3.7 more credits and increased their

GPAs by 0.6 when induced to borrow by the nudge, representing increases of roughly 30 percent relative to

control group means. One year after the intervention, nudge-induced borrowing increased the probability of

transfer to a 4-year institution by 10 percentage points (200 percent).

   Cost-effectiveness calculations based on the estimated first-year attainment gains indicate that nudging

students to borrow is more cost-effective than the most promising interventions at community colleges to-

date (e.g., Scrivener et al. 2012; Mayer et al. 2015). The average student also likely benefits from receiving

a nonzero loan offer. Using existing estimates of the labor market gains from community college credit

accumulation and from admission to a four-year institution, we estimate that the attainment gains students

experienced within two years are worth more on average than the present value of the students’ additional

debt for any discount rate below 12.4 percent.

   Finally, we provide evidence of the mechanisms through which nonzero offers affect students’ borrowing

decisions. Predictions from a model with anchoring are inconsistent with the empirical distribution of loans

for treatment and control group members. Thus, we focus on a model that allows for default bias, inattention,

and costs associated with learning about loan availability. Among treated students, the distribution of loan

amounts exhibits a spike at the exact amount of the offer, providing evidence of inattention to alternative

amounts. Two additional patterns suggest nonzero loan offers provide information about loan availability,

even though all students receive an email explaining how to obtain a loan. First, treatment increases the

number of students borrowing amounts at all points in the distribution of loan amounts and not just at the

offered amount. Second, compliers – students induced to borrow by the nudge – are more likely than always-

takers to be new students and are less likely to have borrowed in the past. We estimate that information

about loan availability provided by nonzero loan offers accounts for over 75 percent of treatment effect on

loan take-up, suggesting nonzero loan offers generate welfare gains for most compliers.

   Outstanding student loan debt in the U.S. has grown steadily over the past decade, reaching $1.34

trillion in 2017 (Federal Reserve Bank of New York 2017). Despite the fact that community college students

have greater unmet financial need and are less likely to borrow than students at private and more selective

institutions, efforts to reduce borrowing have been especially pronounced within this sector.5 Such policies

range from completely opting out of federal loan programs to offering all students $0 in loan aid.6 Colleges
   5 According to the 2012 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS), 70 percent of community college students

who applied for federal student aid faced a cost of attendance that exceeded their total resources (including grants, loans,
work-study, and personal resources). Among four-year public and nonprofit undergraduate aid applicants, 58 and 60 percent
had unmet need. Authors’ calculations using PowerStats.
   6 Nearly one million additional students attend colleges that do not participate in the student loan program (Cochrane and

Szabo-Kubitz 2016).




                                                             3
may try to limit student loan debt out of concern over students’ ability to repay their loans and a desire

to avoid sanctions that the Department of Education can place on schools with high cohort default rates

(CDRs).7 Although sanctions can cause schools to lose access to federal student aid programs, these penalties

are rarely applied to community colleges.8

    There is limited evidence on the extent to which loan aid affects outcomes in and beyond college. Two

observational studies estimate the impact of access to federal loan aid using variation in community colleges’

decisions to participate in federal loan programs (Dunlop 2013; Wiederspan 2016).9 These studies rely on

the identifying assumption that colleges’ decisions of when and whether to participate in the federal student

loan program are random, whereas we implement random assignment of non-binding loan offers within a

college. Nonetheless, these studies also suggest that institutional decisions that inhibit access to federal loans

may also reduce educational attainment.

    A handful of bachelor’s degree granting institutions have also recently implemented interventions designed

to reduce borrowing. The Indiana University system rolled out a number of concurrent programs aimed at

reducing debt and increasing four-year graduation rates in 2013, and within two years, aggregate borrowing

fell by 16 percent (Kennedy 2015).10 Schmeiser et al. (2017) study a similar intervention at Montana State

University that targeted students with high levels of debt using a difference-in-differences design, and they

find that targeted students’ borrowing decreased by only 2 percent.11 Less costly interventions designed to

help inform students’ borrowing decisions have produced mixed results. Loan applicants at the Community

College of Baltimore who were randomly assigned to a text messaging campaign combined with assistance

from financial aid counselors experienced small reductions in both the amount borrowed and short-run

attainment (Barr et al. 2017).12 Experimental evidence from the U.S. and the Netherlands suggests that
   7A   school’s CDR equals the share of federal borrowers who default within three years of entering repayment. Schools with
CDRs exceeding 30 percent for three consecutive years lose eligibility to provide students with federal Pell Grants and loans,
while schools with CDRs exceeding 40 percent in any single year lose access to federal loans. Schools can appeal such sanctions
for a variety of reasons, including serving a large number of low-income students or having a low number of borrowers in a given
cohort. Prior to 2012, CDRs were measured on a two year basis with lower sanction thresholds. See the Federal Student Aid
Cohort Default Rate Guide for additional details.
    8 Only three community colleges received CDR-related sanctions between 2002 and 2015. All three avoided federal aid loss

through successful appeals. In September 2017, one additional community college was sanctioned and will likely appeal (see
https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-releases-national-student-loan-fy-2014-cohort-default-rate).
    9 Dunlop (2013) finds that students in participating colleges are more likely to transfer to a four-year school, with some

subgroups also being more likely to obtain bachelor’s degrees. Wiederspan (2016) estimates that college-wide participation in
federal loan programs leads Pell Grant-eligible students to attempt an additional 19 credits in their first year.
   10 These initiatives included the establishment of an Office of Financial Literacy and financial education program, one-on-one

financial counseling, online financial training for new students, and annual student loan debt letters to all student borrowers with
information on cumulative debt, estimated monthly repayment, and remaining federal loan eligibility. Completion initiatives
included a campaign that encouraged students to take 15 credits per semester and freezing tuition and fees for students on
track to complete their degree in four years.
   11 Starting in fall 2012, Montana State University sent letters to students with high outstanding debt that included an

incentivized invitation to participate in a one-on-one counseling session with a certified financial counselor.
   12 Students in the treatment group received text messages for one month. Texts included information about students’ loan

options and terms (including lifetime limits and future payments), encouragement to complete required forms, access to one-
on-one counseling with financial aid staff (70 percent of students sent at least one question), reminders that it was possible to
borrow less than the offered amount, and suggested reference loan amounts less than the federal maximum.




                                                                 4
information alone does not significantly alter students’ borrowing decisions, even when it increases students’

understanding of loan terms and programs (Booij et al. 2012; Darolia and Harper forthcoming). Our findings

suggest that the point in time at which students make borrowing decisions is an especially important one.

Small nudges at this point in time can have effects on borrowing that are as large as, if not larger than,

initiatives that are more expensive and broader in scope.

    Furthermore, across-the-board reductions in student loan debt is not necessarily the objective that institu-

tions and policy makers should pursue. Estimated returns to college completion suggest that the investment

in college is worth the cost of borrowing to finance it for the average young adult (Avery and Turner 2012).

Many low-income students already avoid loans, including subsidized loans that do not accrue interest in

college (Cadena and Keys 2013). Students behave as if facing a fixed cost of borrowing, particularly if they

attend colleges that make $0 loan offers (Marx and Turner forthcoming). Our experimental evidence shows

that barriers to borrowing can reduce attainment.

    Nudges have been shown to affect financial choices across a variety of settings (e.g. Thaler and Benartzi

2004; Duflo et al. 2011; Allcott and Rogers 2014). Within the context of postsecondary education, attainment

effects have been found for nudges including reducing already-small costs of college applications (Pallais

2015), providing information to high-achieving, low-income students (Hoxby and Turner 2015), sending text

messages about obtaining financial aid and advancing in college (Castleman and Page 2015; Castleman and

Page 2016), and sending unemployed workers information about financial aid and the return to college (Barr

and Turner 2015). Relative to these studies, ours involves a general population of community college students

and finds especially large effects of a policy choice currently in use or being contemplated by thousands of

colleges. Finally, our study contributes to a growing literature on the importance of choice architecture.

Madrian and Shea (2001), Choi et al. (2006), Chetty et al. (2014), and Bernheim et al. (2015) show that

default options matter for decisions related to investment, saving, and 401(k) participation. The default

option for all students in our setting is a loan amount of $0, regardless of the offer received. Our study

therefore provides evidence that nudges that establish reference points can influence behavior even when the

nudge does not alter the default option.



2     Federal Student Loans in the U.S.

Low-income college students in the U.S. are eligible for federal grants and loans. In order to access federal

aid, prospective students must fill out the free application for federal student aid (FAFSA), which requires

information on family income, assets, siblings, and other family members’ college attendance. These inputs

are fed through a complicated, nonlinear formula to determine a student’s expected family contribution


                                                       5
(EFC), the federal government’s measure of ability to pay. Eligibility for federal need-based grants, subsidized

loans, and campus-based aid will generally depend on EFC, either directly (as in the case of Pell Grant aid)

or when combined with additional information (as in the case of work-study funding).

    All students who are enrolled at least part-time and have completed a FAFSA are eligible to borrow

through federal loan programs. The largest source of federal loan aid for undergraduate students is the

Direct Loan Program. The terms of federal loan aid depend on a student’s course load, dependency status,

class standing, and unmet need. While students must attempt at least 6 credits to be eligible to borrow,

above this threshold, the terms of borrowing do not explicitly depend on a student’s course load. A student’s

unmet need, equal to her total cost of attendance (tuition, fees, and a cost of living allowance) minus her

expected family contribution (the federal government’s measure of need) and total grant aid from all sources,

determines her eligibility for subsidized loans, which do not accrue interest while in school. Students classified

as freshmen are eligible for subsidized loans equal to the lesser of remaining need and $3500.13 Community

college students who are classified as sophomores are eligible for an additional $1000 in subsidized loans.14

Dependent first-year students can borrow an additional $2000 in unsubsidized loans while independent

students can borrow an additional $6000.15

    Students who do not qualify for subsidized loans can still borrow unsubsidized loans up to the over-

all maximum (e.g., $5500 for freshmen dependent students and $9500 for freshmen independent students).

Unsubsidized loans begin accruing interest immediately after disbursement, but interest rates for both subsi-

dized and unsubsidized loans are fixed over the lifetime of repayment.16 Dependent undergraduate students

face a lifetime eligibility limit of $31,000 in federal loans, while the limit for independent undergraduate

students is $57,500.

    Although the federal rules described in the previous paragraph dictate the amounts of subsidized and

unsubsidized loans for which a college student is eligible, colleges can decide how much loan aid to offer in

financial aid award letters.17 In all cases, not borrowing is the default: students who take no further action

do not receive loans, regardless of the amount offered. Students who receive nonzero loan offers must still

accept the offer and complete federal requirements (entrance counseling and a Master Promissory Note) in

order to receive their desired aid. Students who do not receive a loan offer (or receive a $0 offer) can still
  13 Subsidized loan eligibility is also reduced when a student’s remaining lifetime eligibility for subsidized loans ($23,000) is

less than these amounts.
  14 Students enrolled in four-year institutions are classified as upper-level students are eligible for an additional $2000 in

subsidized loans. Regardless of credit accumulation, community college students cannot be classified as upper-level.
  15 An undergraduate student is classified as independent if she will be over the age of 24 by the end of the calendar year, is

married, has dependent children, was in foster care or a ward of the court since age 13, is an emancipated minor, is a homeless
unaccompanied youth, is currently serving on active duty, or is a veteran.
  16 Subsidized and unsubsidized loans disbursed after July 1, 2015 had an interest rate of 4.29 percent. Both types of Direct

Loans disbursed after July 1, 2016 had an interest rate of 3.76 percent.
  17 The Department of Education and college financial aid administrators call this process “packaging”.




                                                                6
request a loan, with the specific request process varying across institutions. Nearly all four-year institutions

offer students the maximum amount of loan aid for which they are eligible. In contrast, community colleges

are divided in how much loan aid they offer to students.

    We collected information on loan offer policies of community colleges that participate in federal loan

programs through a combination of web searches, emails, and phone calls between March 2014 and July

2015. In Table 1 we describe each type of school using summary data from the Integrated Postsecondary

Education System’s 2012-13 Student Financial Aid and Net Price files and the Department of Education’s

official 3-year cohort default rates.18 A handful of community colleges offer students a nonzero subsidized

loan with zero unsubsidized loans, while the vast majority are split between either offering students both

subsidized and unsubsidized loans or offering them no loans. Close to 5 million students attend community

colleges offer loans, and over 5 million students attend schools that do not offer loans. All three categories

of colleges have comparable populations in terms of Pell Grant receipt, suggesting that loan offers are not

correlated with average student need. Schools that make $0 loan offers tend to have lower borrowing rates (16

versus 30 percent for schools offering subsidized and unsubsidized loans). Differences in federal loan take-up

may have important financial consequences: nationwide, low-income community college students are more

likely to use a credit card to pay for school and are more likely to work if they have unmet need and forgo

subsidized loans.19 Though the risk of federal sanctions for high student loan default rates may motivate

college policies intended to reduce student borrowing, cohort default rates among schools that package both

subsidized and unsubsidized loans are comparable to rates among schools that do not offer their students

federal loans (18.6 versus 18.9, respectively).



3     The Experiment

The experiment was implemented at “Community College A” (CCA), an anonymous community college,

during the 2015-16 academic year.20 As shown in Panel A of Table 2, CCA’s costs are comparable to the

costs faced by community college students nationwide. For instance, in-district tuition and fees for the 2014-

15 academic year were approximately $3100 versus $3249 nationwide. We contacted colleges with sufficient

enrollment to obtain a useful sample size, and hence CCA has a significantly larger student body than the
  18 An earlier version of this table appears in the online appendix to Marx and Turner (forthcoming). The current version

of the table includes the packaging practices of 796 community colleges, representing 92 percent of community colleges that
participate in federal loan programs.
  19 Authors’ calculations using data from the 2012 NPSAS (via Powerstats). We limit the sample to community college students

with at least $1000 in unmet need (and thus would qualify for subsidized loans) and who are eligible for a federal Pell Grant.
Students in this sample who forgo federal loans are 9 percentage points (33 percent) more likely to use a credit card to pay for
college and are 4 percentage points (7 percent) more likely to work while in school than those who take-up federal loans.
  20 We ran a similar experiment at a second community college (“Community College B” or CCB). However, the experimental

sample of students was much smaller than anticipated, and the resulting estimates were not sufficiently precise to rule out the
possibilities of either large effects or no effect. Appendix B contains details on the CCB experiment.



                                                               7
average community college, with a 12-month full-time equivalent enrollment (FTE) of approximately 18,800

compared to 4,300 across all community colleges. Financial aid receipt is similar between CCA students and

community college students nationwide. For instance, approximately 45 percent of CCA students received

Pell Grant aid and 25 percent received federal loans in 2013-14, compared to 41 and 19 percent of students

at the average community college.

    Students at CCA have substantially lower completion rates and slightly worse labor market outcomes

than students at the average community college. Only 5 percent of CCA students completed a credential

within 150 percent of the expected time to degree (e.g., 3 years for an associate degree), compared to

21 percent of students at the average community college.21 Median earnings among federal aid recipients

who were no longer enrolled 10 years after entry are similar for CCA and community colleges nationwide

(approximately $28,000 versus $30,253, respectively). Other earnings outcomes follow similar patterns, with

CCA students experiencing slightly worse labor market outcomes than national averages. While borrowers

from the experimental site had lower student loan balances when entering repayment (approximately $4200

versus $6500 nationwide), CCA borrowers experienced worse repayment outcomes.

    CCA had considered changing its loan packaging procedures prior to the experiment. During the 2014-15

academic year, CCA offered loans to all students with less than $25,000 in outstanding federal loan debt.

All prospective students who listed CCA on their FAFSA received information relating to their financial aid

packages electronically via a web-based system. In addition to federal requirements, CCA required students

to actively confirm that they wish to borrow and to specify the amount of loan aid they would like via an

electronic loan request form. CCA’s loan eligibility criteria and application procedures were not altered for

the experiment. CCA disburses all funds, including loans, 35 days after the start of the semester.22


3.1     Experiment design

The experiment entailed random assignment of loan offers to students. On a roughly daily basis starting in

May 2015, the CCA financial aid office provided data for each batch of students for whom an award letter

was to be generated the following day. Using these data, students were assigned to either the treatment

group or the control group using randomization stratified by Expected Family Contribution (EFC) bins and

all possible combinations of binary variables for new vs. returning, freshman vs. sophomore, dependent vs.
  21 Degree completion measures are only available for students who entered the college as first-time, full-time, degree seeking

students. For community colleges, this group contains fewer than 40 percent of all students in an entry cohort on average.
Within CCA, the share of entering students for whom degree completion outcomes are reported is even smaller (roughly 25
percent).
  22 If a student does not complete the federal and CCA borrowing requirements or does not enroll in at least 6 credit hours

until after the scheduled disbursement date , their loan is disbursed within two days after these criteria are met.




                                                               8
independent, and with vs. without outstanding student loan debt.23

    Loan-eligible students assigned to the treatment group received a nonzero loan offer in their award letter,

while loan-eligible students assigned to the control group received a $0 offer.24 Figure 1 displays screen shots

from CCA’s web page showing the financial aid package, including examples of both treatment and control

student offers at the bottom of the page.25 These offers were pure nudges: they did not affect students’

eligibility for federal loans or the requirement that the student actively accept a nonzero loan (and complete

federal requirements) to obtain a loan. Figure 2 displays a screen shot of the online form that all CCA

students must fill out to obtain a loan.

    The amount of the loan offered to treatment-group students depended on the student’s class standing;

in keeping with CCA’s loan packaging practice in the prior year, treatment group freshmen received $3500

loan offers, while sophomores received $4500 offers. Students with unmet need exceeding these amounts

were offered the full amount as subsidized loans, while those with lower unmet need received a combination

of subsidized and unsubsidized loan offers in their award letters.26 Students in the control group were

informed of their eligibility for federal loans and the process for requesting a loan via email.27 CCA clearly

displayed information on student loan eligibility on its website, and all students that complete a FAFSA

receive information on their anticipated eligibility for Pell Grants and federal loans from the U.S. Department

of Education.
   23 Break points for stratification by EFC were determined within combination of the binary variables so as to roughly equate

the number of students per strata based on data from the two preceding years. A separate category was created for the
considerable number of students with a zero EFC, and the break points always included the $5198 threshold for Pell Grant
eligibility in the 2015-16 academic year.
   24 Students who were not eligible for loan aid did not have loan aid mentioned in the award letter, regardless of their assignment

to treatment or control groups.
   25 Among colleges that do not offer loans, some send award letters that do not mention student loans while others show “$0”

explicitly. CCA students in the control group with unmet need received award letters with an explicit $0 offer, while those
with no unmet need (who were still eligible for unsubsidized loans) received award letters that made no mention of loans. We
show in Appendix Figure A.1 that this distinction made no difference in the effect of treatment on loan take-up for either prior
borrowers (who presumably had some knowledge about federal loans) or students with no outstanding debt.
   26 Unfortunately, we do not observe the specific amount of subsidized and unsubsidized loans offered to treatment group

members, as we learned during the experiment that when a student accepts a loan, CCA’s information systems change the
amount in the “offer” field to the amount the student choose to accept. However, our measure of imputed subsidized loan
eligibility is strongly predictive of actual eligibility for the subset of students that take-up both subsidized and unsubsidized
loans (i.e., students for whom we can reliably measure actual subsidized loan eligibility) and we find no evidence of heterogeneous
treatment effects for students with and without subsidized loan eligibility.
   27 The email contained general information on federal student aid programs and a link to the online loan request form. The

paragraph relating to loan eligibility read as follows:

   “Based on the information provided to us, you have not been offered a student loan at this time. If you plan to enroll at
least half time (minimum of 6 credits hours) and have not yet reached the aggregate loan limit for undergraduate students, you
may request loan funds by completing the Loan Request Form. If you have additional questions please contact the Student
Financial Aid & Scholarships Office at ()  − ... If you do choose to request a loan, the Student Financial Aid
& Scholarships Office encourages you to borrow wisely as loan eligibility is limited and it is possible to lose all loan eligibility
before finishing your program.”




                                                                 9
3.2     Data and descriptive statistics

Our CCA experimental sample includes students who were randomly assigned before February 2, 2016.

Table 3 displays the characteristics of this group by treatment group assignment. We test for differences in

treatment and control group members’ class standing, past enrollment at CCA, dependency status, amount

of outstanding student loan debt, resources (EFC), Pell Grant aid, work study aid, other grant aid (i.e.,

federal non-Pell, state, and institutional grants), other resources (i.e., private and employer-provided aid),

baseline cumulative credits, and baseline cumulative GPA (for returning students). The first column displays

the control group mean and standard deviation (in parentheses) of each characteristic. The second column

displays the difference between the treatment-group mean and control-group mean and the standard error

of this difference (in parentheses). None of the differences in characteristics between treatment and control

groups are statistically significant. While this is to be expected for the variables in the first five rows,

which were used for stratification, the lack of any significant differences in the other rows provides additional

evidence that randomization was successful.

   CCA students who complete a FAFSA (and thus were eligible for random assignment) are quite similar to

FAFSA-completing community college students nationwide. Sixty-five percent of CCA students are classified

as freshmen and 59 percent are independent. Furthermore, the average CCA student has outstanding

student loans worth about $4,200 and a GPA of 2.67. Using data from the publicly available 2012 National

Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS), we estimate that 60 percent of community college students

nationwide were classified as freshman, 58 percent were independent, average outstanding debt was $4,400,

and the average GPA was 2.42 in 2012.28 The mean values of $6,769 EFC and Pell Grants worth $3,438 are

both about 50 percent higher than national averages, indicating that CCA students have a relatively high

dispersion of resources, with more low-EFC students that receive Pell Grants and more high-EFC students

that bring up the college average.


3.3     Empirical Framework

To examine the impact of nonzero loan offers on borrowing and attainment, we estimate ordinary least

squares (OLS) and instrument variables (IV) models:



                                                    Di = βTi + ηXi + νi                                      (1)


                                                    Yi = πDi + φXi + i                                      (2)
 28 Statistics   generated by PowerStats (https://nces.ed.gov/datalab/).




                                                               10
In equation (1), Di is a dummy variable equal to one if a nonzero loan was offered in the financial aid award

letter of student i, Ti is a dummy indicating assignment to the treatment group, and Xi includes a vector

of strata fixed effects and a linear term in student expected family contribution (EFC). To reduce residual

variation we include controls for cumulative credits earned and GPA at baseline as well as the month of

random assignment. OLS estimates of β will represent the extent to which CCA’s loan offers were correlated

with the randomly-assigned treatment status. Compliance with treatment was imperfect because students

who were assigned to the treatment group were not offered a loan if their past borrowing exceeded $20,000 or

if their financial aid package was completed after their enrollment decision and they had not enrolled in the

six credits necessary to be eligible for a loan. Given such discrepancies between treatment status and offer

status, we include among our estimates the “intent-to-treat” (ITT) effect of loan offers, i.e. the reduced-form

OLS estimates of the impact of treatment group assignment on these outcomes.

   We estimate the “treatment-on-the-treated” (TOT) impact of receiving a nonzero loan offer with instru-

mental variables (IV) models in which we instrument for receipt of a nonzero loan offer with assignment

to the treatment group. In this case, equation (2) represents the second stage. Estimates of the coefficient

π will represent the TOT effect of a nonzero loan offer on the borrowing or attainment outcome Yi . Even

if assignment to nonzero loan offers among students in the treatment group was not random, the use of

the treatment assignment dummy Ti as an instrument isolates variation in offers that was randomized. To

test for heterogeneous treatment effects, we jointly estimate IV models for each subgroup to allow for cross

equation correlation in error terms. In all analyses, standard errors are clustered by strata.

   We also use assignment to the treatment group as an instrument for loan take-up. This is because

increased borrowing, rather than the loan offer itself, is the most likely driver of changes in educational

attainment. We replace Di in equations (1) and (2) with a binary variable indicating borrowing. Estimates

produced by these models will represent ITT effects on attainment measures scaled by the impact of treatment

on loan take-up. Under the assumptions that (1) treatment only affects attainment through impacts on loan

take-up and (2) the borrowing response is monotonic, IV estimates will represent local average treatment

effects of loan take-up on attainment for students induced to borrow by the nudge (Imbens and Angrist

1994). The monotonicity assumption is satisfied by the theoretical model that best fits our data, which

we describe in Section 7. It should be noted, however, that nonzero loan offers could in theory have non-

monotonic effects on the amount borrowed. In Section 4, we provide evidence that nonzero offers increase

the probability of borrowing throughout the distribution of loan amounts, and the pattern of these effects

suggests minimal effects of the nudge on the intensive margin of borrowing. If nearly all responses occur on

the extensive margin then the IV estimates should closely approximate the local average treatment effect on

students induced to borrow. Neither assumption is required to interpret the unscaled ITT estimates.


                                                      11
3.4      Adjustments for multiple hypothesis testing

The outcomes we examine fall into two categories: borrowing and educational attainment. In the first

category, we consider two main measures - the probability of borrowing and the amount borrowed - which

are highly correlated. In the second category, we observe several measures of educational attainment in

the year of the experiment, including the number of credits attempted, credits earned, GPA, and credential

receipt. Testing for effects on multiple outcomes increases the likelihood of finding at least one estimate to

be statistically significantly different from zero when standard errors do not account for the fact that many

hypotheses are being tested.

    We address concerns over the multiple hypothesis testing in two ways. First, we generate a standardized

index of treatment effects following Finkelstein et al. (2012) and the online appendix of Kling et al. (2007).

This index represents the weighted average of the estimated treatment effect for each separate outcome,

jointly estimated via seemingly unrelated regression, with weights equal to the inverse of the standard

deviation of the specific outcome in the control group. Standard errors are calculated using the delta method.

Second, for each separate attainment outcome, we calculate familywise p-values using the Westfall and Young

(1993) free stepdown procedure.29 The significance of estimated effects on the standardized treatment index

will provide evidence of whether the family of null hypotheses relating to individual attainment outcomes can

be rejected, whereas the familywise p-values will allow us to determine which, if any, attainment outcomes

contribute the most to the significance of treatment effects on the index.



4      Effects of Nonzero Loan Offers on Borrowing

Figures 3 through 6 provide a visual preview of our estimated impacts on borrowing outcomes. In Figure

3, each bar represents the probability of borrowing for students who were assigned to receive a nonzero

loan offer (“treatment group” members) and those assigned to receive a $0 offer (“control group” members).

Vertical capped lines represent 95 percent confidence intervals. Students in the treatment group were 7

percentage points more likely to borrow, a 30 percent increase relative to the control group borrowing rate of

23 percent. Figure 4 displays the probability that treatment and control group members borrowed the exact
  29 Thisprocedure involves four steps, described below.
  Step 1: For each attainment outcome k = 1, ..., 4, we calculate the p-value pk from the test of the hypothesis β k = 0 from
equation (1); we order the labeling of these outcomes such that p1 represents the smallest p-value and p4 is the largest p-
value. Step 2: We draw N = 10, 000 random samples of observations with replacement (drawing proportionately from random
assignment strata), with treatment status assigned randomly so as to impose the null. For each sample i we calculate pki ,
                                                                                                                 
the p-value from the test of the null for outcome k. We then compute the adjusted sample p-value qki = min pik , ..., pi4 .
Step 3: For each outcome k, we calculate the share of random samples for which the p-value generated from the original data
                                                 N 
                                             1
                                                 P
exceeds the adjusted sample p-value: p̄k =   N
                                                       1 qki ≤ pk . Step 4: The final familywise p-value for each outcome k is
                                                i=1
p̃k = max p̄1 , ..., p̄k .



                                                                12
amount that was included or would have been included in the award letter if the student were assigned to

the treatment group ($P = $3500 for students with “freshman” status and $4500 for those with “sophomore”

status). A significantly greater percentage of treatment group borrowers took up the exact amount offered

compared to control group members (11 versus 7 percent, respectively).

    Next, we compare how the amount borrowed responded to treatment group assignment (Figure 5),

looking across all students (Panel A) and students who borrowed (Panel B). Treatment group members

borrow approximately $280 more than control group members, a 26 percent increase from the control group

mean. However, once we condition on loan take-up, control group borrowers take on higher debt than

students assigned to the treatment group (an approximately 5 percent increase from the treatment group

mean amount of $4551). The reduction in the amount borrowed by treatment group borrowers is consistent

with the mechanism described in Marx and Turner (forthcoming), whereby an offer of $0 generates a fixed

cost of borrowing. Control group students will only pay the fixed cost of borrowing if their desired amount

is sufficiently greater than their offer of $0, while treatment group students whose desired amount is only

somewhat greater than $0 may be induced to accept this small amount.

    We further explore how borrowing decisions are influenced by loan offers by comparing the distributions

of loans taken up by borrowers in the treatment and control groups. We recenter the actual amount borrowed

around $P, again defined as the amount students would have been offered had they been assigned to the

treatment group ($3500 for freshmen, $4500 for sophomores). Panel A of Figure 6 displays the distributions

of amounts borrowed by students in the treatment and control groups, represented by light blue and dark

blue bars, respectively. Assignment to the treatment group increases the likelihood of borrowing at almost

every point in the distribution. However, students who received a nonzero offer are substantially more likely

to borrow exactly the amount they were offered, suggesting that the offered amount serves as a reference

point for at least some portion of students.30 This finding is confirmed in Panel B. Dark bars represent

the unconditional share of students in the control group who borrowed amounts within $500 bins centered

around $P, solid circles represent the control mean plus estimated treatment effect of nonzero loan receipt,

and the vertical capped line indicates the corresponding 95 percent confidence interval. While nonzero offers

significant increase the probability of borrowing amounts both above and below $P by 0.4 to 0.9 percentage

points, the estimated 2 percentage point increase in the probability of borrowing exactly $P is substantially

larger in magnitude, representing an increase of approximately 115 percent relative to the control group

mean.
  30 We observe heaping at $500 intervals in both the treatment and control groups. Even in the control group, such heaping is

especially pronounced at $P because this amount corresponds to the maximum subsidized loan for students with unmet need
of at least $P. However, when we limit our sample to students whose subsidized loan eligibility falls below $P, we only observe
excess bunching at $P in the treatment group (Appendix Figure A.2).




                                                              13
4.1    Nonzero loan offers increase borrowing

We formally estimate the impact of treatment assignment and nonzero loan offers on borrowing outcomes

using OLS and IV models. The first column of Panel B in Table 4 displays “first-stage” estimates of the

effect of assignment to the treatment group on the probability of receiving a nonzero loan offer. Treatment

group assignment increased the probability of being offered a nonzero loan by 81 percentage points. The fact

that most students assigned to the treatment group were in fact treated with a nonzero loan offer allows for

precise estimates of impacts on borrowing outcomes.

   Given the imperfect compliance with treatment assignment, we use IV models to generate TOT estimates

of the effect of loan offers on students’ borrowing decisions, as described in Section 3.3. As shown in Panel

C of Table 4, receipt of a nonzero loan offer resulted in a 9 percentage point increase in the probability of

borrowing. This response represents a 39 percent increase in borrowing relative to control students’ mean

borrowing rate of 23 percent. Furthermore, a nonzero loan offer increased the average amount borrowed

(including zeroes) by $348 (a 32 percent increase relative to the control group mean). Both estimates are

statistically significant at the 1 percent level.


4.2    Heterogeneity

We test whether receipt of a nonzero loan offer had heterogeneous impacts across different student subgroups.

Most community colleges serve a diverse student body that includes both traditional and nontraditional

students from a variety of family backgrounds. Given the one-size-fits-all approach to loan packaging taken by

most community colleges, it is important to understand whether the effects on CCA students are generalizable

to schools with different student bodies. We focus on subgroups defined by past experience of borrowing (any

outstanding debt versus no outstanding debt), student resources (Pell Grant eligible versus ineligible), prior

CCA enrollment (new versus returning), class standing (freshman versus sophomore status), and dependency

status. To do so, we jointly estimate estimate IV models for each separate subgroup. Table 5 contains these

results.

   Across all subgroups, a nonzero loan offer significantly increased the probability of borrowing and the

unconditional amount borrowed. We can reject the hypothesis of equal impacts of nonzero loan offers on

borrowing and the amount borrowed across all subgroups (p < 0.001). The largest differences between

subgroups arise when splitting the sample according to whether a student had borrowed in the past. Loan

offers increased borrowing by 12 percentage points and $539 among students with outstanding loan debt

compared to only 6 percentage points and $185 among students with no outstanding debt. However, relative

to loan take-up among control group members for past borrowers (39 percent) and nonborrowers (10 percent),



                                                     14
the estimated increase in loan take-up for students without outstanding debt represents a larger increase in

percentage terms.

    Loan offers also generate significantly different effects by dependency status and Pell Grant eligibility.

Pell Grant eligible students’ loan take-up is more responsive to nonzero loan offers than that of ineligible

students (p = 0.045). The nudge also led independent students to borrow significantly greater amounts than

students classified as dependents (p = 0.003), an effect that is likely driven by the higher borrowing limits

for independent students. We find no evidence of significantly different impacts of nonzero loan offers on

conditional borrowing or borrowing exactly $P (i.e., $3500 for freshmen and $4500 for sophomores) along

any of these dimensions.



5     Impacts on Attainment

We first test whether nonzero loan offers affected the likelihood that CCA applicants enrolled in fall 2015,

the semester of the intervention. As shown in Figure 7, 72 percent of students assigned to the control group

enrolled in fall courses compared to 71 percent of students in the treatment group. IV estimates of the

impact of receiving a nonzero loan offer on enrollment produce precisely estimated null effects. For instance,

the 95 percent confidence interval excludes effects larger than a 1 percent increase in enrollment and a 4

percent decrease in enrollment.31 Because we do not observe loan take-up by applicants who do not enroll,

and given that enrollment is balanced across treatment and control groups, we limit the sample of students

used to estimate attainment effects to students who enrolled in at least one course. We further limit our

sample to exclude students who received their financial aid packages after October 15, 2015 (N = 1843),

which is the approximate drop/add deadline for the fall semester. This restriction is meant to focus our

attention on students who could have adjusted their credit hours in response to the loan offer, although our

results are robust to including the dropped students.32

    We observe attainment outcomes for the 2015-16 academic year including credits attempted, credits

earned, GPA, degree receipt, and the standardized treatment index constructed from all four of these vari-

ables. Control group means and standard deviations are displayed in Panel A of Table 6. We examine

the effect of treatment group assignment and being offered a loan on these outcomes (Panels B and C, re-

spectively) and then estimate the achievement gains experienced by students who were induced to increase

borrowing by the nudge of a nonzero loan offer (Panel D).
  31 We also test for heterogeneous effects of loan offers on enrollment within the 10 subgroups examined in Table 5. As shown

in Appendix Table A.1, only one of the 10 point estimates is significant (p < 0.05) and we can reject the test of joint significance
across subgroups (p = 0.482).
  32 Appendix Table A.2 shows that characteristics of the treatment and control groups are balanced in this restricted sample.

In this sample the first stage coefficient is 0.835 with standard error of 0.033 and F statistic of 640.



                                                                15
    As shown in Panel A, students assigned to the treatment group experienced significant increases in their

attainment. The significance of these estimates is not due to the fact that we examine multiple measures of

educational attainment; impacts on the standardized treatment index are significant at the 1 percent level.

Familywise p-values, displayed in brackets below the point estimates and cluster-robust standard errors, show

that impacts on credits earned and GPAs remain significant at the 5 and 10 percent levels, respectively, after

accounting for the familywise error rate. However, estimated impacts on credits attempted are no longer

significant at conventional levels, and effects on degree receipt remain small and insignificant.

    Estimated impacts of nonzero loan offers on attainment outcomes are quite similar to ITT estimates of

the effect of treatment assignment (Panel B). Since loan offers only affected a subset of students’ borrowing

decisions, it is not surprising that nonzero offers are associated with relatively small changes in educational

attainment. The IV estimates in Panel C scale these effects by the number of students who were induced to

borrow by the nudge (compliers). On average, compliers took up a loan of approximately $4000. Borrowing

leads to a statistically significant (p < 0.05) 2.5 increase in credits attempted over the academic year.

Impacts on credits earned are even larger; nudge-induced borrowing led to gains of 3.7 credits earned over

the academic year (p < 0.05). Finally, borrowing also increased course performance. Students induced to

take-up a loan earned significantly higher GPAs in each semester, with a cumulative increase of over 0.6 GPA

points (p < 0.01). Borrowing did not increase the likelihood of degree receipt by the end of the academic

year. This finding is not surprising given that most students in our sample were more than one year of

full-time attendance away from completing their degree programs.33

    As with the borrowing outcomes, we test for heterogeneous effects of borrowing on educational attainment

over the 2015-16 academic year (Table 7). Column (1) contains the average loan amount for students in the

specific subgroup who were induced to borrow by the nudge, as this amount varies across groups. When

it comes to impacts of nudge-induced borrowing on academic outcomes, there is only one case in which

the estimates for the subgroups on the two sides of each binary distinction are statistically distinguishable.

Estimated impacts on the standardized treatment index significantly exceed zero for a number of subgroups,

but as a whole, we cannot reject the hypothesis that treatment effects are jointly insignificant across all

subgroups (p = 0.273).34

    We estimate impacts on on three attainment outcomes in year following the intervention (2016-17):
  33 Approximately   96 percent of CCA students in the experimental sample were pursing associate degrees that required 60 to
70 credits. Most had accumulated fewer than 30 at the start of the fall 2015 semester. Only a quarter of the sample started
the fall semester with at least 40 credits.
  34 We also test for heterogeneity by degree program. Specifically, we compare students pursing an academic associate degree

(e.g., Associate of Arts, Associate of Science; hereafter AA) that is designed for students who wish to transfer their first
two-years of liberal arts coursework to a four-year institution to students pursing a terminal vocational associate degree (e.g.,
Associate of Applied Science, Associate of Applied Business, Associate of Technical Studies; hereafter AAS), excluding the
small number of students in certificate programs. Treatment effects for students pursuing different associate degree programs
are not statistically distinguishable (Appendix Table A.3).



                                                               16
reenrollment in CCA, transfers to a four-year public institution, and degree receipt.35 We observe transfers

and degree receipt using data from the National Student Clearinghouse (NSC). As shown in Table 8, nudge-

induced borrowing led to a 12 percentage point (23 percent) drop in reenrollment at CCA in the 2016-17

academic. We find a similarly-sized positive impacts on transfers into bachelor’s degree programs within

four-year public institutions. Given the relatively low rate of transfers from CCA into four-year public

institutions, the statistically significant 11.4 percentage point increase in the probability of transfer represents

a 178 percent increase relative to the control group mean. Borrowing induced by the nudge did not generate

statistically significant increases in degree receipt for the average student. Although statistically insignificant,

the 2.3 percentage point increase represents a gain of 11 percent relative to the control group mean.



6     Cost-Benefit Analysis

To contextualize our findings, we compare costs and benefits of nonzero loan offers. We do so from the

perspective of the government and then from the perspective of the student. Loans appear beneficial from

both perspectives based on observed attainment effects.

    We compare our estimates to impacts of other RCTs targeting community college students’ attainment,

including the City University of New York (CUNY) Accelerated Study in Associate Programs (ASAP) and the

Performance-Based Scholarship interventions. Both interventions involved student-level random assignment

and were evaluated by MDRC. CUNY community college students assigned to the ASAP program were

subject to a suite of requirements, additional supports, and financial assistance.36 The long-run effects

of the ASAP program included a doubling of the likelihood of graduation within three years of program

entry (Scrivener et al. 2015), while early impacts included a significant increase of 2.1 credits earned per

semester (Scrivener et al. 2012). These gains can be compared to an estimated annual cost of $3900 per

student per year, suggesting an annual increase of 1.1 credits earned per $1000 (Scrivener et al. 2015).

The Performance-Based Scholarship (PBS) Demonstration was implemented at several community colleges

nationwide. Students were randomly assigned to be eligible to earn up to $1500 per semester in incentive

payments if they met specific academic goals.37 At the most successful PBS site, treatment group members

earned significantly more credits than control group members, with first-year impacts of approximately 1

additional credit per $1000 of program expenditures (Barrow et al. 2014).
  35 Within CCA, attainment effects remain positive, but we can no longer obtain unbiased estimates of effects on earned credits

or grades because students select out of CCA based on assignment to the treatment group.
  36 Specifically, students were required to enroll in at least 12 credits per semester (the threshold for full-time attendance),

attend special seminars and engage in intensive advising. Students received a tuition waiver to cover unmet need, free use of
textbooks, and subsidies for transportation expenses. Students in the program took block scheduled classes and had support
to take winter and summer semester courses. See Scrivener et al. (2015) for additional details.
  37 The specific population eligible for participation and the structure and size of incentives varied across experimental sites.

See Mayer et al. (2015) for additional details.


                                                               17
    Our estimated effect of 3.7 additional credits for each $4000 of loan aid translates into approximately 0.9

credits earned per $1000 outlay, which is comparable to the magnitude of estimated effects from the ASAP

and PBS programs. However, in our setting, the additional $1000 is lent to the student rather than spent.

Long-run costs to colleges and government may be substantially lower if the additional loan aid is repaid.

If we assume that students induced to borrow by the experimental nudge will default on their loans at the

same rate as other CCA borrowers, the federal government’s expected cost per $4000 loan is $444. This

suggests a cost-benefit ratio of 8.1 additional credits per $1000, far exceeding the short-run returns of ASAP

and PBS.38

    We also assess whether borrowing is financially beneficial for students by describing the financial trade-off

implied by the observed effects on borrowing and educational attainment. Making such a comparison requires

translating the attainment gains into financial terms. For the returns to credit completion within CCA, we

use estimates from Jepsen et al. (2014), who use an individual fixed-effects approach to estimate the effect of

community college credits and credentials on earnings and employment for two cohorts of students enrolling

in the Kentucky Community & Technical College System.39 For enrollment in a four-year public institution,

we use estimates from Zimmerman (2014), who uses a regression discontinuity design to estimate effects of

admission to a four-year public institution that acts as a substitute for community colleges.

    Implied earnings effects are substantial. Jepsen et al. (2014) estimate that for students who do not earn

a credential, each additional credit generates a $5.60 to $14 increase in quarterly earnings (in 2008 dollars).

Applying the estimates of Jepsen et al. (2014) according to the gender mix of compliers within CCA, a

student induced to take up a $4000 unsubsidized loan by the experimental nudge would see annual earnings

increase by $169 (in 2016 dollars). Zimmerman (2014) estimates that admission to a four-year institution

that acts as a substitute for community colleges increases annual earnings by 22 percent, or $1593 (in 2005

dollars). Based on these estimates, the 10 percentage-point increase in enrollment at 4-year institutions

implies an annual earnings increase of $198 (in 2016 dollars). Thus, we project the combined earnings effects

of the nudge to be roughly $370 per year per student, on average.

    If the earnings effects begin five years after loan receipt and grow at a nominal rate of 3 percent over a

30-year career, and if students repay loans at the interest rate of 4.29 percent that applied to loans made in

2015-16, then the loans are financially beneficial if future cash flows are discounted at any rate below 12.4

percent. Because roughly half of the earnings gains are due to credit accumulation, the ex-post break-even
  38 CCA has a 23 percent three-year cohort default rate. We assume that all defaulters do so immediately and make no

payments on their loan and that otherwise, borrowers enter into the standard 10-year repayment plan and face a 5 percent
interest rate. The average interest earned on a $4000 unsubsidized loan over the repayment period would be $880 and thus, the
expected value of interest received given the risk of default is $678. The average cost of default is $4880, while the expected
cost of default per $4000 loan is $1122. Thus, the federal government’s expected net cost of a $4000 loan is $444. Given that a
$4000 loan buys 3.6 additional credits, we estimate that the experimental nudge produces 8.1 additional credits per $1000.
  39 An earlier study finds similar effects for an older population of displaced, high tenure workers (Jacobson et al. 2005).

rate would be roughly half as large for students who experience average gains in credits completed but whose

four-year enrollment is unaffected. Thus, the induced borrowing is almost certainly beneficial to students on

average, and it appears likely that the majority of students benefit.



7     The Nature of the Nudge

To infer the welfare effects of the nudge, it is necessary to distinguish between potential channels through

which offered loans affect behavior and whether the response to the nudge may defy standard models of

rational choice (Bernheim and Rangel 2009; Handel 2013; Allcott and Kessler 2015; Allcott and Taubinsky

2015). We consider four potential mechanisms across models and provide evidence on their relevance using

the observed distribution of loan amounts among the treatment and control groups.40

    Two models are fully consistent with rational choice. First, students may be uncertain of the existence of

or their eligibility for federal loans, and it may be costly to obtain this information. In the presence of such

information costs, a nonzero offer reduces or eliminates the expected cost by providing a signal that increases

the belief that loans are available. Second, students may consider the offered amount a recommendation,

causing a student’s belief about the optimal loan amount to update toward the offered amount, generating

anchoring of loan amounts.41

    Two behavioral models of potential relevance are inattention and default bias (Madrian and Shea 2001;

Thaler and Sunstein 2003). Bernheim et al. (2015) “distinguish between the status quo, which determines

the outcome if the worker fails to attend, and the default, which determines which outcomes require effort.”

In our setting, the decision-maker is the student, and if the student doesn’t expend the effort to complete a

loan application then she receives no loan. This implies a default loan amount of $0. The offered amount

has no effect on the default loan amount, and hence both the treatment and control group might exhibit

default bias toward borrowing $0. Thus, default bias would not explain the treatment-control difference

in borrowing, and we do not attempt to estimate its role. Similarly, a status quo bias toward the amount

borrowed in the previous year would not vary across treatment and control groups. However, if the student

fails to attend to the options for borrowing then she may simply choose the offered amount. This inattention

toward options other than the offered amount could induce the observed effects on borrowing.

    We examine a model that allows for information costs, inattention, and default bias. In Appendix C, we

examine anchoring as an alternative model and show that its empirical predictions are not consistent with

our findings. Evidence against anchoring is also provided by a separate experiment at a college in which all
  40 The analyses described in this section were not included in our pre-analysis plan.
  41 Alternatively,
                  anchoring could arise if the offered amount generates an endowment effect at the reference point established
by the offer.

students were offered a loan (Marx and Turner 2017). In this experiment, references to amounts borrowed

by recent graduates affected loan take-up, but treated students were no more likely to borrow the suggested

amounts than students who were not given an explicit reference point.

   Consider a utility function U (`|T ), where ` is the chosen loan amount and T is an indicator for treatment

with an offer of $P . When T = 0 the offered amount is $0. Let the utility function have the form


                                       α
                U (`|T ) = − (` − `∗ ) − T ca 1 [` 6= P ] 1 [` 6= 0] − (cd + (1 − T ) (ci + ca )) 1 [` 6= 0] ,


where `∗ ∈ R is the latent desired loan amount, ` ≥ 0 is the amount borrowed, ca ≥ 0 is the cost of attending

to options other than the offered amount, cd > 0 is the cost of deviating from the default of zero, ci > 0 is

the information cost of discovering availability of federal loans, and α ∈ {2, 4, 6, ...}.42 Such preferences can

be obtained as the reduced form of a model in which latent borrowing demand is determined by the chosen

amount of educational investment. Optimal loan amounts will take following form (without specifying a

choice at points of indifference):

   In this model, treatment with a loan offer of $P can increase the number of borrowers in two ways.

First, inattentive students with `∗ ≤ 0 may be induced to borrow by going along with the offered amount in

the award letter if ca is sufficiently large. Second, students with `∗ > 0 may not borrow when not treated,

either by inattentively following the $0 offer or because information costs are large enough to prevent them

from borrowing. We assess two empirical predictions that offer tests for information costs and inattention,

respectively.

   Property 1: If Pr ` ∈ 0, P2 |T = 0 < Pr ` ∈ 0, P2 |T = 1 then there are students with `∗ ∈ 0, P2

such students we can focus on the choice between ` = 0 and ` = `∗ . U (0|T = 0) = − (`∗ ) = U (0|T = 1),

of Crawford and Sobel (1982).

i.e. the utility obtained from ` = 0 does not depend on treatment status, but U (`∗ |T = 0) = −cd − ca − ci

and U (`∗ |T = 1) = −cd − ca . Treatment raises the utility obtained from choosing ` = `∗ and increases the

probability that it is chosen only if some of these students have ci > 0.

   Property 1 shows that we can obtain evidence on the existence of information costs by examining whether

the treatment group exhibits more mass than the control group for ` ∈ 0, P2 . Experimental evidence is
                                                                               

provided in Figure 8, which plots the distribution of loan amounts by class level. Among both freshmen

and sophomores (for whom P differs), we find more treatment-group students than control-group students
                                            P
choosing loans in amounts between 0 and     2   . If we estimate IV models we find that treatment increases the

likelihood of borrowing such amounts by 2.1 percentage points (p < 0.001) for all students. This evidence

implies that the treatment effects on borrowing cannot be driven entirely by inattention; information costs

must be at play.

   Two additional observations about this property are noteworthy. First, it should be noted that not all

models predict a positive treatment effect on small amounts of loans. In Appendix Appendix C we show

that the anchoring model predicts a negative effect on the probability of borrowing some amounts near $P

in our setting, contrary to what we observe (Figure 6, Panel B). Second, it should be noted that it is the

symmetry around `∗ in our parametric model that makes ` =           P
                                                                    2   the focal point of this prediction. More

generally, the argument will hold for the smallest loan amounts as long as the loss from borrowing less than

`∗ is not too much greater than the loss from borrowing more than `∗ , and this will be true for a wider range

of ` values if cd is large. We observe positive treatment effects throughout ` ∈ (0, P ).

   Property 2: Consider δ > 0. If, for all students with `∗ ∈ (P − δ, P + δ), if ca = 0, then when T=1, if

`∗ 6= P then ` 6= P .
                                                         α                  α                      α
   Proof: From the solution above, ` = P when (`∗ ) + ca > (`∗ − P ) + cd ∩ ca > (`∗ − P ) . If ca = 0,
                                α
then this requires 0 > (`∗ − P ) . The right-hand side of this expression is uniquely minimized to zero when

`∗ = P , and so for no other value of `∗ can it be that ` = P .

   Property 2 shows that we can test for the existence of inattention by examining whether the treatment

group exhibits excess mass at ` = P . If students behave as if there is no cost to attending to options

other than the offered amount then we should not see a spike in the distribution of loans at the offered

amount. Figure 5 shows that we do see such a spike. Treatment leads to a 2 percentage-point increase in the

probability of borrowing $P (p < 0.001) among all students, and a 3.7 percentage point increase (p < 0.001)

among borrowers. Among treated students, the number borrowing exactly ` = P is equal to or greater than

the number borrowing any amount in a $500 bin above or below P . For this pattern to be consistent with

Property 2, there would need to be a mass of students with `∗ = P . This possibility seems unlikely except

for the fact that for some students P corresponds to the maximum subsidized loan. However, when we limit


                                                        21
the sample to students who are ineligible for the maximum subsidized loan, the excess mass of students at

P in the treatment group remains (Appendix Figure A.2). We conclude that the effect of the nudge on

amounts borrowed cannot be driven entirely by information costs and must instead involve some degree of

inattention.

    Property 3: Assume ci + ca > 0. For all students, if ` > 0 when T = 0 then ` > 0 when T = 1.

    Proof: From the solution above, for a treated student to not borrow when treated it is necessary that
          α                                    α                           α
cd ≥ (`∗ ) . If ci + ca > 0 then cd ≥ (`∗ ) ⇒ cd + ci + ca > (`∗ ) , which implies that the student does not

borrow when not treated.

    Property 3 shows that this model implies a monotonic, positive effect of treatment on the dummy variable

1 (` > 0). Under such monotonicity, a combination of sample moments identifies the average characteristics

of always-takers (those who borrow regardless of their loan offer), compliers (those who are induced to take-

up a loan when receiving a nonzero offer), and never-takers (those who do not borrow regardless of their

loan offer) (Abadie 2003).43 If the cost borrowing includes an information cost, we would expect this cost

to be decreasing in past borrowing and/or schooling experience. If this is the case then compliers for the

outcome of 1 [` > 0] will be newer students and will have less experience with student loans.

    Complier characteristics are consistent with the existence of information costs. Table 9 displays estimates

of the characteristics of students according to how their decision of whether to borrow responds to the nudge.

Always-takers are significantly more likely to have borrowed in the past compared with compliers (73 versus

63 percent, respectively, with p < 0.1) and are significantly less likely to be new to CCA (19 versus 29

percent, respectively, with p < 0.1). Among returning students, compliers are the group with the lowest

baseline (consistent with either information or attention costs decreasing in ability), though the differences

between groups are not statistically significant.

    Property 4: For all students with ci = 0 and `∗ > 0 ∩ `∗ 6= P , if ` = `∗ , when T = 1 then ` = `∗ when

T = 0.

    Proof: From the solution above, for a treated student to choose ` = `∗ when treated it is necessary that
                α                                                           α
cd + ca < (`∗ ) . Because ci = 0, this implies cd + ci + ca < (`∗ ) , which implies that the student chooses

` = `∗ when not treated.

    Property 4 allows us to bound the share of the treatment effect on the borrowing rate that is due to
  43 As shown in Abadie (2003), mean characteristics for each group can be constructed using combinations of sample mo-
ments. Let πAT , πN T , and πC represent the share of students that are always-takers, never-takers, and compliers, re-
spectively, and B the probability of taking-up a loan. As in equation 1, T indicates assignment to the treatment group.
Then πAT = Pr (B = 1|T = 0) and πN T = Pr (B = 0|T = 1). Under the assumption that assignment to the treatment
group weakly increases the probability of borrowing for all students, πC = 1 − πAT − πN T . For any characteristic X,
E [X|C] = (1−π 1−π ) {((1 − πN T ) E[X|B = 1, T = 1]) − (πAT E[X|B = 1, T = 0])}, E [X|AT ] = E [X|B = 1, T = 0], and
                 AT    NT
E [X|N T ] = E [X|B = 0, T = 1] . We estimate sample analogues for each of these terms and test for significant differences in
characteristics across groups using the delta method.




                                                             22
information costs. This property notes that the information cost generates a positive treatment effect on

loan amounts other than P , whereas we would only see a reduction in the share borrowing such amounts

if students were only influenced by inattention, as some of these students would be induced to borrow P

when treated. The treatment effect is 0.02 for ` = P and 0.07 for other positive amounts. If we assume that

all students induced to choose ` = P would have chosen ` = 0 when not treated, then the information cost

explains 78 percent of the impact of the nudge on loan take-up. If we instead assume that all students induced

to choose ` = P would have chosen some other positive amount when not treated, then the information cost

explains 100 percent of the treatment effect on loan take-up.

    Welfare analysis is generally difficult when people exhibit behavioral biases. Bernheim and Rangel (2009)

propose a framework for behavioral welfare analysis in which one option is deemed better for an individual

than another if, among her choices that are considered relevant, she consistently chooses the first option.

If the cost of attending to borrowing options was paramount then we might consider all choices relevant,

implying ambiguity in whether students would prefer to borrow or not because there is a set of students who

do not consistently choose the same option. However, choices are not considered relevant if the individual

does not understand her options. Given our evidence for the information-cost mechanism, students who

are not offered a loan do not appear to understand their options, and thus the compliers are students who

prefer to borrow when they understand their options. Welfare effects of a nonzero offer would therefore

appear to be positive for at least 78 percent of those induced to borrow. This conclusion could be reversed

by other behavioral biases that we have not modeled, such as if present-biased students take out loans that

are harmful to them in the long run, but our cost-benefit calculations suggest that the average student who

borrows only when offered a loan is in fact made financially better off.

    We conclude that the loan offer nudge appears to affect borrowing through a combination of student

inattention and misperception about loan availability. Information costs associated with learning about loan

availability can explain at least 78 percent of the effect of the nudge on loan take-up, while bunching at the

offered amount shows that inattention also affects borrowing. These results can help guide future work on

welfare analysis and the question of why students, and individuals more generally, respond to certain nudges.



8     Conclusion

We experimentally test the effect of student loan nudges on community college students’ borrowing decisions.

Randomly assigned nonzero loan offers generated a 40 percent increase in the probability of borrowing. Stu-

dents induced to borrow by the nudge earned 3.7 additional credits and improved their GPAs by 0.6 points in

the year of the intervention, on average. In the following academic year, nudge-induced borrowing generated


                                                     23
a 10 percentage point (178 percent) increase in transfers to four-year public institutions. We estimate that

nonzero loan offers increase short-run attainment of community college students by substantially more per

expected dollar of government expenditure than other interventions that have been evaluated with exper-

iments. We cannot conclude that offering a nonzero loan is welfare-enhancing for every student, but we

project that the average responder benefits financially from borrowing, even with a discount rate as high as

12 percent. Using a simple theoretical model that allows for inattention, information costs, and default bias,

we provide evidence on the channels through which nonzero offers affect student behavior. The pattern of

responses to the nudge suggests that 78 percent of the response of loan take-up is driven by a reduction in

information costs, suggesting that nonzero offers improve most students’ welfare.

   Our findings are relevant for colleges, policymakers, and future research on the effects of nudges. Over

5 million students attend U.S. colleges that do not offer loans in financial aid award letters and nearly one

million more attend colleges that do not participate in federal loan programs. Our findings suggest that

offering loans to students enrolled in these colleges could generate substantial attainment increases. We also

show that nudges can affect behavior by communicating information in a way that is more salient than other

methods used to communicate the same information. Students appear to benefit substantially from clear

communication of the opportunity to borrow at the point in time when they are making borrowing decisions,

and thus should be made aware of their choice set. At the same time, choosing well within this set also

requires knowledge of expected costs and benefits. Future research could examine how to help each student

obtain an amount of loan aid that best serves his or her needs.

                  Notes: CCA borrowers randomly assigned before February 2, 2016. In both panels, the amount borrowed is recentered around
                  the amount a student would have received had they been assigned to the treatment group ($3500 for freshmen and $4500 for
                  sophomores). Panel A displays the number of students taking-up loans within the specified $500 bin. Panel B displays the
                  control group mean unconditional probability of borrowing within the specified $500 bin, the estimated effect of nonzero offer
                  receipt on the unconditional probability of borrowing within the specified bin, and the corresponding 95 percent confidence
                  interval. Treatment effects are estimated via 2SLS where assignment to treatment group serves as an instrument for receipt of
                  a nonzero loan offer.

Notes: Two-year public schools participating in Title IV federal student aid programs. Panel A measures from 2014-15 IPEDS
institutional characteristics file. Dollar amounts for experimental sites rounded to nearest $100 to preserve confidentiality. Cost
of attendance is equal to the sum of in-district tuition and fees and the estimated cost of books and supplies, off campus housing,
and other living expenses. Panel B measures from 2013-14 IPEDS for all students except the last measure (percent of students
that are first generation college students), which comes from the College Scorecard data and pools 2013-14 and 2014-15 cohorts.
FTE = full-time equivalent enrollment. Enrollment for experimental sites is rounded to nearest 100 and percent measures are
rounded to the nearest 5 to preserve confidentiality. Panel C measures from the College Scorecard data. The percent of students
graduating within 150% of the expected time to degree is measured using first-time, full-time, degree-seeking undergraduates
who entered college in fall 2010 and fall 2011. The percent of students with earnings and the percent of students earning more
than $25,000 10 years after entry are measured for federal aid recipients who were not enrolled 10 years after college entry,
belonging to the 2001-02 and 2002-03 entry cohorts. Earnings measured in 2012 and 2013, adjusted for inflation and reported
in constant 2015$. Median salary is reported for students with earnings who received federal student aid in college and were not
enrolled 10 years after college entry, belonging to the 2001-02 and 2002-03 entry cohorts. Percent measures for experimental
sites rounded to nearest 5 and median salary for experimental sites rounded to nearest $1000 to preserve confidentiality. Panel D
cohort default rate comes from the official three-year federal cohort default rate for students who entered repayment in FY2013.
Borrowers are considered to have defaulted if they have not made payments on their federal loans for 270 days. Median debt
from College Scorecard data and pools students entering repayment in 2014 and 2015. The percentage paying down their loan
balance is from College Scorecard data and represents the share of students who entered repayment in FY2007 and FY 2008
who were not in default and had reduced their loan balance 7 years after entering repayment. Experimental site measures
rounded to nearest 5 (percent measures) or nearest $100 to preserve confidentiality.

Notes: CCA borrowers randomly assigned before February 2, 2016 who were ineligible for subsidized loans based on imputed
unmet need. Amount borrowed recentered around the amount a student would have received had they been assigned to the
treatment group ($3500 for freshmen and $4500 for sophomores). Light blue bars represent treatment group borrowers and
dark blue bars represent control group borrowers.

nonzero loan on Fall 2015 enrollment, estimated separately for each specified subgroup. Assignment to treatment serves as
an instrument for receipt of a nonzero loan offer. Brackets contain p-values from a test of the equality of prior two subgroup
estimates. Robust standard errors, clustered by strata, in parentheses; ** p<0.01, * p<0.05, + p<0.1. All regressions include
controls for strata, randomization month, and baseline cumulative credits and cumulative GPA.

Appendix B: Community College B Experiment

In this appendix, we describe the setting and design of the experiment that took place at Community College

B (CCB). We then present preliminary estimates of the impact of loan offers on borrowing and attainment

(fall semester enrollment and credits attempted).



B.1 CCB Experiment Design

In the year prior to the intervention (2014-15), CCB students were not offered loan aid. CCB only provides

financial aid packages to students after they have registered for courses and sends students hard-copies of their

financial aid package via mail. In addition to federal requirements (i.e., entrance counseling and completion

of a master promissory note), CCB students who wish to borrow must complete several additional steps.

These include filling out a budget, determining their expected future salary upon graduation and calculating

estimated loan payments, and attending a one-on-one meeting with a college counselor.44

    For the intervention, CCB’s financial aid office offered students assigned to the treatment group their

maximum subsidized loan and no unsubsidized loans. CCB students without subsidized loan eligibility were

not included in the experimental sample. Offers continued to be made via paper award letters that were

mailed to students (Figure B.1). Students in the control group did not receive an additional communications

from CCB on their loan eligibility, although the school’s financial aid website contained general information

on federal loan programs.

    CCB underperformed in terms of expected sample size. Based on past enrollment of degree-seeking

students, we projected a sample size of roughly 8,000 students. However, the surprisingly small number

of CCB students who completed a FAFSA and were eligible for subsidized loans reduced the number of

students eligible to be included in random assignment to 2,221. At present time, we only observe borrowing

outcomes for 2,102 of these students. As shown in Table B.1, predetermined characteristics are balanced

between CCB treatment and control groups.



B.2 Results

As shown in Table B.2, only 74 percent of treatment group members received a loan offer. The estimated

effect of a nonzero loan offer on the likelihood of borrowing is small and statistically insignificant. However,

the corresponding 95 percent confidence interval - [−0.12, 0.14] - includes the estimated effect of the nudge
  44 The budgeting worksheet requires students to estimate their fall and spring semester education-related expenses, financial

resources, and unmet need.




                                                              45
within CCA. In contrast to CCA, we find large, negative impacts on conditional borrowing, suggesting that

among borrowers, receipt of a nonzero offer led to a $1093 reduction in loans (p < 0.01). This reduction

is driven by a reduction in unsubsidized borrowing (available upon request), which is consistent with the

fact that CCB treatment group members only received subsidized loan offers. We find evidence of patterns

of heterogeneous treatment effects in the impact of nonzero offers on borrowing that are similar to those

produced in CCA (Table B.3), but we are underpowered to distinguish between effects across groups.

   Given that we do not find any first-stage effects of loan offers on borrowing, we are only able to estimate

reduced form impacts of loan offers on attainment. As shown in Table B.4, estimated impacts on fall

semester enrollment, credits attempted, and the likelihood of part-time or full-time enrollment are negative,

insignificant, and sufficiently imprecise that we cannot rule out impacts of a similar magnitude to those

found in CCA.

Appendix C: Anchoring Model

We first consider a model with anchoring, which offers predictions that differ considerably from the other

possible explanations discussed in Section 7. Let the utility function have the form


                                                      α                α                     α
                            U (`|T ) = − (` − `∗ ) − T c (` − P ) − (1 − T ) c (` − 0) ,


where `∗ ∈ R is the latent desired loan amount, ` ≥ 0 is the amount borrowed, c > 0 is a parameter affecting

the cost of deviating from the offered amount, and α ∈ {2, 4, 6, ...}. We consider two testable properties of

this model.

   Property 1: When T=1, only if `∗ = P does ` = P .
                                                α−1                   α−1                α−1
   Proof:   d
            d` P   U (`|T = 1) = −α (` − `∗ )         − αT (` − P )         = −α (P − `∗ )     . If ` = P and `∗ > P then

the derivative is positive, and increasing ` would increase utility. If ` = P and `∗ < P then the derivative is

negative, and decreasing ` would increase utility. Thus ` = P is only optimal if `∗ = P .

   As Figure 5 shows, many students in the treatment group borrow exactly ` = P , and this is not due to

a shift in the distribution of loan amounts, suggesting that anchoring cannot be the only reason that the

loan offer affects borrowing. Among treated students, the number borrowing exactly ` = P is similar to or

greater than the number borrowing any amount in a $500 bin above or below P . This increased mass at

exactly ` = P could arise because for some students P corresponds to the maximum subsidized loan, but

this is also true for the control group, for which we do not see a spike at exactly ` = P . Figure 5 shows

that a nonzero offer of P significantly increases the probability of borrowing exactly ` = P by a magnitude

substantially larger than estimated impacts on the probability of borrowing other amounts.

   Property 2: Suppose α = 2 and  ∈ R+ . If the density of `∗ is increasing (decreasing) over [P, (1 + c) (P + )]

then the probability Pr (` ∈ (P, P + )) will be greater (lesser) when T=1 than when T=0.

   Proof: For α = 2, the first-order condition and be rearranged to show that the utility function is maxi-

                                                                                                ∗              
mized by ` = ` +T cP                                                                             `
                1+c . The relevant probabilities are therefore Pr (` ∈ (P, P + ) |T = 0) = Pr 1+c ∈ (P, P + )
                                                                               ∗                  
= Pr (`∗ ∈ ((1 + c) P, (1 + c) (P + ))) and Pr (` ∈ (P, P + ) |T = 1) = Pr ` 1+c +cP
                                                                                       ∈ (P, P + ) = Pr(`∗ ∈

(P, P + (1 + c) )). Both the upper and lower bounds for the range of possible values of `∗ are decreased by

cP when T=1 relative to when T=0. If the density of `∗ is increasing (decreasing) over the entire range then

the higher values implied by T=1 occur with greater (lesser) probability.

   Empirical evidence on Property 2 indicates that anchoring is limited. Though we cannot directly observe

the density of `∗ , when the offer is $P , the distribution of ` near $P is not greatly distorted from that of

`∗ (as noted in Property 1). Hence we can get a sense of the slope of the latent distribution around $P



                                                             51
from the observed distribution among students treated with an offer of $P . Panel A of Figure 6 shows

that the loan amount density of treated students is increasing in the range up to $2000 above $P , at least

among freshmen. By property 2, this would imply that in the bin just above $P we should observe more

control-group students than treatment-group students. We observe the opposite, suggesting that anchoring

is limited.

   Property 3: Suppose α = 2. There exists  ∈ R+ such that if the density of `∗ is increasing (decreasing)

over (0, P ) then the probability Pr ` ∈ P2 − , P2 +  will be greater (lesser) when T=0 than when T=1.

(1 − c) P2 + (1 + c) )). Both the upper and lower bounds for the range of possible values of `∗ are de-

creased by cP when T=0 relative to when T=1. If the density of `∗ is increasing (decreasing) over the

entire range then the higher values implied by T=1 occur with greater (lesser) probability. The entire

range is ((1 − c) P2 − (1 + c) , (1 + c) P2 + (1 + c) ), and for this to be contained in (0, P ), it must be that
P
2   +≤    P
          1+c   ⇔≤   P
                      2   . Choose  small enough that this holds.

    Figures 6 and 8 show that the density is generally increasing over amounts less than P . Property 3
                                                                               P
therefore implies that the control group should exhibit more mass around       2   than does the treatment group.

We observe the opposite. In both figures we see that the treatment group has at least as many students as

the control group who borrow at each level below P . This pattern provides another piece of evidence against

the anchoring model.

    The distributions of loan amounts among treatment and control groups does not support an anchoring

explanation. Failure of Property 1 implies that anchoring cannot fully explain the borrowing effects, and

failure of Properties 2 and 3 suggests that anchoring is limited. While there may be a small amount of

anchoring that is obscured by offsetting factors, for the purpose of distinguishing between remaining possible

mechanisms, we assume there is no anchoring.
