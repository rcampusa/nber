                       Pure Price Effects of
                        Nonwage Compensation
                               ABSTRACT

This paper discusses the pure static price effects which are engendered

by tax preferences for   nonwage compensation. Section II demonstrates
 that,   because of these price effects, optimal consumption bundles will

contain larger quantities of the goods included in nonwage compensation,

and smaller quantities of other goods, than they would in the absence of

tax preferences. In the presence of preferences, the cost of a compensa-

tion package to an employer usually differs from its value to an

employee.
   Under proportional taxation, compensation packages which contain

optimal quantities of nionwage compensation may be between 4 and 13>

less expensive than cash compensation sufficient to purchase, at retail,

consumption bundles providing similar util ity.   This   difference repre-

sents a substantial savings to employers. It is largely attributable to

reductions in tax payments, and may represent substantial foregone tax

revenues. Optimal provision of nonwage compensation confers greater

advantages under progressive taxation, advantages which increase with

the degree of progressivity.

   These considerations are important in the analysis of any issue to

which employee 'income' or employer costs are relevant. As examples,

Section III demonstrates that conventional definitions of income un-

avoidably generate incorrect conclusions with regard to evaluations of

welfare distribution, tax progressivity, and returns to human capital.

NonwaQe compensation, in all its forms, has become a substantial corn—

ponent of employee income, employer labor costs and national income in

the years since World War II. In consequence, compensation for   labor
services is now more complex than is the price of any other commodity.




  This paper addresses these complications in a simple, static context.

Within that context, it explores the most important incentive to nonwage

compensation: price effects which arise out of income tax exemptions on

consumption goods received as compensation in kind. It demonstrates

these effects through the contrasts between optimal consumption packages

under personal provision, and optimal compensation packages under

employer provision of the goods which comprise 'fringe benefits'.




   Income tax exemptions insure that optimal employer provision of

benefit goods is always less expensive than optimal personal provision.

In simulations with proportional tax schemes and reasonable utility

parameters, the costs of optimal consumption packages exceed the costs

of optimal compensation packages of the same util it>' value by 4< to 13.

These advantages derive largely from impi icit tax subsidies to employers

offering nonwage compensation, which may represent large sacrifices in

income tax revenue. They may be compounded by changes in consumption

composition which further reduce employer expenditures on employee

compensation.




  The differences between employer and personal provision, or between

levels of employer provision, distort all interpersonal comparisons

which require accurate measures of individual welfare. For example,
distributions of employer compensation costs and earnings under employer

provision overstate the attenuation r distributions of employee

util it>'. Distributions of disposable earnings ——   net of income tax
payments ——   understate   utility distributions. Taxation of earrings

results in actual tax progressivity which exceeds nominal proQressivity.

Differences in compensation costs and earnings overstate returns to

human capital, while differences in disposable earnings understate them.




              1. Nonwage Compensation in the nerican Economy


     When a benefit program is paid for by the company, I do not
     think most employees think of it as a trade—off with their
     paycheck. And, while I recognize that, ultimately, there is no
     free lunch —— and there is a total limit on compensation
     dollars — I am not really sure that we are looking at it in
     that contexteither. (Harold P. Kneen, Jr., Director of
     Employment Benefits, International Business Machines Inc.,
     quoted in Conference Board)

    Total employer costs for fringe benefits cannot be equated
    with total income of the employee because anumber of
    benefits, such as pensions, provide the worker with no im—
    mediate additional income. Other benefits, such as supplemen-
    tal unemployment benefits, provide economic security against a
    circumstance which may never materialize. (Oswald and Smyth)



Modern compensation packages contain many nonwage components in addition

to wage or salary payments. The economic implications of these 'fringe

benefits' are subject to much greater misunderstanding than are the

traditional cash components.




   In principle, the marginal dollar of expenditure on nonwage compensa—

tion ought to elicit the same labor effort as does the marginal dollar
of expenditure on cash compensation (Triplett). 14 this relationship is

not enforced, compensation dollars will be expended inefficiently. Kneen

suggests that employers fail to recoanize the costs associated i.jith

haphazard compensation practices.




      Nonwage compensation is comprised of goods —— insurance and savings

programs among them —— which would be bought with disposable income if

they were not included as part of the compensation package. Cash income

is preserved when they are provided by the employer. Oswald and Srnyth

demonstrate that employees fail to recognize the contribution of nonwage

compensation to real income.




      This confusion is not limited to those who provide and those who

receive. The United States Congress and the Internal Revenue Service ——

those who tax ——    continually   redraw distinctions between those com-

ponents of compensation which constitute 'Income" for tax purposes, and

those which do not (AICPA). Economists —— those who measure —— have

neglected the nonwage components of total compensation in their analyses
                                      2
of labor and consumption markets.




      Nonwage components of compensation are now sufficiently important




  1
      Oswald and Srnyth appear to assert that employer expenditures are
      greater than the value an employee receives. Section II of this
      paper demonstrates that a well—chosen compensation package is worth
      more to its recipients than the employer expenditure it represents.

      Duncan and 4oodbury are recent exceptions. Atrostic includes both
      wages and nonpecuniary benefits among the costs of leisure.

that such confusion is costly.    The value of nonwage compensation in

the American economy of 1982 is estimated at $510 bill ion. This total

represents approximately 21'. of national income. Nonwage compensation

comprised 29.1'. of expenditures for' employee compensation among firms

surveyed by the Chamber of Commerce in that year.




   Despite the magnitude of nonwage compensation payments in a modern

economy, employers, employees and economists are understandably uncer—

tam about the roles they play. Their role varies substantially between

individual firms. Among firms surveyed by the Chamber of Commerce in

1982, four percent reported expenditures for nonwage compensation equiv-

alent to less than 18Y of payroll. Nearly four percent reported expendi-

tures equal to 60Y. or more of payroll. Almost all firms offer life

insurance coverage. Eighty—six percent of firms offer paid vacations.

Just half of firms, 53, offer dental insurance. Only 26.< offer con-

tributions to employee thrift plans.




   The variety of modern compensation packages is matched by the multi-

plicity of goals they attempt to achieve. They may include provisions

for human capital investments, work incentives, career development,

risk—sharing, insurance, saving and current consumption, as well as the

exchange of cash for output. These packages are constructed to satisfy

an array of requirements established by competitive pressures, social

obl igatioris and legal responsibilities. They create a complicated,

sometimes contradictory array of incentives which cannot be analyzed in

    The discusson below explores the simple economic responses elicited

by the most important characteristic of nonwage compensation components.

Most forms of nonwage compensation are not taxed as income. The employer

can provide benefit goods to his employees with pre—tax dollars. The

employee would have to expend post—tax dollars if he purchased them

himself. Employers can therefore 'buy' benefit goods for their employees

at a 'price' which is lower than that charged of individual employees in

retail exchanges. The employer 'price' of benefit goods may be further

reduced through bulk discounts offered by vendors who value the transac-

tional economies employers can provide. This price advantage is the

principle reason for which goods are offered, and accepted, as compensa—

t i on.




    This paper discusses the pure static price effects which are engen—

dered by tax preferences for nonwage compensation.
                                                        5.Section   II

demonstrates that these price effects have three major implications: In

general, the cost of a compensation package to an employer is not the

same as its value to an employee. Individuals with identical utility

functions and identical levels of utility will choose different consump-

tion bundles if one receives some compensation in kind while the other

receives compensation in only cash. Individuals whose marginal rates of

                  across employers in bulk purchase discounts create price
      effects which duplicate those of tax preferences. Inter—employer
      differences in these discounts are discussed more fully in Zax.


                                        —5—
substitution are identical whenever their consumption bundles have

identical composition, but who receive different 'incomes', will choose

consumption bundles of differing composition if the rate of income

taxation depends upon the level of taxable income.




   These implications are important in the analysis of any issue to

which employee 'income' or employer costs are relevant. Conventional

definitions of income unavoidably generate incorrect conclusions in many

important interpersonal comparisons. Section III demonstrates that

evaluations of income distribution, proqressivity of taxation, and

returns to human capital depend critically upon the measure of income on

which they are based.




                    LI. Optimal Compensation Packages




Individuals obtain benefit goods in two distinct 'markets'. Under

employer provision, they receive nonwage compensation from their

employers in partial exchange for labor. Under personal provision, they
                                                                       6
purchase benefit goods from retail vendors out of disposable income.




  6
      Employer and personal provision are mutually exclusive alternatives
      in the analysis presented here. In addition, employees are not
      permitted to resell benefit goods received as part of compensation.
      In practice, many individuals supplement benefit goods provided b>'
      their employers with further retail purchases. This behavior is
      discussed further in Zax.


                                   —6—
   The analysis in this section derives optimal compensation packaQes in

the case of employer provision, and optimal consumption bundles in the

case of personal provision, with both proportional and progressive

taxation. It demonstrates that employer provision can always attain a

given level of util it>' at less total expense under proportional taxation

than can personal provision. The advantage to employer provision is

increased under progressive taxation. However, employers can only real-

ize these advantages if they know the utility functions of their

employees. Compensation packages which are ineptly composed can cost the

employer more than would cash compensation of identical value to the

employee.




                        A. Fundamental Concepts




Several concepts of income and consumption are essential to the

relationships between benefits provision, consumption value and compen-

sation cost. The definitions themselves demonstrate several important

characteristics of optimal compensation packages.




  Non—benefit goods are represented by the index good x. This good is

also the numeraire good; its retail price is unity. However, it is taxed

at the rate of t. In compensation packages, x represents post—tax wage

compensation, or disposable earnings. Pre—tax wage compensation, or

earnings, are x(1+t). In consumption bundles, x represents post—tax

nonbenefit consumption, and x(1+t) represents pre—tax nonbenefit con—

surnp t   I on.




    Benefit goods are represented by the index b. This composite good has

a retail price of p. In compensation packages, b represents nonwage

compensation. Employers receive discounts for bulk purchases of benefit

goods, represented by d. They purchase these goods with pre—income—tax

dollars, at an effective price of (1—d)p. In consumption bundles, b

reprsents benefit consumption. Employees must purchase benefit goods

with cash, at an effective price of (1+t)p.




    Employee utility is given by U(bx). It is a function of the com-

posite nonbenefit good ——   disposable earnings —— and   the composite

benefit good. Employee cost of any arbitrary consumption bundle (b*,x*)

is the expenditure necessary to purchase it at retail. It is given by:



                     C1 =   (1+t)pb   +   (1+t)x*
                                                                         (1)



                                                          7
    is the utility value of consumption bundle (b*,x*),



                                  =   U(b*,x*).


Employee value of any consumption bundle is equal to Y*,the minimum

level of income necessary to attain the utility level of this bundle




     The analyss in this paper assume that employee utility levels are
     fixed at U as a result of competition in the labor market. Analyses
     at constant utility levels allow comparisons to be made conveniently
     in monetary terms.


                                      —8—
through personal provision:



                          =    E[(1+t)p,    (1+t); U*],



where E represents the expenditure function (Varian). If the employee

chooses his or her consumption bundle inefficiently, its cost will

exceed its value. By definition,




                                           Cl.



  consumption bundle is efficient under personal provision if equality

holds.




  The employer expenditure for compensation package (b*,x*) is the

expenditure the employer must incur in order to provide that package to

his or her employees. It is given as:



                        C2 =    (ld)pb*     +    (1+t)x*


This definition and that of C1 in equation 1 prove that




                                   C2 < C1.



Any bundle of benefit and nonbenefit goods can be more cheaply purchased

by the employer than by an employee.




   Employer value of any compensation package is equal to the minimum



                                     —9--
level of expenditure the employer must incur in order to provide his or

her employee with the util ity   level   represented by that package. It is

given as:




                        Y = EE(1—d)p, (1+t); U*]



14 a compensation package is inefficiently composed, its cost to the

employer will be greater than necessary to provide employees with U. By

def i   n it on,




                                         C2



As with personal provision, a compensation package is efficient under

employer provision if equality holds.




  C1, C2, Y andY are displayed graphically in Figure 1. The point at

which a budget line intersects the x, or wage axis, represents the

dollar value of all (b,x) combinations which lie on that line. Budget

lines with steep slopes represent the possibilities of employer provi-

sion; relatively small quantities of wages can be exchanged for rela-

tively large quantities of nonwage compensation. Budget lines with flat

slopes represent the possibilities of personal provision; relatively

large quantities of nonbenefit goods must be sacrificed for relatively

small quantities of benefit goods.




   Figure 1 also identifies four bundles of benefit and nonbenefit


                                   — 10 —
goods, each providing the same level of util it)', U. The budget 1 ines on

which point I lies demonstrate that employer cost for any bundle is less

than employee cost. The employer budget line always intersects the x

axis at a point to the left of the intersection of that axis and the

employee budget line. This bundle also demonstrates inefficient alloca-

tion in either employer or personal provision.




     Employee value is represented by the consumption bundle at point 2.

At the prices of personal provision, it is the least expensive consump-

tion bundle which provides utility U. Employer value is represented by

the compensation package at point 3. At the prices of employer provi-

sion, it is the least expensive combination of benefit and nonbenefit

goods which provides utility U. In comparison, the bundle at point 2 is

relatively intensive in nonbenefit goods. The bundle at point 3 is

relatively intensive in benefit goods.




  This figure demonstrates concisely the most significant aspect of

employer benefits provision. The absolute price of disposable earnings

is the same to employers and employees. However, the absolute price of

benefit goods to employers is less than that to employees. In conse-
                                                            8
quence, employer value is always less than employee va1ue

     The expenditure function increases in all prices (Varian>. This
     conclusion is a simple appi icat ion of that theorem.


                                  — 11 —
Any given level of utility can be attained throuQh employer provision at

less expense then through personal provision.




     Tax advantages and bulk discounts for benefit goods provide employers

with opportunities to reduce labor costs by offering consumption goods

as compensation, in addition to cash wages. The employer who wishes to

take advantage of this opportunity must offer a compensation package for

which employee value Y exceeds employer expenditure C2. The optimal
                               •                      9
compensation package maximizes iiiS excess.




     Compensation packages which fulfill these conditions always exist.

However, there is no guarantee that employers will, in practice, be able

to identify them. The employer must know employee preferences precisely

in order to allocate compensation expenditures efficiently. In the

absence of such knowledge, employer expenditure is likely to exceed
                     10
employer value.           14 the employer s choice of compensation packages is

especially infelicitous ——         point    4 in figure 1 is an example —— employer

expenditure can exceed employee value:




                                           C2 )



In this circumstance, employees value their compensation package at            less



     With utility fixed at U, this is equivalent to minimizing employer
     expendi ture.
10
     Empirical studies tentatively suggest that employers, and even union
     representatives, can not accurately predict employee compensation
     preferences <Brosnan, Lawler and Levin, Nealey, Nealey and Goodale)



                                            — 12 —
 than its cost to the employer.          Personal provision of benefit Qoods

would be less expensive to the employer than is inept employer provi—

S i On.




       The relationships in Figure 1 demonstrate the general problems of

compensation composition. Employees are not indifferent between dif-

ferent compensation bundles which represent identical levels of employer

cost —— the bundles which define an employer's budget line are on dif-

ferent indifference curves. Consumption bundles of identical utility

value represent different levels of expenditure under employer and under

personal provision —— bundles on a single indifference curve are drawn

from different budget lines.




       Algebraic formulations reiterate these relationships. Optimal con-

sumption bundles under personal provision minimize the monetary income

which must be earned ——        —— in order to support the given level of

utility ——     U.   They solve the following problem:



                    Minimize   =   (1+t)pb   +   (1+t)x
                                        *

The following first order condition determines optimal bundle coniposi—

t I   on:




        Both extremes of the indifference curve represent compensation
        packages which merit this disdain. They are over—intensive in either
        wage or nonwage compensation.

where U1 and U2 respectively represent the marginal utilities of b and

     Optimal compensation packages under employer provision maximize

employer profits ——    it   ——    while   insuring employees the required util it>'

level. If the number of employees is n, the production function is f(n)

and output is the nurneraire good, then optimal packages solve the fol-

lowing problem:

The following first order condition determines optimal package composi-

tion in this case:

                  U2



Benefits are relatively cheaper to the employer than they are to the

employee. Optimal compensation packages will be relatively more inten-

sive in benefit goods than will be optimal consumption bundles under

personal provision at any given level of utility.




     In general, employers can offer employees a given utility level with


                                            — 14   —
lower expenditures if they distribute benefit goods alonQ with wages

than if they offer only wages with which employees purchase their own

benefits. This economy is available because employers can purchase

benefit goods at lower prices than can employees. Optimal compensation

packages under employer provision substitute relatively inexpensive

benefits for relatively expensive wages, in comparison to optimal con-

sumption bundles under personal provision which represent the same

utility value.   The subsection which follows develops these results

further in the context of a specific utility function.




           B. Optimal Compensation With Cobb—Douglas Utility




Equations 2 and 3 can be solved explicitly with respect to a specific

functional form for the employee's utility function. A Cobb—Douglas

representation of U(b,x) conveniently demonstrates most of the important

points:



                 U(b,x) =   baXl
                                                                        (4)




The exponent, a, represents relative tastes for benefit and nonbenef it

goods. It also represents the optimal share of benefit goods in compen-

sation or consumption expenditures.




   With this specification, solutions to equations 2 and 3 suggest that



                                   — 15 —
the optimal compensation package under employer provision can be 4< to

14< less expensive than the optimal consumption bundle under personal

provision which provides the same level of utility. This economy is

largely attributable to substantial tax subsidies under proportional

taxation. These subsidies are larger under progressive taxation, because

maximum tax rates under employer provision are endogenous.




1. Proportional Taxation




Under proportional taxation, employees convey a fixed proportion of
                                                                        12
their taxable income to the government, regardless of its magnitude.

Differences in the definitions of taxable income between personal and

employer provision are responsible for differences between optimal

consumption bundles in the first case, and optimal compensation packages

in the latter. The optimal consumption bundle is more intensive in

nonbenefit goods and more expensive than is the optimal compensation

pack ge, given a constant level of utility.




The optimal consumption bundle under personal provision solves equations

2 and 4 at U(b,x) U, where U* is fixed. The solution consists of an

      In practice, the tax rate is usually defined as a function of tax-
      able income. In this study, the tax rate is defined as a function of
      post—tax consumption, for illustrative convenience. These two
      definitions are equivalent, as taxable income is identically equal
      to the sum of post—tax income and tax payments.

  Explicit solutions for optimal income and consumption quantities also

reaffirm that disposable earnings and earnings under employer provision

understate employer value, which itself understates employee value

      In addition, earnings under personal provision usually underestimate
      employer value:

However, if employer discounts (d) or tax rates (t) are sufficiently

         Unless otherwise specified, all numerical simulations use these

         discounts presented in Fosu. Chamber of Commerce surveys of compen-
         sation practices —— the only private sector surveys which measure
         costs of paid time not worked —— demonstrate that the share of
         nonwage compensation in total compensation has been equal to ap-
         proximately .3 for the last several years (Chamber of Commerce,
         1984). This value is assigned to abecause the optimal share of a good
         in consumption expenditures is equal to the exponent it carries in
         the Cobb—Douglas utility function.

         Srneeding s empirical analysis of the differences between employer
         cost and employee value suggests an estimate of this difference at
         6.3X . His estimate and that presented here are not entirely com-
         parable, as he ignores consumption expenditure reallocations induced
         by tax exemptions for nonwage compensation.
    16
         These estimates are representative of those which obtain for a wide
         range of reasonable parameter values. In general, the advantages of
         employer provision increase with tax rates, bulk discounts and
         preferences for benefit goods. If t.2, strong preferences for
         benefit goods (cx.4) and large employer discounts (d.15) increase
         the difference above to 12.9X. In contrast, reduced preferences for
         benefit goods (a.2) and reduced employer discounts (d=.05) limit
         this difference to 4.6V., at the same tax rate.

precise estimate of this reduction.            However, the magnitudes it SuQ—

qests are noteworthy. National income accounts for the United States

give employer expenditures for employee compensation in 1984 as $2.173

trillion (Bureau of Economic Analysis). If this is taken as employer

value, equation 11 with t=.2 implies that employee value exceeds it by

$180.4 billion.




      The difference between employee and employer value is comprised of

the difference in retail payments under personal and employer provision

and the difference in tax payments:

Retail costs of consumption packages are usually greater under personal

than under employer provision, but need not be. The 'composition' effect

of tax privileges on nonwage compensation is given as:




            (x —x) + p(b —b(1—d)) =

      This model analyzes individual compensation packages. Its use in the
      estimation of national economic activity entails many assumptions
      about aggregation which should not be casually invoked. In addition,
      welfare levels are taken as constant in the model and in all suc-
      ceeding calculations. These calculations ignore the general equi—
      1 ibrium effects of tax privileges for nonwage compensation on equi—
      1 ibrium welfare levels in general, and on employment and output
      levels, in particular.

Simulations           demonstrate that, with Cobb—Douglas utility, this cornposi—

      Tax payments under employer provision are always less than those

Tax payments under employer provision are less than those under personal

provision, both because benefit goods provided by the employer are not

subject to taxation, and because optimal consumption bundles contain

greater shares of benefit goods under employer provision.




      Equation 11 demonstrates that employers are able to substantially




 18
       Composition effects are rarely negative under Cobb—Douglas utility
       because this utility function restricts ordinary own—price elas-
       ticities of demand to equal —1 . Composition effects may be more
       regularly negative under utility functions which permit demand for
       benefits to be more elastic.

reduce expenditures for employee compensation if nonwage compensation is

not subject to income tax. Equation 13 measures the size of the subsidy

these tax privileges confer. This subsidy, as a proportion of the total

difference between employee and employer value, is:

          tpb    +   t(x x)

If the composition effect of tax privileges is negative, the reduction

in government tax revenue actually exceeds the savings which accrue to

employers. Positive composition effects reinforce the subsidy under most

values for Cobb—Douglas parameters. With a.3, d.1 and t.2, the tax

subsidy contributes 72.1X of the difference between employee and

employer value. If t.3, that contribution rises to 82.4X.




   This subsidy may represent a significant reduction in tax receipts.

As an example, the excess of employee value over employer value es-

timated by equation 11 with t=.2, the parameter values on which this

estimate is based, and equation 14 imply that income tax revenues

foregone in 1984 through tax exemptions for nonwaqe compensation

amounted to approximately $130.0 billion. This subsidy estimate is more



                                          —   23    —
than twice as large as expi ict Medicare subsidies for health care

($57.5 bill ion), and nearly half as large as actual federal income tax

revenue ($296.2 bill ion) in 1984 (Economic Report of the President,

Table B—71). As a further example, impi icit tax subsidies to homeowner—

ship in 1966 were approximately $7 billion, in contemporary dollars

(Aaron). With cx.2,19 d.1 and t.2, equations 11 and 14 imply that

implicit tax subsidies to employment through exemption of nonwage corn—

pensation amounted to $17.9 billion.




   Tax privileges for nonwage compensation have two separable effects;

they alter the composition of consumption bundles, and they subsidize

employment costs for employers. Alternative taxation policies could, in

principle, achieve either of these effects without invoking the other.

Subsidization, if that is the primary purpose, can be achieved through
                                         —
lump—sum payments to employers of            Y, without altering the prices of
benefit goods relative to nonbenefit goods.




      If the primary purpose of policy is to induce greater consumption of

benefit goods, relative to nonbenefit goods, tax exemptions for nonwage

compensation and lump—sum taxes can be combined so as to avoid any net

subsidy to employers, or any net change in tax revenue. With exemptions

for nonwage compensation, lump—sum taxes equal to S1'Y,

       Companies surveyed by the Chamber of Commerce in 1967 reported the
       average share of nonwage compensation in total compensation to be

2. Progressive Taxation




Income tax exemptions for nonwage compensation create an incentive for

employer provision which does not vary with the level of   taxable   income

if taxation is proportional. Progressive taxation creates an incentive

for employer provision which increases with the level of taxable income,

with tax rates, and with the degree of progressivity. The excess of

employee value over employer value is greater if taxation is progressive

than if it is proportional.




   Progressive tax schemes apply increasing rates of taxation to addi—

tional increments of taxable income. B. defines these increments as the
                                        J

width,   in dollars, of the Jth tax bracket. The tax rate, t., applies to

that part of income which falls in the jth bracket. The index i repre-

sents the highest bracket into which taxable income falls. Total tax

payments tT) are given by:

benefit   goods out of post—tax earnings has slope equal to —p, the retail

price for benefit goods, under progressive as well as under proportional

taxation. Benefit and nonbenefit consumption levels, b* and x, are

determined by equations 5 and 6 in either regime. in contrast, progres-

sive taxation changes the minimum level of pre—tax income from which

these quantities can be purchased.

The bracket i is the highest bracket into which employee taxable income

falls. It is defined implicitly by this condition:




                 I
                 i*_1
                              *
                         B. < x + pb

Y*(t*) is the solution to equation 7 at a proportional tax rate equal



                                                         — 27          —
to the tax rate in bracket i. Employee value under progressive taxation

is similar to that under proportional taxation, with an adjustment for

tax payments below the rate of t.* in brackets below 1*.




   The budget constraint for an employer who provides employees with

benefit goods as part of their compensation package is also linear under

proportional taxation. Under progressive taxation, this budget con-

straint becomes piecewise linear. It is linear within a tax bracket, B4,

and continuous but not differentiable at the boundary between two brack-

ets. The relative price of benefit goods decreases as j, the bracket

index, increases.




   Figure 2 portrays the budget constraint for employer provision under

progressive taxation. The ith bracket begins at



               i—i
                Z B., and ends at Z B.
                     J                 J
               j=1               j=1


The relative price of nonwage compensation decreases as taxable income

exceeds one tax bracket and enters the next.




  The compensation package at point I represents the employer value of

utility level U1. The package at point 2 represents employer value of

utility level U2. The budget constraints associated with these utility

levels demonstrate the incentives to which employers are subject.




                                 — 28 —
     The optimal compensation package for utility level U2 at the optimal

price ratio for utility level U1 is at point 3. However, wages at point

3 fall within a higher tax bracket than do wages at point 1. The actual

relative price of nonwage compensation in that bracket is lower than in

the bracket of point 1, so point 3 is inefficient. Point 2 is the actual

optimum compensation package for U2. It represents less taxable cornpen—

sation than point 3, but more nonwage compensation. 21




     Composition of the optimal compensation package depends only on the

marginal tax rate, that prevailing in the tax bracket which includes the

value of taxable compensation. Equations 8 and 5', with the tax rate of

that bracket, also represent the optimal levels of nonwage and wage

compensation under progressive taxation.



     As with employee value, employer value under progressive taxation (Y)

differs from that under proportional taxation in order to reflect the

difference in tax payments:

21
     Alpert tests empirically the proposition that compensation packages
     are composed of wage and nonwage components in constant proportions.
     Triplett asserts that proportionality can not occur with progressive
     taxation except with unusual utility functions. Figure 2 confirms
     Triplett's statement: Under progressive taxation, the slope of the
     budget constraint is increasing along any ray from the origin.
     Optimal compensation packages cannot be composed of components in
     constant proportions if utility is homothetic.

The difference between employee and employer value under progressive

taxation exceeds the difference under proportional taxation. Progressive

taxation increases the advantages to employer provision of nonwage

compensation, by compounding tax exemptions analyzed in the previous

section with reduced rates of taxation on earnings still subject to tax.




   As in the case of proportional taxation, the difference between

employee and employer value under progressive taxation is comprised of

changes in the retail value of consumption and changes in tax payments:

The first term of equation 17 represents the difference between retail

values of consumption. This composition effect is identical to that

encountered under proportional taxation, as given in equation 12.




   The second term of equation 17 represents the difference between tax

payments under personal and employer provision. The components of this

term are analogous to those of equation 12, but differ in that they

include adjustments for tax progressivity. Under the assumptions given

above, the difference between tax payments,                is bounded below;

                    (1/2) Bt E i*(i*_1) —        i(isl)]


TIi luwr bound for this difference depends on the brackets i and i

and on the difference between them. If i =        I   +   k, where k indicates the
extent of progressivity, then




                    41       (1/2) Bt [(2i+k) (k—i)] ? 0.
                         p



   represents the impl icit tax subsidy allowed to employer provision of

nonbenefit goods under progressive taxation. The lower bound for this

subsidy increases with tax progressivity (with k), with the increment

added to tax rates at each new bracket (with t) and with the minimum

bracket attained under employer provision (with i).




                                      —   33 —
      The size of this tax subsidy, relative to the difference between

employee and employer value, depends upon the exact relationship between

taxable earnings and tax brackets. If the taxable components of income

under either employer or personal provision are equal to the maximum

levels in their respective brackets;




                                 x
                                     *

                                             pb



then tax revenue under personal provision is given as:




              I t       B. =      (1/2)       tBi* (i*+1) =        (1/2)   t(x*+pb*) (1*1)
                    J    J
             j=1


Tax revenue under employer provision is given as:



              I t. B. =           (1/2)       tBi (i+1) =        (1/2)   tx (i+1)
             j=1 J J




      With these conditions, the loss of tax revenue represented by the

difference between tax payments under personal and employer provision is

This savings, as well as that between tax payments, increases with k,

effect is not negative ——            if   the tax subsidy does not exceed net

employer savings —— the subsidy provides an increasing share of employer

The analysis of Section II demonstrates that earnings and income

'easures differ systematically under personal and employer provision of

benefit goods. The discussion in this section demonstrates that inap-

propriate income concepts give rise to incorrect analyses of welfare

distribution, taxation equity and returns to human capital. It suggests

that similar problems will arise in analyses of many other important

     If d=.1, then the composition effect in this model is negative only
     if t.6 . In the context of progressive taxation, these values are
     extreme. The marginal tax rate in bracket i is it. If the marginal
     tax rate in the American economy is approximately .4 (Stuart, for
     example), and that rate is achieved in the thirteenth or fourteenth
     tax bracket (Schedule X, Internal Revenue Service), then t is on the
     order of .05.

problems which arise when compensation packages are efficient. The

problems it reveals must be compounded unpredictably if they are not.




   Truly progressive taxation schemes, such as that of Section 11, are

too cumbersome for application in this presentation. The analysis in

this section is based upon a quasi—progressive tax scheme in which

individual taxation is proportional. Higher proportional tax rates at

higher levels of   utility     generate progessivity across individuals.

truly progressive schemes, as well.

1. Distribution      of Income and Taxation




The distribution of util ities among employees differs from the distribu-

tions of employee and employer value, earnings and disposable earnings

under progressive or quasi—progressive taxation schemes, and under most

util it>' functions. The effects of progressivity on tax payments ensure

that the cost of compensation packages increases more rapidly than does

the utility they provide. The composition effects of tax exemptions for

nonwage compensation usually ensure that disposable earnings increase

less rapidly than does the utility derived from the compensation
                                                 26
packages of which they are a part.




      Solutions to equation 10 demonstrate the relationship between

employer values at different levels of welfare:

Solutions to equation 7 demonstrate the same relationship under personal

pray is ion:




 26
      This discussion compares employees at different levels of utility
      within either employer or personal provision. Comparisons between
      employees who differ in the manner by which they obtain benefit
      goods require more extensive analysis.

These relationships prove that the distribution of employee value is

more attenuated than the distribution of employee utilities. The dis-

tribution of employer' value is less attenuated than that of employee

value because substitution of nonwage for wage compensation under

employer provision reduces the growth in employer value with increases

in utility. However, this distribution still overstates disparities in

utility. The share of tax payments in both employee and employer value

increases with utility under progressive and quasi—progressive taxation

schemes. In consequence, value ratios exceed utility ratios. L4hile this

result is demonstrated using Cobb—Douglas utility, it should hold

regardless of the utility function.




     Under employer provision, distributions of earnings and disposable

earnings provide upper and lower bounds for the underlying distribution

of employee utilities. Disparities in disposable earnings underestimate

disparities in utility because nonwage compensation substitutes increas-

ingly for wages as utility increases. However, the growth of tax pay—

rnents with utility is more rapid than the decline of wages. As a result,

earnings disparities overestimate utility disparities. 27




27
     This last result is imposed by the Cobb—Douglas util it>' function,
     which forces the share of earnings in employer value to be constant.
     Utility functions which allow that share to decrease could generate
     earnings disparities which underestimate the extent oF util it>'
     disparities. Empirically, Srneeding claims that the distribution of
     employer value is more attenuated than that of earnings.

The distribution of employer—provided disposable income is more com-

pressed than the distribution of utilities, while the distribution of

earnings is more attenuated.




     Of the income concepts discussed here, only disposable earninQs under

personal provision and Cobb—Douglas utility provide anaccurate basis

for interpersonal comparisons of welfare. The solution to equation 6

demonstrates that x is in fixed proportion to the level of utility: 28

28
     The relative price of benefit to nonbenefit consumption is constant
     under personal provision, regardless of the taxation scheme. There-
     fore, the composition of consumption bundles does not vary with
     utility, and this result holds, for all homothetic utility func—
     t ions.



                                                 — 39 —
The distribution of disposable earnings under personal provision

reproduces faithfully the underlying distribution of employee utilities.

The relationship in equation 21 also proves that disparities in pre—tax

nonbenefit consumption under personal provision overstate utility di;—

parities. Pre—tax expenditures on nonbenefit goods under personal provi-

sion are not proportional to utility because they are inflated by

progressive tax payments.




   in the examples of this section, nominal tax rates are specific to

utility levels. Intended tax revenue is equal to tkU at any utility

level U. If tax rates are applied to observable income measures rather

than utility, actual tax progressivity almost always differs from

nominal, intended progressivity. Equation 21, multiplied by the ratio

t./t. ,   demonstrates that actual progressivity is equal to nominal

progressivity only where taxation is applied to nonbenefit consumption

under personal provision.




   Equations 18 through 20 demonstrate that other taxation schemes do

not produce intended progressivity. Taxation of employer value, earn—

ings, employee value or pre—tax nonbenef it consumption takes revenue

disproportionately from employees with high levels of utility. In all

these cases, actual progressivity is greater than nominal progressivity.

Taxation of disposable earnings under employer provision takes revenue

disproportionately from employees with low levels of utility. In this

case, actual progressivity ts less than nominal progressivity.




2. Returns to SchoolinQ




Accurate estimates of returns to schooling require accurate measures of

returns. Standard empirical analyses rely on the relationship between

schooling and earnings differentials to reveal the benefits of addi-

tional study (Mincer). Duncan attempts to include a measure of nonwage

compensation, as well, but does not have access to adequate data.

Theoretically, the concepts developed in Section 11 indicate that

returns may be badly misestimated when compensation is misrepresented.




         Human capital is denoted by Hk, where ki,j and H > H. . Human

capital level Hk supports utility level Uk for all values of 1<, where U.

>   U.        if H. > H. . True relative returns to human capital, measured in
         I        J     I

terms of utility, are:

             The assumptions which obtain in this discussion assure exoQenously
             the level of utility. In this context, these distortions are imposed
             upon the employer.

Increases in utility require more than proportionate increases in

employer value under progressive or quasi—progressive taxation schemes

(equation 18). Employer value differentials overstate utility differen-

tials and overestimate returns to human capital.




     In this example, earnings differentials yield overestimates of

returns to human capital which are identical to those produced by

employer value differentials. This result is guaranteed by the Cobb—

Douglas representation of util ity, which forces proportional it>' between

earnings and employer value at any level of compensation or taxation

(equations 9 and 10). If employee utility functions require that optimal

shares of earnings in employer value decrease as tax rates increase ——

in   effect, price elasticities greater than unity ——      earnings   di-fferen—

tials will not overestimate utility differentials as dramatically as do

employer value differentials. However, earnings differentials will

overesttrnate util it>' d,fferentals by more than do value differentials

if   earnings shares increase with tax rates.



     The dierences between true and estimated returns to human capital

may be substantial. For example, where t1.1 ,           .3, and k1k2=1 .1,

true returns are equal to:




                  R* =




Estimated returns based on disposable earnings underestimate true

     No measure of compensation under employer provision correctly es-

timates true returns to human capital. Measures of disposable earnings

and earnings or employer cost give rise to estimates which bound the

true value on either side, but which miss it by wide margins.

                              IV. Conclusion




This paper has explored the interactions between tax privileges, optimal

consumption bundles and optimal compensation packages. If employers and

employees understand these interactions, they can be manipulated to the

benefit of both. In contrast, analysts must suffer from these interac-

tions, whether or not they understand them.




   Employers can reduce compensation costs without reducing employee

ut;lity by offering compensation packages which contain nonwage cam—

nents when these components are exempt from income taxation. This

opportunity is not a guarantee, however. Employers must know their

employees' preferences in order to take advantage of these tax

privileges. If they do not know them, they risk constructing a cornpli—

cated compensation package which is more costly than it would be were it

to include only wages.




   Economists must usually choose between several imperfectly correlated

measures of compensation and income when compensation packages include

nonwage components. The correct measure is usually unavailable. For most

labor demand problems, cost of the entire compensation package is prob-

ably the appropriate measure of compensation. For most consumption and

labor supply problems, utility is the appropriate measure of income.




                                 — 45 —
  Many data sets measure only earnings. The analysis in this paper

demonstrates that earnings differentials hardly ever provide accurate

direct estimates of util ity differentials. Here, they are proportional

to compensation cost differentials only because util it>' is represented

as a Cobb—Douglas function. Appropriate measures of income and compensa-

tion may be inferrable from   earnings measures if the compensation
package of which earnings are a part is efficient. If it is not, earn-
