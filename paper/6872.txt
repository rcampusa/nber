I    Introduction

In the early 1990s, while comprehensive health care reform was being debated at the federal

level in the US, forty-five states introduced their own regulations affecting the small group

health insurance market. These state-level reforms were intended to curb insurance carrier

practices that might limit the ability of small “high risk” firms to purchase insurance for

their employees. A common feature of these reforms were restrictions on the extent to which

insurers can vary premiums according to subscribers’ risk status. The most extreme type of

restriction is “pure community rating” which mandates that, for a given plan, the same rate

must be charged to all individuals or small groups, regardless of their age, sex, or other risk

characteristics.

    Community rating continues to be a source of considerable controversy. Some industry

groups and economists have argued that, contrary to the intended effect of insurance reform,

community rating might actually reduce insurance coverage. The mechanism by which this

may occur is known as an “adverse selection death spiral.” In an unregulated market, pre-

miums will be “risk-rated,” that is, younger, healthier consumers are charged lower rates

due to their lower expected claims. Since community rating requires insurance companies to

charge the same premium to all consumers, the rate charged to younger individuals may rise

in response to the higher costs imposed by older persons with the same coverage. If enough

younger consumers react to this price increase by dropping coverage, expected claims for the

covered group will rise, which will necessitate a further increase in premiums. In the extreme

case, this cycle will continue until only those consumers with the highest expected medical


                                              1
expenses will retain coverage.

   While the notion that community rating leads to adverse selection death spirals appears

to have passed into the “conventional wisdom,” there has been little systematic attempt to

document the magnitude of this effect. The most relevant economics literature is a number

of case studies documenting adverse selection against specific health plans within employer-

sponsored health benefit programs (e.g., Price and Mays (1985), Luft, Traener and Maerki

(1985),Cutler and Reber (1998), and Cutler and Zeckhauser (1997)). A common finding from

this literature is that plans that are more attractive to higher risk individuals are vulnerable

to adverse selection death spirals, as lower risk workers migrate to less comprehensive or

more “tightly managed” plans. The implications that these studies have for understanding

the effects of mandating community rating in the small group or individual health insurance

market, however, is unclear. In particular, since in the cases studied coverage is essentially

universal, they offer little insight as to whether imposing pure community rating in a voluntary

insurance market will reduce the number of persons purchasing coverage.

   In this paper, we take a closer look at the effect of community rating by focusing on three

states: New York, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut. These three states had similar insurance

regimes until the early 1990s, and then diverged sharply. New York enacted comprehensive

small group and individual market reforms that included pure community rating in both

markets. Pennsylvania enacted no reform, and Connecticut enacted moderate reforms that

placed very few restrictions on how insurers could set premiums. Despite some differences

the experiences of these states provide a convenient “natural experiment” for evaluating the



                                               2
effects of community rating.

     While critics of the New York legislation have argued that the imposition of community

rating in New York led to a market–wide adverse selection death spiral and a reduction in

insurance coverage (see, for example, Gradison (1995) and Matthews (1997)), our analysis,

using data from the 1987-1996 Current Population Survey, offers no evidence of such an

effect. While insurance coverage rates in the New York small group market did fall, and

the age distribution of the covered population did shift towards older persons in a manner

consistent with a market-wide death spiral, we find almost identical changes in Pennsylvania

and Connecticut. Although we find no effect on insurance coverage, we do find some evidence

that New York’s reforms led to an increase in the market share of HMO’s in the small group

and individual markets.



II     Political Background of New York’s Reform

The focus of state health insurance reforms of the early 1990s was the small group market.

Two reasons commonly given for this emphasis are


     • Employees of small firms and their dependents represent a disproportionate share of

       uninsured Americans.


     • Prior to the reforms, the small group market was rife with insurer underwriting and

       marketing practices making it difficult for small groups deemed to be undesirable risks to

       obtain coverage. Their proponents argued that the small group reforms would increase

       private insurance coverage by removing the barriers faced by high risk groups.

                                                3
       Table 1 summarizes the main provisions of the reforms enacted in Connecticut1 and New

York.2 With respect to most provisions, the reforms in the two states are quite similar to

each other, as well as to model legislation proposed by the National Association of Insurance

Commissioners and reforms passed elsewhere.3 Both states require the guaranteed issue

and guaranteed renewal of insurance to small groups regardless of the group’s industry or

risk status. Insurers are allowed to exclude coverage for pre-existing conditions for no more

than one year after enrollment. Individuals who switch directly from one insurance plan

to another, and were with the first for at least 6 months, are exempted from pre-existing

conditions exclusions altogether.

       One potentially important difference between the two states is that Connecticut’s reforms

apply only to the small group market4 , whereas New York’s apply to both the small group and

individual markets. This is significant because the individual market is generally seen as being

more vulnerable to adverse selection than the small group market. Under New York’s law,

indemnity insurers can treat the two markets as separate, and therefore can choose to offer

coverage to small groups, but not individuals (or vice versa). HMOs, however, are subject to

a “one market rule,” whereby any HMO offering group coverage in the state must also sell a

     Hall (1994) and Blumberg and Nichols (1996) provide good general discussions of the small group reform
movement. For detailed information on the provisions of each state’s reforms, see General Accounting Office
(1995) or Markus, Ladenheim and Atchison (1995). Recent Federal legislation, the 1996 Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), incorporated many features of small group legislation that had
been previously enacted by the states. Our analysis is based entirely on data prior to 1997, when small group
regulations in all states were required to conform to HIPAA.
   4
     The Connecticut legislation initially applied to groups of 1 to 25; in 1993 the upper limit was extended
to 50. To be considered a group of one, a person must be self-employed and work at least 30 hours per week
year-round.

standardized product in the individual market (Hall 1998).5

       The area where there is the most variation in state level reforms, and where the differ-

ence between the Connecticut and New York reforms is greatest, is the rules governing how

premiums for a given plan may vary across subscribers. The Connecticut legislation allows

premiums to vary with age, gender, region, industry, group size, coverage tier (e.g., single,

family). Initially, the Connecticut law allowed further adjustments to account for differences

in risk not captured by these variables, though these additional adjustments were phased out

by July 1995. Various accounts of the effect of these rules and of similar rating regulations

enacted elsewhere, indicate that they generally do not impose a binding constraint on the

pricing decisions by Connecticut insurers. In contrast, New York’s reforms require pure com-

munity rating. For a given plan, the same rate must be charged to all subscribers regardless

of age, sex, health status, or other risk factors.         6


       While pure community rating is often depicted primarily as a mechanism to transfer

wealth from consumers whose expected medical expenses are lower than average to those

whose expected expenses are higher than average, such redistribution did not appear to be

the objective of those designing New York’s policy. Rather, according to policy makers, the

goal was to “level the playing field” for the state’s non-profit Blue Cross and Blue Shield

plans (Curiale 1994). Prior to the reforms, Blue Cross and Blue Shield “voluntarily”sold

community rated insurance on a guaranteed issue basis. Given that their competitors were

    6
      Rates are allowed to vary with geography, coverage tier, and plan benefit design. In addition, carriers are
allowed to define different rates for the small group and individual markets.

not bound by such rules, the Blues (as they are commonly known) argued that they were at

a significant disadvantage and had been suffering from adverse selection for years.



III    The Economics of Rate Regulation in a Voluntary Insur-

       ance Market

Despite the prevailing belief that a reduction in insurance coverage due to an adverse selection

death spiral is a likely consequence of community rating, it is not a prediction that comes

naturally out of the simplest models of insurance provision. Despite its limitations (See Wilson

(1977) for example) the Rothschild and Stiglitz (1976) framework provides a convenient model

to analyze the consequences of community rating. Our description of the model will be largely

graphical.

   Consider a simple one-period, two state world, with the two states given by S1 and S2 .

There are two risk types j = H, L , who incur loss d with probability pj where H and L

correspond to high risk (older) and low risk (younger relatively healthier) types respectively

such that pH > pL . An uninsured individual receives wealth W1 = W − d in the bad state

S1 , and W2 = W in the good state S1 . Insurers are risk neutral and competition ensures that

contracts receive zero profit in a (Nash) equilibrium. For high risk individuals this zero profit

condition is given by the ray EG; for low risk (younger) individuals the set of zero profit

contracts is given by the ray EF . Complete insurance is given by the 45 degree ray from the

origin, and the point E in Figure 1 denotes the initial endowment (no-insurance) state.

   While the Rothschild and Stiglitz model and others in the insurance literature are con-


                                               6
cerned with the case where there is an “information surplus” favoring consumers, in reality

health insurers have a considerable amount of information on which to base premiums. In-

deed, most of the health care reform legislation that has been recently proposed and enacted

has been motivated in large part by a dissatisfaction with the various ways that insurers use

information on subscribers’ demographic characteristics, health status, or prior claims expe-

rience to risk-rate premiums or ration coverage. Thus, the case of an unregulated market can

be approximated by the situation where risk types are fully observable and each consumer

can be offered coverage at an actuarially fair premium.7 In Figure 1, the insurance contracts

given by αL and αH represent complete insurance at such prices for young and old individuals,

respectively.

       Under a pure community rating regime, this equilibrium is not possible because insurers

cannot charge young and old consumers different amounts for the same coverage. Suppose

an insurer that had been offering the pair (αL ,αH ) attempted to continue offering complete

insurance but charged a pooled premium equal to the average expected claims for the entire

risk pool. A basic result of the Rothschild-Stiglitz model is that such a contract, represented

in the figure by αP , cannot survive in equilibrium, as young individuals will opt out of the risk

pool in favor of contracts that offer a lower quantity of insurance at a lower price (i.e., ones

that lie to the southeast of αP ). Indeed, if a simple (Nash) equilibrium exists, it is given by

the separating equilibrium (αH , βL ). Note that due to self-selection, both contracts are fully

risk-rated, yet at the same time are in compliance with the community rating regulations.

   7
     Obviously, even when risk-rating is allowed, insurers do not have perfect information on consumers’ risk
status. See Hoy (1982) for a discussion of how insurers’ use of observable information that is correlated with
risk status affects market outcomes.


                                                      7
       Note that the model represented in Figure 1 does not predict a decline in the number of

persons with any insurance coverage (which is how coverage is typically measured in empirical

research and policy discussions). The reason is that as long as both types of individuals are

risk averse, low risks will prefer a low quantity contract like βL to the uninsured endowment

point E. In this framework, the number of persons with any insurance coverage will only

fall if contracts on the line segment from E to βL are either not available, perhaps because

regulations such as mandated benefits effectively impose a minimum quantity constraint,

or are not desirable to consumers. The latter situation may occur if low cost catastrophic

coverage is seen by younger consumers to be inferior to the “free coverage” that arises from

the requirement that hospitals provide certain types of emergency care even in the absence

of payment.8 As shown in Figure 2, if these considerations are relevant, insurance coverage

may fall as low risk individuals faced with a choice between αH and E choose the latter.

       Our analysis therefore suggests one of two potential outcomes:


   1. A market-wide adverse selection death spiral. Insurance coverage falls after the impo-

         sition of community rating, and there is an increase in the age of those individuals who

         have insurance.


   2. No death spiral. Insurance coverage does not fall after the imposition of community

         rating, and the age composition of covered individuals does not change, but the average

         quantity of insurance purchased declines.

   8
    Similarly, low risk, low income individuals may choose not to purchase insurance because they expect to
become eligible for Medicaid in the event that they incur catastrophic medical expenses (Cutler and Gruber
1996).


                                                    8
   Note that second scenario is not inconsistent with the case where certain insurance carriers

report the symptoms of an adverse selection death spiral. Insurers that offer contracts like

αP will observe young persons dropping coverage and the average cost of insured individuals

rising. The experience of particular carriers, however, provides no information on how com-

munity rating affects the total number of persons purchasing insurance in the market. What

must be the case for the second scenario to obtain, however, is that the individuals do not

abandon coverage altogether but purchase (cheaper) less complete coverage.



IV     The Effect of New York’s Reforms on Insurance Coverage

It is clear that after New York’s reform went into effect in April 1993, there were significant

changes in the market for health insurance. At first pass, many of these changes appear to

be consistent with the existence of an “adverse selection death spiral.”

   For instance, NY Department of Insurance data indicate that 40% of individual policy

holders saw their premiums increase by 20% or more, while 18% saw their premiums fall by

at least 20%. As might be expected, younger insured individuals faced the greatest increases,

and older insureds experienced the greatest decline (Barents Group 1996, Hall 1998). It was

widely reported in the media how one indemnity insurer, Mutual of Omaha, raised rates for

single males under age 30 by 170%. There appears to have been slightly less change in the

small group market, though there too rates appeared to increase for younger groups relative

to older groups (Hall 1998). Department of Insurance data indicate that enrollment in New

York’s individual and small group markets combined fell by 2.4% between March 31, 1993



                                              9
(the day before the reforms became effective) and April 1, 1995 (the two year anniversary of

the reform’s enactment).

   There are reasons to doubt, however, that these changes were caused by the New York

reforms. While coverage appears to have fallen after the reforms, it is also the case that

New York’s reforms were enacted in the midst of a long secular decline in insurance coverage

throughout the U.S. (Kronick 1989, Acs 1995, Long and Rodgers 1995, Olson 1995, Fronstin

1997). Indeed, data from the New York Department of Insurance show that combined individ-

ual and small group enrollment had fallen by 8.6% in the six months prior to the enactment

of community rating.

   Our approach is to estimate the reform’s impact by comparing trends in insurance coverage

in New York with trends in our “control” states of Pennsylvania and Connecticut. As is clear

from our description of the legislation, we expect the contrast in outcomes to be starkest

between New York (pure community rating imposed on both the small group and individual

markets) and Pennsylvannia (no reform in either market). Connecticut, which implemented

some reforms in the small group market but did not implement pure community rating and

introduced no new regulations in the individual market is our intermediate case – we expect

its outcomes to lie somewhere between New York and Pennsylvannia.

   As we detail below, the focus of our investigation is the effect of the reforms on


  1. The level of health insurance coverage.


  2. The age (“health”) distribution of those receiving coverage.


  3. The quantity/quality of insurance coverage.

                                               10
        In each case, we first compare changes among small firms in New York to small firms in

our two control states. We then look at changes among large firms – which were not directly

affected by the reforms – in all three states. This provides us both with a possible additional

source of identifying information, and a control for possible within-state trends.


A        Descriptive Statistics

We use data from the March Current Population Surveys for the years 1988 to 1997. Since

the insurance questions in the March CPS refer to coverage during the prior year, our data

span the period from 1987 to 1996.9

        Table 2A presents descriptive statistics on demographics, and employment characteristics

for adults (18 to 64 years old) in the three states from the initial year of our data. With the

exception of the percentage of minorities and urban residents, both of which are higher in New

York than in the other two states, the three states are quite similar in terms of demographics.

Because the New York reforms applied only to the small group and individual health insurance

markets, we focus on employees of small firms and the self-employed as a “treatment group,”

using the employees of large firms as a within-state control group. The figures in Table 2A

show that in 1988 44% of working adults in New York were either self-employed or employed

by a firm with fewer than 100 employees. This is slightly lower than the comparable figures

for Pennsylvania (48%) and Connecticut (51%). The industry distribution is quite similar

    9
    One potential limitation of the March CPS data is the possibility that respondents answer the insurance
questions as if they pertained to their insurance status at the time of the survey rather than for the previous
year as intended. (Swartz 1986, Berger, Black and Scott 1998). Because the New York reforms became effective
in April 1993, our designation of pre- and post-reform years is the same whether we assume that respondents
answered the questions as intended, or answered with respect to their current situation.



                                                      11
across the three states.

       Table 2B compares the three states in terms of health insurance coverage. The figures

show that in 1988, 77% of adults in New York had private insurance coverage, compared to

84% in Pennsylvania and 87% in Connecticut. Much of New York’s lower coverage rate is

due to a lower percentage of adults who are covered by private insurance as a dependent

on someone else’s policy. When we look at the percentage of those covered by insurance in

their own name, the Pennsylvania-New York differential is only 2 percentage points, and the

Connecticut-New York differential is 8 percentage points.

       Among adults with private coverage, the distribution by source of coverage is very similar

across the three states. Individually purchased coverage accounts for between 9.5 and 11.5%

percent of all private insurance in these states. Among adults with employer-sponsored group

coverage, the percentage insured through large firms (100 or more employees) is slightly higher

than the percentage insured through small firms.

       Figure 3 plots regression adjusted trends from 1987 to 1996 in the percentage of adults

with private insurance in their own names for the three states.10 In all three states coverage

declined from the late 1980s until 1992, before increasing between 1992 and 1994. Coverage

fell again after 1994, though by varying magnitudes. Throughout the entire period coverage

was lower in New York than in the two control states. The difference between Pennsylvania

and New York was at a minimum in the years 1988 and 1991, and appears to have grown

  10
    The plots are generated from regressions with private coverage as the dependent variable. The regressors
included 7 industry dummies, dummies for full/part-time full/part year status, one firm size dummy variable,
a dummy for students, female, married (plus the married and female dummies interacted), hispanic ethnicity,
white, and SMSA (4 categories). The points were generated by fixing the values of the regressors at their mean
value for New York.


                                                     12
slightly over the 10 year period. The Connecticut-New York differential increased between

1988 and 1993 before falling in the final year of our data.

    From Table 2B it is clear that roughly half of adults in the three states obtain coverage

through a large firm and therefore should not have been affected by rules governing the small

group or individual insurance markets. Therefore, in Figure 4 we drop non–workers from our

CPS sample and stratify workers according to their firm size and self- employment status. The

upper panel presents the regression-adjusted trends in own name coverage for individuals who

are self-employed or work in firms with fewer than 100 employees; the lower panel presents

comparable results for workers in firms with 100 or more employees.                11 12


    The results in the upper panel of Figure 4 show that for small firm workers, the Pennsylvania-

New York differential increased over time. However, the gap between the two states widened

in 1991, a year before New York’s insurance reforms were signed into law and two years be-

fore they went into effect. From 1991 to 1996, the difference in coverage rates between the

two states appears to be essentially constant. Foreshadowing some of our results in the next

section, the changes for workers in larger firms parallel those in smaller firms.13

   11
      The firm size categories in the CPS (less than 25, 25 to 100, 100 to 499, 500 to 999, and 1000 or greater)
do not match up perfectly with the definition of a small group under New York’s reforms (3 to 50 full-time
employees). We define small firms as those with fewer than 100 employees. This split ensures that workers in
firms with 25 to 50 employees, who should have been affected by the reforms, will be in the “treatment group.”
Since the reforms apply to full-time workers and the CPS question refers to all workers, some firms with 50
to 100 employees were also subject to the reforms. Dropping workers in firms with 25 to 50 employees and
comparing workers in very small firms (less than 25) to those in larger firms (100 or more) does not materially
affect any of our results.
   12
      Another limitation of the firm size information is that the firm size variable pertains to the March job,
which may not be the job for the preceding year. This potentially introduces a small amount of “slippage.”
   13
      With very few exceptions, all firms with more than 100 employees offer health benefits. Therefore, the
downward trend evident in the lower panel of Figure 4 is most likely explained by an increase in the number of
workers in large firms who decline coverage that is offered to them. Three studies using different data sources
provide evidence consistent with this explanation (Cooper and Schone 1997, Fronstin 1997, Rice 1998).



                                                      13
V     Methods and Results

Our empirical analysis is divided in three sections, corresponding to the types of predictions

made by the theoretical model discussed in section III. First, we examine the effect of New

York’s health insurance reforms on the level of health insurance coverage. Second, we exam-

ine changes in the age distribution of those receiving coverage before and after the reforms

went into effect. Third, we investigate whether the reforms affected the quantity/quality of

insurance coverage by looking at the percentage of individuals covered by HMOs.


A    Measuring the Effect of the Reforms on Insurance Coverage

In this section, we generate a variety of different estimates of the effect of the reforms. The

starting point for our analysis is the simple linear regression model:



                                          X             X
                               I = Xβ +         γSj +         δD · Sj                      (1)
                                          j∈S           j∈S


where X is a n × k matrix of demographic characteristics with associated parameters β, γ and

δ are 1 × 3 vector of parameters corresponding to S ∈ (N Y, CT, P A). The binary variable

D = 1 if the observation is from 1993 (the year the NY reforms went into effect) or later and

0 otherwise. Let I denote the appropriate regression adjusted mean level of insurance and

let ∆ be the operator that computes the difference before and after 1993. Two “difference in

difference” (DD) estimates of the effect of the reform are:



                            DD1 ≡ ∆I N Y − ∆I P A = δbN Y − δbP A


                                                14
                               DD2 ≡ ∆I N Y − ∆I CT = δbN Y − δbCT


   A limitation of this specification is that it assumes that the impact of the reform does not

vary by employer size. As the reforms were designed to apply only to individuals working in

firms with 50 or fewer full-time workers, we can augment our previous specification to include

a firm size effect.

                                             γSj + F 0 ψ +
                                       X                     X
                         I = Xβ +                                  δj,f F ⊗ D · Sj            (2)
                                       j∈S                   j∈S


where F = [BL] where B and L are binary variables indicating big and little firms respec-

tively. Under the assumption that trends for workers in large firms reflect state-specific factors

unrelated to the regulations applying to the small group and individual markets, this speci-

fication yields two additional “difference-in-difference-in-difference” (DDD) estimates of the

effect of the reform:




                                n                        o     n                     o

       In Table 3 we report the simplest estimates of the effect that corresponds to our equa-

tion (1). The results reported in the first rows of the table are from regressions using the

full 10 years of data. We also estimated models using a more focused subsample consisting

of data from 1991 to 1996; those results are reported in the second row. In brackets we re-

port the probability that each difference equals zero. When we use the full 1987-1996 sample

and consider Pennsylvania as the control group, the results suggest that New York’s reforms

led to a 1.1 percentage point fall in coverage (first row, first column). The evidence for an

effect vanishes however if either we use Connecticut as a control (column 2) or we restrict

our attention to the years 1991-1996 (second row). Restricting the pre-reform period in this

way seems especially appropriate as Figure 3 suggests that this estimate avoids attributing to

the reforms the widening of the Pennsylvania-New York coverage gap that occurred between

1987 and 1991.

       One limitation of the specification in Table 3 (equation (1)) is that these estimates average

the change in coverage for employees of small firms with employees of large firms who should

not have been affected by the reforms. We therefore consider the augmented specification

based on equation (2) that allows for differences between workers in large and small firms.

The results of this exercise are reported in Table 4. We also report results for two dependent

variables: a dummy for whether the worker has private insurance from any source (as in the

previous table), and one for whether she has private coverage in her own name.14

  14
     While the number of individuals with insurance may be more interesting in some contexts than the source
of that coverage, a focus on coverage in one’s own name is consistent with our use of firm size and self-
employment status to define treatment and control groups. A substantial share of workers in small firms are
covered through family members working for large firms (Monheit and Vistnes 1994). In trying to estimate the
effect of New York’s reforms, we want to ignore changes in insurance coverage that arise from an individual’s


                                                     16
    Only when we use private insurance from any source as our dependent variable, treat

Pennsylvania as the control, and use the entire 10 years of data, does the DDD estimate

approach standard levels of statistical significance. That estimate implies that coverage fell

by 1.7 percentage points in the wake of the reforms. However, when we use the same model but

compare the trend in New York to that in Connecticut, the result is a precisely estimated zero

effect. When we consider private insurance in one’s own name, which is a more appropriate

dependent variable for contrasting employees of big and little firms, the full-sample regressions

yield estimated reform effects that are zero whichever control group is used. Finally, when

we drop the data from years prior to 1991 (our preferred specifications) the results for both

dependent variables and both control states imply the New York reforms had no effect on

insurance coverage.15


B    The Effect of Reforms on the Age Distribution of Insured Persons

We now look at whether the reforms had any impact on the age distribution of insured

individuals (our CPS data has no other information on health status). Under the “death

spiral” scenario the decline in coverage is more dramatic for younger than for older individuals,

which will cause the age distribution to shift to the right. Figures 5 and 6 display kernel density

estimates of the age distribution of adults with insurance through a small firm (defined again

family member gaining or losing employment with a large firm.
  15
     To avoid any ambiguity concerning the treatment/control classification of workers in firms with 25 to 100
employees (some of whom should not have been affected by the New York reforms) we also estimated models
comparing workers in very small firms (fewer than 25 employees) and those in larger firms (more than 100
employees). The results from these regressions are virtually identical to those in Table 4.




                                                     17
as fewer than 100 employees) and those with individually purchased coverage.16

    Figure 5 displays the estimates for individuals with coverage through small firms before

and after 1993.17 The top panel pertains to New York and the bottom panel displays estimates

for the same time period in Pennsylvania.18 The inference from the density estimates is quite

similar to the inference in the preceding subsection. Consistent with the predictions of an

adverse selection death spiral, the age distribution of those persons in the small group market

shifted toward older individuals in New York. As in the preceding subsection however, almost

identical changes in the age distribution occurred in Pennsylvania.

    Recall from Section II that the rules on how insurers can set premiums were not the only

way the New York reforms were more comprehensive than those in our control states. A

second difference was the fact that the New York reforms applied to both the individual and

small group markets. In Connecticut, by contrast, the more limited reforms were restricted

to the small group market. It could be argued that the adverse selection death spiral did not

occur in the small group market because the formation of employer-sponsored groups had

already enabled some pooling of young and old consumers, muting the impact of community

rating on the distribution of premiums and therefore limiting the exodus of younger consumers

   16
       These insurance categories are determined using information on whether the individual has coverage in
her own name or through a family member, whether that coverage is employer-sponsored, and, if so, the firm
size for the individual in the family who is the source of coverage.
   17
       We use the standard Rosenblatt (1956) and Parzen (1962) kernel density estimator fbh of a univariate
density f based  P on a random sample of ages of covered individuals A1 , . . . , An of size n, with sample weights

                                                      X                         

                                                      i=1

where h is the bandwidth and K(·) is the kernel function. Our inference based the unsmoothed histograms is
identical, however, the smooth histograms are more compelling visually.
  18
     The results for Connecticut are essentially the same and are not reported for the sake of brevity.

from the market. According to this line of reasoning, a death spiral may still have arisen in

the individual market, where in the pre-reform period there was less pooling and premiums

for young and old consumers differed dramatically. Figure 6 presents density estimates for

the individual insurance markets in New York (upper panel) and Pennsylvania (lower panel).

While the shape of the age distribution is different, the results are qualitatively the same as

those in Figure 5: the age distribution shifted to the right in a similar fashion for both states.

   As before, we estimate the effect of the reforms with a difference–in–difference estimator.

At each age (Ai ), we can define an effect:



                             Effect = ∆fˆhNY (Ai ) − ∆fˆhPA (Ai )
                                         n                            o




where for state j,
                                                                     
                                       (j,Post)           (j,Pre)
                             ∆fˆhj ≡ fˆh        (Ai ) − fˆh       (Ai )


   The estimates of these quantities are given in Figure 7 and 8 along with two standard

error bounds. As is clear, the difference in the change in the densities is small in magnitude

and relatively precisely estimated. For sake of brevity we do not display the age distribution

of insured individuals in large firms or the corresponding DDD-density estimate as these

estimates leave the inferences completely unchanged.




                                                 19
C    The Effect of Reform on the Structure of the New York Market

Up to this point, the evidence strongly suggests that there was no market–wide death spiral

induced by the health insurance reforms in New York. Although the qualitative evidence

suggests to the contrary, one possible explanation for the results is that the reforms were

ineffectual. We therefore return to the simple model we developed in Section III to look for

an additional prediction. Recall that the model suggests that the imposition of community

rating should not necessarily lead to a reduction in the number of covered individuals. Indeed,

a more straightforward prediction of the model is that community rating should lead to a

lower quantity of health insurance purchased by younger (low risk) individuals.

    While we lack a precise measure of average quantity of coverage purchased by those with

health insurance, we do have additional data that bears on this question. Specifically we

can look at the change in the type of insurance – HMO or indemnity – purchased before

and after the reforms. Although HMOs in some sense provide more complete insurance

coverage (i.e. less exposure to large out-of-pocket costs), the ways that HMOs ration care

and limit consumers’ choice of physicians and treatments likely represents a lesser “quantity”

of insurance. In particular, HMOs represent a form of insurance that is considerably less

attractive to high-risk consumers, an essential prerequisite for the separating equilibrium we

described in Section III (Feldman and Dowd 1994, Pauly 1985).

    Although not a major issue in the debate that preceded the reforms, informed observers

reported that the New York reforms appeared to have spurred an increase in HMO enrollment

in the state’s small group and individual market (Managed Care Week 1994). Moreover, other



                                              20
more systematic studies, relying mainly on interviews with state regulators, insurance brokers

and industry representatives, point to a similar conclusion (Chollet and Paul 1994, Hall 1998).

       Although this evidence suggests that reforms did indeed have some impact, the fact that

managed care enrollment was increasing throughout the country in the mid-1990s, makes it

important to assess trends in New York relative to an appropriate counterfactual.

       To do this we use data from 6 employer surveys conducted between 1988 and 1995 by

the Health Insurance Association of America and KPMG/Peat Marwick.19 Specifically we

focus on the percentage of insurance–providing firms choosing HMOs rather than indemnity

coverage. As before, we compute a simple difference–in–difference estimate (the change in

New York less the change in the appropriate control group), and display the results in the

first row of Table 5. Again we use the trends in the insurance coverage among large firms

as an additional within–state control. The second and third rows display the change in the

percentage of large firms offering HMO coverage and the associated difference–in–difference–

in–difference (DDD) estimates respectively.

       The results are quite striking. Prior to 1993 the three states had very similar rates of

HMO penetration in the small group market (the differences are not significant at conven-

tional levels.) Consistent with our simple model, however, after 1993 the percentage of small

firms in New York offering HMOs more than doubled from its pre-reform levels, increasing

by 25 percentage points. The corresponding growth in Pennsylvania and Connecticut, mean-

while, was quite small (and insignificantly different from zero.) Consequently, our difference–

  19
    The survey years are 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991 from HIAA and 1993 and 1995 from KPMG/Peat Marwick.
The surveys from the different years use the same sampling scheme and very similar survey instruments. For
additional information on this data see Shore-Sheppard, Buchmueller and Jensen (1998).


                                                   21
in–difference estimates (using either Pennsylvania or Connecticut as a control) suggest the

reforms significantly altered the structure of the New York small group insurance market.

The difference–in–difference estimate using either state as a control is about 23 percent.

       Moreover, the relative change in the HMO penetration rate for large firms indicate that

this result is not an artifact of a differences in statewide trends. If anything, the point

estimates in the second row of Table 5 suggest that HMO coverage was increasingly more

rapidly among large firms in Pennsylvania and Connecticut than in New York (although

these changes are not significantly different from zero.) Consequently, the DDD estimates in

the last row of the table – 31 percent and 32.5 percent using Pennsylvania and Connecticut

as a control respectively – are even larger than the corresponding DD estimates.20



VI        Concluding Remarks

Using data from the March CPS we find no evidence for the “conventional wisdom” that the

imposition of pure community rating leads to an “adverse selection death spiral.” Specifically,

the percentage of individuals in small firms covered by insurance did not fall in New York

(which imposed pure community rating in its small group and individual health insurance

markets) relative to Pennsylvania (which enacted no new insurance regulations) or Connecti-

cut (which enacted very moderate insurance reforms). Consistent with the predictions of

  20
    We do not have precisely comparable data for the individual market in these states although other evidence
strongly suggests the same pattern was evident. Data from the NY State Department of Insurance show that
the HMO share of the individual market increased from 8 percent in March 1993 to 25 percent in April
1995 (Hall 1998). Chollet and Kirk (1998) report market share data (measured as a percent of premium
revenue) that indicate in 1995 HMOs had an 8 percent share in Pennsylvania and a 30 percent share in New
York. (Their analysis is based on a sample of states that does not include Connecticut.)



                                                     22
the simple Rothschild and Stiglitz (1976) framework, however, we find that the reforms had

a significant impact on the structure of the New York insurance market. Specifically, New

York experienced a dramatic shift away from indemnity insurance toward HMOs. While this

shift took place during a period of nationwide increases in the managed care enrollment,

the increase in HMO penetration in New York’s small group and individual markets was

significantly greater than in either Pennsylvania or Connecticut.21

    The implications of these results for policy are not immediate. Contrary to the “worst

case” scenarios depicted by the insurance industry and other critics of reform, there is no

evidence that the reforms led to a significant increase in the number of uninsured individuals.

At the same time, our results suggest that the primary goal of reform proponents – to increase

the percentage of persons with health insurance – was not met either.




  21
     We should note that while our finding that there was no “death spiral” runs counter to predictions that
were made prior to the enactment of New York’s reforms and arguments made by reform critics thereafter,
our results are quite consistent with detailed qualitative studies of the New York experience (Chollet and Paul
1994, Hall 1998).

Notes: 6/12 means that conditions present 6 months prior to enrollment can be excluded for a
maximum of 12 months. The Connecticut reform allows standard premiums to vary by age,
gender, geographic region, industry, group size and coverage tier (i.e., single, family, etc.).
Initially, insurers were allowed to make further adjustments to account for risk differences not
captured by these variables. These adjustments were phased out by July 1995. In New York,
premiums can vary by market (individual vs. small group), region and coverage tier.
