Do Immigrant Inflows Lead to Native Outflows?

                                              ABSTRACT

        We use 1980 and 1990 Census data for 119 larger Metropolitan Statistical Areas to examine
the effect of skill-group specific immigrant inflows on the location decisions of natives in the same
skill group, and on the overall distribution of human capital. To control for unobserved skill-group
specific demand factors, our models include lagged mobility flows of natives over the 1970-80
period. We also estimate instrumental variables models that use the fraction of Mexican immigrants
in 1970 to predict skill-group specific relative immigrant inflows over the 1980s. Despite wide
variation across cities in the size and relative skill composition of immigrant population changes we
find no evidence of selective out-migration by natives. We conclude that immigrant inflows exert
a direct effect on the relative skill composition of cities: cities that have received relatively unskilled
immigrant flows have experienced proportional rises in the size of their unskilled populations.

                                 Do Immigrant Inflows Lead to Native Outflows?

           The rise in immigration that followed the lifting of national origin quotas in 1965 has led to

significant changes in the size and composition of the United States population. Despite the presumption

that increases in immigration will necessarily harm the labor market opportunities of natives, most

studies over the past decade have found only very modest effects. The usual approach in this literature,

the so-called Aarea-analysis@ method, is to correlate wage levels in different metropolitan areas (or

changes in these wage levels) with the fraction of immigrants in the metropolitan area.1 Point estimates

from these studies suggest that a 10 percent increase in the fraction of immigrants lowers native wages

by no more than 1 percent. These findings are also consistent with the Anatural experiment@ provided by

Miami=s experience following the 1980 Mariel Boatlift B despite a rapid increase in low-skilled workers,

there was no discernable effect on the wages of less skilled natives (Card, 1990).

           Recent work by Borjas, Freeman, and Katz (1996,1997) (henceforth BFK), however, has

been critical of these analyses. They argue that a core assumption of these studies -- that immigration

leads to an increase in the supply of labor in local labor market B is violated. Specifically, they argue

that selective out-migration by natives has effectively Aundone@ recent immigrant inflows. They note

that if the arrival of one immigrant (of a given skill type) to a local labor market leads one native (of the

same skill type) to leave the local market, standard economic reasoning suggest that immigrant inflows

will have no detectable impact on local wage differentials B natives have effectively Aarbitraged@ them

away (although immigration might still have important economy-wide impacts).

        Evidence of native-born mobility responses to immigrant inflows, however, is mixed. Frey

(1995,1996) reports a strong correlation between immigrant inflows and native outflows, and argues

that this behavior is leading to a Ademographic balkanization@ of U.S. cities. Wright, Ellis, and Reibel

(1997) re-examine Frey=s specifications and conclude that native outflows from large metropolitan areas

are unrelated to immigrant inflows. Likewise, Butcher and Card (1991) find no evidence that native

population flows are related to immigration inflows. Filer (1992) and BFK (1997), however, find

evidence consistent with a Askating rink@ model of native location decisions -- each new immigrant

knocks a native off the ice.

        In this paper, we analyze the extent to which immigrant inflows over the 1980s have changed

the distribution of skills across cities. Specifically, we focus on the causal relationship between

immigrant inflows and native-born location decisions that is at the heart of both the Askating rink@ and

Ademographic balkanization@ hypotheses. Our analysis exploits several key aspects of recent immigrant

inflows. First, there is considerable diversity in the skill levels of new immigrants (Butcher and DiNardo,

1998), with Mexican immigrants in particular being very likely to work in low-skilled occupations.

Second, there is also much variation across cities in immigrant inflow rates. As a consequence of these

facts, there are remarkable differences across cities in the relative inflows rate of less-skilled immigrant

labor. By correlating the relative population movements of native workers in different skill groups with

these relative inflow rates, we are able to estimate the net impact of immigration inflows on the relative

skill distributions of different cities. To address the concern the unskilled immigrants may be drawn to

cities that are experiencing rising relative demand for unskilled labor, we exploit a third important aspect

                                                      4

of US immigration: the tendency of newly arriving immigrants to settle in places where previous

immigrants from the same country already live. Specifically, we use the fraction of Mexican immigrants

in a city in 1970 as an instrument for the relative inflow rate of low-skilled immigration to the city over

the 1980-90 period, while controlling for historical differences in native mobility patterns. Use of this

Asupply side@ instrument gives no indication that unobserved skill-group specific demand shocks can

explain the relative flows of native workers in response to immigrant inflows.




I. Data Issues

         Our analysis is based on microdata from the 1970, 1980, and 1990 Decennial Censuses. Use

of these data immediately raises two important conceptual issues: (1) the definition of skill groups; and

(2) the definition of Alocal@ labor markets. The definition of skill groups is potentially important to our

analysis since we wish to compare the relative migration responses of natives who are in most direct

competition with newly-arriving immigrants, and ultimately evaluate the effect of immigration on the

distribution of human capital. One natural way is to use information on occupation.2 Specifically, we

first construct three equally sized occupational groups for each Census year, based on average weekly


2
 The literature has adopted several different skill classification systems: by demographic characteristics such as
gender, age, and education; by location in the wage distribution; and others. Each of the alternatives can be easily
criticized. For example, if foreign education is less valuable in the U.S. labor market, then immigrants with a specific
level of education may compete most directly with natives in a lower education category. Moreover, the process of
assimilation implies that immigrants with given characteristics compete at a lower rung of the job market when they
first enter the country, and then gradually move up the ladder as they accumulate language skills and country-
specific human capital. Finally, distinctions between some demographic groups (for example, between men and
women with the same level of education) may artificially limit the degree of competition we measure between
immigrants and natives. As a practical matter, our experience suggests that different methods of defining skill groups
lead to very similar results.

                                                           5
                                                      6

wages in each occupation. Next, for each year and for each of four gender/nativity groups, we fit

multinomial logit models for the probability of working in the three occupation groups. These models

include flexible functions of the usual human capital variables: education, race, labor market experience,

and (for the immigrant groups) country of origin and year of arrival in the US. The models also include

detailed geographic controls that control for any distortions in the occupation distribution caused by

immigration or other factors. We use these models to assign to all adults (workers and nonworkers) a

set of probabilities for working in each of the three occupations in a nationally representative labor

market. These probabilities are then used to compute estimates of the relative population of natives and

immigrants in each of the three skill groups in each city. (For example, the number of immigrants in the

lowest skill group in a city is weighted count of immigrants in the city, using as a weight the probability of

working in the lowest occupation group.)

        Appendix Table 1 provides a brief overview of the gender and nativity characteristics of our

three skill groups in each Census year. As one would expect, women are over-represented in the

lowest skill group. In 1970, the occupational distribution of immigrant men is very similar to that of

native men, consistent with the relatively similar wage levels of immigrant and native men at that time

(Butcher and DiNardo, 1998). By 1990, however, immigrant men are substantially over-represented in

the lowest skill group, reflecting the declining education levels and changing country of origin of post-

1965 immigrants. Of particular interest are Mexican immigrants, who by 1990 represent about one-

quarter of all immigrants. As shown in the bottom row of Appendix Table 1, both Mexican men and

women are highly concentrated in the lowest skill group.


                                                      6

        The definitions of the local labor markets used in our analysis are similarly important. Previous

work has used both state-level data (e.g., BFK (1997)) or Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) level

data. As we document below, one limitation of a state-level approach is that there are important

differences in native and immigrant population flows even within the same state. The smallest

geographic that can be easily made consistent across Censuses is the MSA. As a practical matter, we

therefore limit our attention to 119 larger MSAs that had relatively stable geographic boundaries

between 1970 and 1990. These cities range in size (in terms of population aged 16-68) from 150,000

to 5.8 million in 1970, and from 128,000 to 5.9 million in 1990.3

         A brief overview of the remarkable inter-city differences in population growth rates and

changes in the skill distribution over the period from 1980 to 1990 is provided by Table 1. Panel A

decomposes the adult population growth rate for selected MSAs in our sample into components

attributable to natives and immigrants. Panel B does the same for the relative growth rate of the

lowest skill group (i.e. the growth rate of the population of the lowest skill group minus the growth rate

for the total population). There is much heterogeneity in population growth across cities (even in the

same state), and in the relative contributions of immigrants and natives to total population growth and the

growth of the low-skilled population. In California, for example, Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Jose

all experienced large increases in the size of their (disproportionately low-skilled) immigrant populations.

San Diego had a rapidly rising native population, San Jose=s native population was roughly constant,


3
 However, even at the level of the MSA , changing geographic definitions do not make a simple match across the
1970, 1980, and 1990 Censuses straightforward for all MSAs. In cases where there have been significant changes in
the composition of MSAs we have used the county group codes to make them as comparable as possible. See
Jaeger, Loeb, Turner, and Bound (1999).

and Los Angeles saw the size of its native-born population fall 6 percent. In Florida, Miami and Tampa

both experienced similar increases in total population, although the increase was virtually all immigrants

in Miami and mainly natives in Tampa. Interestingly, this difference was associated with a sharp

increase in the relative size of the low-skilled population in Miami, but a more stable relative skill

distribution in Tampa.4 Finally, New York, Chicago, and Philadelphia all had relatively small changes in

their immigrant populations, but experienced sizeable declines in their native-born populations.




II. Empirical Framework

         Our analysis proceeds by observing that both the area analyses and the Ageneral equilibrium@

approach of BFK (1997) begin with the presumption that the extent to which immigrant population

inflows affect the relative wage and employment outcomes of the nativeCborn depends on the extent to

which inflows change the proportion of the population in different skill groups (DiNardo (1997)). For

instance, in a model in which each city produces a nationally-traded output using a production function

that depends on a CES-aggregate of different labor types, wages will be related to local skill group

shares by an equation of the form:

         log wjc = !1/(σ+ε) log (Pjc/Pc) + uj + uc + ejc




where wjc denotes the wage of skill group j in city c, Pjc is the population of skill group j in city c and Pc


4
 The fact that total population growth in Miami was similar to that in Tampa (and other Florida cities) has been used
by some analysts (e.g,. Borjas, 1994) to argue that the 1980 Mariel Boatlift had no net effect on Miami=s population.
As shown in Table 1, however, this misses the fact that the relative size of the unskilled population increased very
rapidly in Miami relative to Tampa or most other cities.
                                                          8

is the total population of the city, σ is the elasticity of substitution across skill groups, ε is the elasticity

of labor supply (assumed to be common across skill groups), uj represents a fixed effect for skill group

j, uc is a city effect reflecting permanent differences in productivity across cities, and ejc is an error

component reflecting city-specific relative demand shocks and other factors.5 If immigrant inflows are

proportional to the existing distribution of skills (or if native outflows completely Aundo@ immigrant

inflows), then a rise in the immigrant population will have no effect on the structure of wages. If

immigrant inflows lead to a rise in the relative share of a particular skill group, however, then the relative

wage of that group would be expected to fall.

         Assuming that the wage structure in different cities depends on the relative skill distribution (and

not on the total size of a city=s population), we direct our attention to the effect of immigration inflows on

the relative fraction of workers in the three skill groups described above. The use of skill shares has the

appealing feature that the empirical results are not likely to be too sensitive to the definition of the

appropriate labor market. For instance, aggregating two identical regions leaves the predictions for

relative wages unchanged. Moreover, changes in the boundaries of an MSA (such as occurred in

many cities over the 1970-90 period) would not necessarily distort relative skill shares, although they

would lead to spurious changes in overall population.

         For our empirical analysis it is useful to decompose changes in log (Pjc/Pc) into a component

determined by immigrant population changes, and a component determined by native population


5
 We are assuming that each worker in each skill group supplies a fixed number of units of labor, if he or she decides
to work, and that the fraction who work is a constant elasticity function of the wage, with elasticity ε.
See Card (2000) for details.

                                                          9
                                                      10

changes. The total population of a city and the population in each skill group can be written as the sum

of the populations of immigrants, M and natives, N (i.e. Pc = Mc + Nc ). Using this fact, the change in

the log of the fraction of the population in skill group j in city c is approximately

(1)     ∆log (Pjc/Pc) = ( ∆Mjc/Pjc - ∆Mc/Pc )        + ( ∆Njc/Pjc - ∆Nc/Pc ) .

The first term in (1) is relative growth rate of the population of skill group j attributable to immigrants B

which we call the Arelative growth rate of immigrants in skill group j@ -- while the second term is the

corresponding contribution of natives B which we call the Arelative growth rate of natives in skill group

j@. With this decomposition in hand, we next posit a simple behavioral equation summarizing the

reaction of natives to changes in the relative supply of immigrants in their own skill group:

(2)       ( ∆Njc/Pjc - ∆Nc/Pc ) = a + b ( ∆Mjc/Pjc - ∆Mc/Pc )         + vjc

where vjc is a skill group and city-specific error term. This equation implies that the overall change in

the log population share of a specific skill group is related to the relative immigrant inflow rate for that

skill group by:

      ∆log (Pjc/Pc) = a + (1+ b) ( ∆Mjc/Pjc - ∆Mc/Pc )           + vjc .

If native-born location decisions fully offset immigrant inflows the coefficient b is equal to !1, and we

have the Askating rink@ model: local skill shares are unaffected by immigrant inflows. Moreover, a value

of b close to !1 suggests a Ademographic balkanization@: inflows of low-skilled immigrants will cause

low-skilled natives to move out, causing cities that experience such inflows to become increasingly high-

immigrant. At the opposite extreme, a value of b=0 implies that the mobility decisions of natives in a

particular skill group are not differentially affected by immigrant inflows in the same skill group. A


                                                      10
                                                     11

value of b=0 does not imply that native location decisions are insensitive to immigrant inflows B only that

the population changes of natives in different skill groups are not affected by the relative inflow rate of

immigrants in the same skill group.

        We use data on population changes from 1980 to 1990 for 119 large MSA=s to derive two

estimates of the coefficient b in equation (2). In view of the strong focus of the recent literature on low-

skilled migrants, we first use data for our lowest skill group (providing us with one observation per city).

 In a second set of specifications, we pool data for all three skill groups and include unrestricted city

fixed effects. These effects capture any unobserved city-level factors (such as local demand shocks)

that might be correlated with immigrant inflows and native migration flows.

        As a first specification test, we augment the simple model of equation (2) with a set of plausibly

exogenous covariates to allow for the possibility (raised by BFK, 1997) that a simple first-differenced

specification may not adequately capture the dynamics of population change. (Note that our use of

relative growth rates may partially obviate this concern.) Specifically, we include the relative growth of

the native population over the period 1970-1980 (i.e., the lagged dependent variable) and the fraction

of immigrants in the relevant skill group in 1980. We also include measures of city population growth

over the periods 1970-1980 and 1980-1990 in the models for the lowest skill group that exclude city

fixed effects.

        Columns (1)-(2) and (5)-(6) of Table 2 display the results of estimating equation (2) by

weighted ordinary least squares (OLS). The estimates show no evidence that native outmigration rises

in response to immigrant inflows. In our basic specification in the first row of column (1), the point


                                                     11
                                                      12

estimate of b for the lowest skill group is 0.12 with a standard error of 0.07. This suggests, if anything,

that a relative inflow of unskilled immigrants leads to a (slight) increase in the relative growth of the

unskilled native population. Column (5) displays results from a similar model fit to data for all 3 skill

groups and including city fixed effects. The point estimate for b is very similar. The addition of controls

for pre-existing trends in relative population growth and for the fraction of immigrants in the city in 1980

in columns (2) and (6) yields estimates of b that are somewhat more imprecise but generally similar to

the results from the simpler specifications in columns (1) and (5).

        Some additional insight into the OLS results is provided by Figure 1, which presents a simple

bivariate plot of the relative growth of the low skilled population against the relative growth of the low

skilled immigrant population. For reference, the figure also includes the 45 degree line (corresponding

to b=0 in our regression specifications) and a horizontal line at 0 (b=!1, the skating rink model). Given

the large immigrant inflows to many California cities, it is interesting to note that the individual MSAs of

the state are scattered fairly evenly around the 45 degree line. Fresno, Los Angeles and Riverside are

all above the 45 degree line, reflecting the fact that the relative size of the unskilled native population

actually grew slightly over the 1980-90 period, despite relative inflows of unskilled immigrants. On the

other hand, Anaheim, San Diego and Oakland are all slightly below the 45 degree line, reflecting small

declines in the relative size of the unskilled native population. Also interesting is the fact that no city

experienced a large relative outflow of low-skilled immigrants over the 1980-90 period.

        A possible objection to inferences based on the scatter in Figure 1 (or the OLS estimates in

Table 2) is that immigrant and native population growth patterns may be driven by city-and skill-group-


                                                      12
                                                      13

specific relative demand shocks that attract natives and immigrants in the same skill group to certain

cities. In the presence of such shocks, OLS estimates of b will tend to be upward biased. Suppose,

however, that some part of immigrant inflows are determined by supply-side considerations B

specifically, the tendency of recent immigrants to locate in cities with a large number of previous

migrants from their country (Bartel, 1989). In that case, we can use the existing stock of immigrants

from a specific country as an instrumental variable for changes in the immigrant skill share. One effect

of the changes in immigration laws that occurred in the 1960s was a rapid increase in the number of

immigrants from Mexico. The existence of enclave effects suggests that the fraction of Mexican

immigrants in a city in 1970 (largely before the big supply shock) can serve as a potential instrumental

variable for later immigrant inflows, and particularly for the relative inflow of the lowest skill group. In

Figure 2, we present a simple plot of the relative growth rate of low skill immigrants over the 1980-90

period against the percent of Mexican immigrants in each city in 1970. As predicted by the enclave

hypothesis, there is a strong positive association between the two.

        Columns (3)-(4) and (7)-(8) of Table 2 present instrumental variables (IV) estimation results for

equation (2) using the fraction of Mexican immigrants in the appropriate skill group in the city in 1970 as

an instrumental variable for the relative growth of the immigrant population in the skill group. Perhaps

surprisingly, in every case the IV point estimate of the coefficient b is larger (i.e., more positive) that the

corresponding OLS estimate. One possible explanation for this pattern is that the OLS estimates are

downward biased by measurement errors in the immigrant inflow rates. This is quite plausible, given

slippage in our definition of skill groups, and possible errors arising from changes in the geographic


                                                      13
                                                     14

boundaries of cities. As with the OLS models, the addition of controls for previous native population

flows and the fraction of immigrants in 1980 has little effect on the IV estimates of b.

        A growing literature has stressed the potential problems with IV methods when the instrumental

variable is only weakly related to the endogenous variable (see e.g. Bound, Jaeger, and Baker, 1995).

To address this concern, the last row of Table 2 reports the t-statistics associated with the coefficient on

our instrumental variable (the fraction of Mexican immigrants in the city in 1970) in the first-stage

equation. Confirming the impression from Figure 2, the coefficient on the instrumental variable is highly

significant, with t-ratios ranging from 4.77 to 13.51. Thus, weak instruments are not a particular

concern.




III. Caveats and Conclusions

        Using data from the 1970, 1980, and 1990 Censuses, we investigated the extent to which skill

group specific changes in the immigrant population across various MSAs has led to a flight of similarly

skilled native-born individuals from these MSAs. Contrary to the Ademographic balkanization@

hypothesis, our point estimates suggest that, if anything, increases in immigrant population in specific skill

groups lead to small increases in the population of native-born individuals of the same skill group. This

pattern also suggests that systematic out-migration by the native born is unlikely to provide an

explanation of the small measured effects of immigration on the labor market outcomes of the native

born found in most Aarea analyses.@ Indeed, we find that immigration has had quite significant impacts

endogenous shifts in industry structure, rather than by rapid adjustments in the native population.

Notes: The occupational groups include one-third of all wage and salary
workers ages 16-68 in each year. Occupations are grouped based on average
weekly wages. The excess distributions in columns 4-6 show the difference in
the percent of the specific nativity-gender group in the occupation, relative
to native men.

Notes: Standard errors in parentheses. Models in columns 1-4 fit to observations for 119
metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs): dependent variable in these models is the relative
growth in the native population in skill group 1 between 1980 and 1990. Models in columns
5-8 are fit to pooled data for three skill groups in 119 MSAs: dependent variable in these
models is the skill-group specific relative growth in the native population. In the IV
models, the relative growth of the immigrant population in the same skill group is treated
as endogenous. For models in columns 3-4 instrument is the fraction of Mexican immigrants
in the city in 1970. For models in columns 7-8, instrument is the skill-group specific
fraction of Mexican immigrants in 1970.
