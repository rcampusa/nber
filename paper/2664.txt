                                      ABSTRACT


     Casual examination of annual postwar    data on inventories and aggregate
output for   seven developed countries--Canada,   France, West Germany,   Italy,

Japan, United Kingdom,   United States- -suggests that in these countries the

primary function of aggregate inventories is not to smooth aggregate output
in the face of aggregate demand shocks.     Japan is a possible exception to

this generalization.

L   Introduction

                         recent                                              smooth
      A number of                  papers have consideredwhether inventories

output fluctuations in the United States (e.g.,

not, however,         seem to have been much research on this question, for other

countries.1          This paper is a preliminary attempt to help fill this gap.

      It uses annual postwar data from the seven 'G7" countries- -Canada,
                                                                   and the United
France, West Germany,             Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom

States-   -   to   see whether aggregate inventories serve mainly to buffer aggregate

                                        For all these countries,      except possibly Japan,
output from demand shocks.
the answer seems to be no, in two senses.                First, aggregate         output (measured

                                       than aggregate final sales. Second,
by either GOP or GNP) is more variable
                                                         with output rising
positive sales shocks tend to make inventories increase,

more than one to one with such shocks. As is well known for the U.S., then,
                                                          consistent with the
aggregate          inventory behavior does not seem to be

production smoothing model of             liolt   et al. (1960).

      It should be emphasized            that this is a first, preliminary effort in what

is likely to be a somewhat larger research project.                   Sinte I have yet to


obtain quarterly data, I have yet to be able, for example, to replicate for

other countries Blinder's (1981) calculations of the contribution of U.S.

                   fluctuations    to peak to trough falls    itt   U.S.   GNP.    I also have yet
inventory
                                                                        this
to obtain a figure for the level (as opposed to change) in inventories;

precludes          computation    of such elementary statistics as a mean inventory-sales

ratio.        In addition, my approach is casual, and no standard errors have been

calculated.

      Let         be   real aggregate output, St real aggregate final sales, Ht real

aggregate      inventories.      The variables       are linked by the identity
                                                                                Q_S+tsH.
      Much recent U.S. research on inventories has assumed a variant of the

Holt et    al.    (1961) production smoothing model.            The representative   firm

minimizes the expected present discounted value of coats over an infinite

horizon, with a constant discount rate.                  In a general version of this model,

per period costs are



                                                 +
(1)            ao(AQ+u1)2 +       a1(Q+u2)2          a2(H-a3ES1+u3)2,

where: the a. are positive parameters;               the      are zero mean iid cost shocks;


Et denotes mathematical expectations conditional on period t                  information.
The three      tens in    (1) capture costs of changing production,           costs of

production and costs of having inventories deviate from a target level.                     See

West (1986) for further discussion.              Constant and linear tens are allowed in

the empirical work but are omitted from (1) for simplicity.

      Iwill consider two implications that follow when the model is
specialized, as in Blinder (1982) or Belsley (1969), so that inventories serve
mainly    to buffer output from demand fluctuations.               This requires that a2a3 be

small relative to a           and a1   and that the costs shocks u.tt have minor effects
                          0

(e.g., because the standard deviation of cost shocks is small relative to that

of demand shocks).         The first of my two tests looks at some sample moments.

The specialized model suggests that production                     should be smoother than
                                                              Q
demand           inventories will be adjusted to avoid the costs that result when
          S:
the level or change of production is varied.                 Let   "var" denote variance,
"corr"    correlation.        The model then suggests

See West (1986) for a formal argument for the firat two inequalities.                             The

laat inequality follows from the first, since var(Q) —                          vsr(S)    +   var(AH)    +

countercylical.

        The first inequality does not make sense if variables have unit roots.

One can, however, calculate           an analogue to var(Q)var(S) that has a

                                                    even in the presence of unit roots.            See
meaningful population counterpart,

below.

        A second test of the model looks at how inventories respond to sales

shocks.     If the cost of having inventories deviate from a target level is

                                                                     inventories should be drawn down

when there is a positive sales shock.                        (This does not hold under all

circumstances.         See Blinder (1986).)             One admittedly crude way to check this

is to suppose that only lagged sales are used to forecast future sales.

Suppose that the sales process follows an autoregression,

      By algebra such as in Blanchard (1983), the decision rule for inventories

III. Results

A. Data

      Annual data on nominal and real GNP or GDP and on nominal change in

inventories was taken from the International                   Financial      Statistics       tape of the

International    Monetary Fund.          Annual rather than quarterly data were used in

part because they seem likely to be more reliable: figures on inventory

investment in Germany, for example, are benchmarked againat data on inventory
                                                      5


levels only annually, with preliminary quarterly figures simply computed as a

residual    (OECD, 1981, p13).          The definition of inventory investment,

                 does not appear to be identical in all countries,              since there
incidentally,

seems to be some variation in the treatment of certain stocks held by the

government    (OECD (1967, 1972, 1981)).

     Data were available 1957-1986 for six of the countries, 1961-1986 for

Canada.     Aggregate    output Q was measured by GNP when this was available

                                                 GDP otherwise                  (Canada,
(Germany, Japan, United Kingdom, United States),

France, Italy).      For all countries,           the base year for the real data is 1980

and all data are expressed in billions of units of home currency.

     A deflator was calculated by dividing nominal by real output.                    Real

inventory investment            was calculatedby dividing the nominal IFS figure by

the deflator.     Real final sales S              was then computed as
                                                                         S — Q-id1.     A real

inventory series Ht was created by accumulating                 the changes in real

inventories:
                H1
                     —
                         H1,   H2
                                    —
                                        H1
                                             +   2'   etc.   (The IFS tape does not seem to

supply a figure for the level of inventories.)                  All such manufactured values

of Ht are of course too low by a constant value of H0, the presample value of

the inventory stock. Note that the series being off by a constant will affect

only the constant term in regressions, and will leave estimates of, for

example, variances        and correlations         unchanged.

        My procedure for computing a real series for Hr and                  is nonetheless


unsatisfactory in that it uses the output deflator to convert the inventory

data.     In the U.S., at least, a more subtle and complicated procedure is
                                                                dollar
employed by the Department of Commerce in constructing constant

inventory    series (Hinrichs and Eckman (1983)).               To get an idea of how

substantial     are the biases induced by my deflation procedure,              I compared the
                                            6

deflated IFS data for the United States to the constant dollar Department of

Commerce data, with the latter obtained from Citibase.            The reaults ate in

Table I, with notes at the foot of the table describing the procedure used.

Since the Department    of Commerce is the source for the IFS data, the

correlation between the two real GNP series is virtually perfect           (Table I,

panel A).     (See below for the qualifier      "virtually.")    The differing    deflation

procedures    led to only slight discrepancies between the two seta of inventory

and sales figures, with correlations of about         .99,   in levels or differences

(panel A).     In addition, the correlation of moments within each data act are

very close.     Compare panels B and C.     (Note that the figures for Q and       Q     are

not identical,    for the two data sets.     I believe that the minor discrepancies

resulted because of errors introduced when I converted the Department of

Commerce data from its 1982 base year to the 1980 base year that IFS usea.)

     It seems from Table    I, then,    that the use of an output deflator to

deflate nominal data on inventory investment         introduces only very slight

errors.     I will therefore proceed on the tentative aasumption that tF            ae   of

data deflated in this way is unlikely to introduce serious biases.

B. Emøirical Results

     Columns (2) to (4) of Table II report inequalities           (2a) to (2c).    Column

(5) reports essentially a measure of war(Q)-var(S)           that is legitimate    in the


presence of unit roots; inequality (2a) indicates that this difference should

be positive.     Column (5) was calculated as described in West (1987), using

five lags of         Column   (6)   is presented   to scale the column (5) figure.
               AS.
With the possible exception of Japan, the well known U.S. experience is

typical- -aggregate output is about 15 to 100 per cent more variable than final

sales (columns (1) and (2)).        In Japan, however, output is not even 10 percent
                                                7

more variable.     Column   (5)   indicates    that the column (2) result is not a

spurious result of inappropriate        treatment of unit roots- -output is more

variable than sales even when unit roots are explicitly allowed.                In all

countries   but Japan, in-antory investment is procyclical            (column (3)).

     Table III contains the impulse response functions of inventories                 to a


positive sales shock, of magnitude one 1980 unit of home currency (e.g.                ,    one

1980 French franc, for France).         Panel A presents the results when (3) and (4)

were estimated in levels, panel B when a unit root was imposed in (3).                     The


lag length q was set to 2; the Q statistic          in all of the regrsaions suggested

that this sufficed to whiten the residuals.           Deterministic    terms were included

as described in note 2 to Table        I.     Detailed regreasion results are in an

appendix available from the author on request.
     To read the table, consider the entry for Canada in panel A.               If sales

unexpectedly rise by one Canadian dollar, inventories initially rise by 42

Canadian cents.     The next year they rise by an additional          9 cents   (9—52-41),

before beginning to fall back toward their trend line.           Although for panel B

equation    (3) was estimated     in differences, the figures in panel B apply to the

level and not the difference of inventories.

     A poaitive sales shock initially causes inventories to rise: with the

exception of Japan, in differences, all entries in year 0 are positive.                     In

differenced specifications,       the year 5 figure suggests that a positive aalea

shock also causes a rise in the steady state level of inventories, again with

the exception of Japan.




III. Conclusion

     Casual examination of annual postwar data suggests that in the "C]" group
of countries aggregate inventories do not serve mainly to smooth output

fluctuations    in the face of aggregate demand shocks.   Japan provides a

possible exception, although even in Japan production smoothing behavior, if

present,    is not particularly marked.   That inventory behavior is qualitatively

similar in these countries is consistent with Moore (1978), whith gives the

level and change in inventories the same position in the NEER reference      cycle

in each of the seven countries.

     A simple extension of this work is to consider quarterly data as well, at

least in those countries where the quarterly data are reasonably reliable.

The work of Wilkinson (1986) suggests that quarterly results are likely to be

broadly similar, although it also suggests that at quarterly frequencies

Japanese inventory behavior is not qualitatively different from that of the

other countries.    More generally, desireable areas for future research include

considering the role of inventories in business cycles in light of

international   differences in tax systems, in the degree to which various

economies   are open, and in the sources of business cycle shocks.
Footnotes

1. In a paper that I became aware of only after drafting the present paper,

Wilkinson (1986) touches on whether inventories smooth production, for exactly

the countries   considered in this paper.   Wilkinson's   main focus, however,   is


estimation of a general model of inventory demand for a subset of these

countries.

     This appendix presents the regressions that underlie the impulse

responses    in Table III.    The variable "CONA" is a dummy that is one before

1973, zero afterwards;       TREND" is    a trend term, set to one in 1957, two in

1958, etc.    (except for Canada, where TREND was set to one in 1961, etc.);

TRENDA is defined as CONA*TREND;         "DS" is the first difference of
                                                                           St.

2. For columns (5) and (6), units are billions of real (1980) units of home
currency, squared.
3. As explained in the text, column (5) essentially calculates var(Q)-var(S)
in a fashion that is robust to the presence of unit roots. Column (6) is
presented solely for comparison to column (5).
