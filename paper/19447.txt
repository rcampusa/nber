                                             ABSTRACT

We estimate price regressions for surgical procedures used to treat colon cancer, a leading cause of
cancer mortality. Using a claims database for self-insured employers, we focus on transaction prices,
rather than more commonly available billing data that do not reflect actual payments made. Although
the responsiveness of prices to hospital performance depends on the impact of quality on the slope
of the quantity-demand of the payers, which are not known a priory, it is often assumed that higher
performing hospitals are able to command higher prices. To test this hypothesis we construct performance
rankings, based on hospital excess-mortality and incorporate them into our price models. We are interested
in the type information available to large payers who negotiate prices on behalf of their members.
To get a cancer-specific index we emulate the widely-reported risk-adjustment methodology used
in the federal Hospital Compare reporting system for ranking cardiac performance. The effects were
consistently negative in all models (adverse quality reduces price), though not significant. However,
we observe a rational pricing structure whereby higher treatment complexity is reflected in higher
price differentials, controlling for patient characteristics and market structure.

1      Introduction


       There is a growing recognition among policy makers that in order to make

informed decisions, consumers of health care services need to possess information on

both prices and quality. Similarly insurers and large group purchasers require information

on quality and performance in order to negotiate prices with providers in their networks.

Interest in this issue has prompted CMS to develop the Hospital Compare web site. As of

April 2005 this site provided consumers with quality indicators for major medical

conditions, in approximately 4,700 acute care community hospitals. The featured

medical conditions were heart attacks (acute myocardial infarction), heart failure, and

pneumonia; quality indicators were based on process of care measures associated with

each of these conditions1. Due to the difficulty in interpreting over 30 disparate process

measures and a greater emphasis on outcome-based measures in policy discourse, CMS

began to report post-discharge hospital mortality rates for these conditions beginning in

2008. In 2009 CMS also began to report Medicare allowed charges for related

procedures. However, these charges reflect mostly fixed rates paid to hospitals for

treating Medicare beneficiaries, and apply to broad diagnostic categories used in the

Medicare payment formula; they do not necessarily reflect actual hospital prices in the

private segment of the market.

       While these reporting systems represent progress, consumer confusion over ‘fair’

pricing continues to be widespread, particularly in private markets for hospital services

1
 Process measures ranged from smoking cessation counseling for pneumonia or contraindicated
aspirin for AMI to surgical safety. The complete list is available at
www.hospitalcompare.hhs.gov. Process measures associated with hospitalizations due to
childhood asthma were also added in subsequent years.




                                                                                              3
(Reinhardt, 2006; RWJF, 2013). Anecdotal press accounts often tell of individual

consumers able to negotiate price discounts from hospitals using information gleaned

from Hospital Compare and similar state based reporting systems, while consumer-

oriented internet sites and blogs appear to reflect frustration over the lack of information

regarding costly procedures left out of the published lists2. Most recently, a broader

release of the CMS charge data has garnered substantial media attention, but its

applicability to privately insured segment of the market remains contestable (Meier et al.,

2013). A related issue of interest is the association between hospital performance

measures and prices. While price transparency is intended to inject price competition

overall (Ginsburg, 2007; GAO, 2011), it has been suggested that higher performing

hospitals may be able to command higher prices if prices are negotiated with well-

informed insurers (Cutler and Dafny, 2011).

       In this study we focus on the example of colorectal cancer, and the inpatient

surgical procedure associated with it, colon resection. We have two objectives. First, we

examine the distribution of prices in the private segment of the market. Second, we assess

the association between hospital performance and prices using a mortality-based outcome

measure similar to that found in hospital report cards such as Hospital Compare. Note




2
 Related to the procedure of main interest in this study, colon resection (also referred to as
colectomy), an anxious patient asks, without getting a definitive reply: “…Please can someone
give me a ballpark figure on how much the surgery to remove a tumor in the lower part of the
colon would run? I need to know because I want to raise money because we currently don't have
health coverage….”, www.healthboards.com (accessed 4/30/11).




                                                                                                 4
that we rely on transaction prices, namely actual payments made to hospitals by third

party payers3 (Capps and Dranove, 2004; Dor, Grossman and Koroukian, 2004).

        The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides background and context on

colorectal cancer and related procedures. Section 3 describes data sources and estimating

sample. Section 4 lays out the conceptual framework, including specification of our

price models, definition of our mortality-based hospital performance measure, and simple

theoretical motivation. The results are discussed in section 5, followed by conclusions in

section 6. In the Appendix, construction of the hospital performance measures is

explained in greater detail.




2       Colorectal Cancer


        In the U. S., colorectal cancer accounts for approximately 147,000 cases and

almost 50,000 deaths annually, making it the second leading cause of death among all

cancers, following lung cancer. Treatment usually involves surgical removal of the

affected portion of the colon (resection), with the type and extent of resection dependent

on the location of the tumor. Other than the importance of colon cancer nationally, we

chose to focus our analysis on colon cancer for two reasons. First, this surgery is

performed on an inpatient basis only; in contrast to surgeries for other common cancers


3
  For the most part, prices are negotiated between hospitals and managed care organizations,
PPOs and other group purchasers, rather than between hospitals and individuals (Capps and
Dranove, 2004; Dor, Grossman, and Koroukian, 2004). Consumer-directed health plans (CDHP)
are an exception, currently accounting for only 13% of privately insured individuals nationally,
but are negligible in the earlier period spanning our data.. Although states may offer CDHPs
through their state health insurance exchanges, it remains to be seen if enrollments in such plans
will grow or decline with the implementation of health reform (Claxton et al., 2010).




                                                                                                 5
such as breast cancer for which surgeries may be performed on an outpatient basis as

well. Second, in the case of colorectal cancer, there is no discretionary choice of therapy

so all patients receive surgery treatment, unlike the example of prostate cancer where

surgery and radiation are equally viable alternatives (Jacobson et al., 2010).

Consequently, the price of colorectal surgery is more clearly defined and identifiable in

insurance claims databases. Variants of the procedure include total surgery, in which the

entire colon is removed, partial surgery, in which an incision is made to remove part of

the colon, and less invasive laparoscopic surgery. Surgeries are performed on an

emergency basis only when intestinal obstruction or perforation occurs (Diggs et al.,

2007).



3        Data and Sample

3.1      Data sources

         The main database used is the MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters

file (CCE) which assembles complete insurance claims for approximately 100 large

employers who self insure. We extracted claims for hospitalizations for employees and

dependents with a diagnosis of colorectal cancer who underwent surgical treatment,

namely colon resection. Unlike hospital discharge data which provide charges, claims

databases reflect actual payments made to hospitals, namely transaction prices (see Dor,

Grossman, Koroukian, 2004, and Dor, Koroukian, Grossman 2004). Other variables

include the type of benefit plan administered by the employer, and comorbidities

associated with the patient’s main diagnosis, descriptors of the type and complexity of the

surgery, and demographic characteristics. Due to strict confidentiality requirement in the




                                                                                              6
data, the identity of employer is not known. However, for purposes of this study, hospital

ids were made available so that hospital characteristics could be linked, provided that the

identity of individual hospitals remained confidential. Hospital characteristics were

taken from the American Hospital Association (AHA) Annual Survey and the Area

Resource File (ARF) provided an additional variable on HMO penetration in the market

area. The AHA survey provided a crosswalk to Hospital Referral Areas (HRRs). All of

the source files were pooled for the years 2002-20074. We kept only hospitals that

performed more than 20 colorectal cancer surgeries per year. The final sample consisted

of 5,293 cases of commercially insured individuals with matching hospital ids. Of these,

4,187 underwent partial colon resection, and 1,106 had total resection. The number of

hospitals performing colon resections in the combined data ranged from 715 in 2002 to

998 in 2005.

       Finally, hospital-level 30-day mortality rates for colorectal cancer admissions

were calculated from the Medicare Provider Analysis and Review (MEDPAR) files for

all hospitals matching hospitals in our data, for the years 2000-2007. These mortality

rates were transformed into standardized performance measures, which are described in

detail in our Methods Section. Summary statistics for the final analysis file are provided

in Table 1.



3.2    Colorectal surgery prices by procedure variant

       The distribution of transaction prices by the variant of colorectal surgery and

hospital type are shown in Figure 1. The mean for all the procedures combined was

 We obtained the additional years of MEDPAR to allow for inclusion of three-year moving
averages of mortality ratios



                                                                                             7
$21,990 (2007 dollars). Four surgical variants are considered, namely partial resection,

total resection, emergency cases and laparoscopy cases (colostomy, a follow up

procedure to construct a colon bypass is rarely performed at the same admission). There

were no statistically significant differences between partial and total resections5.

Interestingly, laparoscopy which involves a more novel technology but is minimally

invasive, was priced at $19,183.55 (grand mean), 14.3% below the $22,382.66 price for

open surgery (grand mean), except when performed in for-profit hospitals. As expected,

surgeries performed on an emergency basis were priced well above non-emergency

surgeries, ($30,141.13 and $20,739.38 respectively). Similar differences were found in all

hospital categories.

        We further compare prices between hospital types within the ownership, teaching,

and system affiliation categories. Tests indicated that generally, prices in public, for-

profit, and non-profit hospitals were statistically different at the 99% significance level.

However, prices in teaching and non-teaching hospitals, and system-affiliated and

independent hospitals were not significantly different for any of the variants of the

surgical procedure.

 Colostomy is a surgical opening that connects the colon to the surface of the abdomen,
providing a new pathway for waste materials. It is often done as a follow up to colon surgery,
when medical risk necessitates. However, in or data it was rarely performed within the initial
hospital stay for the main surgery. Colostomy added substantially to the price, up from $20,276 to
$29,585 in the case of total resection, and from $19,946 to $29,892 for partial, a difference of
45.9% or 49.9% respectively. For a more detailed description of the underlying procedures see
Diggs et al., 2007.




                                                                                                8
4       Analytical and Conceptual Framework

4.1     Simple theoretical insights

        Although it may be natural to assume that higher quality is associated with higher

prices, this may not necessarily be the case. To see this generally, let the hospital

maximize6:

         = PX(P, Q) – C[X(P, Q), Q],                                   (1)

where P is price, X is output, Q is quality, and C is total cost. Price is the choice variable

of interest, while Q is exogenous. The first-order condition for price is

        P = X(P, Q) + PXP(P, Q) - CX[X(P, Q), Q]XP(P, Q) = 0. (2)

The notation XP(P, Q) is used to denote that XP depends on P and Q.

        Now consider the effect of an increase in Q on P. From the total differential of P

and the implicit function theorem

        dP    
             PQ
        dQ     PP

Since PP is negative by the second-order condition for profit maximization, we have

sign(dP/dQ) = sign(PQ). Solving PQ and rearranging we get,

        PQ = XQ + (P – CX)XPQ – XPCXXXQ - XPCXQ                        (3)

The sign of the first term on the right-hand side of equation (3) is positive while the signs

of the last three terms are ambiguous. However, by imposing a few reasonable

assumptions on the hospital’s structure, it can be shown that sign(dP/dQ) depends on how

quality affects the slope of the demand curve. For instance, if CXX ≥ 0 and if CXQ ≥ 0,

6
  Dor and Farley (1996) use a similar framework to analyze the impacts of changes on regulated
prices (e.g., the Medicare prospective payment system) on quality. They allow X and Q to enter
the cost function multiplicatively, and find similar ambiguities.



                                                                                                 9
then πPQ > 0 (hence dP/dQ is positive) as long as XPQ = 0 or XPQ > 0. In the first case

(XPQ = 0), quality has no effect on the slope of the demand curve. The second case

(XPQ > 0) corresponds to the case where a quality improvement causes the slope of the

(quantity) demand curve to be steeper7 8.



4.2       Empirical Estimation

4.2.a Price regressions

          We model transaction prices for colon cancer surgeries adjusting for the

underlying clinical traits of the procedure, patient traits, hospital and insurer

characteristics, and local area market structure. The variable of greatest interest to us is

the hospital performance measure. We explore two alternative specifications of this

variable, the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) and the risk adjusted standardized

mortality ratio (RSMR). Detailed construction of these two variables is provided in the

next subsection.

          We model the transaction price using a generalized linear model (GLM) with a

log link and normal family (McCullagh and Nelder, 1989). It has been common practice

to model the logarithm of prices, E(ln(y|x)) = xβ but models that specify E(y|x)= exp(xβ)

are preferred for a number of reasons (Manning, 1998; Manning and Mullahy, 2001).

This allows us to report back-transformed coefficients without further adjustment,

additionally allowing us to express the results in terms of relative price differences (see

7
    Equivalently, an increase in price makes the (quantity) demand less sensitive to quality.
8
 It can easily be shown that the familiar price rule for the firm can be derived from eq. [1].
                     where ε is the price elasticity of demand. Here, the optimal price would not
change if CX (the marginal cost of quantity) and ε are constant (do not depend on X or Q).




                                                                                                10
below). Model selection criteria showed that the normal family was preferred to other

suitable candidates, e.g., Poisson and Gamma. Prices were adjusted for medical inflation

using the hospital component of CPI, and are expressed in 2007 levels.

        Construction of several variables included in the regression model requires further

explanation. Indicators of type and severity of surgery are as previously described.

Additionally, to adjust for patients' overall severity of illness and preexisting conditions

in both our mortality and price models, we used the list of comorbid conditions as

developed by Elixhauser et al. (1998), to define a scale of 0, 1, 2, 3+ conditions.9 We

also control for whether the patient received colostomy procedure during the surgery.

Separately, we accounted for the presence of metastatic cancer (ICD-9 codes 196.0-

199.1)10.

        Hospital characteristics were previously described. In addition, we control for

the type of benefit plan available to the employee from the self-insured employer.

Preferred provider organizations (PPOs) were the dominant form of benefit plans in our

data, accounting for about 63% of all patient encounters. They formed the reference

category; they were followed by other forms of fee-based plans, predominantly

comprehensive fee-for-service (there was a small number of cases with consumer-


9
  The Elixhauser index is based on a more comprehensive set of comorbid conditions than the
Charlson index, which is also widely used in the epidemiologic literature. We identified these
conditions through ICD-9 diagnosis codes documented in the inpatient datasets. In exploratory
side regressions, we observed no marked difference between models incorporating binary
indicators of the most prevalent conditions and the summary measure reported here.
10
  Cancer registry data incorporate the more detailed classification based on cancer staging,
conventionally ranked on a 1-4 scale. These data however, are available for a limited number of
states, and could not be matched to our data. Using claims data it was also possible to construct
the binary measure of metastases, indicating cancer spread (Cooper et al., 1999; Merkow et al.,
2013).




                                                                                                 11
directed health plans; these were included in the fee-based category). The next most

common type of benefit plan was fee-based plans, followed by point-of-service (POS)

plans. POS plans combine features of PPOs and traditional health maintenance

organizations (HMOs) whereby members are covered under capitation arrangements, but

are given the option of going to providers outside the network. Traditional HMOs, i.e.

closed panel HMO-type plans, formed the final and least common category; in our data

this category included a small number of cases in Exclusive Provider Organizations

(EPOs). EPOs are groups of medical care providers who have entered into written

agreements with the employer under capitation arrangements similar to HMOs.11

        In addition to the hospital characteristics previously described, we also included

an HRR-level hospital market structure variable, namely the Herfindahl-Hirschman index

(HHI) which measures market concentration in the area, defined as the sum of hospital

squared market shares. We explored two ways of defining HHI. First, we counted each

hospital as a separate entity. Second, in market areas with more than one hospital

belonging to a particular multi-hospital system, we summed the share of hospitals within

the system thereby counting them as one unit. All market shares were based on medical

and surgical admissions. As expected the system based index yielded greater market

concentration (Table 1). Since both HHI variables yielded similar results, we opted to

include the coefficients for the more commonly used hospital-based HHI in Tables 1 and




11
  Of the 791 of surgeries classified as fee-based in our sample only 22 were covered by consumer
directed health plans (CDHP). All other surgeries in this category were coded as comprehensive
fee-for-service (FFS). There was no statistical difference between prices in these plans. Of the
505 surgeries covered by HMOs, only 29 were coded as EPOs in our data.




                                                                                             12
212. County-level HMO penetration rates, aggregated to metropolitan areas were

obtained from the Health Resources and Services Administration's (HRSA) Area

Resource File (ARF). The HMO penetration rates reported in ARF were calculated by

dividing HMO enrollment data from the InterStudy County Surveyor Database by the

U.S. population estimates; the underlying enrollment data pertain to the enrollee

residence and do not rely upon HMO headquarters location. HHI and HMO penetration

were previously used as proxies for the hospital’s and the insurer’s bargaining power

(Dor, Grossman, and Koroukian, 2004).


       While we are precluded from identifying individual hospitals and employers in

these data, our analysis informs consumers and decision makers alike about the extent to

which performance and the complexity of the underlying medical case contributes to the

eventual pricing of a colorectal surgery.



4.2.b Hospital Performance Measures

       We focus on hospital mortality, which has formed the basis of hospital level

performance measures in numerous studies and in a variety of clinical settings, including

that of colon resection (Hayanga et al., 2010). In particular we consider two measures of

excess mortality, namely the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) and the risk standardized

mortality ratio (RSMR). The SMR is the relatively simpler measure, thus more likely to

have been accessible to various group purchasers in the study period for purposes of

actuarial calculations (Rothman, 2012). On the other hand the RSMR involves more


12
  Similarly, we experimented with hospital market shares based on the number of inpatient days;
however this affected the indices only marginally.



                                                                                             13
complex methodology and was recently incorporated into the Hospital Compare rating

system for the diagnoses of AMI and heart failure (CMS, 2012; Krumholz et al., 2005).

We replicated the statistical approach with some modifications in risk-adjustment

variables to reflect the diagnosis of colon cancer.

       The SMR is defined as the ratio of “actual” mortality to “expected” mortality in

the hospital. Actual mortality is calculated as the sample mortality rate for each hospital.

Expected mortality is calculated as the average of predictions from a logistic regression

that adjusts for patient-level characteristics and severity measures. RSMR is the ratio of

“predicted” to “expected” mortality rates in the hospital, where both the predicted

mortality rate and the expected mortality rate are estimated by Hierarchical (Random

effects) Logistic regression model (see Krumholz et al., 2006a, 2006b). The hierarchical

logistic regression incorporates a hospital-specific random intercept (which can be

interpreted as a measure of the hospital’s adverse quality) in addition to adjusting for

patient characteristics. The hospital predicted mortality is calculated as the average of

patient level predictions from the pooled model that take both effects of covariates and

estimated random intercepts into account. Here, expected mortality is the average of

predictions assuming that each hospital random intercept is zero, or in other words,

holding hospital quality constant.

       Further emulating the Hospital Compare methodology, we estimate predicted

mortality with Medicare administrative claims data, matching hospitals from this analysis

to hospitals in the main analysis file. We use 3-year moving averages of hospital-level

SMR and RSMR in our regression analyses.




                                                                                            14
5      Results


       Table 2 allows for a comparison of results from price regressions using our

alternative definitions of hospital performance, namely the standardized mortality ratio

(SMR), and the risk-standardized mortality ratio, the RSMR. While the vast majority of

employers in the MarketScan data offer employees one type of benefit plan only, the data

would not allow us to identify the subset of employees who were offered a choice, thus

endogeneity of plan choice is a concern. To avoid confounding effects due to potential

endogeneity biases in the plan variables, we estimated pairings of models, with the plan

indicators included and omitted. As seen in the table, omitting these variables had no

substantive effects on coefficients of all other variables, thus we focus our discussion

primarily on the models with all variables included. We report cluster-robust standard

errors, to adjust for within-hospital correlations for patients treated in the same hospital.

       In general, coefficient estimates were qualitatively similar across specifications.

Noting that the coefficients in these semi-log models are simply the percent effect on

price of a unit change in the variable, for expositional convenience we rescaled

continuous variables with values between 0 and 1 (times 100); thus coefficients of the

indices HMO penetration and HHI are interpreted as the effect of a percentage point

change in the index on price. We further applied the adjustment eβ – 1 to the coefficients

of binary explanatory variables in the discussion below.

       As discussed earlier, the variables of greatest interest in this analysis were the

measures of hospital quality as measured by SMR and RSMR. The coefficients on both

measures of mortality are negative, but none of them is statistically significant. While the

coefficients on SMR are very close to zero, those on RMSR are larger, and if statistically



                                                                                             15
significant, would indicate a substantive negative relationship between quality and price.

To show effect sizes, we changed SMR and RSMR in standard deviation units. We

observe that increases by one, two, and three standard deviations of SMR corresponded

to 0.36%, 0.74%, and 1.10% declines in price; the same analysis for RSMR yielded

1.19%, 2.35%, and 3.51% declines.

         Among other possible determinants, there was no significant variation in prices

due to age or gender (a minor exception occurred between age 50 and 60), payment

differences tend to reflect illness severity and complexity of the underlying procedure

significantly. While there was no difference in the price of partial surgery versus total

surgery (referring to the surgical removal of part or the whole patient’s colon), the price

of laparoscopic surgery, a less invasive form of the procedure was 5.7-5.9% lower

compared with surgery using standard incision. On the other hand, the price of surgery

involving colostomy, a complex procedure that can be performed in conjunction with the

main surgery, was about 26% higher than surgery alone in all model specifications.

Prices for cases involving metastases and prices of emergency surgery are also

significantly higher than the baseline case, (+21% and +35% respectively). The higher

price associated with emergency surgeries might be due to the fact that these cases were

taken outside of insurers’ network. Similar to the effect of metastases, payments increase

significantly in a step-wise fashion as patient severity rises, as reflected in the Elixhauser

index.

         Focusing on hospital type and benefit plan characteristics, the results are generally

in line with what might be anticipated due to gradations in pricing power. Thus, prices at

not-for-profit hospitals were about 10% lower relative to the default category, namely




                                                                                            16
hospitals sponsored by local governments, whereas prices at for-profit hospitals were 8%

higher. Prices at teaching hospitals were 4.6-5.4% higher compared with non-teaching

hospitals, and prices at system-owned hospitals slightly lower compared with non-

teaching and non-system hospitals, but statistically significant. Similarly, price

differences associated with type of benefit plan are as anticipated, with prices at fee-

based plans and point-of-service plans slightly higher than prices at the default category

(PPOs), while prices lower in closed- HMO plans; however none of these price

differences were statistically significant.

       Turning next to market structure, we find that HMO penetration is highly

significant, and exerts moderate downward pressure on prices. We interpret the results in

Table 2 to mean that a one percentage point increase, relative to a mean HMO penetration

rate of 10.9 on the 0-100 scale, is associated with a 0.004% reduction in price, or $87;

equivalently, a 10% increase in the penetration rate leads to a $81 decrease in price,

implying an elasticity =-0.04. We also find that hospital market concentration as

measured by HHI tends to increase prices although the related coefficients were not

statistically significant. However, we note that the HHI variables pertain to all inpatient

admissions in the hospital and may not accurately reflect pricing power in the cancer

segment of the market; cancer-specific market shares were not available in our data.13




13
  We also explored system-based HHIs, whereby two or more hospitals located in a given market
area and belonging to the same multi-hospital system are counted as a single entity (by summing
their market shares). As expected, this resulted in more concentrated markets (the mean HHI was
0.201 compared with 0.142 for the hospital-based HHI), but with no improvement is statistical
significance in our price models



                                                                                              17
6       Summary and Implications

        Previous literature on hospital markets and pricing tended to focus on cardiac

procedures or diagnoses. In this study we focus on the lesser explored case of colorectal

cancer, a leading cause of death among all cancers, and its surgical treatments. In

particular we explore transaction prices paid by benefit plans administered by large

employers. While there were no significant differences by plan types administered this

way, our analysis revealed a rational pricing structure, with price difference matching

gradients in severity and complexity of the main surgical procedure and its variants.

        The effects of greatest interest were those of the standardized mortality ratio

(SMR) and the risk-standardized mortality ratio (RSMR), which are based on

methodologies that are now standard under the federal Hospital Compare and other

public reporting systems. Although measures focused particularly on cancer diagnoses

are rarely included in such rankings, they are potentially accessible to large group

purchasers that characterize our data. For both of the mortality measures studied, namely

the SMR and the RSMR we found negative effects on price (adverse quality reduces

price) which were consistent in all model specifications; however, the results were not

significant. One possible explanation for this weak effect is that purchasers are not able

to replicate quality scores for purposes of price negotiations. Another explanation is that

such scores are accessible, but underlying demand for cancer treatment is not highly

sensitive to quality differences among providers14. We are unable to distinguish between

these explanations, and leave this for future exploration. Finally, we find high correlation

between the SMR and RSMR (e.g. Figure A.1), suggesting that simply adding hospital
14
  In the simple theoretical model this corresponds to the case in which a quality improvement
causes the slope of the demand curve to become flatter.



                                                                                                18
random effects in the latter (and as reported on the Hospital Compare website) does not

contribute additional information about the underlying hospital rankings.

Appendix

        The general methodology we use to estimated expected mortality and excess

mortality for colorectal surgeries was based on the methodology found in Hospital

Compare for AMI and heart failure15. We replicated this approach as closely as possible,

with some modifications needed given the change in diagnosis and clinical setting to that

of colon cancer.

        Rather than providing simple standardized mortality ratios (SMRs), Hospital

Compare provides rankings based on the more complex risk-standardized mortality ratio

(RSMR). SMR is defined as the ratio of actual mortality to expected mortality in the

hospital, or equivalently, the ratio of actual and expected mortality rates. Let the hospital

h’s actual rate is               , where dh = number of actual deaths in hospital h, nh =

number of cases in the hospital.




        Accordingly,       is the vector of patient characteristics and severity measures in

the hospital (e.g. the hospital means)16, and p is the probability of death in the population

given the distribution of characteristics found in h. When actual mortality exceeds

expected mortality, the hospital’s performance is said to be worse than average. Expected

   Expected mortality is simply the predicted value, based on the pooled regression of all patients
in all hospitals and the hospital means of h. We use terminology found in the relevant literature.




                                                                                                27
mortality is typically estimated from patient level data using a binary logit model

(Mohammed and Stevens, 2013; Silber et al., 2010)17.

        RSMR is the ratio of predicted to expected mortality rates in the hospital, where

both the predicted mortality rate and the expected mortality rate are estimated by

Hierarchical Generalized Linear Modeling (HGLM) with a logit link function (see

Krumholz et al., 2006a, 2006b). Here, in addition to adjusting for patient characteristics,

the predictive mortality model incorporates a random hospital-specific effect (α) that

accounts for within-hospital correlations of the observed patient outcomes. Expected

mortality in the denominator is also estimated by HGLM. Accordingly, the excess

mortality score is redefined as the ratio of predicted to expected mortality rate, with a

random effects term set equal to zero:




As with the Hospital Compare methodology, we employ inpatient administrative claims

data (MEDPAR files) for Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in Original Medicare

(traditional fee-for-service Medicare) hospitalized in short-term acute care hospitals.

Similarly, we followed Hospital Compare by tracking deaths that occur within 30 days of

a hospital admission, rather than tracking in-hospital mortality only. Using pooled data

for the years 2000-200718, resulted in a sample of 131,159 patients who underwent colon



17
  When general measures of mortality are of interest, e.g., all-cause mortality or regional
mortality, cruder estimators are often used, based on weighted averages of population mortality
rates for broad patient groupings.

  Note that all of the expected and predicted mortality rates in any given year are obtained using
covariate values for that year, while the regression coefficients are estimated from the pooled
regression for all years. A Wald test for inter-temporal stability indicated that all explanatory



                                                                                                  28
cancer surgery. Hospitals where colon resection was a fairly rare event (less than 21

cases in the entire period), were excluded from our mortality regressions19; 393

observations were dropped due to this restriction. The mean of 30-day mortality was

0.045, with a standard deviation of 0.207. Trendlines for all estimation approaches are

found in Figure A-1. In practice, all of the models yield close results. There appears to be

some fluctuations of 30-day mortality rates from between years, but all bends occur

within a tight range around the mean.

        Table A-1 presents regression coefficients and odds ratios from the predictive

mortality regressions corresponding to SMR (generalized linear models with logit link

function), and RSMR (HGLM with a logit link function). Risk adjusters include age,

gender, an indicator of colorectal cancer severity (metastasis), and emergency20. The

Elixhauser score is a summary measure of the presence of other diagnoses or

comorbidities. The odds-ratios for risk adjusters in the two models were virtually

identical. The results clearly indicate increases in mortality rates as patient severity

increases (metastases, number of comorbidities), along with a 7% increase due to

additional year of, and a 34% differential for males relative to females.

0.3433.
19
  Under Hospital Compare, hospitals with less than 21 cases were retained in the data, but
assigned the (national) sample mean characteristics. Rather than lumping together all small
hospitals in each with relatively rare occurrences of colorectal surgeries, we opted to exclude
such hospitals from our mortality regressions. For sampling units with < 21 parametric methods
for calculating standard errors do not apply (Kahn and Sempos, 1989).

  ICD-9 codes for metastatic disease are: 196.0, 196.1, 196.3-196.5, 196.7-196.9, 197.0-197.4,
197.6-199.0; ICD-9 codes for emergency surgery were: intestinal obstruction (560.8, 560.9),
peritonitis (567.0, 567.2) and perforation (569.83). See Cooper et al., 1999, and Merkow et al.,
2013.

        The Hospital Compare web site further explains that mortality rankings are based

on aggregating mortality for three years ending with the reference year. To emulate this

aspect, we construct three-year moving averages of SMR and RSMR, and we incorporate

the transformed values into our price regressions. Three year averaging has the added

advantage of smoothing random temporal shocks. The price regressions in Tables 2-3

include SMR and RSMR as described above, namely with the averaging for years t, t-1, t-

2 in the hospital matched to prices in year t21.




21
  We also explored alternative specifications such as entering mortality with a one-year lag only;
in practice this yielded virtually identical results as the 3-year averaging. Results are available
upon request.
