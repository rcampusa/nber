                                            ABSTRACT

     While much is known about the impacts prices and tobacco control policies have on smoking
participation and frequency of cigarette use, little is known about their impacts on smoking cessation.
This paper addresses the dynamics of smoking cessation using longitudinal data on young adults from
the Monitoring the Future Surveys. Site-specific prices and several measures of clean indoor air
restrictions are added to the survey data. Both parametric and semi-parametric duration models are
used to model multiple cessation attempts of young adults. The estimates indicate that increases in
the price of cigarettes increase the probability of initial smoking cessation as well as subsequent
cessation for those individuals who are unable to remain smoke-free after at least one prior cessation
attempt. The average price elasticity of cessation is 0.343. In addition, stronger restrictions on
smoking in private worksites and public places other than restaurants increase the probability of
young adult smoking cessation.

I.   I. Introduction

            Since the publication of the first Surgeon General’s report on the health

     consequences of cigarette smoking in 1964, numerous studies on the determinants of

     cigarette demand have been published. These studies have used diverse data, theoretical

     modeling, and statistical techniques to examine the impacts prices and other policy-

     related variables have on individual’s consumption of cigarettes. While a significant

     number of these studies have concluded that cigarette prices and smoking participation

     are inversely related, they have been unable to distinguish whether or not a decrease in

     participation, due to a price increase, is a result of decreased smoking initiation or

     increased smoking cessation. Economists have neglected the dynamics of smoking

     transitions in their investigation of cigarette demand. Very little attention has been

     devoted to investigating the determinants of smoking pathways and trajectories including:

     experimentation, addiction, and cessation. Determining why individuals start smoking,

     and what factors cause smoking cessation should be a central focus in formulating

     appropriate anti-smoking policies. This paper addresses the dynamics of smoking

     cessation and provides the first econometric analysis of the impact prices, clean indoor air

     laws, and other socio-economic factors have on multiple quit attempts of young adults.

            Cigarette smoking is the single most preventable cause of premature death and

     disability in the United States, responsible for more than 400,000 premature deaths each

     year. (CDC, 1999) According to the 1990 Surgeon General’s report, smoking cessation

     represents the single most important step that smokers can take to enhance the quality and

     length of their lives. In fact, many researchers consider smoking cessation the “gold




                                                   2
      standard” of healthcare cost effectiveness, producing higher quality and length of life at

      costs that are well below other health care interventions. (Warner, 1997)

II.   II. Previous Research

             Many studies of cigarette demand have been published over the past three

      decades. One general conclusion emerges from these studies – the demand for cigarettes

      is responsive to changes in the price of cigarettes. According to a recent National Cancer

      Institute (NCI) sponsored gathering of economists and other experts, the overall price

      elasticity of cigarette smoking falls in the range of –0.3 to –0.5. (NCI, 1993)

             Only three studies have examined the impact economic factors have on

      individual’s decisions to quit smoking. Douglas (1998) used the 1987 National Health

      Interview Survey: Cancer Risk Factor Supplement to investigate the determinants of the

      decisions to start and quit smoking in the context of an economic model of addiction. He

      estimated several alternative parametric duration models in his assessment of smoking

      initiation and cessation. Douglas concluded that current, future, and past prices of

      cigarettes have an insignificant effect on the probability of initiation. Likewise, current

      and past prices were found to be statistically insignificant in the probability of quitting.

      However, his estimates suggest that increases in future cigarette prices will significantly

      increase quitting rates. Douglas estimates a quitting hazard elasticity of 1.07 to 1.30 with

      respect to future price. This suggests that a 10% percent permanent increase in the future

      price of cigarettes will reduce the average duration of smoking by 11%-13%. In addition,

      the study indicated that information dissemination regarding the adverse health

      consequences of smoking, bans on cigarette advertising, and state level regulations

      significantly increase the probability of quitting.




                                                     3
        While the study by Douglas (1998) made significant contributions to the

investigation of the determinants of the decision to start and quit smoking, many of his

findings, particularly those that deal with prices, are at odds with a majority of the

research on the determinants of cigarette smoking conducted over the past several

decades. One possible explanation why Douglas finds insignificant current and past price

effects may be due to the fact that he uses one year of cross-sectional data. The

application of duration methods in the econometric analysis of cigarette smoking requires

relatively high quality longitudinal data that can accurately measure cigarette

consumption, cigarette prices, government enacted policy variables, income, and socio-

demographic variables over a relatively long time period. Indeed, Douglas’ study

employs cross-sectional data with retrospective information on smoking initiation and

cessation. Therefore, incorrect recall by participants can dramatically influence any

results obtained. A second possible explanation stems from the error in matching prices

to respondents’ previous states of residence. Douglas bases all previous prices that a

respondent would have paid for cigarettes on the respondent’s current state of residence.

Therefore, if a respondent lived in a different state in the past, significant errors in price

matching would be likely. As Douglas notes, the panel data requirements needed to use

duration modeling are not met in this study, and future investigation is needed using true

longitudinal data.

        In a more recent study, Forster and Jones (1999) use both parametric and semi-

parametric techniques to investigate the determinants of smoking initiation and cessation.

As did Douglas, Forster and Jones use cross-sectional data (British Health and Lifestyle

Survey) with retrospective information on cigarette smoking to approximate the length of




                                               4
time each individual smokes and abstains from smoking. Furthermore, in line with

Douglas’ work, they allow cigarette tax to act as a time-varying covariate.1 They find

cigarette taxes to be an insignificant determinant of smoking initiation. In addition, they

find that the estimated elasticity of the number of years smoked before quitting with

respect to tax falls in a range of -0.40 to -0.63, suggesting that a 5% increase in tax would

lead to a reduction in smoking of approximately 6 to 9.5 months. However, the authors

find strong evidence of 5 and 10 year recall bias in their quitting models. To control for

the effect of recall bias, they include dummy variables equal to one for individual’s who

recall quitting either 5 or 10 years ago and zero otherwise. The authors conclude that

recall bias had limited impact on the parameter estimates.

        Finally, Tauras and Chaloupka (1999) employ data from the Monitoring the

Future Surveys (MTFS) to estimate smoking cessation equations for young adult men and

women separately. The MTFS are longitudinal data that track individual’s smoking

behaviors and other socio-economic characteristics over time for up to fourteen years.

Using a single-failure semi-parametric Cox regression model, they conclude that price

has a positive and significant impact on the probability of first-time cessation for both

young adult males and females. In addition, they find that policies restricting smoking in

private worksites increase the probability of smoking cessation among employed females.

        While much has been learned over the past 30 years from economic research on

the determinants of cigarette demand, there is much more to learn. In general, cigarette

price increases appear to increase the probability of first-time smoking cessation.

However, due to the addictive nature of cigarettes and the withdrawal (disutility)

  Although Douglas allowed price to vary at the state level over time, whereas Forster and Jones allow tax
to vary solely at the national level over time.


                                                     5
associated with termination of cigarette use, many smokers are unable to remain smoke

free and revert back into daily smoking. To date, no research has attempted to model the

dynamics of multiple quit decisions by smokers. This paper proposes to address this

issue by providing the first analysis of the impact prices and clean indoor air laws have

on multiple cessation attempts by individuals.



III. Data

        The empirical models that are estimated in this study employ panels formed from

the nationally representative cross-sectional surveys of high school seniors conducted by

the Institute for Social Research (ISR) at the University of Michigan. Each year since

1975, ISR has conducted a nationally representative random sample of between 15,000

and 19,000 high school seniors as part of a national research program titled Monitoring

the Future: A Continuing Study of American Youth (MTF)2. These surveys focus on the

use of cigarettes, alcohol, and illegal drugs and provide an accurate cross-sectional

representation of United States high school seniors.

        The senior year of high school is an extremely interesting and relevant point in

time to start tracking individuals. According to the 1994 Surgeon General’s report,

nearly all first use of cigarettes occurs before high school graduation, and most adults

who regularly smoke are addicted to cigarettes by the time they are twenty years old. In

addition, the completion of high school, for many, means the end of living under parental

supervision and undergoing a transition into a different social environment.




2
 In the past, the Monitoring the Future Study was sometimes called the National High School Senior
Survey.


                                                   6
       One limitation that exists in the MTF data is that the surveys do not include

individuals who have dropped out of high school or who were absent the day the

questionnaires were administered. Johnston, O’Malley and Bachman (1996) have argued

that dropouts in general have substantially higher smoking prevalence rates than do in-

school students. Similarly, they argue that students who are consistently absent from

school have higher prevalence rates than do regular school attendees. DeCicca, Kenkel,

and Mathios (1998) take the argument one step further and conclude that students who

drop out of high school have higher smoking prevalence rates years before they actually

drop out of high school.

       Starting with the class of 1976, approximately 2,400 individuals from each senior

class are chosen to participate in follow-up surveys. The 2,400 selected respondents are

divided into 2 groups of 1,200 individuals each. One group is surveyed on even-

numbered calendar years, while the other group is surveyed on odd-numbered calendar

years. As a result, one group is resurveyed for the first time one year after baseline

(senior year in high school), while the other group is resurveyed for the first time two

years after the baseline year. Subsequent follow-ups are conducted at two-year intervals

for both groups for up to seven follow-ups and then less frequently.

       The questionnaires used in the follow-up surveys are very similar to those used in

the baseline. Many of the questions that were asked in the baseline are also asked in all

subsequent follow-ups so that changes in behaviors and experiences can be measured.

High school specific questions are dropped from the follow-ups and relevant post-high

school questions are added such as college education, employment status, marital status,

etc.




                                              7
       The most prominent advantage of using the MTF data is that it is the only

longitudinal data set that tracks individual’s smoking habits as they age from teenagers

through early adulthood. This is an extremely important time to analyze, because for

many, a transition from initiation/experimentation to regular smoking to cessation takes

place during this period.

       A variety of cigarette consumption, socioeconomic, and demographic variables

was constructed from the survey data for all respondents. Of particular importance for

this research was the information collected on each individual’s monthly cigarette

consumption. In the baseline year and all subsequent follow-ups, all respondents were

asked the frequency with which they smoked cigarettes during the past 30 days. The

response to this question was used to construct a dichotomous smoking participation

indicator equal to one if the respondent indicated that they had used cigarettes in the

thirty days prior to the survey, and equal to zero otherwise. Tracked over time, the

participation variable maps out each individual’s smoking trajectory for up to fourteen

years or until loss due to censoring occurs.

       In addition to the cigarette consumption variables, a variety of independent

variables was constructed from the surveys to control for other factors affecting cigarette

demand. These include: the age of the respondent, in years; average real yearly income

from employment (deflated by national Consumer Price Index (CPI) 1982-1984=100);

number of years of formal schooling, in years; average number of hours worked weekly;

race/ethnicity (White, Black – omitted); gender (male, female – omitted); indicators of

college student status (full-time, half-time, less than half-time, no college - omitted);

indicators of frequency of participation in religious services (never - omitted, infrequent




                                               8
participation, moderate participation, and frequent participation); indicators of marital

status (married, engaged, separated or divorced, and single - omitted); indicators of

family structure (live alone, live with parents, live with spouse, live with child); and

indicators of type of city/town (urban - omitted, suburban, and rural).

       In addition, indicators of region according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (New

England, East, South East, Midwest, South, Plains, Mountain, North West, New

York/New Jersey, and West - Omitted) and dichotomous indicators of variables capturing

the year the questionnaires were administered were constructed from the surveys to

control for region and time trends.

       Based on the site identifiers, cigarette prices were added to the surveys. The price

data were obtained from Tobacco Institute’s annual Tax Burden on Tobacco. Each year,

the Tobacco Institute publishes state level cigarette prices as of November 1. These

prices are weighted averages for a pack of 20 cigarettes based on the prices of single

packs, cartons, and vending machine sales where the weights are the national proportions

of each type of sale. These prices are inclusive of state level sales taxes applied to

cigarettes, but are exclusive of local cigarette taxes. Since the price published is as of

November 1, and the survey is conducted between mid February and early June and the

dependent variables are based on past month smoking, a weighted average price for the

first six months of the year is computed. The average price for the first six months of

every year is calculated by subtracting state and federal excise taxes from the current

year’s price and the previous year’s price and weighting the pre-tax prices accordingly

(7/12 previous year and 5/12 current year). Then the average federal tax and average

state tax for the first 6 months of the year are added to the first six month’s average




                                              9
pretax price. To account for changes in the relative price of cigarettes over time, all

cigarette prices are deflated by the national Consumer Price Index published by the

Bureau of Labor Statistics (1982-1984=100).

       Based on state identifiers, a set of variables reflecting the presence of state level

clean indoor air laws was added to the data. These data were obtained through special

agreement with the Centers for Disease Control from an unpublished database. The data

were used to construct three dichotomous indicators for state level restrictions on

smoking in private worksites, restaurants, and any other public place.

       Finally, with the exception of gender, race/ethnicity, and parental education,

which are time-invariant across individual specific observations, all other covariates enter

the models as time-varying regressors.



IV. Methods

       In the case of cigarette smoking, an individual can occupy one of two discreet

states: smoking and nonsmoking. At any point in time, each of these states is associated

with a certain level of utility for each individual. Each individual decides which state to

occupy based on the discounted present value of utility for each of the states. If the

remaining discounted lifetime utility of the smoking state exceeds the remaining

discounted lifetime utility of the nonsmoking state, then the individual chooses to become

a smoker or remain a smoker. If on the other hand, the remaining discounted lifetime

utility of the nonsmoking state exceeds the remaining discounted lifetime utility of the

smoking state, then the individual decides to abstain from smoking or quit the habit. An

individual’s utility for each state fluctuates over time in response to changes in




                                             10
exogenous covariates including: information on the health hazards of cigarette smoking;

tobacco control policies such as clean indoor air laws, excise taxation, and youth access

laws; level of addiction; peer pressure; tastes; and various others.

       Duration modeling is the appropriate statistical technique to examine the

structural determinants of the decision to make a transition from one discrete state to

another. This paper employs both parametric and semi-parametric duration models to

examine the impact economic factors have on individual’s decisions to quit cigarette

smoking. The semi-parametric model takes the form of a stratified multiple-failure Cox

regression in which the hazard at time t for a subject in group i is assumed to be:

                                   hi(t,x(t)) = hoi(t)exp(x(t)Bi).

hoi(t) is the baseline hazard at time t, which is unknown, x(t) is a vector of time-varying

explanatory variables, and Bi is a vector of parameters, which is unknown. Group

stratification is conditional on the number of previous quit attempts. That is, each subject

is assumed not to be at risk for a subsequent event (quit attempt) until a prior event has

occurred. This is equivalent to estimating separate Cox models for each consecutive

failure under the constraint that the coefficients are the same regardless of the number of

failures, but assumes that the baseline hazard function differs across successive quit

attempts. Parameter estimates are obtained by maximizing the following partial log-

likelihood function:


                               D                           
                       ln L = ∑  ∑ xkB − dj ln ∑ exp( xiB)  
                              j =1 k ∈Dj      i ∈Rj        




                                                 11
where j indexes the ordered time until cessation t(j) (j=1,…,D), Dj is the set of dj

observations that quit smoking at t(j), and finally, Rj is the set of k observations that are at

risk of cessation at time t(j).

        The parametric model employed in this study takes the form of a Gompertz

regression. Unlike the semi-parametric Cox regression described above which left the

baseline hazard, ho(t), unspecified, the Gompertz model assumes that the baseline hazard

takes on a specific parametric functional form. The Gompertz parameterization yields

the following hazard, survival, and density functions:

                                     h(t,x(t)) = exp(γt)exp(xB)

                                  S(t,x(t)) = exp[(-exjB)/γ)(eγt –1)]

                         f(t,x(t)) = exp[(xjB + γt) – {1/γ (exjB+γt - exjB)}]

This distribution implies that the baseline hazard ho(t) = exp(γt), where γ is a shape

parameter that determines the shape of the distribution curve. The hazard rate increases

with time if γ>0, decreases with time if γ<0, and remains constant if γ=0. The Gompertz

distribution is therefore well suited to model the hazard of quitting, which is

monotonically increasing with time. Since the Gompertz model assumes an underlying

functional form for the baseline hazard, stratification based on previous failures cannot be

incorporated. The baseline hazard remains unchanged regardless of the number of

previous quit attempts. That is, the hazard of quitting changes over time, but is

independent of when the last cessation attempt occurred. Parameter estimates are

obtained by maximizing the following full log-likelihood function:




                                                  12
                                  U                         N
                          ln L = ∑ ln{ f (t , x (t )} +   ∑ ln{S (t , x(t )}
                                  j =1                    j =U +1




In which f(t,x(t)) and S(t,x(t)) are the Gompertz survival and density functions

respectively, N is the number of observations, U of which are uncensored. This implies

that a subject known to fail at time t will contribute the value of the density function to

the log likelihood function, whereas a censored observation will contribute the value of

the survivor function to the log likelihood function.

       According to Moffitt (1985), parametric estimates can be very sensitive to the

assumed shape of the baseline hazard. If the parametric functional form for the baseline

hazard is misspecified, inconsistent estimates of the coefficients will result. However,

when the baseline hazard is specified correctly, a parametric approach will usually

provide a small increase in efficiency (Meyer, 1990). The Cox semi-parametric model

uses variation in the covariates across observations to estimate the covariate coefficients,

while the over-time variation in the mean of the covariates is absorbed by the baseline

hazard. Parametric estimation uses the part of the variation in the mean of the

explanatory variables not accounted for by the baseline hazard component to estimate the

regressor coefficients.

       To account for the correlation among the observations on an individual subject

and the correlation due to observing multiple quit attempts within the same subject, a

robust method of calculating the variance-covariance matrix proposed by Lin and Wei

(1989) is used.



V. Results


                                                    13
       Estimates from the stratified Cox regressions are presented in Table 2, with the

corresponding estimates from the Gompertz regressions presented in Table 3. Each table

contains eight alternative models. The model presented in the first column of each table

(model 1) contains estimates from a specification which includes real average price, three

dichotomous clean indoor air indicators reflecting state level restrictions on smoking in

private worksites, restaurants, and any other public place, and a variety of socio-

economic variables including: race, gender, income, type of community, marital status,

family structure, parental education, mother’s work status while growing up, religious

participation, hours worked, formal years of schooling, college enrollment status, and

dummy year variables to control for year fixed effects. In addition, with the exception of

price, clean indoor air indicators, year and region indicators, and indicators of family

structure, indicators for respondents with missing data for all the above variables are

included in the models. These missing value indicators were created to prevent the loss

of a large number of observations. For example, if mother’s work status while growing

up is unknown, each of the mother’s work status variables take on a value of zero, while

an additional indicator, unknown mother’s work status takes on a value of one. This

missing value indicator takes on a value of zero for all respondents whose mother’s work

status is known.

       The models estimated in the second, third, and fourth columns of each table are

identical to the first column, except the three dichotomous clean indoor air indicators are

replaced by at most one clean indoor air indicator (model 2 contains private worksite

restrictions, model 3 contains restaurant restrictions, and model 4 contains any other

clean indoor air restrictions). These models are specifically designed to minimize the




                                             14
collinearity of included state-level variables reflecting tobacco control efforts that may be

correlated over time. The inclusion of highly correlated state-level controls may result in

misleading estimates of the correlated covariates. Models 5 through 8 are identical to

models 1 through 4, except models 5 through 8 contain nine dichotomous region

indicators to control for regional fixed effects.

       The real price of cigarettes is found to have a positive and significant impact on

the quitting hazard in all the models estimated using the stratified Cox regression.

Similarly, the real price of cigarettes is found to have a positive impact on the quitting

hazard at at least the 5% significance level for all the models estimated using the

Gompertz regression, with the exception of models 5 and 6 which were significant at the

6% significant level. These estimates clearly indicate that increases in the real price of

cigarettes increase the probability of initial smoking cessation as well as subsequent

cessation for those individuals who are unable to remain smoke free after at least one

cessation attempt. Table 4 contains the estimates of the price elasticities of cessation

based on the semi-parametric and fully-parametric estimates presented in tables 2 and 3.

The estimated price elasticities derived from the Cox models are very similar to those

derived from the Gompertz models. The Cox elasticities range from 0.269 to 0.466 and

have an average elasticity of 0.350, whereas the Gompertz elasticities range from 0.245

to 0.464 and have an average elasticity of 0.336. These estimates imply that a 10%

increase in the real price of cigarettes will increase the probability of cessation among

young adults by approximately 3.4% - 3.5%.

       Policies restricting smoking in private worksites are found to have a positive

impact on smoking cessation in all of the models using both Cox and Gompertz




                                              15
techniques. However, when region fixed effects are controlled for (models 5-8), the

coefficients for private worksite restrictions are no longer significant at conventional

levels. Policies restricting smoking in public places other than restaurants are found to

have a positive and significant impact on smoking cessation in both the Cox and

Gompertz models when region fixed effect are not controlled for, but have a negative and

insignificant impact on smoking cessation when region dummies are included. In

general, restaurant restrictions have an insignificant impact on young adult smoking

cessation decisions.

       Briefly reviewing the estimates for the other independent variables: Males are

significantly less likely to quit smoking than are females. With respect to race and

ethnicity, the probability of cessation is higher among Caucasians than for those of

African American descent, however, the estimates are only significant at the 5% level for

the models employing Gompertz regressions.

       The results are mixed with respect to real yearly income. In the Cox regressions,

individuals with higher yearly incomes from employment are significantly more likely to

quit smoking than are individuals with lower yearly incomes. This positive relationship

implies that cigarette smoking is an economically inferior behavior, and supports much of

the recent empirical evidence on adult cigarette demand (i.e. Wasserman, et al., 1991).

However, in the Gompertz regressions, individuals with higher yearly incomes are

significantly less likely to quit smoking than are individuals with lower yearly incomes,

implying that cigarette smoking is an economically superior behavior for young adults.

This view is consistent with Chaloupka and Grossman’s (1996) and Tauras and

Chaloupka’s (1999) estimates for youth and young adult smoking behaviors. Given the




                                             16
high correlation between age and income, the discrepancy between methodologies on

how income effects smoking cessation is likely due to how each method controls for

respondent’s age in the models. 3 That is, the Cox model uses variation in the

independent variables across observations to estimate the regressor coefficients, while the

over time variation in the mean of the covariates is absorbed by the baseline hazard. The

Gompertz regression uses the part of the variation in the mean of the independent

variables not accounted for by the baseline hazard to estimate the covariate coefficients.

Given this, the effect of age is likely to be fully controlled for in the Cox model allowing

differences in income at each age level to directly impact the probability of cessation. In

the Gompertz model however, if the baseline hazard is misspecified, inconsistent

estimates of the income coefficients may result. Therefore, it is likely that income plays

a positive role on young adult smoking cessation decisions.

            No significant differences are observed between the variables capturing the

type of community individuals reside in and the probability of smoking cessation.

Individuals who are either engaged or are separated or divorced are significantly less

likely to quit smoking than are individuals who are single. Married individuals are also

less likely to quit than are individuals who are single, although the estimates are not

significant at conventional levels using the semi-parametric techniques. Young adults

who live with their parents are significantly more likely to quit smoking than are

individuals who do not live with their parents. Young adults who live with their children

are significantly less likely to quit smoking than are individuals who do not live with

  In both methodologies, age is treated as a time variable. That is, age measures how time is recorded in the
data. Therefore, explicit control of age as a covariate is not feasible given its perfectly collinear
relationship with the time variable.

their children. No other significant differences are observed with respect to family

structure.

        Individuals whose mothers have at least some college education are much more

likely to quit smoking as young adults than are individuals whose mother’s education did

not exceed the high school level. No significant differences are observed between

paternal education and the probability of smoking cessation. Individuals whose mothers

worked while they were growing up are less likely to quit smoking as young adults than

individuals whose mothers did not work while they were growing up, although the

relationship is not significant at conventional levels for mothers who worked full-time

employing Gompertz techniques.

        Young adults with a strong attachment to religion, as measured by the frequency

of attendance at religious services, are much more likely to quit smoking than are young

adults with little or no attachment to religion. Individuals who work many hours a week

as young adults are significantly less likely to quit smoking than are individuals who

work less hours per week. Individuals who attend college full time are significantly more

likely to quit smoking than are individuals who do not attend college at all, however,

young adults with more years of formal schooling are significantly less likely to quit than

are those with less formal education. Individuals who live in the East, Midwest, New

England, New York/New Jersey, Plains, South, and South East regions of the United

States are significantly less likely to quit smoking than are individuals who live in the

West region. Finally, young adults were much more likely to quit smoking in 1977-1993

than they were in 1976.

V. Discussion

        Since the release of the first Surgeon General’s report on the health consequences

of cigarette smoking in 1964, the United States government has been involved in a

sporadic and often unsynchronized campaign to reduce the use of cigarettes among the

American people. Throughout the 25 years following the onset of the government’s

campaign, significant progress was made in reducing cigarette smoking in all segments of

the population. Overall smoking prevalence declined from 40.4% in 1965 to 25.5% in

1990. (CDC, 1999) Much of this success can be attributed to tobacco control strategies,

including wide-spread dissemination of information on the health hazards of cigarette

smoking, anti-smoking advertisements, limits on cigarette manufacturers advertisements,

cigarette excise tax increases, restrictions on smoking in public places and private

worksites, and restrictions on youth access to cigarettes. (USDHHS, 1991)

        However, recent data suggests that the decades of steady decline in smoking

prevalence have not been sustained. The prevalence of smoking among adults declined

very slightly in the 1990’s. According to the National Health Interview Surveys, 25.5%

of U.S. adults were current smokers in 1990 as compared to 24.7% in 1995.4 Even more

troubling however is the increased prevalence of cigarette smoking among youth and

young adults in the 1990’s. According to the Monitoring the Future Surveys (MTFS), the

prevalence of cigarette smoking among 8th, 10th, and 12th graders has increased for the

better part of a decade. (University of Michigan News and Information Services

(UMNIS), 1998) Moreover, according to the Harvard University College Alcohol Study,


4
  The definition used to assess smoking prevalence changed in 1992. As of 1992, some-day smoking was
included in the definition of current smoking. The inclusion of intermittent smokers in the new definition
will increase the prevalence estimates by approximately one percentage point over the previous definition.
(CDC, 1994)


                                                    19
smoking prevalence among college students increased by 28% between the years 1993

and 1997. (Wechsler, et al., 1998) These trends, coupled with the strong addictive nature

of cigarettes, have led policymakers to increase their efforts on discouraging cigarette

use, particularly by youth and young adults. Understanding the impacts prices (which

can be increased via excise taxation) and tobacco control policies, such as clean indoor

air laws, have on young adult’s decisions to quit smoking is essential to formulating

appropriate policies aimed at reducing young adult cigarette consumption.

       This paper uses both parametric and semi-parametric techniques to estimate the

impact prices and clean indoor air laws have on young adult’s decisions to quit smoking.

The estimates clearly support the hypothesis that increasing the price of cigarettes would

increase the probability of smoking cessation among young adults and therefore decrease

the amount of time they smoke. The estimated price elasticity of smoking cessation fell

in a narrow range of 0.245 to 0.466, with an average price elasticity of 0.343 for all the

models using both methods. In addition, the estimates indicate that stronger restrictions

on smoking in private worksites and public place other than restaurants generally have a

positive impact on young adult smoking cessation.

       Given the estimates above, and the well-documented (USDHHS, 1990) benefits

of smoking cessation, a significant increase in cigarette excises taxes may be an

extremely effective means to reduce the death and disease caused by tobacco use in the

United States.
