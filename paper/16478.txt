                                             ABSTRACT

The end of the great moderation has profound implications on the assessment of fiscal sustainability.
The pertinent issue goes beyond the obvious increase in the stock of public debt/GDP induced by
the global recession, to include the neglected perspective that the vulnerabilities associated with a
given public debt/GDP increase with the future volatility of key economic variables. We evaluate for
a given future projected public debt/GDP, the possible distribution of the fiscal burden or the flow
cost of funding debt for each OECD country, assuming that this in future decades resembles that in
the past four decades. Fiscal projections may be alarmist if one jumps from the priors of great moderation
to the prior of permanent high future burden. Prudent adjustment for countries exposed to heightened
vulnerability may entail both short term stabilization and forward looking fiscal reforms.

          The global crisis has brought to the fore the fiscal vulnerabilities of OECD countries.
There is a growing recognition of the fiscal vulnerabilities of some countries of the Euro block
(Greece, Portugal, Spain, Italy, Ireland and others). The ability of the US to obtain relatively
cheap funding of its debt delays, but does not negate the fiscal challenges facing the US.
          While the crisis added to the debt burdens, the fiscal vulnerabilities are not new. Rather,
they were built up gradually before the crisis, as a result of demographic transition (aging
population and declining fertility) affecting most OECD countries and the commitments made by
the welfare states. The “great moderation” (i.e., the drop in volatility and risk premium during
the late 1990s and early 2000s), and the growing belief that this great moderation was here to
stay, mitigated fiscal concerns. During that period, the sharp decline in the price of risk and in
the risk free interest rate allowed a growing sense of complacency in Europe and the US
regarding the exposure to fiscal challenges. The current global crisis made clear that the spell of
great moderation was a transitory hiatus. The purpose of this note is to illustrate that the end of
the great moderation has profound implications for the assessment of fiscal sustainability. The
pertinent issue goes beyond the obvious increase in the stock of public debt/GDP induced by the
global recession, to include the neglected perspective that the vulnerabilities associated with a
given public debt to GDP ratio increase with the future volatility of key economic variables.
          A common measure of fiscal burden is the funding flow needed to keep public debt/GDP
constant. Specifically, a public debt/GDP ratio, d, would grow overtime at a rate equal to the
gap between the real interest rate on the debt, r, minus the growth rate of the economy, g,
assuming a primary balance of zero, i.e., d = ( r − g − ( PB / D) ) d , where d is change in d over

continuous time, PB is the government’s primary balance and D is the public debt.2 Henceforth
we refer to the gap (r – g) as the flow cost of public debt. The fiscal burden associated with a
given public debt/GDP ratio, d, equals (r-g)*d. Vulnerability projections of the IMF and other
international financial organizations frequently focus on postulating the expected future pattern
of d. Such projections portray the path of public debt/GDP in future years by adjusting the
present debt/GDP according to the expected future path of taxes and fiscal commitments. We
supplement this approach with fragility analysis based on what the past data says about (r-g).

Specifically, we evaluate for a given future projected public debt/GDP the possible distribution
of the fiscal burden if the distribution of flow cost of funding debt in future decades resembles
the past four decades. While there is no obvious threshold indicating a funding crisis, higher
burden of public debt [(r – g)*d] increases the need for fiscal adjustment in the form of some
combination of lower government expenditure and transfers, and higher taxes.
        Looking at the past to provide insight about the future has been a neglected perspective
since before the crisis. The low real interest rate and the moderate growth of OECD countries
during the era of the “great moderation” implied very low fiscal burden. Perceiving the great
moderation as an enduring state instead of a lucky draw induced fiscal laxity. Arguably,
derailing short term economic stabilization based on projections of permanent gloomy growth
rates today may be an equally invalid perspective. Taking the past four decades as guidance for
possible future developments helps in avoiding the fallacy of framing the future in terms of a
unique scenario, a strategy that may lead to either too optimistic or too pessimistic priors,
possibly magnifying the resultant macro volatility. Looking at the past data is useful, as it
indicates that growth rates and real interest rates are highly unstable over time, with low
correlations across decades (Easterly et al., 1993; Mishkin, 1981). Fiscal projections may be
alarmist if one jumps from the priors of great moderation to the prior of permanent high future
burden. Yet, the importance of both r and g in determining the actual debt burdens as well as the
range of scenarios faced by OECD countries in the past suggests that countries exposed to
heightened vulnerability may consider both short term stabilization and forward looking fiscal
reforms.


Average flow costs of public debt since 1970
        To construct the flow costs of public debt, we first collect data on the current average
effective maturity of general government debt for OECD countries (Table 1).3 The average
OECD country had an effective maturity of general government debt of around 6 years. UK debt
had the highest maturity, about 14 years and Hungary the lowest, of 3 years. We then use the
series of average annual real interest rate on the government debt of maturity most closely
corresponding to the actual effective maturity of general government debt, and the growth rate of
3
 The effective maturities in Table 1 correspond to the year 2010 or the latest available values. The data
are sourced from Bloomberg, BIS, EU and national sources.

real GDP, to compute the annual flow cost, (r-g) for each country.4 The annual series of (r-g) is
then averaged over 5-year intervals starting in 1970. The annual real interest rate and growth rate
series are plotted in figure 1, and the average flow costs for the 5-year periods are shown in
Table 2. Most OECD countries had negative flow costs of public debt during the 1970’s, due to
the negative real interest rates owing to high inflation in this period. Most countries saw their
flow costs peak in one of the three periods between 1980 and 1994. The average flow costs
during the last decade were low or moderately negative. The table illustrates the large swings in
flow costs for each country, indicating that the debt burden associated with any given d can vary
considerably, depending on the difference between real interest rate and GDP growth.
        In addition, the distribution of (r-g) may be characterized by fat tails. To test this, in
Table 3, we present the statistics on relative kurtosis of the annual series of (r-g) for each country
and the results of normality tests. The distribution of (r-g) is leptokurtic in Germany, Greece,
Korea, Japan and the USA.5 The normality hypothesis is rejected by the Shapiro-Wilk test for 12
out of the 26 countries and by the joint skewness and kurtosis test in 11 countries. In addition, in
Table 4, we present the realized probabilities of bad outcomes, i.e. realizations of (r-g) exceeding
the intra-country mean by 1.645 or more standard deviations. The last three columns of Table 4
list the ex-post probability of (r-g) ≥ μ + 1.645σ, (r-g) ≥ μ + 1.96σ and r-g ≥ μ + 2.3267σ,
respectively. For a normally distributed variable, these probabilities would equal 0.05, 0.025 and
0.01, respectively. For nine countries, the realized probability of an extremely adverse outcome
(corresponding to r-g ≥ μ + 2.3267σ) exceeds 0.02, i.e. is over double what it would be in a
normal distribution. For 17 out of the 26 countries, the realized probability of an (r-g) exceeding
the mean by 1.96 standard deviations or more is higher than the corresponding probability in a
normal distribution, 0.025. The possibility of fat tails indicates a need to evaluate carefully, both
the average and extreme scenarios in projecting debt burdens.
        In order to evaluate the various outlooks for the future debt burdens for OECD countries,
we use the World Economic Outlook (WEO) projections of gross general government debt/GDP

  A leptokurtic distribution is more “peaked” than the normal distribution and has a fatter tail. Its kurtosis
is greater than 3.

ratio, d, for each country, for the year 2015 (Table 1).6 A majority of the OECD countries are
expected to have debt/GDP ratios exceeding 60% by 2015. For the projected debt/GDP ratios,
we compute the implied debt burdens for each country, for each of the scenarios in Table 2.
Figure 2 plots the best case, the worst case and the average of the best and the worst scenarios for
each country. We define the best case scenario as the one with the lowest flow cost, based on the
historical average flow costs in Table 2. The worst case scenario is analogously defined. All but
three OECD countries in Figure 2 will have a negative debt burden in the best case scenario. A
negative debt burden implies that the government can run a primary deficit and yet keep the
debt/GDP ratio constant (or more precisely, that it would have to run a primary deficit in order to
keep the debt/GDP ratio constant, which would otherwise shrink). Only Italy, Denmark and
Sweden have positive debt burdens under the historical best case, and should this scenario
prevail, their gross debt burden for the projected 2015 debt/GDP ratio would be 0.03, 0.52 and
0.11 percent of GDP, respectively. Italy’s debt burden in the best case scenario is lower than that
of Sweden and Denmark, even though its projected debt is 124.7 percent of GDP, while Sweden
and Denmark have low projected debts of 37.6 and 49.8 percent of their GDP, respectively. In
fact, should the (r-g) turn out to be negative, the higher the debt/GDP ratio, the lower the debt
burden. In the best case scenario, the US debt burden is lower than that of UK and Canada,
although the projected US debt is higher than both countries.
          Most OECD countries have worst-case projected debt burdens over 2 percent of GDP,
which, if realized, would likely be onerous, given their population dynamics and the
commitments of the welfare state. The US has an above-average debt burden in the worst case
scenario, of about 3.9 percent of GDP. Greece by far has the highest debt burden in the worst
case scenario, of about 12.4 percent of GDP. In the worst case scenario, a Greek default is not a
far-fetched possibility. Another interesting case is of Portugal, which has recently seen a cut in
its sovereign rating by all three international ratings agencies, but whose debt burden is moderate
relative to peers even in the worst case scenario.7

The prudence of fiscal adjustment increases with the uncertainty of the future debt burden. In
Figure 3, we use three different measures to capture the uncertainty implied by the variation in
(r-g). In Figure 3.a., we plot the difference between the historical worst and best case scenarios.
The country with the greatest uncertainty in the future debt burden is Japan, followed by Greece,
Belgium, Ireland, France and Canada. The US has the 11th highest uncertainty in terms of (worst-
best) scenarios. While most countries that have low projected debt ratios occupy the lower end of
the scale, that is, they have lower uncertainty in future debt burdens, this uncertainty does not
increase monotonically with the size of projected debt. The US projected debt for 2015 is higher
than the projected debt of 7 of the countries that face greater uncertainty in debt burden than the
US.
          In figure 3.a, Japan’s figure is inflated by the very negative flow costs it saw in its period
of high growth in the 1970’s and 1980’s. In figure 3.b and 3.c, we narrow our focus to less
extreme events. In order to figure 3.b, we use an alternative measure of uncertainty after
excluding the possibility of an extremely lucky draw for all countries. We re-define best and
worst scenarios after excluding the periods (from Table 2) with the highest average g or the
lowest average r. The uncertainty is lower for most countries8, than in figure 3.a. It is lower still
in figure 3.c, where we use the standard deviation of the annual series of (r-g), times d.
Nevertheless, the size of the uncertainty faced by most countries, those with high projected debt
and those with relatively lower projected debt, indicates a need for caution in formulating short
term policy based on overtly pessimistic scenarios, and also for forward looking fiscal reforms.
          Several caveats apply to the above analysis. In so far as the debt projections do not
include unfunded liabilities, the actual debt burden may be higher in all scenarios. The debt
burden, or the primary balance needed to keep the debt/GDP ratio constant, is computed here
using gross government debt (due to easier data availability), but an accurate measure of the debt
burden would use net government debt. While these considerations would change the actual
numbers of projected debt burdens, they wouldn’t undermine the overall message, which is that
the debt burden, (r-g)*d, depends on the realization of (r-g) as much as on the size of d.

Conclusions
       Our analysis highlights the uncertainty in future debt burdens facing OECD countries and
the importance of future real interest rates and growth rates in determining the debt burden,
particularly for countries with high projected debt/GDP ratios. In so far as the future growth may
depend on short term stabilization during or in the aftermath of a financial crash and a deep
recession, the additional debt incurred for such stabilization may not translate into excessively
high future flow costs of public debt. However, we also emphasize that the uncertainty of future
debt burden is likely to increase with the size of the future debt/GDP ratios. Prudent fiscal policy
therefore may involve both short term stabilization and forward looking fiscal reforms.
Admittedly, doing both simultaneously has challenged the political capacities of the US and
Europe. Yet, going overboard with only one of the two adjustments (i.e., focusing only on short
term stabilization, or on forward looking fiscal reforms in the form of early belt tightening) may
increase vulnerabilities. Focusing only on stabilization in the form of fiscal stimulus and
monetary easing raises concerns about the cost of government borrowing (as in the case of
Greece and the weaker underbelly of the Euro area). Focusing only on belt tightening today may
delay the global recovery. Finding the proper balance remains a work in progress.

Note: μ refers to the mean of (r-g) and σ to its standard deviation. Both are computed from annual observations on
(r-g) and are country-specific. The last three columns give the ex-post probability of (r-g) ≥ μ + 1.645σ, (r-g) ≥ μ +
1.96σ and r-g ≥ μ + 2.3267σ, respectively. The probability of (r-g) ≥ μ + 1.645σ for a normally distributed variable
equals 0.05, etc. Where realized probabilities are missing, they equal zero.

Note: *Real rates for Austria are based on the average return on bonds with maturities greater than one year for 1970-1982, and with a 9-10 year maturity for
1983-2010. Real rates for all other countries are the real rates on the maturity closes to the most recent average maturity of general government debt in Table 2.

Note: The gross debt burden representing the lowest flow costs is calculated by taking an average of the two lowest
values of the difference (r-g), respectively, and multiplying it with the projected debt to GDP ratio. For countries for
which flow costs for less than 4 periods are available, the single highest and lowest costs are used. *Real rates for
Austria are based on the average return on bonds with maturities greater than one year for 1970-1982, and with a 9-
