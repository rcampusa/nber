1.   Introduction

     There is no standard model of money in an individual optimization

problem.   Money—in—utility specifications,   overlapping generations models,

and cash—in—advance models are perhaps the three most popular optimizing

models of money that are tractable in a general equilibrium context.      One

difficulty with the cash—in—advance   setup in a representative—agentmodel is

that there is no explicit reason for trade.     If all individuals are alike,

                                                                     Lucas
they can consume their own production, and money would be worthless.

(1980) tried to get around this problem with a parable about differentiated

                                                                color but
products of different colors: each individual produces only one

consumes many colors, so if the number of colors is large then he would

consume almost entirely goods purchased   on the market.   While this parable

has great appeal, it was not developed formally in the model.     In particular,

the choice decisions of individuals regarding which color(s) to produce and

consume were not developed.

     Subsequently,   Lucas and Stokey (1983, 1987) developed a model with two

                                 "credit goods."     The former require money
types of goods, "cash goods" and

for purchase,   but the latter do not: they may be purchased on credit,   i.e.

                                                                   a
they are analogous to goods that are both produced and consumed by

particular individual.     A positive nominal interest rate is shown to distort

decisions in their model, as it does investment decisions in Stockman (1981)

 and Abel (1985) and labor supply decisions   in Aschauer and Greenwood (1983).

 But Lucas and Stokey took the identificationof goods with the transactions

                                                  market purchase versus
 technology (cash versus credit, or alternatively

 consumption out of one's own production) as exogenous.
     This paper incorporates Lucas's "color parable" into an explicit model

 that permits specializationto be chosen optimally by individuals.      We
develop a differentiated product model with money, a cash—in—advance
constraint (motivated by technology) for market purchases, and an endogenous

                                            the choices of which goods to
specialization decision.    Consequently,

produce, which to consume, and which goods to buy on the market (using money)

are endogenous.

    In the overlapping generations (00) model of money, individuals are

differentiated by generation,    and money is used for transactions between

generations.    Our model shares with 00 monetary models the feature that

individuals    can consume their own endowments (or, in our model, the goods

                                                            other goods.           In
they produce), and money is used for transactions involving
our model, individuals are differentiatedby which goods they choose to

produce,   and they choose to differentiate themselves in equilibrium. Unlike

the 00 model, these differences are not assumed exogenously.      King and

Plosser have recently developed a cash—in—advance     model in which, as in our

model, individuals who are alike ex ante choose to specialize to achieve

gains in production.     In the King—Plosser model, individuals choose human

capital that gives them a comparative advantage either in goods in

even—number periods or goods in odd—number periods, so individuals trade to

smooth consumption over time.' Money is used for trades in the 00 models and

the King—Plosser model, but all trade is intertemporal.      In contrast,    our

trade" each period, because our model generates endogenous differences among

individuals    that create nontrivial intir.atemporaltrade that uses money.

     We show that the effects of an increase in the rate of money growth with
                                                                   the
endogenous specialization may differ from the results predicted by

nominal interest rate raises the relative price of "cash goods" in terms of

 "credit goods" in their model, because the former (but not the latter)
                                                                                  3




involve hold: ig   cash   and paying the opportunity cost of the nominal interest

rate.   In our formalization of Lucas's color parable, this translates into

the proposition that a higher nominal interest rate raises the cost of

consuming goods purchased on the market relative to the cost of consuming

goods produced by the individual himself,     "home—produced goods" (which he can
                                              With a fixed degree of
simply eat, and need not buy with cash).

specialization,    an increase in the nominal interest rate reduces consumption

of market goods and raises the consumption     of home—produced goods.

Similarly,    a higher nominal interest rate raises the quantity of leisure (a

home—produced good) consumed as in the Aschauer—Greenwoodmodel.          However, we

show that when the degree of specialization     is endogenous,   an increase in the

nominal interest rate can reduce the consumption of each type of

home—produced good, reduce rather than raise total leisure, and either reduce
or raise the degree of specialization.  We discuss properties of our model

using simulations,    and discuss the implied nominal—interest elasticities of

the (real) demand for money in the general equilibrium.

    Finally,    we extend our model to include an alternative transactions

method (ATM).      Innovations in financial markets have created and will

continue to create new methods of transacting,      such as credit cards, debit

cards, etc.     We introduce into our model not only the distinction between

purchasing goods on the market and producing them at home (for one's own

consumption    or for sale), but also the distinction between alternative

payment methods for purchased goods.       As before, we do not impose any

exogenous    requirememt that certain goods must be purchased with money while

others may be purchased with the ATM.       Instead, we allow individuals   to

choose the method of payment for each good.2       In particular, we assume that

individuals    may either pay with cash or may barter.    Paying with cash
                                                                                             4




involves an opportunity cost related to the nominal interest rate.                 Barter

involves other real expenditures to complete a transaction:              search costs due

to the "double coincidence of wants" problem would be the most natural cost

here, but for simplicity we model the costs of barter as a labor cost of

transporting goods.        The key distinction between he costs of using money and

the costs of barter is that while the former are related to the nominal

interest rate and so involve nominal variables directly,             the latter are

purely real.        The ATM will be introduced in Section 4; we first turn to the

basic model in Sections 2 and 3.



2.   The Basic Model

     We examine a simple differentiatedproduct model with money.                 We assume

there is a continuum of types of goods on the interval [0,1].                 There is also

continuum of individuals on a circle with unit circumference.                 Goods and

individuals are each indexed by i on this unit interval (or circle)

Individuals have identical preferences given by



            V   =        d [J U(C(i))di - h(J L(i)di)]1       0<<1.                       (1)


where UO     is     strictly concave and satisfies U'(O)a,      hO   is strictly    convex,
       is consumption of the good of type i at date t,           and           is labor
C(i)                                                                   L(i)
effort used in producing the good of type i at date t.

     We assume that technology developed by the society has resulted in the

invention of vending machines, which are able to protect goods from being

stolen until a payment is made for the goods.             In addition,   the vending

machine has the name of the company that made it on the front, and the

company's    reputation would suffer if the machine failed to deliver goods (or
                                                                                            5




a refund) after money was inserted.                Finally, the machine is able to

                                                                        bills
recognize money so that people are not able to put counterfeit coins or
in the machine.        Technology has not developed yet that would allow the

machine to evaluate whether a consumption good is                   real' or "counterfeit," so


only money can be used to buy goods from vending machines:                 they cannot be

made to sell goods in exchange for other goods.                 Each individual owns a

                                                                   on the
vending machine that he uses to sell goods. The machine is located

circle.

    At the beginning of each period t, each individual receives a transfer of

            from the government.        The individual      also observes the current state
money   r
of the economy, to be specified below. He then chooses his desired labor

effort on each of the continuum          of goods on [O,1J      .    Labor effort   is


nonnegative, so in making this decision the individual is also choosing his

degree of specialization by allocating positive labor effort to a certain set

of goods.     Define



                             1   if          > D
                                      L(i)
                   =                                                                      (2)
            e(i)
                            D otherwise.




Then define the degree of specializationby                      where      measures the
                                                          l—a
fraction of goods that the individual produces at date t, i.e.



               =
                   J   e(i) di.                                                           (3)
The individuals production of each good i is denoted




          y(i)
                 =
                     f(at)L(i)

where f() is positive, decreasing,        and concave.    Equation (4) shows that
there are gains to specialization,        but the gains may be subject to

diminishing returns. If there were no differential costs of buying goods on
the market rather than consuming home—produced goods, then it would be

optimal for individuals       to specialize completely by setting           However,

there are costs of buying goods on the market as a result of the monetary

nature of exchange.3 These costs will work against specialization and lead

to an interior solution for
                                  a.
      We will see below that in equilibrium,         the relative price of goods i and

j is unity for all i,j on [0,1).         This fact is useful for defining the

individual's gross output,



                     di   =
                              f(a)               f(at)aL
          J                          J Lt(i)


where the last equality defines                as total labor effort by the individual
                                       aL
at date t.    We assume perfect competition in product markets.         (Even if       =
                                                                                   a
0,   there may be an infinity of individuals producing each type of good.)          It

is harmless to treat each individual's          labor effort for those goods he

chooses to produce as equal for each good, i.e.              for all i,j
                                                L(i)=L(j)=Lt
for which his labor effort is nonzero.

      After producing goods, each individual consumes some of them and sells

the rest on the market.        The individual places the goods he wishes to sell in

his vending machine, and (with full information about the current state of
                                                                                         7




the economy) adjusts the machine to emit goods in response to a sum of money

                                               of the good.              He then rides a
equal to the current equilibrium nominal price

tram (provided by nature) around the unit circle, using the money he had on

hand in his vending machine st the beginning of period t (from sales at date

t—l) and the transfer he received at the beginning of period t, to buy goods

from other individual's vending machines.               Goods are consumed on the spot as

                                                                                        The
tram ride takes a full "period," so there is not time for another ride.

next period then begins with vending machines emptied of money and transfers

from the government.        There is no possibility of communication between

individuals   because all are at different spots on the tram.             The exchange

system does not require individuals to meet, but it does require that

individuals   allocate some wealth to "money" accepted by the vending machines.

This induces a cash—in—advance           constraint on goods acquired on the market.

    We can       simplify the individual's optimization problem by making several
observations.         First, preferences and opportunities            are symmetric with

respect to all goods.              This implies a unit equilibrium relative price of

goods due to production arbitrage,               i.e.                 for all i,j.   So we can
                                                        p(i)=p(j)
                        =
define a price level
                     Pt               p(i)   for all     i.   Second, all individuals     are

identical    in tastes and opportunities;               they differ only by their names and
the types of the goods they produce.               But all will choose the same             and the

same Lt=Lt(i) in equilibrium.                Diminishing marginal utility of consumption

(and the absence of any increasing returns)                   guarantees that total output of
each good will be identical in equilibrium.                    This observation also implies

that no borrowing and lending, or other asset trade, will occur in

equilibrium. However, in writing the budget constraint (10) below, we will
include a term for nominal bond holdings because we will want to discuss the

nominal interest rate on those bonds (at which zero trade is the equilibrium

quantity).
                                                                                                9




    The individual's budget constraint can then be written as

                       (l+R_1)B_1 +      Mt       (M_1+r)]/p                                 (10)

where        denotes nominal bond holdings by the individual at date t, where a
        Bt
bond is an asset that costs one unit of money at date t and pays l+Rt units

of money at date t+i.

    The cash—in—advanceconstraint                 (7)   can be rewritten,     using the

observation that all relative prices are unity, as




             Jc*t(i)

    The state of the world at time t is                  (r1M_i).         The equilibrium nominal

price and interest rates will be defined below as functions of the state

where O(i).             and        are the Lagrange multipliers on constraints (14),
                  F,
(15), and (16).

       Equations (19) and (20) imply that the individual consumes the same

amount of all goods that he produces,                      and the same amount of all goods that

he does not produce.           He may consume different amounts of these two classes

of goods, however.           We drop time subscripts when there is no confusion.                     Let

c denote c(i) for all          i   in                 and c* denote c*(i) for all      i   in
                                           [O,ct),                                              [c,l]
Then (13), (15), and (18) imply that c(i)                          f(a)L(i) for   all i in
                                                                                                [0,i), so
                                                               <


cx(i)=0 for all i in                        This means that if        an   individual produces good

i,   he does not buy that good on the market.                      Instead, he sells some of each

of the goods he produces in order to obtain money for future purchases of

those goods that he does not expect to produce in the future.                         Consequently,

(19)    and (20) imply



           U(c)     =       U(c*)      —   .                                                        (25)



       Equations (21) and (22) imply



                =
           Rt       E[5+i/p+i]                 /

which shows that the shadow price of the cash—in—advarce constraint is

positive if and only if the nominal interest rate is positive.                             The return

on nominal bonds dominates                 the pecuniary return on money (zero), so
                                                                                                   12




individuals      choose to hold money only if its liquidity services,                   measured by

6,   compensate for        the difference     in pecuniary    returns.

      Equation (21), with (19) substituted for F, is the standard first—order

condition of the permanent income model or the consumption—based capital

asset pricing model,



                       =                                                                       (27)
           U'(c)             (1+R)3E{tJ(c+1) p/p44}.

There is no monetary wedge in this case because equation (19) applies only to

goods produced by the individual.               However,     substitution of (20) into (11)

yields an analogous equation, for goods purchased on the market, in which a

monetary wedge appears (in the form of the multiplier                    6)   .   Alternatively,
this wedge may be seen by substituting (20) into (22); the result is



           U'          =     13E{U'(c*t) Pt'Pt.iJ                                              (28)
                (cr)



Equations (27) and (28) imply that the expected marginal utility per dollar

of consumption of goods purchased on the market is less than the expected

marginal utility per dollar of own—produced goods whenever the nominal
interest rate is positive.             This highlights the analogy between a positive

nominal interest rate and a tax on market purchases of goods.

      Equation (23) shows that a positive nominal interest rate also creates a

wedge between the marginal utility of consumption of market goods and the

ratio of the marginal disutility of labor to the marginal product of labor:



           h'(ctL)/f(a)
                                  =   U'(c)    <   U'(c*).                                     (29)
                                                                                                    13




This wedge has been discussed in previous papers by Aschauer and Greenwood

(1983), and a similar wedge in a model with investment appears in Stockman

(1981) and     Abel     (1985).

     The optimal degree of specialization,             i.e. the choice of the number of


goods to which an individual should devote positive labor effort,                     is

determined by equation (24).               Given total labor effort              a small increase
                                                                           nL.
in      which corresponds to a fall in the degree of specialization,                       lowers

                                                  FaLf'(a). The marginal
                                             cost                                           benefit
total output by
                        Lf'(c), with utility
of raising            must be equated to its marginal cost.            That benefit is the

ability to consume an extra type of good (type                ) out        of home productiom,

without having to use money to buy it from other individuals'                     vending

machines.         Previously,      c* units of the good of type
                                                                      & were purchased from
these machines.         The marginal utility of relaxing the constraint (14) — which

prevented consumption out of home production when there is no home production
of this good —        is   e(a+)
                                     .   So the marginal benefit of increasing        o    is

                  Notice that              = 8, because            total                  of the
                                                        (given             consumption

good, c*) the inability to consume out of home production adds to purchases

on the market, which require money.               So




            (/F)c*         =
                               f'(u)cL.                                                         (3D)




     The rate of monetary growth was assumed to be drawn independently over

time from a fixed distribution function, and always strictly positive. There

is no other source of randomness              in the model.      Define real money balances,



                  =            +
            'St                    r)/p.                                                        (31)

3.   Properties of Equilibrium in the Basic Model

      An equilibrium is a set of functions m or p, R,                 c, c*,     L,    F,   €5,   that

solve problem one and satisfy the market—clearingconditions (18)                   .
                                                                                        Clearly
there is a time—invariant real equilibrium in this model with a strictly

positive nominal interest rate.                Note that   (15)   and (18), along with our

results that consumption is the same for all goods produced at home and also

is the same for all goods purchased on the market,                   imply



           ac + (1—&c+ =              f(ct)crL.                                                   (32)




The equilibrium of the model can now be summarized as (32) and                   the following
equations,   where we drop time subscripts for time—invariant real variables:


                       =
                               ''
             =       (1—&)c+,                                                                     (34)




           1+R   =     1/SE(p)       >   0,                                                       (35)




           (1+R)U(c)           =    U'(c*),                                                       (36)




           f'(&aL          =    —Rc*,    and                                                      (37)




           h'(aL)      =       f(a)U'(c).                                                         (38)




Equations (32) and (36)—(38) implicitly give equilibrium solutions for c, c*,
                                                                                            15




a, and L.     Equation (35) determines the nominal interest rate, while equation

(34) with the definition (31) determines the price level.

    We have only to complete the description of the equilibrium by giving an

example of an assignment function that determines which individuals produce
which sets of goods.        Obviously, there are infinitely many assignment

functions    that will work.      One is that agents of type      j   choose:




            if j+a <   1   then


                                               1   if i is in     Li j+a)
                                   e3(i) =

                                               o   otherwise

                                                                                        (39)

            if j+a > 1 then


                                               1   if   i   is in [j,l] or [O,ct+j—l)

                                   e3(i) =

                                               O   otherwise.




    An increase in the mean growth rate of money would, according to equation

(35), tramslate into a higher nominal interest rate.               In order to determine

the effects of greater money growth on equilibrium allocations, we consider

some special cases of the model, and then report on results of simulations of

the general model.

    First, suppose that L and a are exogenously              determined.    Then c and c*

are determined by (32) and (36).         We find that an increase in the nominal

interest rate (brought about by an increase in mean money growth) raises an
                                                                                                   16




individual's    consumption of home—produced goods and reduces consumption of

[goods he purchases on the market:



            dc/dR =      (1—a)IJ'(c)/Q      > 0      and                                        (40)




            dc*/dR =    —ctu'(c)/Ii     <   0,                                                  (41)




where



               =   —
                       {cuU''(c*)   +   (1—a)(1+R)U''(c)}          > 0.                         (42)




These results reflect the higher relative cost of buying goods purchased on

the market when the nominal interest is higher.                     This substitution from

market goods to home goods resembles the results in Aschauer and Greenwood,

where home goods are analogous to leisure (which can be thought of as

productive time in the household)                and the substitution out of "cash goods"

into "credit goods" in Lucas and Stokey (1983, 1987), where "cash goods" are

analogous    to goods purchased on the market in our model and "credit goods"

play the role of home—produced goods in our model.                        Indeed,   if we allow labor

services L to be endogenous then our model consists of equations                         (31), (36),

and (38) which implicitly give c. c*, and L.                     The results are then



            dc/dR =      (l—a)h''(aL)U'(c)/fl'          >   0,                                  (43)

The result for total labor supply,                     iiL,         is the same as in Aschauer and

Greenwood; that for consumption of the two types of goods is the sane as in

Lucas and Stokey.

     The comparative        statics results just discussed require an exogenously

fixed degree of specialization.                    In fact, we will show that results differ

when the degree of specialization is chosen optimally by individuals.                                               The

simplest case to consider is the choice of a when total                                       labor effort       iuL   is

exogenously fixed.          Let



          x   E       c —   c* aLf1(u)             > 0                                                                 (47)



where the sign follows from (29), concavity of 130, and f'<G.                                             Then



          dc/dR = {xR + U' '(c+)c+x                    — ctLf'       '(a)(la)U'(c)}/!)+,

     While an increase in the nominal interest rate reduces consumption of

each type of good purchased on the market, its effects on consumption of each

type of good produced at home and on the degree of specialization are

indeterminate       in sign.      Consider a special case in which



            f(a) = F — qa,                                                                     (52)




where F and q are positive constants.                Then c+, c, and a are given by



            c* =   qaL/R,


            c =    U'{(1+R)U'(qaL/R)},            and                                          (54)




            a = {FaL — qaL/R}/{c+qa'L—qaL/R}.                                                  (55)




If   also   the utility function is U(c) =              ln(c),   then   c   is given by (53), and c

and a are given by



            c = (1+R)qaL/R,



             a = (F —   q/R)/2q.
                                                                                      19




In   this case, a higher nominal interest rate causes less specialization

(higher a), and, in contrast to the results for fixed a, reduces consumption

of each type of home—produced good,     c.

     This example shows that the type of results obtained in a model like the

one discussed by Lucas and Stokey,     on the effects of changes in conditional

expectations of money   growth on demands    for "cash goods"   and    "credit goods,"
is   sensitive to the assumption of exogenous specialization (which translates

in their model to exogeneity of the matching of types of goods with the type

of payment required for them)   .
                                    Intuitively,   a higher nominal interest rate

raises the wedge between the costs of goods produced at home and goods

purchased on the market.     Given the degree of specialization,        individuals

respond to a higher wedge by buying less on the market and consuming more

home—produced goods (selling less of them)     .   But individuals can also respond

by reducing the degree of specialization in order to reduce the set of goods

purchased on the market.     A reduction in the degree of specialization

involves costs of forgoing the benefits of specialization,        and this "wealth

effect" leads to a fall in consumption of each type of good produced at home.

If a is fixed exogenously,    the individual consumes less of each

market—purchasedgood and more of each home—produced good.             In contrast, with

a rising in our example, the individual consumes less of all goods that were

previously produced at home, less of all market goods, and possibly more of

goods previously purchased on the market and now produced at home.            The loss

from the higher nominal interest rate is "spread out" across a wider range            of


goods rather than concentrated on market goods alone.        Gne might suspect that

a similar argument would imply that results on the effects of a higher

nominal interest rate on the labor/leisure choice can also be altered by
                                                                                                        20




allowing individuals to choose optimally the degree of specialization,                           and

this suspicion is right.

    Returning to the general case
                                                — but with fixed total labor             effort aL     —
we can see that a higher nominal               interest rate definitely raises            a   if it

lowers c or leaves c unchanged.                If dc/dR 1 0, then




           x[R+c*U'
                        I

                            (c*)J   <   aL(1—a)f'       (a)U' (c)   .                                 (58)


But then

           dir/dR   =       —U'' (c)(i—a)(l+R)c*          — U'' (c*)ac* —     aRU' (c)



                      >      —U'' (c)(1—a)(1+R)c*          —   U'' (c*)nc*
                               —     ctRx[R+c*U'(c*)J/aL(l—a)f''(a)
                                                    I




                             = —U' '(c)(l—a)(l+R)c*            —   R2xILf' '(a)(i—a)
                                    —    U'' (c*)ac*[1 — xR/aL(1—a)f' (a)]    '




                             > 0.




So, although a higher nominal interest rate has an ambiguous effect on a, in

order for it to reduce              a   we would require parameter values such that the

higher nominal interest rate also raises c, the consumption of each type of

home—produced good.
     We now turn to the general model, and report results from simulations.

For purposes of the simulations,                            we assumed the following functional forms:


                                     1         1—F
            U(c)       :                   c         ,                                                      (60)
                             1—F

            F(a         :=   1.1 —                               , and
                                           1.090! —         a



            11(L)      :=    L   .                                                                          (62)


     We then solved the model for c, c*, a,                              laL   (=   total   labor effort), and m

for various parameter values, F and j, and for various nominal interest rates

R.   The nominal interest rate can be treated as the exogenous                                  variable

because, given 3 and equations                            (33) and (35), it is simply a transformation

of the rate of money growth.                             In each case, we varied the nominal interest

rate from        .10   to 5.00.

     For F=1, that is, the case of U(c)log(c), and j=2, we found that an

increase in the rate of money growth (i) reduces total labor effort, 1, (ii)

reduces consumption of each type of good that continues to be purchased on

the market, c*, (iii) reduces consumption of each type of good produced

the household, c, and (iv) increases the number of different types of goods

(strictly speaking,                  the measure of the set of goods) produced by the

household,        a.       (Recall the          a        is inversely    related to the degree of

specialization.)

     The    real       demand        for   money         falls   with increases in the nominal         interest
rate.      The    implied interest—elasticity of the demand for                             money   in the general
                                                                                  22




equilibrium with these parameters is reasonable in magnitude and is a
function of the level of the nominal interest rate.      At R—. 10, the elasticity

is —.60,   and rises in absolute value along with the level of a; at R=5.00 the

elasticity is —.90.   Our result on the behavior of the elasticity as R rises

differs from that of Svensson (1985), in which the response of real money

demand to the nominal money growth rate is negative for sufficiently small

money—growth rates, but rises to zero (and the transactions velocity rises to

unity) as the growth rate increases.     In contrast,   our model implies that the

interest—elasticityof money demand may rise as the money growth rate rises.

    For F=.50 and j=2, we found that an increase in the money growth rate (i)

reduces total labor effort and (ii) reduces consumption of each type of good

purchases on the market.     But we also found some nonmonotonic behavior of c

and a: (iii) for money—growth rates such that the nominal interest rate is

smaller than.25, an increase in the growth rate lowers consumption of each

type of good produced by the household and raises the number of goods

produced by the household.    For .25 C R < 1.50, an increase in the money

growth rate raises consumption of each type of good produced by the

household, and continues to raise the number of different goods each

household produces.    Finally,   for R > 1.50, an increase in the money growth

rate raises consumption of each type of good produced by the household but

reduces the number of different types of goods that the household produces,

leaving more goods to be purchased on the market.       Despite the fact that the

household then purchases more types of goods on the market, the decline in

consumption   of each type is sufficiently large that increases    in the money

growth rate always lowers the real demand for money.       The implied

interest—elasticityof money demand, in equilibrium with these parameters,         is
—.65 at an interest rate of R=.      10,   and rises in absolute value as R rises,

reaching —1.03 at a = 1.00 and —1.13 at R =        3.00.
    For smaller values of F the response of c, the level of consumption of

each type of good produced at home, also changes.          For 1=. 10 and j=2, we

found that an increase in the money growth rate (i) lowers total labor

effort,    (ii) lowers consumption    of each type of good purchased on the market,

but (iii) raises consumption of each type of good produced by the household.

Finally,    (iv) an increase in the money—growth rate raises the number of types

of goods produced by the household if R C .20, but reduces this number of

types if R > .20.     The implied interest—elasticity      of money demand varies

monotonically from —.82 at R=.10 to —1.46 at $=1.00.

    For g=2 and j=2, we found that an increase in the rate of money growth

raises total labor effort.     This differs from the results in Wilson (1979)

and Aschauer and Greenwood (1983), where higher inflation leads households t

substitute
       away from        market goods into leisure, which         like the "credit

goods" of Lucas and Stokey (1983, 1987), is not purchased with money.            In our

model, in contrast, there are two opposing effects on labor effort:            the

substitution effect that reduces it and also a wealth effect associated with

the reduction in output when households optimally vary the degree of

specialization.     With these (and other) parameter values, greater rates of

inflation can be associated with more, rather than less, labor effort.               In

addition,   greater rates of money growth reduce consumption of each type of

good (whether produced by the household or purchased on the market) and
raises the number of types of goods the household produces.          Implied

interest—elasticitiesof money demand range from —.59 at $—. 10 to —.90 at

5.00.
                                                                                             24




     We also examined the effects of variations in j, the disutility—of—labor

parameter. An increase in        j   corresponds   to more curvature of the implied

utility—of—leisure function at each level of labor effort.                With   F2   and

j20, for    example,     an increase in the rate of money growth reduces

consumption of each type of good, reduces total labor effort, and raises the

number of types of goods produced by the household if R C 1.50 or lowers this

number if   It   >   1.50.
       These results show that a variety of responses of real variables to the
                                                                                       and
money growth rate are possible in this model, despite the simplicity,

that these responses are not always even monotonIc.



4.     Alternative Transactions Methods (ATM5)

        We now alter the model to permit an alternative transactions method,

ATM.     Individuals     may barter goods.   Barter involves transporting goods to a

central market (in the middle of the circle where individuals               live),

participating in centralized exchange there at Walrasian prices, and

returning home.         Transporting goods requires e units of labor per good

carried to the central market.4 Individuals are also permitted to use money

in the central market, but they would not choose to do so because it involves

the extra cost of the nominal interest rate and           has   no benefits because the

costs of transacting in the central market are zero.

       Assume,   as before, that there is a stationary rational expectations

equilibrium.         Let z(i) denote the number of goods of type      i   that the

individual acquires through barter.           The maximization problem is the same as

before (12), except the instantaneous utility function is now
                                                                                        25

            JU[c(i)+c*(i)+z(i)J                            JJz(i)diJ

and   the   budget constraint (15) becomes


                 —                  +         —
                     (1+R               Mt        (Mti+7-)]/p                       (64)

and we have a nonnegativity constraint on



            z(i) > 0        for all          i.                                     (65)




      The necessary conditions for each individual's maximization problem are

now the same as in Section 2, but with the following changes:

      (1)   U(c*) and its derivatives replaced by 1.J(c*+z), where z =       z(i) for
                                                                                ,




all   i   not in EO,a), is the consumption of goods acquired through barter.

      (2)   h(aL) and its derivatives are replaced by h[aL+(1—c)az] and its

derivatives.

      (3)   Equation (24) becomes



            et(a)[ct*(a)+z(&)]
                                        +
                                            Ftf'(tt)atLt    =   0.                  (66)




      (4)   The new condition associated with the optimal choice of z(i) is



            U' (c(i)+cs'(i)+z(i))       — F   — ah' — w(i)      = 0                 (67)



where w(i) is the multiplier on the new constraint (65)
                                                                                                 26




    The real labor cost associated with the barter system drives a wedge

between the costs of consuming home—produced goods and market—purchased

goods, as before.         Obviously, barter and monetary exchange can coexist in

equilibrium only if          6 =   uh' 0.

    The form of (66) reflects the choice that an individual has if he chooses

a smaller &.       A   smaller a implies more specialization,            which means that more

types of goods are purchased on the market.                 Unlike the model in Sections 2

and 3, the model with an ATM permits the individual to choose the best method

of buying goods on the market.               The form of    (66)   reflects this option.    If

the economy is at an interior equilibrium where both money and barter are

used to purchase market goods, then in the (stochastic) steady state

equilibrium we have          R = 6/F and (66) implies



         (SIF)(c*+z)          =    R(c*+z)    =   —f'(a)aL.


    An equilibrium is a set of functions that now includes z() and                    w0.    There

are three types of possible equilibria in the model, associated with which of

the two systems of transactions are used.                  Two of these types involve corner

solutions,   either without the ATM            (as   in Sections 2 and    3)   or without money.

Assuming barter and monetary exchange are both used in equilibrium, then we
have



                         =
         pt+i/pt


         m     =       (i—a)c*,                                                             (70)

                                                                                              27




          (1+R)U(c)          =    U'(c*+z),                                                (72)




          U (c*+z) — uh [aL+(1—a)az) = U! (°)                                              (73)




          h'    [aL+(1—a)azj I      f(a)     =   U'(c),                                    (74)




          f1    (a)aL   =    —R(c*+z), and                                                 (75)




          ac +     (l—a)(c*+z)       =    f(a)oL                                           (76)




which determine c, cs, z, a, and              aT...   Given total labor effort,   aL, we have

the system excluding         equation (79)

    If monetary growth is low, then (71) implies that the nominal interest

rate will be low.           In that case, the costs of monetary exchange are

sufficiently low that no barter occurs.                   Then the model collapses to that of

Section 2.       At a higher rate of monetary growth, both barter and money are

used to acquire market goods.              Then, for a range of nominal interest rates,

there are equilibria with both barter and monetary exchange.                   While the


per—unit leisure cost of barter is constant, diminishing marginal utility of

leisure   (h'     positive)      implies that the utility cost of barter rises        in the

volume of barter exchange.               This prevents individuals from suddenly switching

from an equilibrium in which all market exchange is monetary to an

equilibrium in which all market exchange is through barter as the nominal

interest rate rises.             In this range, z, consumption of each type of good

acquired by barter, rises with the nominal interest rate R, and c*,

consumption      of each type of good purchased with money, falls with IL               As in

the model of Section 2, consumption of each type of home—produced good, c,
                                                                                        28




may rise or fall with R depending on the parameters.         The ability to trade

with the ATM also affects the responsiveness of consumption of each type of

good,   and the degree of specialization,    to a change in the nominal interest

rate.   Obviously, a greater cost of barter a reduces the amount of barter and

the consumption of each type of barter good.          Clearly, shifts in a over time

due to financial innovations would alter the demand for money, the degree of

specialization in production,     and the total volume of market exchange.        We

believe that extensions of this model may be useful in obtaining predictions

about changes in other variables that would accompany shifts in the money

demand function in response to financial innovation.

     Finally,   if the nominal interest rate is very high then monetary exchange

vanishes and all market exchange is through the ATM.          In this case the

equilibrium     is described by the set of equations above with c*0, without

equation (63), and with equation     (6)   replaced by



           U'(c)f'(cr)crL =   —ah'[üL+(i—a)az]z.                                   (77)




4.   Conclusions

     We have examined a model of differentiated products with monetary

exchange in which individuals may consume their own output, buy other

individuals' output with money, or use an alternative transactions method,

barter, to acquire other individuals'       output.    With a low nominal interest

rate or a high cost of the ATM, technological         considerations dictate that the

use of money is the lowest—cost alternative for market transactions.             With

lower costs of the ATM or a higher nominal interest rate, some or all market

transactions may occur with the ATM.        In contrast to previous models,
                                                                              29




individuals   are identical ex ante but choose to differ ex post in equilibrium

to take advantage of gains from specialization,   the specialization choice is

endogenous,   and monetary exchange occurs for market transactions that involve

exchange of differentiated gods at a point in time (so that a nonzero balance

of trade for an individual is not a prerequisite for monetary exchange)   .   In
contrast to models that exogenously tie certain types of consumption goods to

certain methods of exchange, and in contrast to models with a fixed degree of

specialization,   we find that consumption of home—produced goods may actually

fall rather than rise with a rise in the nominal interest rate.    Finally,   our

model can be used to obtain implications regarding the effects of a decrease

in the cost of using alternative transactions methods,   i.e. to technical

innovations   of the kind that have accompanied recent changes in financial

markets and information technology.

    1.  The cash—in—advance constraint in the King—Plosser model requires
that a commodity they call gold coin" be exchanged for goods; gold coin is
money in their model because it is assumed that buyers can verify its value
at a lower cost than they could verify the value of other goods that might be
used as payment. In our model, fiat money is recognized by the vending
machines as legitimate payment at a much lower cost than if the vending
machines had to be built to recognize the value of various goods that might
be offered as payment.

    2.  Some features of our model are shared by Schreft (1987), who allows
trade credit as an alternative to monetary transactions in an
overlapping—generationsmodel with spatially separated agents.

    3. These costs could also be interpreted as resulting from explicit
taxes on market transactions, costs of shopping, etc.

    4. We assume goods are consumed at the central market, as at each vending
machine, so we do not include costs of carrying goods back home.
