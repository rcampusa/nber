                       The Two Faces of Unionism



                               ABSTRACT




      This study delineates and assesses the relative accuracy of two views

of trade unions in the U.S.   In the first, which we call the "monopoly"

view, unions are a detrimental force in advanced capitalist systems; unions

do little more than raise the wages of their members beyond what they would

otherwise be, increasing the degree of economic inefficiency and inequality.

In the second, which we refer to as the "collective voice/institutional

response" view, unions provide workers with collective voice, which is

essential in the absence of meaningful opportunities for individual exit;

this voice elicits institutional responses which dramatically change the

nature of the employment relationship and, in so doing, increases the levels

of productivity and equality in many settings.

      The evidence presented indicates that those who focus on the monopoly

face of unionism and ignore the collective voice/institutional response view

are likely to hold erroneous beliefs about unions in this country.    The

facts indicate that on net unions do   ~   reduce efficiency or equality and

are generally democratic and non-corrupt organizations.

          Trade unions are the principal institution of workers in modern

     capitalist societies, as endemic as large firms, oligopolistic organization

     of industries,and governmental regulation of free enterprise.       For over two

     hundred years, since the days' of Adam Smith, there has been widespread

     disagreement about the effects of unions on the economy.       On the one side

     are economists including John Stuart Mill, Alfred Marshall and Richard Ely

     (one of the founders of the American Economic Association)wto have viewed

     unions as having major positive effects on the economy.       On the other side

     are economist!?    such ..as, Henry Simons and Fritz Machlup who have stressed
     the adverse effects of unions on the national dividend.       In the 1930s and

     1940s unions were at the center of attentiort among intellectuals, with

     most social scientists viewing them as an important positive force in

     society.   In recent years, unionism has become a more peripheral topic

     and unions have come to be viewed less positively.       Less and less space in

     social science journals, magazines, and newspapers is devoted to unions.

     For example, the fraction of articles in major economics journals treating

     trade unionism dropped      from 9.2 percent in the 1940s to 5.1 percent in the

     1950s to 0.4 percent in the early 1970s.      What is written is increasingly

     unfavorable.      The press often paints unions as organizations which are

     socially unresponsive, elitist, nondemocratic, or ridden with crime.

     Our analysis of the content of articles on unions in two major

     national news journals, Newsweek and Time, shows an increase in the

     percent of lines of print unfavorable to unions from 34 percent in the

     1950s to 51 percent in the 1970s.      Economists, into whose domain

     analysis of trade unions naturally falls, at present generally treat unions
'-   uni~imensionally as    monopolies whose sole function is to raise wages.     Since
                                                                      2


monopolistic wage increases are socially deleterious, in that they can

be expected to induce both inefficiency and inequality, most economic

studies judge unions imPlicitly or explicitly as having a negative impact
                  1
on the economy.

     According to our'recent research on the subject, treatment of unions

as organizations without solidaristic or purposive values, whose sole function

is to raise wages, is seriously misleading.      While unions appear to raise wages

above competitive levels, they also have significant nonwage effects        which

influence diverse aspects of modern industrial life.      By providing workers

with a voice both at the work place and in the political arena, unions can

and do positively affect the functioning of the economic and social systems.

Although research on the nonwage effects of trade unions is by no means

complete and some results will surely change as more evidence is available,

sufficient work has been done to yield the broad outlines of a new view

of unionism.



The Collective Voice/Institutional Response View of Unions

     One key dimension of the new work on trade unionism can be best

understood by recognizing that societies have two basic mechanisms for

dealing with divergences between desired social conditions and actual

conditions.    The first is the classic market mechanism of exit and entry,

which is represented by individual mobility.      The dissatisfied consumer

switches products.      The diner whose soup is too salty seeks another restaurant.

The unhappy couple divorces.      In the labor market, exit is synonymous

with quits,    ~mile   entry consists of new pires by the firm.   By leaving less

desirable     jobs for more desirable   jobs or by refusing bad jobs, individuals

pena~ize    the bad employer and reward the good, leading to an overall

improvement in the efficiency of the social system.       The basic theorem of
                                                                    3

 neoclassical economics is that, under well-specified conditions, the exit

 and entry, or mobility of persons (the hallmark of free enterprise),

 produces a "Pareto-optimum" (a situation where no one can be made better

 off without making someone worse off).    Economic analysis can be viewed

 as a detailed study of the implications of the exit-entry mode of adjust-

 ment and of the way in which actual economies do or do not operate in the

 prescribed manner.   As long as the exit-entry market mechanism is viewed
 as the only efficient means for such adjustment, institutions such as

 unions must necessarily be viewed as impediments to the optimal operation

 of a capitalist economy.

      There is, however, a second mode of adjustment.    This is the political

 mechanism, which Albert Hirschman has termed "voice" in his important

 book Exit, Voice and Loyalty.    "Voice" refers to the process of direct

 communication designed to bring actual and desired conditions closer

. together.   It means talking about problems:   complaining to the store

 about a poor product rather than taking business elsewhere; telling the

 chef that the SOUp ,had too much salt; discussing marital problems,

 possibly with a marriage counselor, rather than going to the divorce

 court.   In a political context, voice is participation in the democratic

 process, through voting, discussion, logrolling, and so on.     Not sur-

 prisingly, voice is studied by political scientists, who in general

 regard citizen participation as the optimal means for solving community

 problems.

      The distinction between the two mechanisms is best illustrated by

 a specific situation:    for instance, concern about school quality in a given

 locality.    The exit solution to poor schools is to move to a different

 community or to enroll children in a private school,thereby "taking one's
                                                                                       4


business elsewhere."       The voice solution would involve political action

to improve the school system, through election of school boards, Parent

Teacher Association meetings, .and related direct activities.
      In the job market, voice consists of discussing with an employer

conditions that ought to be changed, rather than quitting.                     In modern

industrial economies, particularly in large enterprises, a trade union

is the vehicle for collective voice, providing workers as a group with

bargaining with an employer is necessary for effective voice at the work

place for two reasons.

      First, many important aspects of an industrial setting are "public

goods," which affect the well-being (negatively or positively) of

every employee, reducing the incentive for any single person to express

his preferences and invest time and money in changing conditions that

benefit all.       Safety conditions, lighting, heating, the speed of a
promotion line; the layoff, work-sharing, cyclical-wage adjustment, and

promotion policies of the firm; a formal grievance procedure; or a pension

plan obviously affect the entire work force in the same way that defense,

 sanitation, and fire protection affect the entire citizenry.                      Externalities

 (things done by one individual (or firm) that also affect the well-being

 of another) and public goods at the work place call for collective decision-

making.        Without the policing of a collective organization, the incentive

 for the individual to take into account the effects of his or her actions

 on   the well-being of others or express his or her preferences or invest

 time and money in changing conditions is likely to be too small.                       Why not

 let Harry do it and enjoy the benefits at no cost?                    This is, of course,

 the classic "free rider" problem which in the union context lies at the heart

 of the so-called "union security" versus "right to work" debate.
                                                                     5
     Second, workers who are not prepared to exit may be unlikely to reveal

their true preferences to their bosses, fearing that their employers will

punish them in some way.    The essence of the employment relationship under

capitalism, as Karl Marx, Ronald Coase, Herbert Simon and numerous other

analysts have recognized, is the exchange between employer and employee

of money for control over a certain amount of the worker's time which the

employer seeks to use in a way that maximizes the value of the output the

employee produces.    Even in the case of piece rates, employers monitor

employee activity:to assure the quality of output.    As a result,

the way in which the time purchased is utilized must be determined by some inter-

action between workers and their boss.    Since the purchaser of the labor power,

the employer, can fire the protester, individual protest is dangerous.       A

prerequisite for effective voice concerning the employment relationship is

the protection of activists from being discharged.    In the United States

this protection is granted in Sec. 8(u)(3) of the NatiQnal Labor Relations

Act which states that "It shall be an unfair labor practice for an employer

by discrimination in regard to hire or tenure or employment or any term or

condition of employment to encourage or discourage membership in any labor

organization."    It is important to note that, unionism aside, court inter-

pretation of U.S. labor law makes a sharp distinction between collective

and individualistic activity at the work place.    While workers who act as a

collective are Erotected from managerial retaliation,an individual acting

alone is not. 3

     The collective nature of trade unionism fundamentally alters the

operation of a labor market and, hence, the nature of the labor contract

generated.    In a nonunion setting, where exit and entry are the predominant

forms of adjustment, the signals and incentives to firms depend on the pre-

ferences of    the "marginal" worker, the one who will leave (or be attracted)
                                                                      6

by particular conditions or changes in conditions.       The firm responds

primarily to the needs of this marginal, generally younger, mobile worker

and can within some bounds ignore the preferences of "infra-marginal,"

typically older     workers, who, for reasons of skill, knowledge, or rights

that cannot be readily transferred to other enterprises as well as other

costs associated with changing firms, are effectively immobile.       In a

unionized setting, by contrast, the union takes account of the preferences

of   ~   workers to form an average preference that typically determines

its   positio~   at the bargaining table.   Because unions are political

institutions with elected leaders, they are likely to be responsive to a

different set of preferences than those that dominate in a competitive

labor market.

       While social science lacks a theory of political institutions comparable

to the economic model of profit-maximizing firms or utility-maximizing

consumers, virtually any plausible model (e.g., the median voter model, in

which the political institution responds to the desires of the voter in the

middle of the relevant distribution of individuals by their preferences)

would predict that the influence of older, infra-marginal workers relative to

that of younger, marginal employees in determining the relevant employment contracts

would be greater in a unionized as opposed to a nonunionized setting.

In a modern economy, where workers tend to be attached to firms for eight or

more   years~   on average, and where younger and older workers are likely to have

different preferences (for instance, regarding pension or health insurance plans

versus take-home pay, or regarding layoffs by inverse seniority versus work-

sharing or cuts in wage growth), the change from a marginal to an average

calculus is likely to lead to a quite different labor contract.       When

particular work relations or modes of compensation have sizeable fixed or

set-up costs or are public goods, it can be shown that a calculus based on

the average preference can lead to a contract which, ignoring distributional

effects, is socially more desirable than that based on the marginal preference.
                                                                         7

 The mix of employment benefits and policies resulting from the 'average

calculus may be economically more "efficient" than that resulting from

 the marginal calculus.

      The role of unions as a voice institution also fundamentally alters the

social   relat~ons   of the work place.     Perhaps most importantly, a union

constitutes a source of worker power in a firm, diluting managerial authority

and offering members a measure of due process.         In particular, the union

innovation of a grievance and arbitration system permits workers to protest

particular managerial actions concerning nearly all aspects of the labor

exchange.    While   99 percent of major U.S. collective bargaining

contracts provide for the filing of grievances and 95 percent provide for

arbitration of disputes that are not settled between the parties,

relatively few nonunion firms have comparable procedures for settling

disagreements between workers and supervisors. 4        More broadly, the entire
industrial jurisprudence system, by whiqh many workplace decisions are

made on the basis of negotiated rules (such as seniority) as

opposed to supervisory judgment (or whim) and are subject to        cha~lenge

through the grievance/arbitration procedure, represents a major change in

the power relations within firms.         As a result, in unionized firms workers

are more willing and able to express discontent and to object to managerial

decisions.    Although extent and form differ among establishments and unions,

there is no doubt that unionism alters the distribution of power in firms.

         As a collective alternative to individualistic actions in the market,

unions are much more than simple monopolies that raise wages and restrict the

competitive adjustment process. Given imperfect information and public goods

in industrial settings and conflicting interests at the work place and in the

political arena, unionism provides an alternative mechanism for bringing about

important and socially desirable changes.        This is not to deny that unions have

monopolistic power nor that they use this power to raise wages for a select part of the
                                                 IA
                                                                    8

work force.    The point is that unionism has two faces, each of which leads

to a different view of the institution:     one, which is at the fore

in eCbnomic analysis, is that of a monopoly; the other is that of a voice

institution.     To understand fully what unions do in modern industrial

economies, it is necessary to examine both.

        The second central dimension of our research is an analysis of how

other institutions in our society respond to various union stimuli. We have found

that in response to trade unions management has substantially altered

both its personnel and production practices.     These responses represent a key

determinant of the ultimate economic impact of unionism, as was rightfully

stressed in the classic volume by Slichter, Healy, and Livernash, The Impact

of Collective Bargaining on Management.     If management adopts more rational

policies toward the work force and uses the collective bargaining process

to learn about and improve the operation of the work place and the

production process, unionism can be a significant plus.     If one of the main

effects of unions on management is to encourage "investigation and reflection,"

as Slichter, et     ale claim, there is a reasonable chance that union organization

can improve managerial efficiency.     On the other hand, if management reacts
negatively to collective bargaining or is prevented by unions Â·from reorganizing

the work process, unionism can have a negative affect on the performance of

the firm.     The important point is that just as there are two sides to the

market, demand and supply, there are two'forces determining the economic effects

of collective bargaining, managements and unions.     The economic impact of bargaining

and the nature of industrial relations depend on the policies and actions of

both.     It is for this reason that we use the two terms collective voice and institu-

tional response to refer to the second view of unionism under consideration.

        Figure I sets out the difference between the monopoly and

collective voice/institutional response'views of the impact of unionism on
                                                                       9


three major social phenomena:       economic efficiency, or how and what goods are

produced; economic equity,        or income distribution; and the operation of

unions as organizations.        While no sophisticated adherent of the monopoly

model would deny the voice aspects of unionism and no industrial relations

expert would gainsay the monopoly effects, the polar dichotomization usefully

highlights the facets of unionism stressed by the two views.

      The monopoly and collective voice/institutional response views of

unionism are strikingly different, in many instances giving completely opposite

pictures of the institution.        In the former, unions are by nearly all criteria

socially undesirable impediments to the good society; in the latter, unions

have many valuable features which contribute to the functioning of the economy.

Adopting only the monopoly view,the current dwindling in the fraction of
private sector wage and salary workers who are unionized (from 37 percent

in   1~58   to 29 percent in 1974) 5 is a desirable development; it should be

associated with     ~ncreased   productivity and reduced inequality and, thus,

ought perhaps to be encouraged.        Accepting solely the collective voice/

institutional response view, the dwindling of private sector unionization

has serious deleterious economic and social consequences and should

most likely be an issue      deserving public attention.

      Since, in fact, unions have both monopoly and collective voice/institu-

tiona1 response components, the key question for understanding unionism in the

United States relates to the relative importance of these two faces.           Are

unions primarily monopolistic institutions or are they primarily voice

institutions which induce socially beneficial responses?        What weights

should be placed on the two extreme views to obtain a realistic picture

of the role of trade unionism in the United States?

      To answer these important questions, we have studied a wide variety

of data sets that distinguish between union and nonunion establishments

and between union and nonunion workers, and we have discussed many relevant

issues with representatives of management, labor officials, and industrial-

relations experts.     Although additional work will certainly alter some of

the specifics, our research has yielded several important results which

suggest that unions do a great deal more than win monopoly wage gains for

their members.   In the next three sections, the two sets of beliefs

concerning union effects on efficiency and equity and the nature of the

union as a political organization are developed further and examined

in light of the existing evidence.



Economic Efficiency:     The Amount and Mix of Goods Produced

     Unions can affect society's "economic efficiency" through their

impact on the economy's ability to produce output from its limited

resources and through their impact on the composition of this output.

     The Amount Produced:     Beliefs.   In the monopoly view unions reduce

society's output below what it could be in three ways.      First, union-

won wage increases cause a misallocation of resources by inducing organized

firms to hire fewer workers, to use more capital per worker, and to hire

higher quality workers than is socially efficient.      Second, union contract

provisions, such as limits on the load handled by workers, restrictions

on tasks performed,    req~irements   that unnecessary work be done, and so

forth reduce the output yielded by a given amount of capital and labor

power.   Third, strikes called to force management to accept union demands

cause a substantial Â·reduction in gross national product.

     The collective voice/institutional response model, by contrast, directs

attention to important routes by which unionism can raise productivity. According
                                                                      12


to the analysis, one of these potential paths is the reduction of quits.

As workers' voice increases in an establishment, less reliance need be
placed on the exit and entry mechanism to obtain desired work conditions.

Since hiring and training costs are lower and    ~he   functioning of work

groups is less disrupted when quit rates are low, reductions in voluntary

attrition due to unionism can raise efficiency.

     The fact that senior workers are likely to be relatively more powerful

in enterprises where decisions are based on voice instead of exit and

entry points to another way in which unions can raise productivity.

Under unionism, promotions and other rewards tend to be less dependent

in any precise way on iridividual performance and more dependent on seniority.

As a result, in union plants, feelings of rivalry among individuals
are likely to be less than in nonunion plants and the amount of informal

training and assistance that workers are willing to provide one another greater.

The importance of seniority in firms in Japan, together with the permanent

employment guaranteed some workers have often been cited as factors

increasing the productivity of Japanese enterprises.       It is of course

important to recognize that seniority can also reduce productivity by

placing less able persons in certain jobs.
    Unionism can also raise efficiency by pressuring management into tightening

job production standards and accountability in an effort to respond to union

demands while maintaining profits.   Slichter, et al. writing in 1960 comment:

"The challenge that unions presented to management has, if viewed broadly,

created superior and better balanced management, even though some exceptions

must be recognized."    Their conclusion means that unionized management is

able to extract more output from a given amount of inputs than is management

which is not confronted with a union stimulus.    This appears to occur largely

by forcing modern personnel practices on the firm in place of traditional

paternalism.   Management's ability to make such improvements is a function
                                                                        13


of the   union~S   cooperation, since the union can perform a helpful role in

explaining changes in the day-to-day routine.         One recent study supportive

of this view reports that while union workers spend more time on formal breaks,

they spend a comparable amount less time on informal ones and report working

harder than nonunion workers.      It is important to recognize that productivity

gains from improved methods of management in the face of unionism run counter
to the standard assumption of neoclassical economics that all enterprises

operate at peak efficiency.     It is, however~ consistent with the

"satisficing" models ofÂ· firms developed by the reCent. Nobel Prize winner
Herbert Simon and other analysts and with the model of X-inefficiency put forth

.by Harvey Leibenstein; in these models, firms strive for maximum efficiency only

when they are under severe pressure         from competitors, unions, or other

external forces. 6
         Finally, under the voice view, the apparatus of collective bargaining

opens a potentially important communication channel between workers and

management which is likely to increase the flow of information between the

two, possibly improving the produccivity of the enterprise.         As Reynolds

has observed, "UnionS" can do valuable work by pointing out improvements

that perhaps should have been obvious to management but were not, and that,

once discovered, can be installed with a net gain to the company as well as

 the workers ." 7

         The Amount Produced:   Evidence.     Most of the econometric analysis of

unions has focused on the question of central concern to the monopoly view:

How ls.rge is the union wage effect?    In his classic book, Unionism and Relative

Wages, H. G. Lewis summarized the results of this analysis through the early

1960s as showing that, while differing over time and across settings, the

union relative wage effect averages on the order of 10-15 percent:           as a result of

 collective bargaining, a union member makes about 10-15 percent more than an

otherwise comparable worker (i.e., someone working in the same occupation, same

 industry, same geographic area, etc.) who is not a member. Later wprk
                                                                    14


using larger data files which have information permitting more extensive

controls and employing more complex statistical techniques   ten~to   confirm

Lewis' generalization.    While unions in some environments raise wages by an enormous

amount, the average estimated union wage effect is by no means overwhelming. 8

    As predicted by the mOnopoly wage model, the capital-labor ratio and

average "quality" of labor both appear to be somewhat greater than "optimal"

in union settings.    However, the total loss in output due to the mis-
 allocation of resources resulting from the union wage effect appears to

 be miniscule; an analysis done by Albert Rees suggests that the loss is

 less than .3 of one percent of gross national product. 9    In 1975, that would

 amount to $21.00 per person in the U.S.     Even this estimate is likely to be
 too high if one considers the other important and relevant distortions

 in the economy.     In particular, in the presence of elements of monopsony, which

 exist when there are costs to changing one's employer, union monopoly wage gains

 can raise rather than reduce efficiency.    Other distortions, however,

 might cause, the estimate to be understated.


 The Collective Voice/Institutional Response Routes

      One of the central tenets of the collective-voice/institutional response

 model is that among workers receiving the same pay unions reduce employee turn-

 over and its associated costs by offering "voice" as an alternative to exit.

 Empirical research using both information on the job changes and employment

 status of thousands of individuals from newly available computerized data sets

 and industry-level turnover rates shows that with diverse factors, including

 wages, held constant, unionized workers have significantly lower quit rates

 than do nonunion workers who are comparable in other respects.    As Table 1

 shows, the differences between the organized and unorganized workers are very

 large.   Moreover, consistent with the claim that unions provide better

 representation for more senior workers, the evidence suggests a more sizeable

 reduction in exit and increase in job tenure for older male workers than for
                                                                       15

  younger male workers.    A major non-wage reason for the greater attachment

  of workers to firms under unionism is likely to be the existence of formal

  grievance systems, which provide the opportunity to protest seemingly

  unjust conditions without resorting to exit.      Since employee turnover

  is costly, the reduction of quits induced by union voice is one way in

  which unions reduce production costs and thus raise labor productivity.

 Paper.

        As noted earlier, unionism can positively or negatively affect productivity

 in ways other than reducing turnover, leaving the net effect of unions on

 productivity uncertain.   Traditional analyses of unionism and productivity based

 on case studies of establishments (especially by Slichter, Healy, and

Livernash) have cited examples both where positive effects dominate and where

negative effects dominate.     By their very nature, however, case studies cannot
                                                                        16


give a broad quantitative assessment of the net effect of unionism on

productivity.

     Analysis of newly available data on unionism and output per worker in

many establishments or sectors suggest at the least that the monopoly view of

unions as a major deterrent to productivity is erroneous and that in some

settings unionism is associated with higher rather than lower productivity,

not only because of greater capital intensity and labor quality but also

because of what can best be termed institutional response factors.

effect.    The calculations in the table are based on statistical production function

analyses which relate output per worker to unionization controlling for capital

per worker, the skill of workers (in some of the analyses), and other relevant

factors.   While all of the studies are subject to some statistical problems

and thus must be treated cautiously, a general pattern emerges.   In manufacturing,

productivity in the organized sector appears to be substantially higher than in

the unorganized' sector, by an amount that could roughly offset the increase

in total costs attributable to the union wage effect.   Analysis of cross-state

production   figures within 2-digit SIC manufacturing industries yields an

estimated average productivity effect of from 20 to 25 percent.   While .this

estimate is likely to be overstated by the gross nature of 2-digit SIC industries,

the 20 to 25 percent figure is of the same magnitude as estimates with these

data of the extent to which average costs are increased by union wage premia.

Analyses of individual establishments in the wooden household furniture

industry and in the cement industry confirm the finding of a significant

positive union productivity effect which is of roughly the same magnitude

as the impact of the union wage effect on average costs in the industry under

consideration.   The cement industry study provides especially valuable

information, since output can be measured in pure quantity terms and the

study contains data on plants before and after unionization as well as on

organized and unorganized plants at a given point in time.

    The importance of some of the specific routes by which unionism

positively affects the amount of output produced has been analyzed.    In

the typical manufacturing industry the substantially lower quit rates under

collective bargaining can explain about one-fifth of the estimated positive

union productivity effect.   Clark's discussions with individuals at the

recently organized cement plants reveal that the entrance of a union was

usually followed by major alterations in operations.    Interestingly, the

enterprise typically changed plant management, suggesting that the union
                                                                      18
drive was an important signal to top management of ineffective lower-level

management,. and thus, the drive provided increased communication or shock

of a distinctive kind.     Perhaps most importantly, the discussions with union

and management officials in the cement industry indicated that firms often

adopted more efficiency-oriented and less paternalistic personnel policies in

response to unionism in order to raise productivity to meet higher wage demands.

      On the other side of the   ~icture,   the analysis of   produ~tivity   in organized

and nonorganized underground bituminous coal mines indicates that as industrial

relations in the union sector deteriorated in the late 1960s and 1970s,

unionism became associated with negative productivity effects.       The stri1:ing

change in the estimated impact of unionism on productivity in this industry

during the past decade highlights the important fact that the effects of

unionism are not universa1"constants but rather depend on specific industrial

reJ,ationssettings.      Collective bargaining can raise productivity as a result

of some practices and good industrial relations; collective bargaining can

reduce productivity as a result of other practices and bad industrial

relations.   In manufacturing, the factors which raise or at least do not

lower productivity dominate; in coal,    a~   the internal problems of the United

Mine Workers have grown and the ability of management to deal effectively

with labor issues seems to have deteriorated (most likely because rapid

industry growth has yielded supervisors who are on average younger and have

less experience in labor relations than was typical prior to the late 1960s),

the factors which lower productivity have come to dominate.       An important, and
as yet uncompleted, task is to determine the differential impact of various

industrial relations practices on productivity and to discover, as far as

is possible, the reasons for these.differences.
     The evidence just cited suggests that unionism may increase productivity

in some settings and decrease it in others.      If the increase in productivity is

greater than the increase in average unit costs due to the union wage effect then

the profit rate will increase; conversely, if the union wage effect increases
                                                                    19

unit costs more than unionism increases productivity the rate of profit will fall.

There is limited tentative evidence that, on average, net profits are reduced

somewhat by unionism, particularly in oligopolistic industries; however, there

are notable exceptions where the rate of profit increased a result of unionism.

At present, there is no definitive accounting of what proportion of the union wage

effect comes at the expense of capital, other labor, or consumers and what portion

is offset by previously unexploited possibilites for productivity improvements.
       Finally, it is important to note that despite what some critics of

unions might claim, strikes do not seem to cost society a substantial

amount of goods and services.    For the economy as a whole, the percent of

total working time lost directly to strikes during the past two decades has

never been greater than .5 of one percent and has averaged about .2 of one

percent. . Even "national emergency disputes"--those which would be expected

to have the largest repercussions on the economy--do not have major dele-

terious imracts:O Though highly publicized, the days idle because of the

direct and indirect effects of strikes represent only a miniscule fraction

of the toal days worked in the   u.s.   economy.

       The Mix of Employee Benefits and Personnel Practices:   Beliefs.   Under

the monopoly view, the exit and entry of workers permits each individual to

find a firm offering the mix of employee benefits and personnel policies that

he or she prefers.    As noted earlier, however, the efficiency of this mechanism
breaks down when there are public goods at the work place and for workers who

are not able to change firms easily.      In the voice view, a union provides

management with information at the bargaining table concerning policies

affecting its entire membership (e.g., the mix of the employee compensation

package or the firm's   emplo~ent   practices during a downturn) which

can be expected to be different than that derived from the movements of marginal

workers.    Hence, it is likely that the package of employee benefits and employ-

~ent   adjustment policies will be different in firms covered by collective

 bargaining than in those which are not.      To what extent does the mix of
                                                                               20
goods at the work place differ betl7een union arid nonunion .firms?"

     Evidence Concerning Fringes.       Data on the remuneration of individual

workers and on the expenditures for employees by firms show that the

proportion of compensation allotted to fringe benefits is markedly higher

for organized blue-collar workers than for similar nonunion workers.       Within

most industries, important fringes such as pensions and life,      ac~id~nt,


and health insurance are much more likely to be found in unionized

establishments than in those which are nonunion.       While some of the

difference is attributable to the higher wages paid to union workers,

since higher    w~ge   workers generally "buy" more fringes, Table 3 reveals

that a substantial difference is in fact due to the effect of unionism on

the nature of the compensation package received by workers with the same

level of pay.     The table also indicates that the greatest increases in

fringes induced by unionism are for the deferred compensation form which

are favored by older, more stable employees; this is consistent with the

view that unions are more responsive to senior, less mobile workers.       More

detailed analysis of the pattern of benefits among unionized blue-collar

workers compared to the pattern among white-collar workers in the same

establishment shows that the sizeable union impact is not due largely

to the tendency for unionsto organize firms which have high fringes in

any case, at least as reflected in the compensation packages of the firms'

white-collar employees.

     Studies concerning workers' preferences for fringes and managers'

awareness of these preferences provide support for the claim that a

union can provide management with information that affects the composition

of the pay package.       For instance, Richard Lester's 1967 review of surveys

of managerial perceptions of worker preferences found "limited data â¢ â¢ â¢

that workers value benefits more highly compared to wages than employers

believe their workers do".11 Equally important is the apparent ro 1 e

of unions in evaluating the complex costs and prospective benefits of

modern fringe benefits and transmitting these facts to their members.

It is unlikely that an individual worker will make the investment required

to understand and judge the true cost and future benefits of alternative

compensation packages.    A collective of workers, however, can hire lawyers,

actuaries, and related experts from whom they obtain the expertise needed

to bargain effectively over diverse fringe benefits.

       The fact that in many instances nonunion firms have imitated several

of the provisions of union contracts is indicative of the "better" information

available about workers' preferences in union settings. There is no reason for

a nonunion firm to copy what union firms do unless union contracts are

preferred by the average nonunion worker, since the satisfaction of the

average (not the marginal) employee is what is relevant in a union representation

election.   It is important to note that to the extent that nonunion firms

adopt beneficial union-initiated practices, the estimated impact of unionism

on the prevalence of these practices will be understated.

       Finally it shoQId be pointed out that the knowledgeable representatives

of both labor and management agree that one of the major functions performed

by American trade unions is to determine a division of the compensation

package acceptable to workers.    They recognize that some of the most important

bargaining under unionism goes on inside the union, where the desires of

workers with disparate interests are weighted in a political process to

decide the union's positions at the bargaining table.

       Evidence Concerning Adjustments to Economic Downturns.    One of

the most important personnel decisions made by a firm is how to adjust its

employment and wages in response to swings in economic demand.    During a

downturn, firms must choose among alternative adjustment mechanisms, such

as temporary layoffs, cuts in wage growth, average hours reductions, and

indictates that the layoff mechanism is used to a much greater extent in

unionized establishments than in those that are nonunion.    However,

it is important to note that the vast majority of these layoffs are

temporary,in that the laid off members await rehire and are recalled after

a short spell of unemployment.

     By contrast, evidence on the effect of swings in product demand on

wages shows responsiveness of wage rates to be smaller in union than in

nonunion firms.    During the very severe economic downturn from May 1973 to

May 1975, for example, while the fraction of hourly blue-collar union members

unemployed due to layoffs grew more than twice as much as the comparable

fraction for similar nonmembers, the wages of the unionized workers grew

by 18.1 percent versus 16.6 percent for the nonunion workers.          More generally,

analysis of monthly data covering the 1958 tp 1975 period for detailed

manufacturing industries indicates that while the hourly wages of production

workers vary positively with shipments to some extent in nonunion firms

(reducing the need for layoffs), there is virtually no association in

union firms.       These findings reflect the fact that since the late 1950s
                                                                      24



about two thirds of the major contract manufacturing work force has come

to be covered by agreements whose duration is three years or more, nearly

all of which have provisions for automatic money wage increaees. 12

     Why do temporary layoffs dominate alternative adjustment mechanisms to

kmach greater extent in firms that are unionized than in those that are nonunion?

While lower quit rates in the union sector explain some of the differential

use of layoffs, since nonunion firms can rely more heavily on quits to

reduce employment, the question remains as to why unionized firms appear

to use temporary layoffs relatively more than other non-quit adjustment

mechanisms, such as cuts in wage growth or reductions in average hours,

than do nonunion firms.
     The most reasonable explanation is that under the provisions found

in most union contracts, senior workers, who can be expected to have

greater power in organized firms, will generally prefer layoffs over the

alternatives.    A subsample of the major contracts (those covering 1,000

or more workers) in effect in 1970-71 mentioning 'layoff procedures

indicates that seniority was the "sole" or "primary" factor in   rl.~t":,:,,,",.:l.,~_~.:::


layoff rights for 58 percent of the relevant workers; tlte comparable

figure is 7.8 percent- when contracts in which the issue was "subject to local
negotiations" are excluded.     In almost a fourth of the subsample of 1970-71

major contracts with layoff provisions, senior employees were allowed to

waive their seniority rights and be laid off, while retaining eligibility

for recall.     When recall is a near certainty and seniority is retained

(which is usually the case), and i f regular and supplemental unemployment

benefits are obtainable, some senior workers might welcome a short period

on layoff.    In addition, they may prefer a short-term layoff to placement
                                                 13
in a relatively undesirable or low paying jOb.
      Hence, senior union members typically incur very small or no costs

 under an adjustment policy based on layoffs.     They would, however, incur

 more under a policy based on an across-the-board reduction in wage growth
                                                                   25

or in average hours worked.   Thus, if the preferences of senior workers

were really given greater weight under unionism than in nonunion settings,

as the collective voice/institutional response model claims, we would

expect to find layoffs used to a much greater extent than cuts in wage

growth or work sharing in union settings, as we have in fact observed.


Economic Equity

     One of the striking implications of the monopoly view, which runs

counter to. popular thought, is that union wage gains increase inequality

in the labor market.   According to the monopoly model, the workers displaced

from unionized firms as a result of union wage gains raise the supply of

labor to nonunion firms, which can be expected to reduce the wages of

nonunion workers.    Thus, in theÂ·monopoly view, unionized workers are likely

to be made better off at the expense of nonunion workers.    The fact that

those blue-collar workers who are organized would tend to be more skilled and

higher. paid than other blue-collar workers even in the absence of unionism

implies further that this process benefits "labor's elite" at the expense of

those with low skill and earning power.    Since many have supported unions

because of. a belief that they reduce economic inequality, the monopoly

view that unions have an adverse effect on the income distribution would,
if true, constitute a telling argument against the union   mov~cnt.


      The collective voice/institutional response model suggests very different

effects on equity.   Given that union decisions are based on a political

process and given that the majority of union members are likely to

have earnings below the mean in any work place, unions can be .expected

to seek to reduce wage inequality.   In addition, union members
 are likely to favor a less dispersed distribution of earnings for

 solidaristic and ideological reasons.    Finally, by its nature, collective

 bargaining reduces managerial discretion in the wage setting process
                                                                   26


and in this way should also lower dispersion.

     The forces leading unions to reduce economic inequality take explicit

form in two distinct union wage policies.    First is the long-standing

policy of pushing for "standard rates," defined as uniform piece or time

rates among comparable workers across establishments and impersonal rates

or ranges of rates in a given occupational class within establishments.

The importance of standardizing rates across establishments has long been

recognized.   In perhaps the earliest study the Webbs noted that "among trade

union regulations there is one which stands out as practically universal,

namely, the insistence on payment according to the same definite standard,

uniform in its application."   The importance of standardization of rates

within establishments has also been widely recognized.    Under unionism

pay is usually based on job rates associated with specific occupational

categories, rather than personal rates associated with individuals.

While many large nonunion enterprises today employ similar formal wage

setting practices, the option for personal differentials based on service,

performance, favoritism, or any other factor within a job category is generally

larger than in the union sector.   For example, so-called "merit" plans for

wage adjustment appear to be less prevalent in the union than in the nonunion

sector.   In the 1970s, while about 43 percent of all companies gave plant

employees 'wage adjustment based on a merit plan,' only 13 percent of major

union contracts mentioned these plans.    Overall, according to Slichter, Healy

and Livernash, "the influence of unions has clearly been one of minimizing

and eliminating judgment-based differences in pay for individuals employed

on the same job" and of "removing ability and performance judgments as a factor

in individual pay for job performance."   One important potential result of these

policies is -a reduction of inequality, possibly at the expense of efficiency by

reducing the reward for individual effort.   Another important potential result of
                                                                    27


this policy is that wage discrimination against minorities is likely to

be less in unionized than in nonunionized settings. 14

      Second, union policies favoring seniority in promotion    and job posting

 and bidding systems in which wbrkers are informed about new openings and can

 bid for promotions    can also be expected to have egalitarian consequences.

 The possibility for arbitrary supervisory judgments to determine the career

 of a worker is greatly reduced by the development of formal rules which

 treat each worker identically.

      Thus, according to the monopoly model, trads unionism raises inequality,

 whereas according to the collective voice/institutional response model, it

 reduces inequality.   Which of these effects dominates?

      Until the advent of computerized data files, the information needed

 to answer this question was unavailable.    While estimates were made of

 the increase in inequality due to monopoly wage gains, estimates of the

 reduction in dispersion due to standard rate policies could not be made.

 Newly available data on thousands of unionized and nonunionized workers

 permit, for the first time, estimates of the reduction of dispersion

 within the organized sector and of the net effect of unionism on inequality.

 Our empirical estimates based on the new data show that standardization

 policies have had a sizeable impact on wage inequality, reducing dispersion,-

and that the standard rate effect dominates the-monopoly-wageeffect.

 On net unions reduce earnings inequality by a significantramount.

      The impact of the standard rate policies on dispersion of earnings

 is shown in figure 2, which compares the frequency distribution of the natural

 logarithm of earnings among unionized and nonunionized male blue collar workers.

 If standard rate policies significantly reduced dispersion, the union
distribution would be more peaked and less spread out than the nonunion

distribution.   As the figure makes clear, the distribution of earnings is

much less dispersed among.union workers in   bot~   the manufacturing and

nonmanufacturing sectors.   The upper and lower parts of the frequency

distribution are more compressed and the middle of the distribution

much more peaked among those who are organized.

     In addition to reducing earnings inequality among blue collar workers,

union wage policies contribute to equalization of wages by lowering the

differential between covered "blue-collar workers and uncovered white-

collar workers.   In manufacturing, while white-collar workers earn, on

average, 49 percent more than blue-collar workers, our estimates indicate

that under unionism this premium is 32 percent.      In nonmanufacturing,

while white-eollar workers average 31 percent more than blue-collar workers,

under unionism the estimated differential is only 19 percent.

     To obtain the net effect of unionism on earnings inequality it is

necessary to add the decrease in" inequality due to wage standardization and

the decrease due to the reduction in the white collar/blue collar differen-

tial to the increase due to the greater wages of blue-collar union workers

compared to lower paid blue-collar nonunion workers.      Table 5 presents the results

of such calculations using the variance of the natural logarithm of earnings as the

measure of inequality.   This measure was chosen, rather than other related

indices (such as the well-known Gini coefficient) because variances

are easier to deal with in adding together various effects.      The results of

the analysis are not substantively changed by the particular measure of

relative inequality chosen.
      The table shows clearly that the dominant effect on earnings in-

 equality is the standardization of rates within the union sector (line 4).

As a result of the large reduction in inequality attributable, it appears, to

 standard rate policies, the measure of the variance of earnings is reduced
                                                                             30

     by 21 percent in manufacturing and by 27 percent in nonmanufacturing.            Since

        the income distribution is, as Christoper Jencks and other have shown,

     relatively stable in the face of dramatic changes in such important social

        factors as the distribution of schooling, these effects must be judged

     as large.       Unionism appears on net to reduce wage dispersion in the United
                                                                                  "

            Unions also affect the distribution of earnings between blacks and

    whites.        Despite conflicts between trade union seniority rules and affirmative

    action programs and historic patterns of discrimination by craft unions,

    'empirical evidence, as Orley Ashenfelter was first to note, shows clearly that,
    on average, unions aid black workers and reduce discriminatory differences.

            First, blacks are more likely to be union members than whites and thus more
    likely to benefit from union wage gains.          In the 1973-75 period, 30 percent of black
                                                                      31


workers were organized compared to 24 percent of white workers.     The greater

organization of blacks reflects the fact that this group is overrepresented

among blue-collar factory workers and underrepresented among the less

organized white collar workers.   Whileminotities are still not prapantionately

represented in some important craft   union~,   the latest apprenticeship data

show that 18.1 percent of apprentices in 1976 were minorities, 9.4 percent

being black and 8.7 percent being members of other minority groups.15

      Second, unionization reduces discriminatory differences within

organized firms, through the standard-rate and promotion-by-seniority

policies described earlier.   While black organized workers make less than
                                                                           ..
white organized workers, the extent of the differential is smaller than

among unorganized workers.    Estimates with data from the 1973 to 1975 May

Current Population Surveys show that among blue collar private sector wage and

salar1- workers black hourly wage rates are below white hourly rates by about 9

percent in the organized sector of a typical 3-digit Census industry compared to

about 15 percent in the nonunion sector of the same industry.16     Seniority rules

which are often regarded as inimical to the interests of black workers due to

conflict with affirmative action programs should in the long run be beneficial

to blacks; when promotion depends on seniority, the firm cannot discriminate

on the basis of race.

      Third, analysis by Duane Leigh of the effect of unionism on the tenure

and quit behavior of black and white workers taken separately shows that

with wages held constant the turnover of blacks is as much reduced by unions

as the turnover of whites; implying that the nonwage benefits associated
                                                                      17
with unionism improve conditions as much for blacks as for whites.

      On net, while some discrimination is found in the union sector as else-

where in the economy, trade unions raise black earnings relative to white

earnings and, thus, help reduce discriminatory differences.
                                                                     32


Trade Unions as Organizations

      Under the monopoly view, the potential. to 'use union monopoly

power to raise wages and to extort funds from firms, particularly small

weak firms, fosters a significant amount of corruption and nondemocratic

behavior in the union movement.      Many unions are alleged to be run by

 bosses who seek to enhance their own well-being at the expense of the

membership's and by racketeers seeking to ,skim off the monopoly wage

 gains.    Under the voice view, unions aLe expected to be democratic poli-

 tical organizations which are responsive to the will of their members.

 While the monopoly view has been highly publicized, the vast majority of

 evidence appears to support the voice    vi~ â¢


    . There are internal and external forces that can be expected to pushunions--
"both locals and internationals--toward being responsive to the wishes of their

members.    Unions are, by their constitutions, democratic organizations, which are

 supposed to hold conventions or referenda to discern the membership's sentiment
 concerning important issues,and fair and frequent elections to assess the members'

 satisfaction with their   leadership~   While at one time U.s, labor law aealt only

 peripherally with the internal workings of unions, the Landrum-Griffin Act, passed

 in 1959 in response to the 1957 hearings run by Senator John L. McClellan,

 provides strong federal sanctions against corruption and nondemocratic

 behavior inside unions.    This act contains provisions which:   ~equire   local,

 intermediate, and international unions to hold elections at fixed, reasonably

 short intervals;   guarante~   members a reasonable opportunity to nominate

 candidates, run for office, and freely criticize union leaders and their

 policies; prohibit incumbents from using union funds to support the

 election of a given candidate for office in the union and from disseminating

 propaganda for one candidate without doing as much for his or her opponent;

  and require officials to file information on the financial affairs of the union

  and its leaders and on its constitutional provisions.     Moreover, the country's
                                                                     33


 labor law provides an election procedure under which a group of workers can

 decertify its union and become unorganized, replace one union with another,

 or attempt to change the boundaries of an existing bargaining unit.

         The relevant evidence strongly suggests that the vast majority of local and
international unions in the U.S. are quite democratic and only rarely plagued by major

problems concerning internal democracy.    Information issued by the Department of Labor

on the number of complaints (filed under the provisions contained in the Landrum-

Griffin Act) about the way union elections were conducted and on the resolution

of these complaints shows that during fiscal years 1965 to 1974, only 239

claims that improper conduct affected the outcome of a union election
                                   18'
were filed and ruled to have merit.    Moreover, it is probably true that

in a fair number of these cases the violation was caused by ignorance of the

details of labor law on the part of union officials as opposed to an explicit

attempt to affect an election's outcome.    Since approximately 200,000

elections were held by local,   intermediate~   and international unions during

this period, the percentage of elections in which there were proved

violations is approximately .1 of one percent.     While surely there were

some improper actions which affected an election's outcome but did not lead to

the filing of a complaint ruled to be meritorious, the miniscule number of

those that did suggests that the number of these actions was extremely

small.

     While many national union leaders tend to remain ensconced in office

for years, at the local level a fair number of incumbents appear to be

unseated, as would be expected in a well-functioning democracy.      One

pertinent study analyzed data on the turnover of union leaders in 94

locals in the Milwaukee, Wisconsin area during the two years from 1960

to 1962.    It found that 40 percent of the officials in office at the

beginning of the, period were not in office at the end.19
                                                                   34


     The fact that the majority of members in most unions are satisfied

with the internal operation of unions can be supported with information on

the extent of union decertification in elections conducted by the National

Labor Relations Board.    In each year during th~ past decade, only about .1

of one perc~nt of all union members were in bar~aining uni~ that voted
to decertify the union representing them. 20

     Finally, recent surveys of members' views of the internal affairs in their

unions, presented in Table 6, indicate that the vast majority of members

were satisfied with the operation of the union.    About 70 percent of members

said they had "no problems" with their union in 1972-73, while about 80
                                        "
percent had no problems in 1969-70.    Roughly half of those who had problems in

1972-73 regarded them as "slight" or as "not really a problem at all."      At

both points in time, less than 10 percent of union members were dissatisfied

with how democratically their unions were,run, the conduct of their unions'

leadership, or the officials' policies.
     The internal operation of unions aside, the collective voice/institutional

response analysis stresses the role of unionism in increasing democracy at the

work place by providing workers with a mode of expressing their preferences to

management and of increasing workers'willingness to complain about undesirable

conditions.   Evidence from surveys of workers' job satisfaction tends to suoport

this view.    In these surveys the reported job satisfaction of unionized workers

is less than the reported satisfaction of comparable nonunion workers

who are paid the same amount.    However, the union members are also more

likely to state that they are "unwilling to change jobs under any

circumstance" or "would never consider moving to a new job," than are

their "more satisfied" nonunion counterparts.     The most direct interpretation

of the puzzle is that collective organization provides support that encourages

the voicing of dissatisfaction, a prerequisite for democnacy.     In contrast

to most economic beneftts, which increase Doth utility and stated satisfaction,

voice increases utility while increasing stated dissatisfaction. 2l      In

addition, since information about problems in a work place can be viewed

as a .public good, a union will collect more information than will any

individual, and then disseminate it all to each member.   Hence, while

union members know that their jobs are significantly better than the

alternatives, they also know that their jobs are far from ideal.      Since voice

is also a tool of conflict, good strategists, unlike Voltaire's Pangloss,

will not proclaim their work place as "the best of all' possibl e worlds."

     What about the view that unions are corrupt institutions?     The

evidence in Table 6 clearly runs counter to this stereotype.     Ninety-

nine percent of union members in both 1969-70 and 1972-73 stated that

they had "no problems" with graft or corruption among their leaders.

Moreover, after a careful analysis of the extent of corruption in the

American Labor Movement, Derek Bok and John Dun1op,writing in 1970,

concluded:

     Although the record in this country compares unfavorably with
     that of many other nations, legal safeguards now go far to
     curb dishonesty and encourage democratic behavior. Probably
     only a tiny fraction of all union officialS in America would
     stoop to serious abuse. The overwhelming majority of labor
     leaders are honest men who take seriously their obligation
     to represent the interest of the members who have elected
     them to office.2~
     Finally, in what ways has organized labor affected outcomes in the

American political arena?   Have unions had a greater impac~ through

 support of 'social' legislation that benefits lower income persons or

 workers in general or through support of 'special_interest' legislation?

      Despite the bad press given some union efforts to obtain     special-

 interest legislation, much union political muscle has been devoted to

 progressive social policy which provides no obvious material gains to
 unionized workers, save as members of the overall working population.
                                                                        37


For instance, organized labor was quite active in pushing for the passage

of the Public Accomodation Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965,

equal employment opportunity legislation, anti-poverty legislation, and

the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1971.

     At the other end of the spectrum, most union-favored special-interest

legislation has failed to pass Congress, while important legislation opposed by

unions as detrimental to their power and survival has been passed.           The last

major piece of legislation regulating collective bargaining and unionism, the

Landrum-Griffin bill, was enacted in 1959 over the vociferous opposition of

unions, while a 1977 mild labor law reform bill strongly favored by unions

failed to clear the Congress.     Typically, only when unions align with

management in a particular sector in favor of legislation that will benefit

the sector have unions had success in gaining support for their special

interests.

     All in all, while unions,. like other groups in a pluralist society,

have fought .for self-interest legislation, they have scored their        great~st

political victories on more general social legislation.        In terms of

actual outcomes, unions have been more effective as a voice of the whole
                       <




working population and the disadvantaged than as a monopoly institution

seeking to increase its monopoly power.


Explaining managerial opposition

     If, in addition to its negative monopoly effects, trade unionism

is associated with substantial positive effects on the operation of the

economy and on the performance of firms, why do so many United States

enterprises oppose unions so vehemently?

     While at present no detailed analysis of the factors underlying

managerial opposition exists, several seemingly important elements deserve mention.
First, it shou.;L.9:.J:?cLWlders-too.d that the bulk of the eeonomic gains due
                                                                     38

to unionism accrue to workers and not to owners or managers.    Managers are

unlikely to perceive any personal benefits from their subordinates' unionization,

but are likely to be quite aware of the costs from a diminishment of power,

need to to work harder, loss of operating flexibility, and the like.       Second,

while 'productivity might typically be higher in union than in otherwise

comparable nonunion work settings, so too are wages.     It would seem, given the

objectives and actions of most unions, that the rate of return on capital would be

lower under collective bargaining, although important exceptions must be noted.

Thus, there is risk in unionization; the firm may be able to rationalize

operations, have good relations with the union, and maintain its profit rate,

or it may not.    In addition, while the total cost of strikes to society as

a whole has been shown to be quite small, the potential cost to the

particular firm which is struck can be substantial.    Granting that managers,

like most other   peopl~are   risk averse, we would expect opposition to

unions even if on average the benefits to the firm equal the costs.

Moreover, given the wide-ranging differences in the effects of unions on

economic performance, at least some managerial opposition arises from enterprises

where the benefits of collective bargaining may be small while the costs may be
high.   Even the most vocal advocate of the collective   voic~institutional response

view of unionism would admit that, though functional in many industrial settings,

unions are not functional in others, and would expect greater managerial

opposition in the latter cases.     Third, management may find unionism expensive,

difficult, and very threatening in its initial stages, when modes of operation must

be altered if efficiency is to be improved.     New and different types of management

policies are needed under unionism, requiring changes in the behavior of current

management or, as appears to be the case in many just-organized firms, a

new 'set of managers.   Finally, U.S. management has generally adopted an

ideology of top-down enlightened control, under which unions are seen as

both a cause and an effect of managerial failure.     In this view, unions
                                                                      39

interfere with management's efforts to carry out its societal function:

ensuring that goods and services are produced efficiently.    In addition,

unions typically come into existence because management has made mistakes

in dealing with its work force.


Conclusion

       We believe that our analysis of unionism has opened up a host of

neglected issues regarding the key worker institution in the   u.s.   capitalist system

~nd    gives a very different picture of that institution than currently

prevails.    While sOme of our findings will surely be altered by additional

research and some (hopefully few) may be proven wrong, we do believe that

they present a reasonably valid picture of modern unionism in our country--

one which stands in sharp contrast to the monopoly model and many popular

beliefs about trade unions.     If, as we have found, the positive collectiVe

voice/institutional response effects of unions are, in many

settings, more important than the negative monopoly effects, the on-going

dwindling of private sector unionism--a development unique to the

U.S.     among Western developed countries--deserves serious public attention.

3Despite the law, it appears that a non-trivial number of workers are

 discharged 'for union activity.     According to the Forty-Second Annual Report

 of the National Labor Relations Board (p. 269), 16,697 workers filed

 allegations under Sec. 8(a)(3) in fiscal year 1977.
