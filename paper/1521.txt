                         Debt   and   Equity   Returns   Revisited



                                         ABSTRACT




        This paper examines semiannual ex post returns on corporate equities and

bonds and six—month Treasury bills over the 1953—84 period with special

emphasis on whether returns so far in the 1980s have been usual relative to the

previous quarter century. The performance of the equity and bond markets in

the 1980s has not been at all unusual, with equity returns being driven by the

business   cycle and bond returns by unexpected changes in new issue Treasury
bond rates. Real six—month Treasury rates have averaged 5½ percentage points,
far   above the 2 percentage point average since 1953 but about the same as in

the 1926—30 period. On an after—tax (roughly 40 percent) basis, however, real

bill rate have been in line with the 1950s and lOGOs, but significantly above

the abnormally low rates in the 1970s.

                       Debt and Equity Returns Revisited

                             Patric H. Hendershott


1.1 Introduction

      In April 1981, near the beginning of the NBER project on Corporate

Capital Structures, I reported on the behavior of debt and equity returns over

the last half century. Resource utilization and inflation varied widely over

that period, as did real and nominal ex post returns on debt and equity claims.

My analysis of the factors affecting returns was based largely on a relatively

crude examination of the data. I return three and a half years later

(September 1984) with a shorter (quarter—century) perspective and with the

benefit of extensive econometric testing.

      Some of the findings discussed in this chapter are the same as those

emphasized in my earlier paper. For example, a strong systematic relationship

between ex post equity returns and business cycle turning points seemed to

exist in my earlier analysis, with returns being extraordinarily large around

cycle troughs and small around cycle peaks. This relationship is easily

verifiable econometrically and is even stronger after 1980 than before. On the

other hand, data from the 1951—BO period were largely consistent with Treasury

bill rates moving one—for—one with expected inflation and being independent of

everything else, a view obviously inconsistent with the high real short—term

rates that have prevailed since 1980.

      This chapter is divided into three broad parts and a short summary.    I


begin with an analysis of ex post returns on corporate bonds and equities, then

turn to an examination of real after—tax six—month bill rates, and conclude
conclude with an explanation of new issue coupons on six—month and 20—year

Treasury securities. Econometric results on the determinants of ex post

returns and new issue coupons are summarized. The general procedure is to

establish relationships on semi—annual data from the 1950s, 60s and 70s and

then to deduce their applicability to the early l980s.



1.2 The Business Cycle and Ex Post Equity and Bond Returns

      My earlier study contained evidence that corporate equities systema-

tically outperformed corporate bonds near business cycle troughs and underper—

formed them near business cycle peaks. The evidence was obtained by dividing

the months between January 1926 and December 1978 into three types of periods:

those around peaks, those around troughs, and the remainder. The peak periods

were defined as the last six months of every expansion and the first half

(dropping fractions) or first six months, whichever was less, of every

contraction. The trough periods were defined as the last half (dropping

fractions) or last six months, whichever was less, of every contraction and the

first six months of every expansion. We then divided the total 1926—78 period

into ten overlapping intervals that contained single adjoining peaks and

troughs and all the surrounding months that did not overlap with adjacent peak

and trough periods. That is, the intervals extended from six months after a

trough to six months before the second following peak.

      These ten overlapping intervals are listed at the left in Table 1.1.

Also reproduced are the arithmetic means (annualized) during the trough periods

within the interval, the peak periods within the interval, the normal months

(months not classified as either peak or trough months) , and the differences in

average returns between the peak and normal months and between the trough and

normal months. The latter were labeled the excess net returns near peaks and

troughs, respectively. As noted, the data were striking. The excess net

returns on equities around troughs averaged 24 percent, and no net return was

less than 14 percent. In contrast, the excess net returns on equities were

negative around all peaks, except that at the end of World War II, and averaged

—15 percent. When the analysis was restricted to the six cycles between 1946

and 1978, the average excess net return on equities around peaks was —20

percent and no return exceeded —5 percent.

      These data raise three questions. First, are equity returns, bond

returns, or both, sensitive to the business cycle? Second, can a significant

proportion of the variation in equity and/or bond returns during the 1953—79

period be explained by the business cycle turning points? Third, has the

importance of the turning points continued in the 1980's? To answer these

questions, we begin with a regression of ex post six—month returns (times 2 to

annualize them) on equities and bonds on constant terms and two turning point

variables. The variables assume values equal to the fraction of the half year

that consists of, respectively, peak or trough months as defined in the

previous paragraph.1 (Given that the average cycle is just under five years,

the economy is near a peak about one—fifth of the time and near a trough

another one—fifth.) The results are for the 54 semi—annual observations in the

1953—79 period. As can be seen from the first equation summarized in Table

1.2, all three variables are statistically significant in the equity equation

(t—statistics are in parentheses under the coefficients)   ,   and 36 percent of the

variation in six—month returns is explained. Further, the second equation

shows that while the trough variable is marginally significant in the bond

returns equation, the peak variable ads no explanatory power and only 10

percent of the variation in bond returns is explained. Thus, the answers to

the first and second questions are that the business cycle impacts largely on

equity, not bond, returns and that the impact is large. In roughly the year

surrounding business cycle troughs, the return on equities is 32 percentage

points greater than the normal 9 percent. In roughly the year around peaks,

the return is 20 percentage points less than the 9 percent norm.

      This conclusion is supported by two additional tests reported in Table

1.2.2 In the first, we examine the excess of equity and bond returns over the

the six—month bill rate at the beginning of the half year. The results are

changed little from the straight returns equations. Second, we add the

unexpected capital gain on 20—year Treasury bonds during the six—month period,

fJNCG, as a regressor, where




      tJNCG —   —
                    UNIR2O (1 + R20)20 — 1
                    R20    (1 +   R20)20



and the calculation of unexpected change in the 20—year rate, UNAR2O, is

described in Hendershott and Huang (1984, Appendix B) .   Forces causing

unexpected capital gains (and thus large returns) on one asset will also induce

large returns on assets that are close substitutes. The unexpected—gains

variable has a negligible impact on equity returns, but an enormous positive

effect on corporate bond returns, as indicated by the last equation in Table

1.2. clearly corporate and Treasury bonds are very close substitutes, and thus

unexpected Treasury rate changes explain most of the movement in ex post

corporate bond returns. Also, the slight impact the trough cycle variable
                                     —7—




 seems to have on corporate bond returns is due to a correlation between this

variable and unexpected changes in the Treasury rate, not to the independent

effect of the trough variable.3

      The actual and predicted [by the first equation in Table 1.2] equity

returns are plotted in Figure 1.1. The 54 points to the left of the vertical

line are in sample; the 9 points to the right are forecasts for the 1980—midB4

period. 12 sample the equation misses the entire early 1962 stock market

plunge, much of the early 1970 (Cambodian incursion) crash, and more than the

entire late 1974 decline, Of course, each of these market sell offs, and the

corresponding equation error, was largely reversed in the subsequent six

months.   (The general negative correlation of errors was indicated by the 2.52

Durbin—Watson ratio.)

      The estimated equation is considerably more successful in explaining

equity returns the 1980s than during the estimation period itself. Most of the

large gains in 1980 and the mid1982—midl9g3 period occurred in near trough

periods and thus are picked up by the equation. The root mean square error is

0.190, about the same as during the estimation period, but the volatility of

returns so far in the 1980s has been far greater than in the previous quarter

century. The cycle dummies explain 72 percent of the variation of equity

returns in the first half of the 1980s, about double the percent explained

during the estimation period.

      As another measure of the forecasting ability of this equation, I

computed the cumulative percentage forecast error over the nine semi annual

periods as

where ERR, is the error from the estimated equation in the ith period.

The result is a negligible 0.003. That is, the 4½ year forecast of the stock

market plus cumulative dividends is within a half percent of the actual. So

our third question —— does the estimated cyclical influence on equities hold
                                                                             up
in the 1980s? ——    is   answered strongly in the affirmative.4

      While the cycle dummy variables explain over a third of the variation in

equity returns over the 1953—79 period, the variables obviously cannot explain

extended market booms or busts, and there was, of course, a major market

collapse between 1968 and 1978, with most of the decline coming after 1972. To

illustrate the failure of our equation to capture this decline, unity plus the

cumulative error over the 1953—79 period is plotted in Figure 1.2. Along with

it is Tobin's average q, the ratio of the market value (debt plus equity) of

firms to the replacement cost of assets, as presented in the 1983 Economic

Report of the President (Table 3—88, p. 263) .     The general correlation between

the series, especially after 1962, is obvious. The existence of the 1969—78

decline and the failure of the regression equation to capture it explains the

low (0.36) explanatory power in the 1953—79 period relative to the first half

of the 1980s, when no prolonged decline (or increase) occurred.

      Many explanations have been advanced for the 1969—78 stock market decline

(see Hendershott, 1981, for a summary and critique of most of them)   ,   but   that

which I find most appealing is the "relative factor price hypothesis,"

 according to which unanticipated relative factor price changes caused

previously optimal outstanding capital to become suboptimal. Given a putty—

clay technology, the profitability of existing capital, and thus the value of

ownership claims to this capital, declined in response to sharp revisions in

expectations regarding factor prices. Most of the roughly one—third decline in

q after 1972 can, in fact, be explained by unexpected factor price changes

 (Elmer and Hendershott, 1984)



1.3 Nominal and Real Short—Term Interest Rates and Inflation

      When I examined interest rates and inflation in early 1981, financial

economists were still in the 'Fama era" of constant real interest rates. Study

after study of data from the 1950s, 60s and 70s documented the roughly one—

for—one response of interest rates to changes in inflation. Between 1952 and

1980, the real one—month bill rate averaged one—half percent with a standard

deviation of only 1½   percent.   I noted, however, that the real bill rate was

not constant prior to 1951. Most important, the real rate exceeded 4 percent

in each year in the 1926—30 period.5

      Interest rates have become a far more interesting topic in recent years.

No longer is every little squiggle in nominal rates attributed to a change in

expected inflation (although the St. Louis Fed seemed rather reluctant to give

up this view) , and numerous papers have recently been written on why interest

rates are too high relative to inflation. And high they are. Since late 1980,

real six—month Treasury bill rates have averaged around s½   percent.   Very

likely, the real six—month bill rate will exceed 4 percent in each year in the

1981—84 period, strikingly similar to the late l920s.
                                        —12—



         Figure 1.3 contains plots of the real six—month bill rate, before and

after tax. The bill rate is the average of daily figures (of beginning and end

of month data before 1960) , on a bond—equivalent basis, for June and December

of the years 1954—84, and the expected inflation rate is the corresponding

number for six—month inflation from the Livingston survey. The extraordinarily

high level of real bill rates in the l9BOs is obvious. In the eight

observations from December 1980 to June 1984, the real bill rate averaged 5 2/3

percent. This is 4 percentage points higher than the average of the 1960s and

1970g.

         The appropriate tax rate to employ in a study of real after—tax bill

rates is uncertain, and it would probably not be difficult to find economists

who would advocate rates as low as zero and as high as the corporate tax rate.

One possible way of determining the relevant tax rate is to compare the yields

on high quality tax—exempt securities with those on bills6 The real after—tax

bill rate, according to this scheme1 is then the tax—exempt rate less the

expected inflation rate. This representation of the after—tax real bill rate,

indicated by the dashed line in Figure 1.3, tells a far different story than

the before—tax real rate. In only one observation in the 1980s (June 1982) is

the real after—tax rate out of line relative to the 1960s. The rate is high in

the 1980s only relative to the extraordinarily low rates in the l970.

      The data in Table 1.3 highlight the instability of real interest rates,

whether the marginal tax rate of investors is as low as zero or as high as 0.4,

during the last decade relative to the preceding two decades. The real rate

based on a zero tax investor averaged 2.43 percent in the 1954—73 period with a

standard deviation (listed in parenthesis beneath the mean) of only 0.93

percent. For the remainder of the 1970s, the rate fell to 0.85 percent, and it

then jumped to 5.66 percent during the last four years. In spite of the

subdivision of the last decade into two parts, the standard deviation of the

real rate within the last subperiod was 50 percent higher than during the

entire earlier two decades. The increase in the standard deviation is an even

greater 100 percent if the tax bracket implied by the ratio of exempt to

taxable rates is utilized. Note that real after—tax rates based on this tax

bracket are extraordinarily low in the l974—midlBO period and are not higher

in the 1980s than they were in the 1954—73 period.

      The last column in Table 1.3 contains the average difference between the

rate of change in the consumer price index net of the shelter component (to

exclude the impact of changes in home mortgage rates) for each six—month period

less that forecast by Livingston interviewees at the beginning of the period.

Unanticipated inflation so—measured averaged one percent in the 1954—73 period,

2 percent in the l974—midso span (which included half of the first oil price

shock and all of the second) , and —l 1/3 percent since then. For those who

might think that actual inflation is a better measure of expected inflation

than is the Livingston forecast, this unexpected inflation series should be

subtracted from the real interest rates in Table 1.3 to obtain preferred

measures of real rates. This adjustment would increase the already enormous

rise in real rates between the 1970s and l9SOs by 3¼ percentage points-.

        Given that economists are unsure of even what the interest rate puzzle is

——   high real rates in the l9HOs, low rates in most of the l970s, or both ——     it
should not be surprising that there is little agreement on the determinants of

rates. Wilcox (1983) attributes the low real rates in the middle 1970s to

supply shocks (to the increase in real import prices) -      Many, most notably
Clarida and Friedman (1984) ,   cite   tight money for the higher rates in the 1980s

until late 1982, and Hendershott and Shilling (1982) and deLeeuw and Holloway

(1983) point to the business tax cuts and easy fiscal policy generally as the

source of high rates. Others cite deregulation, volatile money growth,

volatile interest rates and so on.



14 An Explanation of Changes in New Issue Yields

       Changes in new issue yields are of paramount importance to ex post bond

returns. These changes are also important to ex post equity returns insofar as

real interest rates influence the business cycle. And while I would not

overemphasize the importance of real rates —— who would dare in light of the

1983—84 economic expansion? ——   there   is no doubt that real rates matter. Thus

I conclude this chapter with an examination of the determinants of changes in

new issue rates.

       Given the diverse views held by financial economists on the determinants

of interest rates, a consensus interpretation of their views cannot be

presented. I will simply summarize the findings of my research. My framework

draws together two views of interest rate determination: the expectations

theory, whereby expected changes in rates can be inferred from forward rates,

and structural models of rates in which unexpected changes in rates can be

attributed to unanticipated changes in expected inflation, economic activity1

monetary growth, and possibly other factors. The variables explained are the
                                          —17—




 changes, over semi—annual periods, in the six—month and 20—year Treasury rates

 described earlier. For unanticipated changes in expected inflation and

 economic activity, I utilize the difference between actual data and Livingston

 Survey expectations of inflation 6 and 12 months in the future and of

 industrial production 6 months out; for monetary growth I use the difference

 between the current growth rate and that during the previous two years (no

 survey data are available) .   The data are described in Hendershott (1984)

 While the inflation expectations data are appropriate for the six—month bill

 rate, they are obviously an extremely rough approximation to the expectations

 relevant to a long—term interest rate.

      The results of this estimation are summarized in Table 1.4, in which only

coefficients on the key variables are reported. The bill rate equation is

estimated on data beginning in 1960 when data for 12—month bills first became

available; the estimation ends in 1979 in order to determine the ability of

rate relations estimated prior to the l980s to explain the movement of rates in

the early 1980s. The equations explain about a third of the changes in rates.

      To no one's surprise, I trust, expected inflation matters.     The 0.738

coefficient in the bill rate equation (with a standard error of 0.24) is

consistent with the results of a large number of previous studies.     The low

(0.18) coefficient in the bond—rate equation probably reflects a general

tendency for long—run expected inflation to move by much smaller amounts than

short—run expected inflation.

      Possibly to the surprise of some, real activity also matters to debt

yields.8 These estimates suggest that, other things being equal, the six—month

bill rate will be about 2 percentage points higher when the economy is

 operating at 90 percent capacity than when it is at 70 percent capacity, and

 the 20—year bond rate will be about three—quarters of a point higher. The

 cyclical movement of the real bill rate is obvious from Figure 1.1, where high

 values occur around all business cycle peaks
                                                (1953, 1957, 1959, 1969, 1973 and

 1979). Moreover, analysis, in a somewhat different framework, of the one—month

bill rate is fully consistent with this result.    Hendershott and Huang (1984)

conclude that the one—month rate would be a full 2½ points higher.

      Most surprising, at least to some academics, is the role of expected

interest rate changes. Recent research has attacked the expectations theory of

the term structure of interest rates; expected changes in rates implied by

forward rates are said to have negative value in explaining ex post rate

changes.9 In contrast, the estimated coefficients reported in Table 1.4 are

close to the expected value of unity and are significantly positive at the 95

and 90 percent confidence levels, respectively.

      The estimated (through December 1979) equations have been used to

interpret the rise and fall in the rates between June 1978 and December 1982.

Table 1.5 contain the results. Eighty percent (6.70 percentage points) of the

8.42 increase in the bill rate to December 1980 is explained by the equation.

Over 5 points is due to unexpected increases in anticipated inflation, two—

thirds of a point to unexpected increases in output, one—half point to the

increase in inflation uncertainty and one—third point to other factors.

Because the expected inflation rate rose by only 4.1 percentage points, the

real interest rate increased by 4.3 percentage points. Of this rise, the

 estimated equation explains 2.6 (6.7 —   4.1) points or sixty percent. The
 estimated relationship also explains 60 percent of the extraordinarily high

 average real bill rates in the early l9EOs.

       One and a half percentage points of the 2.6 percentage—point explained

 increase in the real bill rate can be attributed to the
                                                           unanticipated increases
 in industrial production, inflation uncertainty and other factors noted above.

 However, the primary single factor contributing to the rise was unexpected in-

 creases in inflation far in excess of the actual 4.1 percentage point increase.

 From mid1978 to midl979, no increase was expected, but a two point rise

 occurred. From late 1979 to late 1980 half point increases were anticipated,

while the actual expected rate rose by another two points. In total, the

 cumulated unexpected increase in anticipated inflation over this span was a

full 7 percentage points. Even though the estimated coefficient on expected

inflation increases is only 0.74, implying that the nominal bill rate rises by

only three—quarters of a point for every point of unanticipated increase in

inflation, the forecasted nominal bill rate rises by 5.2 points because of this

7 point increase and thus the real bill rate rises by over a full point.

      Between the end of 1980 and the end of 1982, the bill rate declined
                                                                            by
nearly 7½ percentage points. Nearly 95 percent of this decline is explained by

the estimation equation. All the factors that contributed to the early

increase in the bill rate reversed themselves, inducing the decline.

Unexpected declines in industrial production, inflation uncertainty, and the

catch—all "other" tended to lower the real rate by 3 percentage points, but a

smaller decline in unexpected than actual inflation, along with the only

partial (0.74) response of nominal rates to unexpected changes in inflation,

partially offset the decrease in the real rate.
                                          —22—




       This explanation of the bill rate cycle is remarkably good, in my less

 than humble opinion, because most of the unprecedented increase in rates and

 all of the decrease came after the estimation period. Two problems of the

 forecast should be noted, however. First, the equation does not pick up the

 interyear oscillations in either 1980 (due to the credit controls, see footnote

 7) or 1982. second, the forecasted 6—month rate is 1 1/3 percentage points

above the actual value at the end of 1982 (the 1.72 point underestimate of the

increase less the 0.41 point underestimate of the decrease)      .   That is, the real
rate is 1 1/3 points too high (relative to 1978) ,    possibly   due to some of the

factors discussed earlier but not captured in our equation.

      A similar, but far less satisfactory, explanation of the bond rate cycle

is also summarized in Table 1.5. The inability to explain much more than a

quarter of the rise in this rate almost certainly follows from the inadequacy

of the six—month expected inflation rate as a proxy for long—run expected

inflation. Long—run expected inflation likely rose by about as much as short—

run expected inflation did in the 1978—80 period, but the 0.18 coefficient on

the unexpected change in expected inflation translates the increase in expected

inflation into only one—quarter as large an impact on the bond rate as on the

bill rate. The ability of the equation to explain three—quarters of the

decline in the bond rate suggests that long—run expected inflation has not

fallen nearly as much as short—run expected inflation, which seems quite

plausible in light of the large outyear structural deficits.



1.5 Summary

      A strong relationship has existed between ex post equity returns and

business cycle turning points since at least 1926: Somewhere around business

cycle peaks ——   during   the last half year of the expansion or the first half of
                                       —23—




 the contraction —— investors sharply reduce their expectations regarding future

 returns on equities, and the reverse occurs around business cycle   troughs ——
 during the last half of recessions and the first six months of upswings. As      a

 result, stock prices rise near troughs and fall near peaks. During the 1953—79

 period, ex post equity returns were 32 percent greater than the 9 percent norm

 in the year (roughly) surrounding troughs, and 21 percent less than the norm in

the   year surrounding peaks. This cyclical phenomenon alone explains over a
third of the movement in returns. In the first nine semiannual periods in the
l980s, forecasts of returns based on the 1953—79 relationship explain over 70
percent of the movement in returns, and the cumulative error of a forecast of
the stock market and cumulative dividends is less than one percent. Stock
market performance so far in the l980s has not been at all unusual.
       In contrast, the level of real interest rates so far in the 1980s differs
markedly from the prior quarter (nearly half) century. Nominal Treasury bill
rates moved one—for—one, or slightly less, with changes in expected inflation
during the 1951—79 period, resulting in relatively constant real bill rates
which averaged 2 percent. In the 1980s, real rates have averaged over
percent, duplicating the experience of the late 1920s. The source of the
present high real rates is unclear, with various authors citing tight money (at
least until late 1982) , increased volatility of interest rates and monetary
growth, easy fiscal policy, business tax incentives, and deregulation among
other reasons. More important1 on an after—tax basis real rates are no higher
now than in the 1950s and l9GOs. What was unusual were the low real after—tax
rates in the l970s.
       My own research on new—issue Treasury coupon rates draws on two views of
interest rate determination; the expectations theory, whereby expected changes
in rates can be inferred from forward rates, and structural models of rates in
                                      —24—




which unexpected changes in rates can be attributed to unanticipated changes in

expected inflation, economic activity, monetary growth, and possibly other

factors. The first important result is the consistency of the data with the

expectations theory. While expected rate changes explain little of observed

changes in new—issue rates, the data are consistent with the expectations

theory. A second result is a strong positive relationship between Treasury

rates and economic activity. As operation of the economy increases from 70

percent of capacity to 90 percent, real Treasury rates rise by 2½ percentage

points at the short (one month) end of the term structure to three—quarters of

a point at the long (20 year) end.

      In spite of the "success' of this research, the difficulties of

forecasting interest rates should be obvious. Expected changes in rates

explain a miniscule 2 percent of actual changes because surprises are so

prevalent. Moreover, 'knowing" inflation, real activity, and money surprises

increases the ex post explanatory power only to one—third. My sympathy goes

out to those forecasting interest rates for a living.

 7. One extreme outlier in both rate
                                        series in recent years is worthy of note.
     The —3 percent real bill rate in June 1980
                                                  was 2½ percent below any other
     observed bill rate in the entire period, and the —6.3 percent after—tax

    real rate was also 2½ percent below
                                          any other. The record declines to
    unprecedented lows and the even sharper immediate
                                                        reversals cry out for an
    extraordinary explanation. Fortunately, one is available. In March 1980,

    the Federal Reserve implemented a credit
                                               controls program that included a

    noninterest bearing reserve requirement of 15 percent on increases in

    credit. Apparently as a result, consumer installment credit outstanding

    contracted at an annual rate of 10½
                                          percent in the April—May period, the
    first decline since May 1975 and the largest reduction since World War II.

    The controls program was eased in late May and terminated on July 24, 1980.

                                           and Tanzi (1983) also report large
    real income effects.

   However, Fama (1983) finds a modest value in
                                                  forecasts, and Brennan and

                                               (1984) report evidence of short
   rates reverting toward long rates.
