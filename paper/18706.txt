                                              ABSTRACT

While gold objects have existed for thousands of years, gold’s role in diversified portfolios is not well
understood. We critically examine popular stories such as ‘gold is an inflation hedge’. We show that
gold may be an effective hedge if the investment horizon is measured in centuries. Over practical investment
horizons, gold is an unreliable inflation hedge. We also explore valuation. The real price of gold is
currently high compared to history. In the past, when the real price of gold was above average, subsequent
real gold returns have been below average consistent with mean reversion. On the demand side, we
focus on the official gold holdings of many countries. If prominent emerging markets increase their
gold holdings to average per capita or per GDP holdings of developed countries, the real price of gold
may rise even further from today’s elevated levels. In the end, investors face a golden dilemma: 1)
embrace a view that ‘those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it’ and the purchasing
power of gold is likely to revert to its mean or 2) embrace a view that the emergence of new markets
represent a structural change and ‘this time is different’.

Introduction

The global equity and fixed income markets have a combined market value of about $90 trillion.
Institutional and individual investors own most of the outstanding supply of stocks and bonds. At
current prices, the world stock of gold is worth about $9 trillion. Yet investors own only about 20%, or
less than $2 trillion, of the outstanding supply of gold. A move by institutional and individual investors to
“market weight” gold holdings would require them to offer the already existing gold owners a price
attractive enough to incent them to part with their gold, probably sending nominal and real prices of
gold much higher. Should investors target a gold “market weight”? Could they achieve a gold “market
weight” even if they wanted to?

The goal of our paper is to better understand how we should treat gold in asset allocation. We start by
examining a number of popular stories that are used to justify some allocation to gold, such as inflation
hedging, currency hedging, and disaster protection. We then examine basic supply and demand factors.
Remarkably, the new supply of gold that comes to the market each year hasn’t substantially increased
over the past decade even though the nominal price of gold has risen fivefold. We also look at the
distribution of gold ownership in developed countries and emerging market countries and estimate the
impact on gold demand if key emerging market countries follow the same patterns of central bank gold
ownership in important developed countries.

Gold has had an amazing recent run. From December 1999 to March 2012 the U.S. dollar price of gold
rose more than 15.4% per annum, the U.S. Consumer Price Index increased by 2.5% per annum, while
U.S. stock and bond markets registered annual gains of 1.5% and 6.4%, respectively. Indeed, Saad (2012)
notes a recent Gallup poll found that about 30% of respondents considered gold to be the best long-
term investment, making gold a more popular investment than real estate, stocks, and bonds.

Though some might use historical returns to establish long-run forward-looking expected returns, it is
implausible that the expected long-run real rate of return on gold is 13% per year (15.4% nominal minus
an assumed 2.5% annual inflation). Yet, it is essential to have some sense of gold’s expected return for
asset allocation. Current views are sharply divergent. On one side is Buffett (2012) who compares the
current value of gold to three famous bubbles: Tulips, dotcom, and the recent housing bust. Buffett
writes:
                 What motivates most gold purchasers is their belief that the ranks of the
                 fearful will grow. During the past decade that belief has proved correct.
                 Beyond that, the rising price has on its own generated additional buying
                 enthusiasm, attracting purchasers who see the rise as validating an
                 investment thesis. As “bandwagon” investors join any party, they create
                 their own truth – for a while.”
In contrast, Dalio1 argues that Treasury bills are no longer a safe asset and that there will be an ugly
contest to depreciate the three main currencies (dollar, Yen and Euro) as countries print money to pay
off debt. Dalio notes:

                                                                                                           2
                 Gold is a very underowned asset, even though gold has become much
                 more popular. If you ask any central bank, any sovereign wealth fund,
                 any individual what percentage of their portfolio is in gold in relationship
                 to financial assets, you'll find it to be a very small percentage. It's an
                 imprudently small percentage, particularly at a time when we're losing a
                 currency regime.

It is not surprising that there is so much disagreement about gold’s future. This disagreement reflects
the fact that at least six somewhat different arguments have been advanced for owning gold:2

       gold provides an inflation hedge
       gold serves as a currency hedge
       gold is an attractive alternative to assets with low real returns
       gold a safe haven in times of stress
       gold should be held because we are returning to a de facto world gold standard
       gold is “underowned”

The debate over the prospects for gold resembles in some sense the parable of the six blind men and
the elephant.3 Different perspectives, different models, lead to different insights. Depending upon which
rationale, or combination of rationales, one embraces, gold is either very expensive or attractive. The
debate over the value of gold is also an example of a Keynesian beauty contest.4 The Keynesian beauty
contest framework suggests that the price of gold is not determined by what you think gold is worth.
What matters is, for example, what others think others think others think others think gold is worth.

While the possible value of all the gold ever mined is about $9 trillion,5 only a small amount of gold
actually trades in financial markets. We show that the investment demand for gold is characterized by
positive price elasticity. This is one way of referring to momentum investing. As a result, even though
historical measures of “value” might suggest gold is very expensive, it is possible that the actions of a
relatively small number of marginal, momentum, buyers of gold could drive the real and nominal price
much higher (especially if the marginal buyers are not focused on “valuation”).



1. Gold as an inflation hedge

Probably one of the most widely held beliefs about gold is that it is an inflation hedge. Jastram (1977)
pointed out that historically gold has been a poor hedge of inflation in the short run though it has been a
good hedge of inflation in the long run. For Jastram, the short run was the next few years and the long

  See Saxe (1872).

  See Keynes (1936).

  The World Gold Council estimated that at year-end 2011 there were about 171,300 metric tons of gold above
ground. This is a widely referenced estimate of the cumulative amount of gold that has been mined over time. The
fact that this estimate is widely referenced does not mean that it is accurate. Given 32,150 troy ounces per metric
ton and a price of $1,650 per ounces yields a value of about $9 trillion.

                                                                                                                 3
run was perhaps a century. Jastram used the phrase “the golden constant” to communicate his belief
that the real price of gold maintained its purchasing power over long periods of time and that gold’s
long-run average real return had been zero. Harmston (1998) built on Jastrom’s research, finding that in
the long run the prices of some goods, such as bread, seem to command a constant price when
denominated in ounces of gold. 6 “Gold as an inflation hedge” means that if, for instance, inflation rises
by 10% per year for 100 years then the price of gold should also rise by roughly 10% per year over a
century. The “gold as an inflation hedge” argument says that inflation is a fundamental driver of the
price of gold.7

It is worth asking “for whom might gold be an inflation hedge”? That is, even if gold provides a potential
inflation hedging ability, it might not be accessible for investors. For example, in the United States,
private ownership of gold was outlawed by President Roosevelt in early 1933 with the signing of
Executive Order 6102. Private ownership of gold in the United States was restored when Public Law 93-
373 went into effect on December 31, 1974. If different countries have different laws regarding the
ownership of gold then investors in different countries face different realities with regard to the legal
inflation hedging possibility of gold. Additionally, when an investment is outlawed in a country it is
questionable as to whether or not investors in that country are able to observe “market prices” for the
outlawed investment. As a result exploring the various arguments for investing in gold requires
selecting, and being constrained by, a country perspective and a legal perspective. It is also desirable,
and important, that if one invests in a legal inflation hedge that the position remains a legal hedge until
at least a fraction of a second after the position is sold8. For the purposes of this paper the United States
is a convenient country perspective and the focus is largely on the time period in which it has been legal
to own gold in the United States. This does not suggest that the “U.S. perspective” is the only
perspective or that investors should only consider legal investments. Rather it is a starting point.

Exhibit 1 illustrates one literal version of the “gold as an inflation hedge” argument. Our initial “legal”
sample starts in 1975 because that is when U.S. citizens were once again able to own and trade gold.
The “market price” of gold became readily visible with the launch of gold futures trading (for most of the
history of the U.S., the price of gold was fixed by the government.9) Exhibit 1 shows the month-end

  Harmston (1998) mentions that in 562 B.C., during the reign of the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar, an ounce of
gold purchased 350 loaves of bread. At the recent price of $1,600 an ounce, an ounce of gold could buy 350 loaves
of bread priced at $4.57 a loaf.

  See Greer (1997).

 The possibility that the U.S. government will make gold ownership illegal once again, or outright confiscate gold
held by individuals, is a popular anxiety inducing gold investing theme. For instance, in August 2011, analyst Marc
Faber suggested that U.S. citizens owning physical gold should make sure that their gold was stored outside of the
U.S.

  Officer (2006) shows that the official U.S. gold price has been set only a few times: 1792 ($19.39), 1834 ($20.67),
1934 ($35), 1972 ($38), 1973 ($42.22). Fama and French (1987) examine the performance of gold futures from
February 1975 to July 1984. Our monthly U.S. gold futures data starts with the introduction of legal gold trading in
January 1975. Elwell (2011) notes that from 1934 to 1973 (during what he calls a “quasi-gold standard” period)
“although there was no private market for gold in the United States, such markets did exist abroad. By the late
1960s, prices in these markets were tending to deviate from official currency prices”. Bank for International
Settlements annual reports (1966-70) refer to “market prices” in London and Zurich. Historical London “market
prices” going back to 1968 can be found at the London Bullion Market Association. (The first London gold “fixing”

value of the nearby gold futures contract versus the monthly reading for the U.S. Consumer Price Index
(CPI), over the period January 1975 to March 2012. The red regression line10 shows that on average the
higher the level of the CPI the higher the price of gold. This line roughly portrays the implied price of
gold -- if gold was driven by CPI. However, in Exhibit 1, the price of gold swings widely around the CPI.
The inflation derived price of gold and the actual price of gold have rarely been equal. Given the most
recent value for the CPI index, this version of the “gold as an inflation hedge” argument suggests that
the price of gold should currently be around $780 an ounce.

occurred in 1919 (http://www.lbma.org.uk/pages/index.cfm?page_id=15&title=market_history). Five gold bullion
dealers collectively decided what the price of gold should be on a given day. The London gold fixing was suspended
in 1939 and it was reinstituted in 1954). As part of the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates participating
governments had an option to settle balance of payments differences with gold reserve transfers. An attempt in
the 1960s by the central banks of eight countries to maintain the Bretton Woods fixed exchange rates, by selling
gold to “the market” at $35 an ounce, led to an arrangement called the London Gold Pool. For various reasons the
London price of gold rose above $40 an ounce in 1968 leading to losses for the members of the London Gold Pool
and a decision to end the operation of the Pool. Minutes of Federal Reserve conversations (Memorandum of
Discussion) in 1966, 1967 and 1968 chronicle the challenges the U.S. experienced trying to support the London
Gold Pool. The U.S. ended the convertibility of the U.S. dollar into gold in 1971 and the year-end gold price was
about $43 an ounce in London. In 1973 the U.S. officially ended its adherence to the gold exchange standard. The
year-end 1973 price of gold was about $106 an ounce in London. Barsky and Summers (1988) choose 1973 as the
start date for their analysis of Gibson’s paradox noting that “we focus on the period from 1973 to the present,
after the gold market was sufficiently free from government pegging operations and from limitations on private
trading for there to be a genuine “market” price of gold.”
10
  The price of gold was regressed on the contemporaneous value of the U.S. Consumer Price Index. This illustrates
the best in-sample fit between the price of gold and an inflation index.

                                                                                                                   5
Another way to assess how effective gold has been as an inflation hedge is to examine the historical
fluctuations in the real (inflation adjusted) price of gold. If gold were a perfect short-term hedge of
inflation, in the sense of Jastram’s (1977) metaphor of a long-run zero-real-return “golden constant”,
then the real price of gold should be a constant and exhibit no real price variability.11 Alternatively, if the
real price of gold fluctuates, perhaps behaving like a valuation measure such as a stock market price-
earnings ratio, then gold may be an imperfect hedge of short-term inflation.

Exhibit 2 shows one way to think about fluctuations in the real price of gold from a U.S. perspective
(later we deal with an international perspective).12 In January 1975, the month-end nominal price of the
nearby gold futures contract was $175 an ounce. The month-end January 1975 index value of the U.S.
CPI index was 52.1.13 The ratio of the nominal price of gold relative to the CPI index (one way to
calculate the “real price of gold”) was 3.36. Since the inception of gold futures trading this real price
ratio has averaged about 3.2, reached a low value of 1.46 in March of 2001 and a high value of 8.73 in
January 1980. Using this measure, the month-end March 2012 real price of gold was recently 7.3. Since
the start of gold futures trading the only other time the real price of gold has been roughly as high as it
is today was in 1980. Following the real price high in 1980, the real price of gold, as well as the nominal
price of gold, fell significantly.




11
   Bekaert and Wang (2010) illustrate a way to think about an inflation hedge, in the context of a simple linear
regression model. They regress the nominal return of an asset on the rate of inflation: Nominal Return = “Inflation
Alpha” + “Inflation Beta”*Inflation Rate + error. An asset with an Inflation Beta of 1.0 is a defined as a “perfect
hedge against inflation”. An Inflation Beta of 1.0 is another way of thinking about “moving in lockstep with
inflation”. There are at least three ways to think about the idea of the price of gold and inflation moving in lock-
step. One possibility is Jastram’s (1977) idea of the “golden constant”. One interpretation views gold having an
inflation beta of 1.0 and an “inflation alpha” of zero. The “golden constant” is consistent with the idea that the
purchasing power, the real price, of gold is constant. Alternatively gold’s inflation beta could be 1.0 and its inflation
alpha could be positive. This would suggest that in the long run an ounce of gold has a rising real purchasing power
and a rising real price. A third possibility is that gold’s “inflation alpha” is negative, and the purchasing power, and
real price, of gold declines over time. This third case would be problematic. An inflation beta of 1.0 would seem to
suggest that gold is an inflation hedge while a negative inflation alpha would suggest that with a long enough time
horizon purchasing power would decline to zero. There are, of course, other nuances such as attributing any
“inflation alpha” to overlooked risk factors, time horizon issues (monthly, annual, etc.), how to measure inflation
and the stability of inflation betas.

Exhibit 2 illustrates that the real price of gold has been quite volatile. In fact, the volatility of the real
price of gold has been basically the same as the volatility of the nominal price of gold and the real price
of gold tends to mean revert over a time period of about ten years. The variability of the real price of
gold suggests that gold has been a poor short-term inflation hedge.

There are at least two ways to think about inflation: the rate of inflation that investors expect and the
rate of inflation that comes as a surprise to investors. An asset that hedges expected and unexpected
inflation would probably appeal to a broad number of investors. If an investor possessed perfect
foresight then there would be no unexpected inflation. As a result one of the easiest ways to test if an
asset is a good hedge of unexpected inflation is to ask if it hedges perfect foresight of future inflation
changes. Exhibit 3 details the inability of gold to hedge against unexpected inflation (measured by the
actual year-to-year change in the annual inflation rate during the time period 1975 to 2011). There is
effectively no correlation here. Any observed positive relationship is driven by a single year, 1980.

What about the ability of gold to hedge, keep pace with, longer-term inflation?

Exhibit 4 shows rolling monthly observations of trailing ten-year rates of inflation, as well as both
nominal and real gold returns. There has been substantial variation in trailing nominal ten year
annualized gold returns: from as low as -6% per annum to as high as +20% per annum. There has also
been significant variation in real gold returns. In contrast, over the same time period, the low and high
inflation rates were +2.3% per annum and +7.3% per annum – a range of only 5%.

There are at least four observations that arise from a visual examination of Exhibit 4. First, perfect
foresight knowledge of the future rate of inflation did not translate into an accurate forecast of future
nominal and real gold price returns (inflation did not predict gold returns). Second, knowing future
nominal and real gold returns provided no real insight into the course of future inflation (gold returns
did not predict inflation). Third, variation in the real price of gold accounts for most of the variation in
the nominal price of gold. Finally, observing that the trailing ten year real gold return was negative from
1988-2005, it is obvious that gold might have failed investor expectations to be an effective long-term
inflation hedge.

By definition, the nominal return of gold is the sum of the inflation rate and the real gold price return. Of
course, the rate of inflation varies from country to country. In Exhibit 4, the average rate of inflation in
the U.S. was about 4% per year, driving a wedge between nominal and real gold returns. What If the
average rate of inflation in some other country had been 50% per year, rather than 4% per year? Then,

                                                                                                               8
in a “golden constant” sense, the average nominal return of gold would have been higher. However,
there is no obvious reason that the real gold return would have changed. In fact, As Erb and Harvey
(2012a) illustrate, when the real price of gold is high or low in one country, it is generally high or low in
other countries. As a result, the nominal return of gold (within a country) will consist of a local, country
specific, inflation effect and what appears to be a global real price effect. Exhibit 4 suggests that the real
price of gold can vary a lot. Gold may not be a very effective long-term inflation hedge when the long-
term is defined as 10 years.

Mean reversion is a “past is prologue” way of looking at the world. The real price of gold is currently
high and the real price of gold was high in 1980. In Exhibit 2, the high real price of gold in 1980 was
followed by a long period of unattractive gold returns. Exhibit 5 details the historical relationship
between the real price of gold and subsequent 10–year real gold price returns since 1975. If the exhibit
traced out a “known known” stable relationship then the current high real price of gold would suggest a
future 10-year real price return of about -10% per year. But the relationship is not a “known known,” it
is a “known unknown”.

Whether the real price of gold forecasts future real gold returns is similar to the debate over the ability
of stock market price earnings ratios, valuation ratios, to forecast future stock market real returns. For
instance, Campbell and Shiller (2001) and Asness (2012) emphatically argue that valuation matters and
that high valuation levels are followed by low real returns. DeLong (2012) diplomatically notes that “only
fools say…that movements in market-wide price-earnings ratios are best interpreted as shifts in rational
expectations of future earnings and dividend growth”. However, Ibbotson and Chen (2003) are
comfortable with the idea that in an efficient market high price-earnings ratios forecast high future
earnings growth rates and Malkiel (2003) views the valuation argument as being inconsistent with
market efficiency. Investors observing the behavior of the real price of gold have an opportunity to

                                                                                                            9
confirm their pre-existing concepts about how markets operate. The real price of gold may or may not
mean revert over time, but the purchasing power of gold is driven by changes in the real price of gold.
An investment in gold is a bet on the future evolution of the real price of gold, whether an investor is
aware of the bet or not.

Importantly, it is dangerous to draw inference about the future based on what is arguably one historical
episode.

In 1980 the trailing one year CPI inflation rate was about 13%. Some called bonds “certificates of
confiscation” because of a view that the rate of inflation would stay at a stubbornly high level well into
the future.14 With the clarity of hindsight, it is possible to see a “Volcker moment” in which the U.S.
Federal Reserve turned its back on its dual mandate (maximum employment and price stability) and
decided to focus on fighting inflation. The actual return for gold of -5% per year over the period 1980 to
1990 is the one path traveled by history but it is only one of the many paths that were possible to
imagine from the vantage point of January 1980.

What might inflation be over the next ten years? By looking at the yields of 10 year nominal Treasury
bonds and 10 year inflation linked Treasury bonds it is possible to back out an approximate “market
implied” 10 year inflation forecast.15 Currently the “breakeven” inflation rate over the next 10 years is

14
  See Norris (2010).

  Many investors use Bloomberg terminals. An investor using Bloomberg’s GGR US (U.S. Generic Government
Rates) function will see “breakeven rates” calculated as the difference in yields between maturity-matched
nominal and real Treasuries (TIPS). For example, Perold (2012) uses expected inflation and breakeven
interchangeably. This does not mean that this approach is correct, but it does indicate that many Bloomberg users
are exposed to this measure and method of calculation. A more precise calculation might incorporate an estimate

                                                                                                                         10
about 2% per year. Of course, there is no guarantee that 10 year inflation will actually average 2% per
year over the next 10 years. If the real price ratio of gold mean reverts over the coming decade to its
historical average of about 3.2, Exhibit 6 shows gold’s possible rate of return will average about -6% per
annum.

              Assumes an initial gold price of $1,665 and a March 2012 CPI Index level of 229. The “Return Given Inflation and
              Ending Valuation” is an exploration of how the possible ten year nominal price return for gold might vary with
              1) the current real price of gold (current gold price/current CPI Index), 2) the annualized rate of CPI inflation
              realized over the next ten years and 3) the ending (ten years in the future) real price of gold (nominal gold
              price/CPI Index ratio). For instance, if inflation over the next ten years is 2% per year then the ending level of
                                                        10
              the CPI index will be 279.15 (229 x 1.02 ). If one assumes that the ratio of the price of gold to the CPI index in
              ten years will be 3.2, then the ten year in the future nominal price of gold will be $893.28 (279.15 x 3.2). As a
              result, the “Return Given Inflation and Ending Valuation” will be -6.03% per year (annualized return =
              exp(ln(ending price/initial price)/time horizon)-1=exp(ln($893.28/$1,665)/10)-1).



While Exhibit 2 traces the real price of gold since 1975, received gold lore suggests that gold has been
mined since 3600 B.C.16 Tversky and Kahneman (1971) warned of the “law of small numbers” which
leads to “exaggerated confidence in the validity of conclusions based on small samples”. It is possible
that the behavior of the price of gold since 1975, a time span of only 36 years, is an example of the “law
of small numbers”. A possible, but potentially flawed, way to battle the “law of small numbers” is to
obtain more data.




of a possible “liquidity premium”. The liquidity premium would increase the breakeven inflation level. See analysis

Exhibit 7 shows the estimated growth of the U.S. GDP price deflator since 1792. This increases the
historical inflation time span from 36 years to 220 years. Of course, Exhibit 7 does not provide any
insight into the cost of things between 3600 B.C. and 1792 A.D. Paul and Lehrman (2007) suggest that
“from 1792 to 1971 [the U.S.] had an imperfect money and banking system….but during that time the
dollar was always related to gold in one way or another”. In a more granular review of historical U.S.
currency standards written for members of the U.S. Congress, Elwell (2011) labels the bimetallic
currency years 1792 to 1834 “basically silver”, the years 1834 to 1862 “basically gold”, the years 1862 to
1879 “fiat paper money”, the years 1879 to 1933 “a true gold standard”, the years 1934 to 1973 a
“quasi-gold standard” and the years since 1973 as a pure fiat money regime.

The highest U.S. inflation rate in Exhibit 7 occurred under the current fiat money regime. To some, this is
proof of the fragility of a fiat money regime. Von Mises (1953) believed that fiat money systems were
inherently prone to inflationary excesses, especially if social policy focused on full employment over
price stability.17 But the devil is in the details. The fiat money regime of 1862-1879 experienced what
seems to be a low rate of inflation and the quasi-gold standard regime of 1934-1973 had a relatively
high inflation rate. Bordo and Kydland (1995) point out that a gold standard rule is a contingent
commitment to price stability, a commitment that can be temporarily abandoned during times of war or
other national emergencies. The U.S. Civil War was financed with the creation of fiat money,
greenbacks, and what at the time seemed to be massive borrowing.18 Even though the wartime
financing needs of the Civil War resulted in a high level of inflation in the North during the war, the
period from 1865 to 1879 was characterized by deflation. It is possible that over the entire period 1862-
1879, given the mores of the time, the U.S. implicitly was following a path of contingent commitment to
a gold standard. As a result the fiat money regime of 1862-1879 had a cumulative inflation profile
different from the 1973 to present fiat money experience.

The devil is also in the details again for the 1934-1973 “quasi-gold standard” inflation experience.
McKinnon (1993) points out that the success of a gold standard is only as good as the willingness of the
participants to abide by the “rules of the game”, in which interest rates rise when gold reserves fall and
interest rates fall when gold reserves rise. He suggested that the decades prior to 1913 are an example
of gold standard countries somewhat playing by the “rules of the game”, and the period from 1934 to
1973 is an example of gold standard countries somewhat abusing the “rules of the game”. An interesting
takeaway from Exhibit 7 is the possibility that neither a fiat money system nor a gold system is
inherently prone to inflation: what matters is the long-run actions and intentions of market participants.

   von Mises (1953) believed that the natural response of “the common man” to a fiat money system was to “flee
into real values” by investing in commodities as an inflation hedge.

Exhibit 8 examines the real price of gold in U.S. dollars since 1791. Unlike Exhibit 1, which uses month-
end closing prices for gold from a futures exchange, Exhibit 8 uses an annual gold time series that is
cobbled together from a number of studies.19 The price of gold in Exhibit 8 is deflated (divided) by an
estimate of the U.S. GDP deflator. There are at least two things to note about this price level indicator.
The first is that the GDP deflator is by definition not the same thing as the Consumer Price Index. The
cumulative differences between a GDP deflator and a CPI index are typically not large. The second is that
GDP was first calculated in 1937, as a result of the pioneering work of economist Simon Kuznets, and
backfilled to 1929. The GDP deflator estimates for the years 1791 to 1928 are only “backfilled”
estimates.

Exhibit 8 shows that the real price of gold was fairly constant until the 1970s. This stability was the result
of the fact that the U.S. operated with a variety of currency regimes “backed” by gold and silver
(bimetallism), or just gold, from 1791 until the early 1970s. The exact definition of what “backed” means
varied over time (the U.S. dollar was on a full gold standard between 1900 and 1933, a gold exchange
standard at other times and gold “backing” was typically suspended during wars or economic
emergencies).

From the 1970s until today the real gold price has fluctuated wildly.20 The real price of gold is currently
very high relative to the 1791-2011 average. Unsurprisingly, as is the case with many economic time
series, the overall in-sample average will typically differ from individual sub-period averages. The low
average real price of gold occurred during the 36 year time span from 1937 to 1973. The high average
real price of gold occurred during the current 36 year time span from 1975 to 2011. The message of
Exhibit 8 is that the real price of gold fluctuates and that it seems to have been more volatile recently
than during the previous, roughly, 200 years. The absence of a pronounced upward or downward trend
in the real price of gold in Exhibits 2 and 8 supports, but does not prove, the idea that gold’s real rate of
return might be on average close to zero.21

Related to the idea that gold is possibly a long-term inflation hedge is the “constant price in terms of
gold” argument, the idea that for some items prices tends to hover around some constant amount of
gold. For instance, some claim that over time the cost of a “high quality” man’s suit has cost an ounce of
gold.22 This statement is interesting but hard to pursue because of issues such as quality differences
over time and sumptuary laws, which once regulated the types of clothing different social and economic
classes could wear. Since a man’s suit or a loaf of bread is the result of human labor an alternative way
to examine the idea that the price of goods in terms of gold remains constant is to look at per capita
income measured in ounces of gold. A rising level of purchasing power could be consistent with per

  In 1971 U.S. President Nixon ended the convertibility of U.S. dollars into gold. In effect Nixon brought an end to
the 1944 Bretton Woods Accord which allowed 1) the conversion of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars at fixed
exchange rates and 2) the convertibility of U.S. dollars into gold.

capita income “buying” more ounces of gold over time. A stagnant level of purchasing power could be
consistent with a Malthusian Trap, in which per capita income “buys” a stable number of ounces of gold.

Exhibit 9 shows time series for nominal U.S. per capita disposable income and U.S. per capita disposable
income measured in ounces of gold. Since 1929 per capita income has grown about 5% per year, the
price of gold has grown about 5.5% per year and per capita income measured in ounces of gold has
fallen by about 0.5% per year.23 Looking at nominal per capita income it is possible to see a picture of
positive and reasonably stable income gains over time. Looking at per capita income measured in
ounces of gold reveals a volatile landscape of slowly declining purchasing power. Since 1929 per capita
income has on average been worth 46 ounces of gold. Currently per capita income can buy about 20
ounces of gold. Exhibit 9 suggests that in terms of ounces of gold per capita income has been stagnant
since 1929. Defining the value of one’s life as an item, this observation is consistent with the assertion
that the “gold price” of certain “items” is, on average, constant over time. It is perhaps gold’s way of
saying that the more things change (nominal income) the more things stay the same (real income).

Why might income measured in ounces of gold have been stagnant? First, the lack of income growth
could be viewed as being consistent with the vision of English political economist Thomas Robert
Malthus that the trade-off between technology and population growth would lead to stagnant
incomes.24 A Malthusian explanation carries a lot of deadweight intellectual baggage since Malthus is
often criticized for successfully describing life in the European Dark and Middle Ages and missing the

  1929 is the earliest date for which the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (www.bea.gov) reports macroeconomic
data such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and its constituents (personal disposable income and personal
disposable income per capita).

                                                                                                                                                      15
transformative significance of the Industrial Revolution. So maybe Malthus was right about stagnant
incomes but wrong as to why incomes would be stagnant.

Second, it is possible to view Exhibit 9 as a reminder that some people might suffer from money illusion.
The American economist Irving Fisher (1928) referred to money illusion as “the failure to perceive that
the dollar, or any other unit of money, expands or shrinks in value”. Money illusion is a behavioral
weakness borne of the desire to prosper. Consider the following example. Imagine that you are
presented with one of two ways to receive your pay. In the first case, you can take a pay cut of 10
percent in a world with 0% inflation and in the second case you can take a pay raise of 10% in a world
with 20% inflation. In both instances the inflation adjusted level of income declines 10%, but in the
second case a decline in real income is paired with an increase in nominal income. Money illusion
suggests that on average people prefer to focus on nominal gains in income rather than observe the
path of their real incomes. Money illusion does not explain why gold denominated incomes have been
stagnant though it does provide a reason some might prefer to look at nominal rather than gold
denominated incomes. Additionally it might be that the purchasing power of wages has been more
robust than depicted in Exhibit 9 when measured in terms of an evolving basket of goods and services
that reflects changes over time in tastes, preferences and technology.

Third, it is possible to interpret the lack of growth in disposable income, measured in ounces of gold, as
indirect evidence that gold is overvalued today. In Exhibit 9, 2011 disposable personal income equaled
about 19.7 ounces of gold. This implies an income (in ounces of gold) annual growth rate of -0.6% since
1929. Alternatively, suppose the price of gold was the same today as in 1999. In this scenario, personal
per capita income would command 132.3 ounces of gold. This implies an annual growth rate of 1.7%
since 1929.

While Exhibit 9 presents a picture suggesting little advancement in U.S. per capita pay when measured
in ounces of gold over the last ninety years, Exhibit 10 extends this framework to one of the few
reasonably close wage comparisons that can be made across a long period of time: military pay. The
Romans were skilled at building roads and aqueducts as well as recording how much it cost to staff a
Roman legion. Legionaries were the lowest ranking soldiers in a Roman legion, similar to a private in the
U.S. Army. A centurion commanded a century of 80 legionaries and had a rank somewhat similar to a
captain in the U.S. Army.

In the era of Emperor Augustus (reigned from 27 B.C. to 14 A.D.), a Roman legionary was paid about
2.31 ounces of gold a year (225 denarii) and a centurion was paid about 38.58 ounces of gold a year
(3,750 denarii).25 Converted to U.S. dollars, the pay of a Roman legionary was about 20% that of a
modern day private in the U.S. Army and the pay of a centurion was about 30% greater than the pay of a
captain in the U.S. Army.

Similar to the U.S. aggregate experience since 1791, there is little or no income growth in military pay
over 2,000 years. Interestingly, this conclusion is not that sensitive to the final price of gold.

There are two insights here. First, some incomes denominated in gold might be a very long-term hedge
– in that the real purchasing power of some wage rates are roughly preserved. Second, it helps us to
begin to understand what the expected return on gold is not. Even though 2,000 years is only a fraction
of the time that gold has been mined, it provides a lot of annual compounding periods. A claim that gold
could have “equity-like” returns in the future needs to be reconciled with the past. Starting 2000 years
ago in the year 12 A.D. one dollar compounding at just 1% a year, turns into $439 million over 2,000
years. If the rate of return is increased to 1.62%, the ending value is $100 trillion – more than the today’s
combined capitalization of world stock and bond markets.

In “normal” times, gold does not seem to be a good hedge of realized or unexpected short-run inflation.
Gold may very well be a long-run inflation hedge. However, the long-run may be longer than an
investor’s investment time horizon or life span. In the short-run the real price of gold has been the
dominant driver of the price of gold and the returns from gold. We will return to the inflation argument
when we explore the “safe haven” argument where we explore hyperinflation.



2. Gold as a currency hedge

There are at least two ways to interpret the “gold as a currency hedge” argument. The first
interpretation suggests that “gold is a foreign exchange currency hedge”. In this case, the expected
return of gold should offset the expected decline in the value of one’s own currency. If, for instance, the
U.S. dollar declines 10% against the Japanese yen then the “gold as a currency hedge” argument would
suggest that the price of gold should rise by 10%. The net result of this hedge should be a return of zero
(gold return + currency return = 0).

This perspective has the following problem. If the price of gold in a country is driven by its own inflation
rate and if the exchange rate between two countries is driven by the difference in their inflation rates,


                                                                                                          17
then gold will only reliably be a hedge of the foreign exchange rate if one of the two countries always
has an inflation rate equal to zero.26

A second way to interpret the “gold as a currency hedge” argument sees “gold as a hedge of my own
currency, spent in my own country, when the local government is printing money with abandon”. This is
also sometimes referred to as “currency debasement”. If this debasement is a result of inflation, then
this interpretation is just another version of the “gold as an inflation hedge” argument.

Exhibit 11 highlights the historical gold betas of seven currencies (the Australian dollar, the Canadian
dollar, the Bloomberg estimated Deutsche mark, the Japanese yen, the New Zealand dollar, the Swiss
franc and the British pound). These gold betas are the result of regressing the monthly changes in the
exchange rate (foreign units per dollar) on the monthly change in the price of gold. There are three
things to notice. First, all of the coefficients are negative, which is the correct sign for a U.S. dollar
investor who presumes that gold is a currency hedge. For example, if the U.S. dollar price of gold
increased by 10%, the yen/dollar beta says that the yen appreciated on average about 1.4% (or
alternatively that the dollar on average depreciated about 1.4%).27 Second, the average coefficient is
small, about -0.15 across the seven currency pairs. The average beta coefficient is significantly different
from zero but also significantly different from -1.0. Technically these small average gold betas are driven
by low gold-currency return correlations and by the fact that the currency return standard deviations
are about one-half the size of the gold return standard deviation. Third, if gold was a good currency
hedge the statistical fingerprint of this belief should be supported by high regression R2s. However, for
this universe of currencies, there seems to be little connection between currency returns and gold
returns. Additionally, from a broad perspective the “gold up-currency down” idea sometimes misfires.
From 1975 to the present the U.S. dollar price of gold rose and the U.S. dollar depreciated against the
Japanese yen. However, the Japanese yen price of gold rose and the Japanese yen appreciated against
the U.S. dollar.




26
   Given this framework, say the inflation rate in country A is IA and the inflation rate in country B is IB. Then, if by
assumption inflation differences drive currency moves, the assumed change in the currency exchange rate will be
IA-IB and the nominal gold price appreciation in country A will be I A. If IA is greater than IB then this means that more
of currency A is needed to buy one unit of currency B. This means that the change in the exchange rate will equal
the change in the price of gold when: IA=IA-IB. This will occur when IB equals zero.
27
   From a U.S. perspective, the Japanese yen is quoted in terms of the number of yen in a U.S. dollar. If the yen-
dollar exchange rate starts at 100 and falls to 98.6 then the yen has appreciated by 1.4% and the dollar has
depreciated by 1.4% (absent any important Siegel’s paradox effect).

Exhibit 12 shows how the local currency real price of gold has fluctuated in a number of countries:
Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, Switzerland, the U.K. and the U.S. In each case the
local currency price of gold is divided by a local inflation index28 and the resulting ratio is normalized to
an initial value of 1.0. The message of Exhibit 12 is that since 1975 the real price of gold in these eight
countries seems to have moved largely in tandem.29 Erb and Harvey (2012a) look at a broader universe
of 23 developed and emerging countries and find that the real price of gold rises and fall at the same
time. The real price of gold reached a high level in 1980 amongst all eight countries. The real price of
gold fell to a low level in each of the eight countries in the 1990s, and more recently the real price of
gold has risen to very high levels in all eight countries. The historical evidence of a seemingly common
local currency movement in the real price of gold does not lend itself to a convenient “gold as a currency
hedge” explanation. In fact, the change in the real price of gold seems to be largely independent of the
change in currency values. Furthermore, since the real price of gold seems to move in unison across
currency perspectives, it is unlikely that currency movements help in explaining why the real price of
gold fluctuates.

and Pound.

Is gold a currency hedge? It appears the answer is no. Do currency returns help explain movements in
the real price of gold? No.




3. Gold as an alternative to assets with low real returns

The “gold as an alternative to other assets with low real returns” is a competing assets argument. The
most frequent manifestation of this story is “the price of gold rose because nominal, or real, interest
rates fell” argument.30 DeLong (2011), Elfenbein (2012), Barsky and Summers (1988) and Krugman
(2011) look to Keynes’ (1930) Gibson’s Paradox for a link between the price of gold and interest rates.

Exhibit 13 illustrates the historical relationship between the real price of gold in U.S. dollars (using the
observations from Exhibit 2) and the real yield of a generic 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected Security
(TIPS). Month-end observations from the inception of TIPS trading in 1997 to the present are used.
Superficially, the message of Exhibit 13 seems to be fairly obvious. When real interest rates are high, as

                                                                                                               20
they were during the late 1990s introduction of TIPS in the U.S., the real price of gold was low. Now that
the real yield on a 10-year TIPS is low (close to zero) the real gold price is high. The correlation between
ten year TIPS real yields and the real price of gold is -0.82. Is it possible to disagree with the view that
low real yields caused the real price of gold to be high? Yes.

Exhibit 13 illustrates what seems to be a compelling pattern. An obvious question is how robust the
correlation between real yields and the real price of gold might be to alternative perspectives. Does the
finding hold up if a longer time period is examined? When looking at a longer data sample from the U.K.,
the correlation between real yields and the real price of gold falls to -0.31.31 A “glass half full”
interpretation of this means that real yields explained 9% of the variation in the U.K. real price of gold
and a “glass half empty” interpretation means that real yields explained very little of the variation in the
U.K. real price of gold.

Returning to the U.S. experience over the past 15 years, the historical correlation between real yields
and a time trend is about -0.90 and the correlation between the real price of gold and a time trend was
about 0.87. The highly positive correlation between the real price of gold and a time trend suggests that
the real price of gold increases with the passage of time, without limit. A challenge with the time trend
story is that, even though it “fits” the data better than the real yield story, the possibility of an infinite
real price of gold is hard to grasp. Rather than focusing on fragile correlations perhaps a closer look at
the real yield-real price of gold story might help.

  Exhibit 13 covers 15 years, the years since the inception of trading in inflation protected fixed income in the U.S.
Using U.K. data (where inflation linked bonds started trading in the early 1980s), the correlation between the real
yield of the Barclays U.K. Government Inflation-Linked bond index and the U.K. real price of gold is -0.31

                                                                                                                   21
There are a number of stories suggesting a connection between the real price of gold and the level of
interest rates: the central bank gold leasing story, the low opportunity cost story and the Gibson
paradox story. Each of the stories has an air of plausibility.

Historically, some central banks “leased” part of their gold reserves.32 Working with “bullion banks”,
gold leasing allowed central banks to turn part of their gold holdings into interest earning assets. To
some, such as the Gold Anti-Trust Action Committee,33 the pursuit of gold leasing looked like central
banks were actively trying to suppress the price of gold by effectively selling gold. It is certainly possible
that as interest rates fall gold leasing becomes less attractive for a central bank. The gold leasing story
basically comes down to saying that as interest rates fall, less gold is “sold” (leased). Central banks,
though, have little reason to publicly disclose their gold leasing activities. In fact, International Monetary
Fund (1999) accounting rules (1999) state that a central bank gold lease does not result in a “statistical”
change of ownership and that a gold lease is similar to a repurchase agreement (repo). So in the absence
of hard data on the amount of gold leasing, assessing the marginal impact of central bank gold leasing
on the real price of gold is like searching for a black cat in a dark room and not knowing which room to
look in.

DeLong (2011) expresses the “opportunity cost” view by pointing out that “gold…is…expensive to hold in
your portfolio when real interest rates are high, and cheap to hold it in your portfolio when real interest
rates are low”. This is somewhat different from the gold leasing story. This story suggests that an
investor should be more inclined to buy gold as the level of interest rates fall. But why? If the real price
of gold is constant then it is easy to map out the interest rate determined cost of owning gold. If the real
price of gold fluctuates then the exercise becomes more challenging. Exhibit 13 illustrates a correlation
between the real price of gold and real interest rates. Yet Exhibit 5 shows a historical propensity for low
real gold returns to follow high real gold prices. Asness (2002) argued that the popularity of the “Fed
model” illustrated how a compelling story empowered investors to set stock market price earnings
ratios using nominal, rather than real, interest rates. To Asness, these investors suffered from money
illusion. It is entirely possible that the “opportunity cost” view is to investing in gold what the “Fed
model” is to investing in stocks: an entertaining and compelling story that seems to be out of synch with
future real returns.

Yet another “Fed model”-type story is Gibson’s paradox. Gibson’s paradox is an observation that during
the gold standard years 1821-1913 in the United Kingdom, nominal interest rates were positively
correlated with the aggregate price level (rather than the inflation rate). Barsky and Summers (1988)
interpret this to mean that under a gold standard “the price level is the reciprocal of the real price of
gold”. Keynes (1930) referred to Gibson’s paradox as “one of the most completely established facts in
the whole field of quantitative economics”. There are at least two challenges with applying Gibson’s
paradox to the current world of fiat money. First, Gibson’s paradox is an explanation of how the real

32
   The history of gold leasing is explained in Szabo (2007).
33
   The Gold Anti-Trust Action Committee (GATA) points out that it was “organized in 1998 to expose, oppose and
litigate against collusion to control the price and supply of gold and related instruments”.

                                                                                                                 22
price of gold fluctuates under a gold standard when the nominal price of gold is a constant. It is not a
model of the behavior of the real price of gold under a fiat money regime. Second, Barsky and Summers
find no evidence of Gibson’s paradox under a fiat money regime.

For investors who want to believe that interest rates drive the real price of gold, the good news is that
they can cherry-pick the story that most appeals to their sensibilities. However investors are still left
with the unappetizing fact that a time trend seems to explain the real price of gold more than these
stories.

It is important to avoid the “correlation implies causation” trap. The negative TIPS real yield-gold real
price correlation of -0.82 is a measure of the linear correlation of real yields with real gold prices. While
it is possible to argue that historical data suggest that low real yields “cause” high real gold prices
(Gibson’s paradox), it is equally possible to argue that causality runs in the other direction and that high
real gold prices actually “cause” low real yields. Alternatively, it is possible that both low real yields and
high real gold prices are driven by some other influence, such as a possibly immeasurable fear of
hyperinflation.34

Does the competing assets argument “explain” the nominal price of gold? No. Does the competing
assets argument “explain” the real price of gold? No.



4. The “gold as a safe haven/tail risk insurance” argument

The safe haven/tail protect argument has already appeared three times. First, it is possible that gold
does not hedge day-to-day inflation surprises but provides some protection in a hyperinflationary
environment. Second, gold may not provide very effective hedging for currencies in usual circumstances
but might provide some protection in situations of significant debasement – such as one associated with
hyperinflations. Third, the negative correlation between real gold prices and real interest rates may be
driven by the fear of a large negative macro event – such as hyperinflation.

4.1 The Safe Haven
There is no formal definition of what makes an asset a safe haven asset. However, it should hopefully be
possible to list at least two characteristics that a safe haven asset might have. One characteristic might
be that a safe haven asset should have a stable value during “times of stress”. Of course, there is no
simple definition of “a time of stress”. Baur and Lucey (2010) offered the suggestion that gold is a safe
haven from losses in financial markets. Specifically they proposed that gold does well during periods of
negative stock market returns. Another characteristic might be that a safe haven asset is something that
can be accessed during times of stress. These two conditions provide ways to think about the “gold as a
safe haven” argument: that if gold is a safe haven then its value should be stable when other asset
markets falter and that gold’s stable value should be dependably accessible during times of stress. A

34
  It is possible that the correlation between real gold returns and ten year real yields was a data-mined, after-the-
fact, spurious correlation, such as Leinweber’s (2007) finding that butter production in Bangladesh historically
“explained” 75% of the variation in the S&P 500.

                                                                                                                  23
final thought suggests that a safe haven should be liquid; something that investors believe can be
bought or sold anytime without impacting the price of the safe haven asset.

First, let’s examine the safe haven with respect to financial stress. Exhibit 14 shows the joint distribution
of U.S. stock and gold returns. How does gold hold up in Quadrant 3 (negative equity returns matched
with negative gold returns)? The simple safe haven test states that there should be very few
observations in Quadrant 3. In fact, 17% of the monthly stock and gold return observations fall in
Quadrant 3. This suggests that gold may not be a reliable safe haven asset during periods of financial
market stress. Exhibit 14 illustrates that nominal gold returns have historically had a low correlation with
nominal U.S. equity market returns. Interestingly, depending upon how one defines a “safe haven”, a
good portfolio diversifier may not be a “safe haven” asset.

A possible second condition for a safe haven is that during times of stress it should be possible to access
the safe haven asset. Consider the famous Hoxne Hoard which is currently on display at the British
Museum. The Hoxne Hoard is an example of what can happen when trying to make a safe haven
investment. The Hoxne Hoard is the largest collection of Roman gold and silver coins discovered in
England. Evidence suggests that the hoard was buried sometime after 400 A.D. by a wealthy family
seeking a safe haven for some of its wealth.35 The 5th century A.D. was a time of great social stress and
political turmoil in England as the Western Roman Empire unraveled.36 The fact that the hoard was
discovered in 1992 means that the family failed to reclaim its safe haven wealth. Indeed, the Hoxne
Hoard is an example of an “unsafe haven”.

35
     There is no record of the fate of the owner of the Hoxne Hoard.
36
     See William of Malmesbury (1847, p.6).

                                                                                                                             24
Gundlach37 astutely pointed out that the weight of gold limits its portability, both during normal times
and during times of stress. Thinking in terms of a market-value-relative-to-weight ratio,38 he observed
that many precious gems are a more efficient store of flight capital than gold. Gold is viewed by many as
being durable and largely imperishable, characteristics which make gold its own safe haven against the
ravages of the world. It is not necessarily a safe haven for the owner of gold. As Faber39 once put it,
"When Timur sacked Aleppo and Damascus in 1400, it didn't help to have your savings in gold. You lost
your life and your gold."



4.2 Tail Risk and Hyperinflation
Does gold provide some protection from tail risk?40 Montier (2011) notes that there is no clear cut
definition of tail risk: it is important to define what specific risk one is concerned about and to take a
stab at defining what tail risk means in the context of that risk. Given Montier’s observation, it is
possible to define inflation risk as the risk of unexpected inflation and inflation tail risk as the risk of
hyperinflation.

For some proponents of gold investment, the hyperinflation of the Weimar Republic stands as an
electrifying example of the risks of a fiat currency regime. The hyperinflation of the Weimar Republic
during the years 1922 and 1923 is an example of a possible endgame for a country that spends much
more than it earns. The German mark-U.S. (gold) dollar exchange rate rose from 430 in 1922 to about
433,000,000,000 by 1924. If such a hyperinflation unfolded in the U.S. today, if gold moved exactly in
line with the inflation rate and if the real price of gold was unchanged, then the price of gold would
exceed $1.68 trillion an ounce.

So, does the price of gold provide hyperinflationary tail risk protection? Is gold a hyperinflationary
talisman? Not surprisingly, the answer to a large degree depends on how the question is asked and the
specific scenario that unfolds. It is perhaps instructive to think about how an absolutely clairvoyant
investor might assess the ability of gold to provide a hyperinflation hedge. It is also useful to be aware of
the historical frequency and magnitude of hyperinflationary episodes.

Imagine a Brazilian investor in 1980 who possessed perfect foresight of how Brazilian inflation would
unfold between 1980 and 2000. Exhibit 15 shows that from 1980 to 2000 Brazil had an average annual
inflation rate of about 250%, the currency was renamed and devalued numerous times, and the nominal
price of gold rose substantially in Brazilian currency terms. Yet, using the IMF’s measure of Brazilian
inflation, the real price of gold fell by about 70% between 1980 and 2000. This means, broadly and

37
   See Or and Phillips (2011). At the current price of $1,600 per ounce, $5 million dollars weighs 215 lbs.
38
   Somewhat like a “flight capital” Sharpe ratio.
39
   See Ash (2009) for Faber’s comment. Polleschi (2012) tells of a recent instance in which an Italian businessman
and his daughter were caught trying to smuggle 50 kilograms (110 pounds) of gold into Switzerland in what was
supposed to be a hidden compartment in his car. This highlights that it is important to have an effective way to get
one’s gold across “the border”. Some may be successful in getting their gold across “the border” by asking others
to help transport a cache of gold.
40
   See World Gold Council (2010).

                                                                                                                 25
illustratively speaking, that by the year 2000, an ounce of gold had 30% of its 1980 inflation adjusted
purchasing power. This is similar to the real price decline of gold faced by a U.S. investor during the
same time period.

So, if purchasing power declined 70%, was gold a successful Brazilian hyperinflation hedge? It depends
on one’s perspective. Compared to an expectation that gold would move one-for-one with the Brazilian
price level then gold was not a successful hyperinflation hedge between 1980 and 2000. However,
investors keeping cash-in-a-mattress or investing in a portfolio of Brazilian nominal bonds probably lost
most of their real value from 1980 to 2000. Compared to a close to 100% decline in real value for cash
and nominal bonds the 70% decline in the real value of gold was a great alternative. A key takeaway
from Exhibit 15 is that even though countries, such as the U.S. or Brazil, may experience very different
inflation experiences their real gold return experiences will probably be similar and there is no reason to
expect that the real gold return will be positive when a specific country experiences hyperinflation.

Exhibit 16 provides a list of 56 major and minor country hyperinflationary experiences catalogued by
Hanke and Krus (2012). Earlier research by Bernholz (2006) and McGuire (2010) mentions about 30
cases of hyperinflation. Hanke and Krus identify multiple bouts of hyperinflation in a country where
Bernholz and McGuire primarily focus on broader start and endpoints. Hanke and Krus, Bernholz and
McGuire follow the lead of Cagan (1956) in defining hyperinflation as a situation in which a country
experiences a monthly inflation rate greater than 50% (an annualized rate of about 13,000%). Within
each country’s hyperinflation experience, Hanke and Krus identify the highest monthly inflation rate, the
equivalent daily inflation rate during the month of the highest inflation rate and the required time for
prices to double at the rate of the highest monthly inflation rate. Hungary experienced a highest daily
inflation rate of 207% and Zimbabwean daily inflation soared as high as 98%. Excluding the French
mandats and assignats issued during the French Revolution in the 1790s, all of the reported instances of
hyperinflation have occurred since 1900 – during the era of fiat currency regimes. A key question for
investors is: is it possible to estimate the probability of hyperinflation under a fiat currency regime?
There is obviously no easy way to answer this question but looking at history can be somewhat
illuminating. It is also worth reemphasizing that even if one has a firm grasp on the probability of
hyperinflation in a country that says nothing about whether or not the real price of gold will maintain its
purchasing power during the hyperinflationary experience.

Note: Data from Hanke and Krus (2012), Bernholz (2006) and McGuire (2010). These sources use a definition from
Cagan (1956) that says hyperinflation exists when a country's monthly inflation rate exceeds 50%.

What broad observations arise from Exhibit 16? First, most of the countries listed could be described as
minor, not major, countries. This does not mean that hyperinflation is more likely in a minor country

                                                                                                                27
than a major country since there are many more minor countries than there are major countries. It is
hard to embrace the idea that a country could never experience a hyperinflationary episode, but
accepting the possibility of a non-zero probability of hyperinflation is not the same thing as estimating a
specific probability of hyperinflation. Second, many of the hyperinflationary situations seem to occur
after stressful times in a country such as losing a war (Germany and Austria following World War I) or a
significant change in the way that a society is governed. Third, many investors are concerned about high
inflation -- and hyperinflation (at least 13,000% annualized inflation) is simply an extreme version of high
inflation. According to Exhibit 16 Brazil had two hyperinflationary years, 1989 and 1990, yet during the
two decades from 1980 to 2000, Brazil experienced many years of high inflation. And finally, even if the
real purchasing power of gold rose in each of the historical instances of hyperinflation, it would be hard
to figure out why that fortunate circumstance would hold in the future.



5. The “de facto gold standard/gold is money” argument

The Chief Executive Officer of Barrick, the world’s largest gold miner, once announced that gold is the
“default global currency”.41 In an overly literal sense, in a world in which no country has been on the
gold standard since the Swiss ended convertibility in 2000, gold is not an “official” default currency.42
One characteristic of an official currency is that it is possible to pay taxes and purchase goods and
services with the official currency. For most people, it is probably difficult, for instance, to pay income
taxes with bars of gold or to get a soft drink from a vending machine with a quarter grain of gold.43

While it is possible to debate whether or not the world is on a “de facto gold standard” it seems likely
that this insight is basically another version of the “gold as an inflation hedge” argument. If the “de facto
gold standard” argument is just another version of the “gold as an inflation hedge” argument, and if the
“gold as an inflation hedge” argument provided no explanation for the high real price of gold, then it is
reasonable that the “de facto gold standard” argument does little to explain variation in the real price of
gold.

Why is no country on the gold standard? Some of the supposed possible benefits of a gold standard are:
“life without inflation, an end to the business cycle, rational economic calculation in accounting and
international trade, an encouragement to savings, and a dethroning of the government-connected
financial elite” (see Rockwell, 2002). Others such as DeLong (1996) highlight a belief that a gold standard
would result in loss of “normal” monetary policy options (such as the possible Phillips curve trade-off
between inflation and employment and impart a recessionary and deflationary bias to countries with
balance of payments deficits). This line of thought relates to the work of Eichengreen and Temin (2010)
who note that during the Great Depression those countries that abandoned the gold standard earliest
suffered the least economic harm. One view of the “de facto gold standard” argument is that the gold

   See Regent (2011).

   See Roth (1999).
43
   Gold ATMs are available in a number of cities such as Boca Raton, FL. Some dispense gold coins and others
dispense small gold bars.

                                                                                                          28
standard is the worst form of currency except for all those other forms that have been tried from time
to time.44

If a gold standard exists then gold is money, but the “gold is money” argument does not require the
existence of a gold standard. The “gold is money” argument is essentially another way of stating the
“constant price when measured in gold” argument. For instance, investors Brodsky and Quaintance
(2009) and hedge fund manager Dalio (2012) have argued that “gold is money” without arguing that the
world is on a de facto gold standard. For Brodsky and Quaintance (2011), the “shadow price of gold”, the
price they believe gold should trade for, is equal to the amount of the U.S. monetary base divided by the
official gold holdings of the U.S. Given a monetary base of $2.7 trillion and official U.S. gold holdings of
8,300 metric tons this yields a “shadow gold price” of about $10,000 an ounce. Similarly, Dalio45 thinks
that “the price of gold approximates the total amount of money in circulation divided by the size of the
gold stock.”46

The “shadow price of gold”, “gold is money”, argument is an intriguing concept. The “gold is money”
argument is influenced by Friedman’s assertion that “inflation is always and everywhere a monetary
phenomenon”. As a result the “gold is money” argument is essentially a restatement of the “gold as an
inflation hedge” argument, and it should not be expected to more successfully explain the variation in
the real price of gold. However, the “gold is money”, “shadow price of gold” argument yields a fairly
specific prediction: a view of where the price of gold should be if the world actually accepted this
specific view. From a U.S. standpoint, all that is needed to know where the price of gold is headed is a
sense of the size of official U.S. gold holdings and the size of the U.S. “money supply”.

Exhibit 17 shows a time series of official U.S. gold holdings since 1870. Official gold holdings peaked at
about 20,000 metric tons following implementation of President Roosevelt’s Executive Order 6102,
which outlawed the private ownership of gold in the U.S.47 Official gold holdings entered a period of
decline during the Eisenhower administration that continued until 1971, when President Nixon officially
took the U.S. off the gold standard.48 Since that time, the official gold holdings of the U.S. have been
slightly greater than 8,000 metric tons.

   Signed April 5, 1933. The order was posted with the preamble “All persons are required to deliver ON OR
BEFORE MAY 1, 1933 all GOLD COIN, GOLD BULLION, AND GOLD CERTIFICATES now owned by them to a Federal
Reserve Bank, branch or agency, or to any member bank of the Federal Reserve System.” The notice (signed by the
Secretary of Treasury) also detailed the criminal penalties for violating the order “$10,000 fine or 10 years
imprisonment, or both”. The Secretary of the Treasury, William H. Woodin, was a coin collector, and inserted an
exception in Section 2 of the Order to exempt “gold coins having a recognized special value to collectors of rare
and usual coins”. Note that the $10,000 fine was very punitive. Using the ratio of 2011 and 1933 per capita
nominal GDPs, the fine is equivalent to $1.1 million in today’s terms.

The “shadow price of gold” is simply the “money supply” divided by the official gold holdings of the U.S.
There is, of course, some ambiguity as to which definition of the money supply to use. The Federal
Reserve currently publishes three versions of the “money supply”: the monetary base, M1 and M2.
Furthermore, the Federal Reserve once published an M3 money supply number, but M3 was
discontinued in 2006. Using the monetary base as the money supply value with which to calculate the
“shadow price of gold” yields a current gold price target of about $10,000 an ounce. Using M1 as the
money supply value with which to calculate the “shadow price of gold” yields a current gold price target
of about $8,000 an ounce. Using M2 as the money supply value with which to calculate the “shadow
price of gold” yields a current gold price target of about $37,000 an ounce.

These “shadow prices of gold” may seem alarming since each of the “shadow prices” is much higher
than the current price of gold. Additionally, part of the “shadow price of gold” argument is that the
higher the “shadow price of gold” is relative to the market price of gold the greater the latent
inflationary pressures faced by the U.S.

There are a few obvious challenges with this line of reasoning. First, in the U.S. there has been an
abundance of research that finds little evidence of a link between money supply growth rates and



determined to be in the interest of monetary stability and in the best interests of the United States.” See Nixon
(1971). Note this was not an Executive Order. Executive Order 11615 signed on August 15, 1971 dealt with wage
and price controls. Proclamation 4074 on August 15, 1971 dealt with tariffs. Ironically, Proclamation 4071 on
August 2, 1971 established “National Clown Week”.

                                                                                                              30
inflation rates.49 Second, why just focus on the U.S.? The U.S. official holdings are only about 5% of the
world gold supply. In summary, the shadow price of gold is an engaging concept but because it relies
upon a vague model (the theory of exchange) and poorly defined monetary aggregates; it does not help
us understand the underlying dynamics of the gold price.



6. The “gold is underowned” argument

Of the six arguments to own gold, the “gold is underowned” argument offers probably the best way to
understand why the real price of gold might vary. In order to explore the nuances of the “gold is
underowned” argument, it is important to address a number of subsidiary issues: how much gold exists,
who owns the gold, and have demand trends changed over time. Of course the “gold is underowned”
argument is somewhat ambiguous since all of the gold in the world is currently owned by someone. 50 In
its simplest version, the “gold is underowned” argument asserts that not enough people own gold, that
maybe everyone should own some gold and the move towards universal gold ownership should cause
the nominal and real prices of gold to skyrocket.

6.1 The stock of gold
How much gold is there? Gold exists both above and below the ground. Above ground gold is gold that
has already been mined. Below ground gold is gold ore that has yet to be mined. No one knows exactly
how much above ground gold exists. The World Gold Council (2012) estimates that 171,300 metric tons
of gold have been mined since the beginning of civilization. The World Gold Council estimate provides a
convenient anchor for measuring the number of tons of gold but given the Herculean task of
enumerating gold holdings “since the beginning of civilization” the actual, unknown, number could be
much lower or higher. Buffett (2011) points out that 171,300 metric tons of gold would create a cube
measuring 67 feet on each side. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS, 2011) suggests that there might be
51,000 metric tons of “below ground” gold reserves that could be mined in the future. If the USGS
estimate is correct then over 76% of the world’s actual and potential gold has already been mined. This
balance of already-mined-gold relative to yet-to-be-mined-gold once prompted the CEO of Barrick Gold
to speculate about the possibility of entering a period of “peak gold”.51 The estimate of below ground
gold reserves is more uncertain than the estimate of above ground already mined gold. The USGS
reserve estimate is a best efforts estimate of how much gold might be mined in the future given existing
technology.52




49
   Anderson et al. (2003) noted “it is commonplace today for monetary policy analysis, both in theory and practice,
to be conducted without reference to the monetary base or other monetary aggregates”.
50
   See Madura (2011).
51
   See Evans-Pritchard (2009). The fact that a CEO of the world’s largest gold mining company once referred to
“peak gold” does nothing to demonstrate the existence of “peak gold”. It is simply an observation that a CEO used
a colorful metaphor to illustrate his personal view that the supply of gold was likely to be constrained in the future.
52
   Gold mining company Barrick reported 2011 cash gold mining costs of $460/ounce and expects 2012 cash gold
mining costs in the range of $520-560/ounce (http://www.barrick.com/company/profile/default.aspx).

                                                                                                                    31
Of course, future technological change might usher in opportunities to mine more than the 51,000
metric tons of gold reserves. For instance, there is considerable interest in near Earth asteroids given an
important study by Brenan and McDonough (2009) that argues that much of the Earth’s precious metals
are a result of asteroid collisions. The near-Earth asteroid 433 Eros might contain up to 125,000 metric
tons of gold.53 The website asterank.com catalogues 580,000 asteroids in our solar system and provides
estimates of both the mineral value and the estimated profit from harvesting. There are currently 15
near-Earth asteroids with expected profit greater than $1 trillion according to the website. Closer to
home, perhaps someday in the future someone will figure out how to implement Nobel prize winner
Fritz Haber’s plan to electrochemically recover some of the estimated 8 million tons of gold in the
world’s oceans.54

The USGS keeps track of estimated annual global gold mine production. Exhibit 18 presents the USGS
gold mine production time series, which starts with the year 1900. Annual global mine production has
averaged about 2,500 tons per year for the last few years. In 1900, about 30,000 metric tons of gold had
already been mined. This means that over 80% of the current above ground supply of gold has been
mined since 1900 and that the above ground stock of gold has increased by about 1.5% per annum. If
global production of gold continues at a rate of 2,500 metric tons a year, and if the USGS is correct in its
estimate that there are only 51,000 metric tons of exploitable gold reserves, then gold production will
be exhausted in about 20 years.

6.2 Demand and supply
The World Gold Council tracks annual demand for gold from the jewelry, investment (central bank and
private investment) and technology (fabrication) sectors. Exhibit 19 provides a sense of how the demand
for gold from these sectors has varied since 2001. As the price of gold per ounce rose from $279 in 2001
to $1,567 in 2011, the annual demand from the jewelry sector declined from 3,009 metric tons in 2001
to 1,963 metric tons in 2011, annual demand from the investment sector rose from 357 metric tons to
1,641 metric tons and annual demand from the technology sector barely changed going from 363 metric
tons to 464 metric tons. On average gold mine production was about 2,500 metric tons per year. The
difference between production and demand was made up from scrap, sourced primarily from the
jewelry and technology sectors.

Exhibit 19 also provides a rough approximation of the price elasticity of demand for gold. This measures
the percentage change in demand for gold in response to a 1% change in the price of gold. The estimate
of jewelry’s price elasticity of demand is only -0.24. This means that a 10% increase in the price of gold is
associated with less than a 2.4% decrease in demand for gold. However, this is likely overstated because
we do not control for wealth increases and population changes.55 The price elasticity of investment
demand is positive and has a value of 0.98. This means that a 10% increase in the price of gold was met
with about a 9.8% increase in the investment demand for gold. The price elasticity of technology

55
  Our elasticity estimates are based on a regression of the log of a variable, such as the log of the investment
demand for gold, on the log of the gold price. Batchelor and Gulley (1995) estimate the price elasticity of demand
for gold jewelry to be between -1.0 and -0.5.

                                                                                                               33
demand was close to zero. Interestingly, both the production as well as the supply of scrap gold also is
insensitive to the price of gold.

Exhibit 20 plots investment demand, jewelry demand and technology demand relative to the U.S. dollar
price of gold over the time period 2001 to 2011. The investment demand for gold seems to rise with the
price of gold. This upward sloping investment demand is striking. While it is possible that the upward
sloping investment demand for gold is an example of a Giffen good or a Veblen good, there are two
other explanations that might be more plausible: the impact of momentum-based investors and “too
much” demand, totally divorced from a momentum motive, chasing “too little” supply.

Asness, Moskowitz and Pedersen (2012) have written extensively about the momentum effect, the
possibility of an attractive financial pay-off from buying an asset that has performed well in the past.
Research by Asness and others over the last 20 years has created an environment that is increasingly
accepting of momentum-based strategies. There are at least two ways to think about the rationale for
momentum investing: some view it as a pay-off from the slow transmission of meaningful fundamental
information in a somewhat efficient market and others view momentum as a proxy for expected returns
in an efficient market. While there is no precise estimate of how much capital has been allocated to
momentum-based strategies but it is fair to believe that there is more capital allocated to momentum
based strategies today than in the past.

A momentum investor faces an upward sloping demand curve: the higher the past return of an asset the
higher momentum investor’s demand for the asset. There is another type of momentum investor, one
who attempts to replicate the pay-off from a call option. As Perold and Sharpe (1995) show, an investor
pursuing a call option replication strategy will buy more of an asset as its price rises and sell the asset as
its price falls.


                                                                                                                      34
It is worth noting that while momentum may work for a talented portfolio manager, it is questionable
that momentum can work for most people. The U.S. residential housing “bubble” can be thought of as a
momentum-based strategy in which many people participated. For a while, there was an upward sloping
demand curve for residential housing -- the higher the average price of housing the higher the demand
for housing, but ultimately things changed. The “internet stock bubble” at the turn of the century is
another possible example of a momentum based market characterized by an upward sloping demand
curve for “internet stocks”. A key point is that while an upward sloping demand curve is inconsistent
with certain textbook microeconomic principles, it is consistent with the presence of momentum
investors.

Exhibit 21 displays the trajectory of the real price of gold and the physical gold holdings of the world’s
largest gold exchange traded fund, the SPDR Gold Trust. The SPDR Gold Trust, ticker symbol GLD, was
launched in 2004. Since then its holdings of physical gold (stored in vaults in London) have grown from
nothing to over 1,000 metric tons. GLD currently holds a little less than 1% of the world’s known supply
of above ground gold. GLD’s purchases of gold represent about 15% of the total investment demand for
gold since 2004. As we will soon see, this ETF has more gold than the official holdings of China. Exhibit
21 illustrates a rising amount of gold investment as the price of gold rises, which is consistent with an
upward sloping demand curve for gold. While momentum investing is consistent with an upward sloping
demand curve from traditional financial investors, in which a rising price leads to rising demand, it is also
possible that there has been too much “central bank momentum” gold demand, relative to supply, and
that excess demand has driven the real price of gold to historical high levels.

6.3 BRICs and gold

One possible source of “too much demand” for the price of gold might be the efforts of the Chinese
government to reduce the size of its U.S. dollar foreign exchange reserves. Exhibit 22 shows the
reported size of Chinese foreign exchange reserves since 1995 and the hypothetical number of ounces
of gold those reserves would have been worth over time. For instance in 1995, if 100% of China’s foreign
exchange reserves had been invested in gold China would have owned about 6,000 tons of gold. Using
the same sort of hypothetical framework, China’s current foreign currency reserves would “buy” about
66,000 tons of gold at current prices. This would represent about one-third of the total above ground
stock of gold.56 Of course in this hypothetical and simplified example of China pursuing an “all in” gold
allocation, the gold purchases needed to effect this foreign exchange reserve reallocation would likely
drive the price of gold higher. For a fixed amount of foreign exchange reserves, the higher the price of
gold the fewer tons of gold that must be purchased.

There is another important nuance. Given that the above ground stock of gold has recently increased
about 1-2% per annum, a move to acquire up to one-third of all the gold in the world would mean that
the current owners of gold would have to be offered a price for their gold that makes them happy to
part with their gold. Erb and Harvey (2012b) and Zhang (2012) point out that massive gold accumulation
by the Chinese will do much to increase the wealth of existing, largely non-Chinese, owners of gold. In
this sense, if there is a wealth effect, Chinese gold purchases could marginally stimulate global GDP ex-
China. It is entirely possible that the current owners of gold know nothing about the value of gold and
only the Chinese know the true value of gold. In that case the current owners of gold will one day regret
parting with the gold they sell to the Chinese. Or it could be that Chinese accumulation of gold could
ultimately resemble the attempts of the Hunt Brothers to corner the silver market in 1980.

Have the Chinese been buying gold? Exhibit 23 shows World Gold Council estimates of the central bank
gold holdings for Brazil, Russia, India and China, the BRIC countries. China’s estimated central bank gold
holdings are currently over 1,000 metric tons. There is no reason to believe that Chinese central bank
gold holdings are more accurately reported than any other Chinese government statistic. Even though
China’s gold holdings have risen sharply over the last few years, as just noted, China holds less gold than
the SPDR ETF. China’s gold holdings may still be rising.57

6.4 Central banks
Exhibit 24 provides a snapshot of estimated central bank gold holdings of 33 official entities holding
more than 100 tons of gold. Overall, the central banks of the world hold a little over 30,000 metric tons
of gold, somewhat less than 20% of the estimated above ground gold stock. The U.S., viewed by some as
a profligate debtor country, has about 8,000 tons of gold, and Switzerland, viewed by some as a model
of financial probity, has a little over 1,000 tons of gold.

  China is perceived to be the world’s largest producer of gold with possible annual gold mine output of about 350
tons in 2011. The Chinese government could conceivably increase its gold holdings by purchasing all of China’s gold
output. Is it in China’s interest to purchase gold in secret? Perhaps. It is also possible to ask what, if anything, China
might gain by disclosing the size of its gold holdings. It is hard to believe that reported Chinese government gold
holdings or Chinese gold output are reported any more reliably than other official Chinese statistics.

Exhibit 25 profiles the entities that have either purchased or disposed of the largest gold holdings since
2000. China, Russia and Saudi Arabia have been enthusiastic purchasers of gold and the Netherlands,
France and Switzerland lightened up on their gold holdings. For many years the central banks of the
Western countries viewed gold as a “barbarous relic” that cluttered up their balance sheets.58 Some
Western central banks sought to lighten up on their gold holdings but the lack of liquidity in the gold
market forced them into a series of Central Bank Gold Agreements (CBGA). The essence of the CBGAs
was that the central banks that wished to sell gold collectively agreed that they would not sell more than
some set amount of gold in any one year. Depending upon the terms of the specific CBGA, the typical
amount of sales was limited to 400 or 500 metric tons per year. The motive for limiting the number of
tons of gold sold in any one year was a belief that the gold market could not absorb more gold sales
without the price of gold falling significantly.

Just as OPEC attempts to keep oil prices as high as possible by matching supply to demand, the CBGAs
were an attempt to prevent the price of gold from collapsing by matching supply to demand. Western
country CBGA gold sales have declined substantially over the last few years as the central banks of the
Western countries have reassessed the wisdom of selling their gold holdings in an environment
characterized by rapidly rising gold prices. The CBGAs existed because large holders of gold realized that
fairly small gold sales (400 tons annually) could upset the price of gold in what supposedly is a large
market (171,300 tons). The CBGAs focused on limiting the negative price impact of “excess supply”. At

  The “barbarous relic” phrase was made popular by Keynes. To be precise, Keynes was referring to the gold
standard not gold itself: “In truth, the gold standard is already a barbarous relic”, see Keynes (1924).

and it is possible that this “excess demand” could persist well into the future.

6.4 What if emerging markets emerge?
The U.S. is the world’s largest debtor country and it has the world’s largest gold reserve. Switzerland is a
model country for financial conservatism. How might the size of BRIC gold holdings evolve over time if
they diversify their central bank holdings in a manner similar to either the U.S. or Switzerland?

Exhibit 26 examines this question by looking at two possible “keeping up with the Joneses” measures,
gold holdings relative to the size of a country’s GDP as well as relative to its population. The BRIC
countries currently hold 2,457 tons of gold. If these four countries each targeted the same ratio of gold
holdings relative to GDP as exists in the U.S. then the gold holdings of the BRIC countries would rise to
6,233. If the BRIC countries targeted the U.S. ratio of gold holdings relative to population, then the BRIC
countries would hold 77,811 tons of gold. If the BRIC countries targeted the Swiss ratio of gold holdings
relative to GDP then the BRIC countries would hold 22,191 metric tons of gold. And finally, if the BRIC
countries targeted the Swiss ratio of gold to population then the BRIC countries would own 415,812 tons
of gold. Of course, this would suggest the challenging prospect of the BRIC countries owning more than
twice the entire amount of gold in the world. Interestingly, if a country pursues a “keeping up with the
Joneses” approach to owning gold, targeted holdings based on the size of population or GDP will not be
affected by changes in the price of gold.

6.5 Gold in a diversified portfolio
There are at least two reasons one might consider gold in a diversified portfolio. First, gold has low
correlations with other tradeable assets. Exhibit 27 shows five-year rolling betas for gold against a
variety of tradeable equity and bond market factors. The gold betas with respect to the equity market
factors are never statistically different from zero when estimated over the full sample. However, the
betas vary through time. The U.S. stock market beta was -0.40 in 1992 but it is positive today at 0.16.
There are particularly wild swings in the gold beta against U.S value and size factors. Exhibit 28 considers
a variety of fixed income measures. The story is similar. The correlations of gold with respect to various
fixed income benchmarks varies considerably through time. For example, currently there is a very large
positive beta with respect to the mortgage backed portfolio. Yet for the first half of the sample, the beta
with respect to mortgages was negative. The message here is that, on average, gold has low correlations
with equity and fixed income benchmark returns. However, the correlations are unstable.

A second reason for holding gold in a diversified portfolio has to do with one of the key insights of the
Capital Asset Pricing Model: investors should hold the “market portfolio”. This is one way to think of the
“gold is under owned” argument. For instance, Exhibit 29 shows that the market value of all the stocks
in the world was recently about $48 trillion and the market value of all the bonds in the world was about
$41 trillion. This means that the “global stock and bond market” is about 54% stocks and 46% bonds.
While some individual investors may own more than 46% bonds in their portfolios and some more than
54% stocks in their portfolios, the “average investor” has a 54%/46% stock-bond mix (even if no
individual investor is an “average investor”). As a result, one portfolio asset allocation recommendation
is that, on average, an investor’s portfolio should look like “market capitalization weights” because that
is the aggregate market reality. Now for all intents and purposes, the average stock and bond investor
owns about 0% gold. In a world in which all the above ground gold is already owned, how much gold
should “market capitalization oriented stock and bond” investors own?

Depending upon how one defines the size of the gold market there are at least three “float-adjusted
market capitalization weight” answers. One way to think about the size of the gold market is to think
about the value of all the gold in the world (about $9 trillion). Another is to think about the gold just
held by central banks and other investors (about $3.5 trillion) and yet another way is to think about the
gold held by “investors” only (about $1.8 trillion).

Roll (1977) points out that it is easier to invoke the phrase “market portfolio” than it is to get agreement
on how to define and measure the “market portfolio”. Exhibit 29 shows that if the “gold market” is
taken to be the non-central bank investment amount then this would represent about 2% of the total
market capitalization of a narrowly defined “market portfolio” consisting of stocks, bonds and gold.
There is good news and bad news in this measure that highlights some of the challenges of creating
macro-consistent portfolio allocations. The good news is that the 2% represents already existing
investment by what the World Gold Council calls investors, so it is possible to think in an abstract way
that the world already follows a 53%/45%/2% stock/bond/gold allocation model. If this is the case then
“investors” already own all the gold they need. The bad news is that the idea that investors in aggregate
already have a “market allocation” to gold probably seems odd to those who argue that gold is
“underowned”, such as Ray Dalio.

There are most likely very few pension plans, defined contribution plans or stock and bond investors
pursuing what in aggregate looks like a 53%/45%/2% stock/bond/gold allocation. If these
“underallocated” investors were to invest in gold they might use Exhibit 29 as a guide in moving to a 2%
allocation to gold. Yet, if the data from the World Gold Council are to be trusted, other investors have
already laid claim to this gold. Given the small size of the gold market relative to the stock and bond
markets, this 2% portfolio allocation to gold would represent 19% of the gold market, or about 30,000
metric tons of gold. Given the illiquidity of the gold market indicated by the existence of the Central
Bank Gold Agreements and a seeming positive elasticity of investment demand, a broad-based move by
“underallocated” investors to a 2% portfolio allocation to gold would probably result in much higher
nominal gold prices. What would happen if the price of gold doubled and the value of the stock and
bond markets stayed the same? Gold’s target portfolio weight would rise to about 4% and the target
number of tons of gold to own would be unchanged. What would happen if the price of gold fell by

                                                                                                         42
50%? Gold’s target weight would decline to about 1% and the target number of tons of gold to own
would be unchanged. Finally, if a 2% allocation were pursued by buying no more than 400 tons of gold
per year it would take in excess of 70 years to complete the 2% allocation.

The “gold is underowned” argument has probably been an important driver of the increase in the real
price of gold. A rising level of gold investment by emerging market central banks in an illiquid gold
market could lead to a rising real price of gold. A rising level of “keeping up with the Joneses” motivated
gold purchases could lead to a rising real price of gold. The rising real price of gold could act as a signal
to momentum based investors to allocate capital to gold. As long as some central banks are insensitive
to the real price they pay for gold the possible move into gold could drive the real price of gold much
higher.



7. Conclusions

Investing in gold is potentially a way to maintain purchasing power. The purchasing power of gold rises
and falls as the real price of gold rises and falls. Investing in gold entails a bet as to the future real price
of gold, whether or not an investor even thinks about the bet. It is a fact that the real price of gold is
very high compared to historical standards. A number of reasons have been advanced to explain the
current real price of gold – some of these stories argue the real price of gold is too high and others
suggest the real price could go even higher. The goal of this paper is to analyze these competing
narratives.


                                                                                                               43
We find little evidence that gold has been an effective hedge against unexpected inflation whether
measured in the short term or the long term. The gold as a currency hedge argument does not seem to
be supported by the data. The fluctuations in the real price of gold are much greater than FX changes.
We suggest that the argument that gold is attractive when real returns on other assets are low is
problematic. Low real yields, say on TIPS, do not mechanically cause the real price of gold to be high.
While there is possibly some rational or behavioral economic force, perhaps a fear of inflation,
influencing variation in both TIPS yields and the real price of gold, the impact may be more statistically
apparent than real. We also parse the safe haven argument and come up empty-handed. We examine
data on hyperinflations in both major and minor countries and find it is certainly possible for the
purchasing power of gold to decline substantially during a highly inflationary period. When the price of
gold is high in one country it is probably high in other countries. Keynes pointed out “that the long run
is a misleading guide to current affairs”. Even if gold is a “golden constant” in the long run, it does not
have to be a “golden constant” in the short run. Conversely, current affairs are possibly a misleading
guide to the long run.

We analyze the demand for and the supply of gold in search of “new era” explanations for the current
and future real price of gold. The USGS estimates that using current technology only 20 years supply of
gold exists below the ground. Indeed, gold mine output has not significantly increased even though the
price of gold has substantially appreciated over the past decade. A common commodity cliché is that
“the best cure for high prices is high prices”. Yet the deluge of price-incented-supply conjured up by this
bit of wisdom has yet to manifest itself. Interestingly, the investment demand for gold has increased
dramatically as the price of gold has gone up. A single exchange traded fund, GLD, holds more gold than
the official reserves of China. Our paper asks the question of what happens if key emerging market
countries boost their gold holdings, on both a per capita and per GDP basis, to levels that more closely
reflect the experience of more developed markets? Our calculations suggest that such a move would
exert substantial upward pressure on the nominal and real price of gold. Finally, we examine the asset
allocation problem of the average investor in a world subject to macro-consistency. The estimated value
of all the gold in the world is about 9% of today’s combined capitalization of world stock and bond
markets. If we look at investible gold, the share is about 2%. It is also a fact that very few investors hold
2% of their portfolio in gold. A widespread move to increase gold in diversified portfolios would lead to
upward pressure on the real and nominal price of gold.

In the end, investors are faced with a golden dilemma. Will history repeat itself and the real price of gold
revert to its long-term mean – consistent with a “golden constant”? Alternatively, have we entered a
new era, where it is dangerous to extrapolate from history? Those are the uncertain outcomes that gold
investors have to grapple with and the passage of time will do little to clarify which path investors
should follow.
