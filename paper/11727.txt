U.S. v. Microsoft: Did Consumers Win?

JEL No. K21, L1, L4, L6

                                           ABSTRACT

U.S. v. Microsoft and the related state suit filed in 1998 appear finally to have concluded. In a
unanimous en banc decision issued in late June 2004, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected
challenges to the remedies approved by the District Court in November 2002. The wave of follow-on
private antitrust suits filed against Microsoft also appears to be subsiding. In this paper we review
the remedies imposed in the United States, in terms of both their relationship to the violations found
and their impact on consumer welfare. We conclude that the remedies addressed the violations
ultimately found by the Court of Appeals (which were a subset of those found by the original district
court and an even smaller subset of the violations alleged, both in court and in public discourse) and
went beyond them in important ways. Thus, for those who believe that the courts were right in
finding that some of Microsoft's actions harmed competition, the constraints placed on its behavior
and the active, ongoing oversight by the Court and the plaintiffs provide useful protection against
a recurrence of such harm. For those who believe that Microsoft should not have been found liable
because of insufficient evidence of harm to consumers, the remedies may be unnecessary, but they
avoided the serious potential damage to consumer welfare that was likely to accompany the main
alternative proposals. The remedies actually imposed appear to have struck a reasonable balance
between protecting consumers against the types of actions found illegal and harming consumers by
unnecessarily restricting Microsoft's ability to compete.

I.         Introduction
           The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a unanimous en banc decision in June 2004

upholding the remedy ordered in U.S. v. Microsoft.1 A District Court has been actively

overseeing compliance with that order since May 2003.2 Several of the major derivative private

actions have either been dismissed or settled.3 It thus appears that this long conflict is nearing

an end.4 It is concluding in a way that prevents hard-core warriors on either side from claiming

victory, though some who opposed Microsoft have claimed, in effect, that victory was stolen

from them in the remedy phase of the struggle.5

           What about consumers, however, whose interests both sides claimed to be serving? As

the rhetorical dust kicked up by the Microsoft battles settles, we believe it is becoming clearer

that the end result—the violations ultimately found by the appeals court and the remedy

imposed under its guidance by the district court—is broadly consistent with basic, pro-

consumer antitrust principles. To the extent it departs from those principles, it reflects some

    Microsoft began complying with the terms of the settlement before it was entered by the courts. That process
    started in December 2001. J Colleen Kollar-Kotelly did not issue a decision on the settlement until November
    2002. In May 2003, J. Kollar-Kotelly ordered that Microsoft begin filing compliance status reports with the
    court. The first such report was due in July 2003. (Stipulation and Revised Proposed Final Judgment, U.S. v.

    with the court at three-month intervals starting in July 2003.

    Suits by Sun and AOL (which bought Netscape in 1999) have both been settled. Several other suits were brought
     by other competitors of Microsoft, including Be, Inc., which offered the Be operating system in the mid 1990s
     (case settled), and two suits by companies involved in digital media, Burst and RealNetworks (both cases still
     pending as of February 2005). In addition, dozens of class-action suits were filed alleging overcharges on
     Windows and, in some cases, Microsoft Word and Excel. Most of those suits have been dismissed or settled, but
     a handful remain pending as of February 2005.

    As we discuss further below, however, Microsoft still faces a major antitrust challenge in Europe. See the
     European Commission’s decision: Case COMP/C-3/37.792 Microsoft, Mar. 24, 2004. The Court of First
     Instance (CFI) denied Microsoft’s request to stay the remedy until the case was reviewed on the merits. (Order
     of the President of the Court of First Instance, Case T-201/04 R, December 22, 2004.) The CFI is not likely to
     reach a decision on whether to uphold or void the Commission’s decision until 2006.



                                                                                                                1
serious bumps along the procedural road and, in part as a consequence, embodies an element of

punishment for Microsoft’s perceived aggressiveness and arrogance.6 As we discuss in this

essay, the courts did find that Microsoft engaged in anticompetitive actions, but, in the absence

of any evidence that those actions actually reduced competition, the remedy imposed is well

designed to prevent similar violations without imposing potentially expensive structural

changes or substantially restricting Microsoft’s ability to compete on the merits.

           Accordingly, we argue below, if one accepts the courts’ ultimate findings of fact one

must conclude that the Microsoft remedy is likely to contribute future benefits for consumers.7

Even if one goes beyond those findings and harbors a deep and broad distrust of Microsoft, as

some observers plainly do,8 it is hard to escape the conclusion that the constraints placed on

Microsoft’s behavior and its active oversight by the parties and the District Court will benefit

consumers by reducing the likelihood of future anticompetitive behavior—even if one believes

that more severe constraints should have been imposed.

           At the other end of the spectrum, even if one believes, as we do, that Microsoft’s

conduct did not justify a finding that it had violated the Sherman Act, because there was no

credible evidence of likely consumer harm flowing from the challenged actions, 9 it is hard to

find much fault with a remedy that does not impose costly structural change or significantly

reduce Microsoft’s ability to compete on the merits—in particular, its ability to design,

develop, and market products that respond to the demands of end users and software

developers.

           Moreover, regardless of one’s views of the particular facts of this case, there can be

little doubt that this near-death experience has caused Microsoft, which unquestionably has

significant short-run market power in personal computer operating systems, to be more careful

to avoid even the appearance of anticompetitive behavior.10 As long as this increased care does

not result in competitive timidity or reduced innovation, it may make all parties better off.11

           Those observers who have complained about the remedy in this case are typically not

considering, as we are here, a but-for world in which this case was never brought. Moreover,

their primary concern seems to have been with competition in particular markets, rather than

with fidelity to general antitrust principles. That is, they have sought to use antitrust as a tool to

reshape particular market structures rather than to deter anticompetitive behavior across the

economy.12 Observing that competition in operating systems for personal computers was not as

vigorous as they would like and that some of the actions Microsoft took in the course of

maintaining its leading market position were judged to have been anticompetitive, they asked

the courts to impose drastic structural and injunctive relief designed to induce more

competition, largely by hobbling Microsoft and making some of its intellectual property

available to its rivals.13

           While it is hard to argue with the proposition that more vigorous competition in the

software business would raise welfare, all else equal, increasing competition by weakening a

                                                                                                                   3
competitor does not leave all else equal and is not likely to make consumers better off—in

general or, as we argue below, in this case. In Microsoft, in the absence of evidence that the

violations in question had actually reduced competition, the courts properly declined to take not

particularly egregious antitrust violations as a license to punish the firm in ways that would

make it a less effective competitor.

           Those who are frustrated with the result in Microsoft are thus not frustrated because the

courts stepped away from traditional antitrust standards, which are based on concern for

consumer welfare. Rather, they are frustrated because the courts refused, despite enormous

pressure, to leap forward into uncharted territory. Microsoft escaped execution, but it hardly

escaped unscathed. Accepting the original trial court’s findings of fact, this outcome—and the

appellate decisions on which it rests—is consistent with sound antitrust doctrine.

           Not only did the Microsoft litigation follow a somewhat winding path, which we

summarize below, but the conduct ultimately found illegal was not at the core of the case

originally brought or the trial actually held. Section I of this paper summarizes the evolution of

the liability side of the case from the original complaint in May 1998 to the D.C. Circuit’s

decision on liability in June 2001. Similarly, as Section II summarizes, the discussion of

remedy changed considerably along the way from the original complaint to the D.C. Circuit’s

final decision on remedy in June 2004.

           At the core of this case as originally brought was the allegation that Microsoft’s

provision of Internet browsing functionality—labeled Internet Explorer or IE—as a component

of the Windows operating system rather than as a stand-alone application constituted a tie that

was per se illegal under Section 1 of the Sherman Act. This tying claim was never proven


13
     These proposals, as well as the remedy actually ordered, are summarized below.


                                                                                                 4
although many commentators appear not to have noticed.14 Microsoft ultimately was found

liable for an apparently related violation: making it difficult for computer manufacturers who

used Windows (OEMs in the language of the case) to remove ready means of access to IE,

including its icon on the Windows desktop and its place on the Start menu. Accordingly, as

Section III describes, much of the discussion of remedies focused on whether and how

Microsoft should be ordered to modify the design of Windows. We argue that the design

change actually ordered would in fact have been appropriate even if an illegal tie had been

found. In fact, the design change ordered is what the government sought as its remedy for the

claimed illegal tying.15 More drastic design changes proposed in this case—and adopted by the

European Commission in its case against Microsoft now under appeal16—would have imposed

significant costs on consumers without any incremental competitive benefit.

           Section IV discusses the other remedy provisions and the enforcement of the entire

relief order. Section V summarizes our evaluation of the Microsoft outcome and draws a

number of related conclusions.




14
     There has been much confusion about this point in the non-specialist media. For instance, Déjà vu all over
     again, ECONOMIST, Jan. 29, 2004, asserted that “Although Microsoft was found guilty of illegally ‘tying’ its
     web-browser to Windows, and was initially ordered to be broken in two, the far more lenient settlement that was
     eventually agreed made no attempt to prevent similar tying in future.” As we discuss below, the final remedy is
     more easily understood if one is told (as readers of the ECONOMIST were not) that the trial court’s finding of
     illegal tying was vacated and remanded by the court of appeals and never retried, and the trial court’s divestiture
     order was vacated, in part, because the trial court did not hold a hearing to address remedies-specific factual
     disputes.
15
     The DOJ’s initial complaint to the District Court asked that Microsoft be enjoined from “distributing a single
     version of its operating system which includes Microsoft's browser software, unless… each OEM is permitted
     at its option to delete the software that provides the Internet Explorer icon and the other means by which
     users may readily use IE to browse the web.” (emphasis added) Department of Justice Complaint, U.S. v.

II.        Violations Alleged and Found

       A. Basic Facts17

           The central product in Microsoft was Microsoft’s Windows operating system for

personal computers.18 An operating system permits applications software, like word processors,

to control the underlying hardware through what are called APIs (Applications Program

Interfaces). APIs are interfaces that are documented so that applications can use them to request

specific services from the operating system.19 When a user instructs a word processing program

to print a document, for instance, the word processing program uses APIs to in effect pass this

instruction (including detailed formatting information) along to the operating system, which in

turn sends the printer detailed instructions specific to that printer. Operating systems for

personal computers also provide services that can be invoked directly by end-users, such as the

ability to name, copy, move, or delete files. In modern operating systems, APIs exposed by one

part of the system may be used by other parts. Thus, for instance, when a user directly instructs

Windows to rename a file, the same APIs are invoked as when the user tells an application such

as WordPerfect to rename a file.

           Interest among the public in use of the Worldwide Web increased sharply in 1993 after

a team at the University of Illinois developed the first graphical Web browser, called Mosaic,

which it licensed to several commercial software vendors. Netscape Communications, formed

17
     We only cover the more prominent accusations.
18
     An operating system is a piece of software that provides memory management services and interfaces for
     communication between applications and a computer’s hardware. Microsoft Windows, which originally shipped
     as an add-on to Microsoft’s earlier operating system, MS-DOS, has an integrated graphical user interface, so
     that users execute commands and perform functions primarily using a mouse. Since its inception, Windows has
     greatly increased in functionality; over the years Microsoft has, for instance, added support for networking
     protocols, included myriad drivers for peripheral hardware such as printers and speakers, and integrated new
     features, such as the Internet Explorer Web browser.




                                                                                                             6
in 1994, hired away most of the Mosaic developers from the University of Illinois.20 Its

Navigator browser was an instant hit as soon as it was released in late 1994. By some estimates,

it accounted for 80 percent of browser usage in 1995 and early 1996,21 and versions of

Navigator ran on several operating systems in addition to Windows. As Netscape noted in a

prospectus in the summer of 1995, however, it faced competition from several sources,

including operating system vendors, many of which were developing their own Web browsers

and planning to include them with their operating systems.22 IBM’s OS/2 Warp operating

system (then the primary competitor to Microsoft’s Windows) was among the first, with its

Web Explorer browser in the fall of 1994.23 Microsoft followed in August 1995 with Internet

Explorer included in its new Windows 95 operating system. Apple was also developing its own

Web browsing software for the Macintosh.24

            At around the same time, Sun began promoting its Java software platform. It promised

to permit programmers to write applications that would run on any computer with a “Java

Runtime Environment” or JRE,25 regardless of the computer’s operating system or

microprocessor. Java is often described as “middleware” because it works between applications

software and the operating system; applications use some of the APIs provided by the

middleware in addition to or in place of APIs provided by the operating system. Starting in

19
     We use “API” to mean only documented, “public” interfaces that are intended for use by application software
     developers. Some authors use “API” to reference any interface, including those that are private or internal and
     are not documented for use by third-party developers.

1996, Netscape distributed a JRE with Navigator.26 Microsoft also added a JRE to Windows in

1996.27

           Microsoft had worked hard to persuade applications software vendors (independent

software vendors, or ISVs in the language of the case) to write their programs to run on

Windows. Its success in this effort contributed substantially to the value of its operating system

products: consumers found them attractive in large part because they could run a large number

of useful applications. Java posed a potential threat to Microsoft because it held out the

possibility that if JREs became ubiquitous and their capabilities and performance improved

sufficiently, standard PC-style applications could be written to run on any operating system for

which a compatible JRE existed. Thus, an entrant in operating systems would not have to

attract developers to write applications for its new operating system before it had customers; it

would only have to create a JRE. Moreover, because the operating system would not have to

support applications directly, it could be much simpler than Windows (or Apple’s Mac OS) and

less costly to OEMs.

           Netscape seemed to pose a similar potential threat. During the period relevant to the

case, it was not a middleware product: it neither exposed many APIs to other applications nor

supported a robust programming language. But Navigator was widely used on Windows and

other operating systems (notably Apple’s Macintosh), and if it had both remained ubiquitous

and come to expose a sufficiently rich set of APIs, applications program writers might have


25
     A JRE consisted of a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which interpreted Java applications to run on a particular
     operating system/processor platform, and a set of “class libraries” that provided the Java equivalent of APIs.

written programs to run on Navigator rather than on Windows. Moreover, Navigator provided

wide distribution of Netscape’s JREs.28 In various interviews, Netscape’s Chief Technical

Officer boasted that Navigator and Java would relegate the role of Windows to a set of “slightly

buggy device drivers.”29

           Microsoft saw the opportunity presented by the Internet and the challenges posed by

Netscape and Java, and it responded in several ways.30 First and most important, it included a

browser that it had licensed and modified and an application exposing no significant APIs in

Windows 95 when it was released. A year later, in August 1996, Microsoft introduced IE 3, a

fully redesigned version that broke the browsing functions down into a series of software

“components.” IE 4, released in October 1997, provided additional “componentization” and,

like IE 3, offered new features and improved performance to browser users. By the time the suit

was filed, Internet Explorer generally received better reviews in the trade press than Netscape’s

Navigator did.31

           Breaking IE into components provided little direct benefit to users, but it exposed much

of the functionality in IE as APIs that other parts of the operating system and applications could


28
     At trial, Netscape’s JREs were portrayed by plaintiffs as faithful implementations of Sun’s specifications.
     However, as noted infra note 33, Netscape’s JREs ran fewer “pure” Java applications than did Microsoft’s JRE
     in tests by PC Magazine. Moreover, like Microsoft, Netscape offered its own method for calling “native” code
     and did not adopt Sun’s specification until more than a year after it was released. Even then, Netscape adopted
     Sun’s specification only for its JRE that ran on Windows, not for those that ran on other platforms.

     Netscape’s success posed a significant challenge even if Navigator did not become middleware. Netscape’s
     original business plan envisioned its browser primarily as a way of promoting sales of its Web servers. The idea
     was that by having the most popular browser, Netscape could set de facto Internet standards for new
     functionality, which its Web servers could provide, keeping Microsoft and other software vendors permanently
     in catch-up mode. Alessandra Bianchi, Should Netscape Control the Web, INC., Dec. 1996,

use to add new features. An example is the “HTML rendering engine,” the software that

interprets files in HTML format for display on monitors or in printed documents. This software

is used to display Web pages when the user is browsing the Web; it is used to display

information in the Windows Help system; and it can be used by any application to display an

HTML file, whether it is on the Web or the user’s hard disk.

       Second, Microsoft actively promoted Internet Explorer. It included IE in Windows,

including updated versions (IE 2, 3, and 4), which were incorporated into “service releases” of

Windows 95 that were distributed to OEMs. IE 4 was an integral part of Windows 98. Thus,

Microsoft licensed this product in its entirety and did not allow OEMs to disassemble or

modify its software by removing IE or hiding IE from users. Microsoft also prevented OEMs

from displaying other browsers and folders in a manner different and more prominent than IE

was displayed. (Some computer makers did distribute Netscape Navigator as well as IE.)

       Microsoft also provided IE and related software for free to Internet access providers

(IAPs), offered some of them a bounty for each customer signed up that used IE, and provided

some IAPs (most importantly, AOL) with free distribution of Windows in exchange for the

IAPs’ agreement to not promote competing browsers to subscribers and to limit shipments of

non-Microsoft browsers to subscribers who requested them.32 Microsoft similarly offered free

software that let IAPs and corporations manage and customize IE. It also provided inducements

to some Web site developers (Internet content providers or ICPs in the language of the case) to

distribute and promote IE rather than competing browsers.

       Finally, Microsoft added some Windows-specific extensions to its implementation of

Java that, if used by a developer, meant that the written Java application could not run on JREs




                                                                                            10
that fully complied with Sun’s specifications. Nonetheless, tests in 1997 and 1998 showed that

Microsoft’s JRE was able to run a larger proportion of “pure” Java applications (designed to

meet Sun’s specifications and thus using no Windows-specific extensions) than were those

from Sun and Netscape.33

       B. Complaints and Trial

           The U.S. Department of Justice, twenty state co-plaintiffs, and the District of Columbia

(collectively, “the government”) filed an antitrust lawsuit in May 1998. The complaints alleged

that the inclusion of IE with Windows was an illegal tie.34 They also charged that Microsoft’s

contracting practices had effectively cut off Netscape’s distribution,35 that Microsoft attempted

to monopolize “the market for Internet browsers,” and that it had illegally maintained a

monopoly in “the market for PC operating systems” through these and other anticompetitive

practices.36

           The District Court put the case on a “fast track”: the trial began in mid-October 1998

and concluded in mid-June 1999, following 76 trial days. Each side was limited to 12 trial

32
     AOL did not use IE per se. Instead, with Microsoft’s help, it used IE components and their APIs to provide Web
     browsing from within the software it provided to subscribers to find and use content on AOL’s proprietary
     network.

     Tying is a violation under Section 1 and is often analyzed under a fairly strict standard enunciated by the
     Supreme Court in Jefferson Parish Hospital v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2 (1984). Tying can also be a violation under
     Section 2 under standard that is harder for plaintiffs to prevail on. 10 PHILLIP E. AREEDA ET AL., ANTITRUST
     LAW ¶ 1752 (1996).

     Shortly before the complaint was filed, Microsoft unilaterally removed the restrictions the Department found
     objectionable from many—but not all—of the relevant contracts.

     The States brought a separate claim of monopoly under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, alleging that Microsoft
     “used its monopoly power in the market for operating system software to foreclose competition in the separate
     market for Internet browsers and create a monopoly in the market for Internet browsers” (Plaintiff States’ First
     Amended Complaint, U.S. v. Microsoft and New York, et al. v. Microsoft, Civil Action Nos. 98–1232 and 98–
     1233 (TPJ), July 17, 1998, ¶¶ 91–92). The district court dismissed this claim on summary judgment “[b]ecause
     the theory of “monopoly leveraging” is inconsistent with both the Sherman Act’s plain text and with Supreme
     Court pronouncements on the general limitations of its reach” (Memorandum and Order, U.S. v. Microsoft and
     New York, et al. v. Microsoft, Civil Action Nos. 98–1232 and 98–1233 (TPJ), Sept. 14, 1998, p. 3).

witnesses who provided written testimony and were then cross-examined on that testimony at

trial and three rebuttal witnesses who presented oral testimony. The court issued findings of

fact on November 5, 1999 and conclusions of law on April 3, 2000. A hearing on remedies, in

which the trial court allowed the parties to makes statements but present no testimony, took

place on May 24, 2000. A final decision was issued on June 7, 2000.

           The testimony at trial covered six broad topics: (1) market definition and market power;

(2) tying of IE and Windows; (3) contracts that limited the distribution of Netscape; (4)

predatory conduct against Netscape; (5) Microsoft discounts and other efforts to dissuade

OEMs from installing Netscape and other middleware products; and (6) various Microsoft

actions regarding IBM, Intel, Netscape, Sun, RealNetworks, and Apple that were alleged to be

part of a pattern of using monopoly power in the operating system to illegally maintain power

there. Considerable economic testimony was presented on all of these topics. Table 1

summarizes the main antitrust charges initially levied against Microsoft, as well as their

disposition by the District Court and, as we will discuss in the next section, the Court of

Appeals.37

           The trial court agreed with the government on most of the charges against Microsoft,

rejecting only the Section 1 claim of exclusive dealing. It found that Microsoft had a monopoly

in personal computer operating systems, had illegally tied a browser to this operating system,

had engaged in tying and exclusionary contracts for the purpose of excluding Netscape from

37
     The states in their complaint made additional antitrust claims under the Sherman Act regarding Microsoft’s
     Office suite of business applications: 1) Office as well as Windows was indispensable to OEMs, contributing to
     Microsoft’s leverage negotiating with OEMs about IE; 2) Microsoft’s licensing terms for Office were
     anticompetitive, leading to higher barriers to entry in a putative market for PC office productivity suites and
     monopoly power in said market for Microsoft; and 3) Microsoft planned to illegally bundle its consumer email
     application, Outlook Express, with Windows 98 to eliminate potential threats to Office. Plaintiff States’
     Complaint, New York, et al. v. Microsoft, Civil Action No. 98–1233 (TPJ), May 18, 1998, §§ VII, XI–XII. The
     states further brought claims under their individual state laws. Plaintiff States’ Complaint, New York, et al. v.

the browser market, and had engaged in a variety of other actions to maintain its operating

system monopoly and in an attempt to monopolize the browser market. Although these broad

conclusions are clear from the court’s findings, it is harder than one might imagine to determine

from the court’s findings (of fact and of law) whether particular actions engaged in by

Microsoft were found to be illegal or were merely frowned upon by the court. For example, the

trial court seemed to condemn Microsoft for engaging in predatory conduct (including giving

IE away for free) in its Findings of Fact, but there is no specific Conclusion of Law that states

that this was a violation.38

            After finding liability, the trial court asked the parties to submit their recommendations

on remedies. The government sought structural relief—proposing to break Microsoft into two

companies—as well as behavioral restraints, including restrictions on the integration of features

into the operating system. The court decided not to take additional testimony on this topic and,

after a one-day hearing, granted the government’s proposal over Microsoft’s objections.

       C. The First Appeal

            Shortly after the conclusion of the trial, interviews with the trial judge appeared in the

press based on conversations that had taken place before he issued his Findings of Fact and

Conclusions of Law. The Court of Appeals, in a unanimous en banc decision, found that the

trial judge’s violations of several ethical precepts in these secret conversations were

“deliberate, repeated, egregious, and flagrant.”39 And it noted that some of his comments

“would lead a reasonable, informed observer to question the District Judge’s impartiality.”40


38
     As we will see below, the Justice Department did not raise the predation issue on appeal, and the appeals court
     dismissed this as a possible antitrust violation, while noting that it was not clear that it was being claimed as an
     antitrust violation by the government. U.S. v. Microsoft, 253 F.3d 34 (D.C. Cir. 2001), at 41–42, 88–89.

                                                                                                                    13
The Court of Appeals concluded, however, that the appropriate remedy for the District Judge’s

misconduct was to vacate the order breaking up Microsoft (which, as we discuss in Section II,

it vacated for other reasons as well) and to disqualify him from participating in the case

thereafter. In particular, it held that his findings of fact “both warrant deference under the clear

error standard and, though exceedingly sparing in citations to the record, permit meaningful

appellate review.”41

            As it turned out, the District Court’s detailed findings of fact failed to save two of the

trial court’s three findings of liability. The D.C. Circuit reversed the finding that Microsoft had

attempted to monopolize the browser market because the trial court had not found that browsers

comprised a relevant market. It also found that the plaintiffs had not presented adequate

evidence on market definition or barriers to entry—either at trial or in oral argument on

appeal—and it precluded the government from addressing this problem on remand. The appeals

court also vacated the finding of per se illegal tying, in part because it concluded that “the

nature of the platform software market affirmatively suggests that per se rules might stunt

valuable innovation.”42 It remanded the issue, giving plaintiffs the option to retry a tying claim

under the rule of reason, and it also provided guidance on the specific standards it would apply

if upon remand the district court found under the rule of reason that Microsoft had illegally tied

its browser to Windows, its software platform.43 The government decided against pursuing the


41
     Id.,, at 118. The clear error standard requires a finding of fact to be sustained unless it can be shown that it is
     clearly erroneous in light of the record. This is little help when the record is thin: if only one witness testified on
     an issue, and that testimony was not clearly demolished on cross-examination, it stands as definitive even if
     inconsistent with incontrovertible facts not in the record.
42
     Id.,, at 92.
43
     In particular, the Court of Appeals’ standards were: “First, to be condemned as exclusionary, a monopolist’s act
     must have an ‘anticompetitive effect.’ That is, it must harm the competitive process and thereby harm
     consumers. In contrast, harm to one or more competitors will not suffice…Second, the plaintiff, on whom the
     burden of proof of course rests, must demonstrate that the monopolist’s conduct indeed has the requisite
     anticompetitive effect…Third, if a plaintiff successfully establishes a prima facie case under § 2 by

                                                                                                                      14
tying case on remand. Although some have argued that the change in administrations made the

U.S. Department of Justice less aggressive, we think the higher standards for establishing a

tying violations set by the appeals court together with that court’s prohibition against the

government’s re-arguing that there is a browser market (a potentially important element of a

tying claim) would have made such an attempt futile. In any event, it is not clear that the

remedy would have been any different if the tying claim had been retried and Microsoft found

liable.

           The trial court’s detailed findings of fact were critical to the Court of Appeals’ review

of the District Court’s finding of illegal monopoly maintenance. The findings relevant to the

actions listed in the second and third sections of Table 2 were based on a thin trial record.44

           In considering these findings by the lower court, the appeals court described the test for

causation that it thought was appropriate for considering liability questions. It first noted with

approval that “with respect to actions seeking injunctive relief, [Areeda and Hovenkamp]

recognize the need for courts to infer ‘causation’ from the fact that a defendant has engaged in

anticompetitive conduct that ‘reasonably appear[s] capable of making a significant contribution



     demonstrating anticompetitive effect, then the monopolist may proffer a ‘procompetitive justification’ for its
     conduct. If the monopolist asserts a procompetitive justification—a nonpretextual claim that its conduct is
     indeed a form of competition on the merits because it involves, for example, greater efficiency or enhanced
     consumer appeal—then the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to rebut that claim…Fourth, if the monopolist’s
     procompetitive justification stands unrebutted, then the plaintiff must demonstrate that the anticompetitive harm
     of the conduct outweighs the procompetitive benefit.” U.S. v. Microsoft Corp., 253 F.3d 34, 58-59, 95-97 (D.C.
     Cir. 2001),. The court noted that although its discussion on the rule of reason arose in the context of the Section
     2 monopolization claims, the analysis was analogous to that for Section 1 claims.
44
     For two of the twelve acts found illegal by the Court of Appeals, there was no direct testimony; the findings
     were based on documents introduced during cross-examination during the rebuttal phase (These findings
     concerned the “First-Wave” program, which the court found was used to reduce the likelihood that ISVs would
     distribute Navigator and non-Microsoft JREs. Id.,, at 48–49, 54–55.)) For another of the acts—the finding that
     Microsoft had deceived Java developers into using Windows-specific features in its Java developer kit—there
     was no testimony (at trial or in deposition) from any independent developer. The only testimony was from a Sun
     witness who testified that he had heard from some developers that they were confused, but could not recall any
     names(Trial Transcript, December 10, 1998, a.m. session (Gosling Direct), U.S. v. Microsoft, 253 F.3d 34 (D.C.
     Cir. 2001), at. 58–64.) There is a deeper but nonetheless sparse trial record for the other nine acts.


                                                                                                                  15
to … maintaining monopoly power”(emphasis added).45 It then asserted that “[w]e may infer

causation when exclusionary conduct is aimed at producers of nascent competitive technologies

as well as when it is aimed at producers of established substitutes.”46 It described this as a

“rather edentulous [i.e., toothless] test for causation[.]”47

            Under this standard, the Court of Appeals reversed the trial court on the allegations

summarized in the second part of Table 2. But it found that because each of the actions listed in

the third part of Table 2 seemed capable in principle of maintaining Microsoft’s monopoly

power and lacked an adequate efficiency justification, each constituted a violation of the

Sherman Act.

            The Court of Appeals held in this case that actions by a monopoly were illegal if they

were facially suspect, aimed at nascent competitors, and lacked a persuasive efficiency

rationale, even in the absence of proof of any actual effect on competition or harm to

consumers. The main explicit argument it gave for this “toothless” standard was the difficulty

of proving what would have happened absent the illegal acts. Suppose monopoly A burns the

factory of B, an emerging but struggling competitor, and B’s business fails. Even if it cannot be

shown that the fire caused or even hastened the failure, most people would want to find A

guilty of more than arson. The charge on the table in Microsoft was monopoly maintenance,

and, in retrospect, once the appeals court had decided it would accept all of the trial court’s

findings of fact, with their adverse description of conduct that struck most observers as at least

exceptionally aggressive competition,48 it would have been difficult for it to find that Microsoft

had done absolutely nothing wrong. At the same time, for some of the acts ultimately found

illegal by the Court of Appeals, Microsoft had not presented testimony explaining why its

actions had pro-consumer benefits.49

            We and others have argued that more evidence of harm to consumers should be required

to establish liability.50 But the direct impact of any antitrust case on consumers depends on

what relief, if any, is ordered,51 and in that context the D.C. Circuit pointedly noted that

“Microsoft’s concerns over causation have more purchase in connection with the appropriate

remedy issue.”52 As we show in the next section, its elaboration of that point played a central

role in determining the remedy ultimately adopted.

III.        Remedies Proposed and Ordered

       A. Complaints and Trial

            In its original complaint, the Department of Justice asked the court to order Microsoft

not to tie “Microsoft’s Internet browser software or other software product” to Windows, to

     NEWSWEEK wrote that Judge Jackson’s Findings of Fact was a “compelling litany of misdeeds” documenting “at
     length how Microsoft is a monopolistic violator that not only bullies its competitors but also rips off the public
     by stifling innovation and overcharging for its software” Bill Takes It On The Chin, NEWSWEEK, Nov. 15, 1999.

49
     In many cases that is not surprising since there were many allegations made during the trial and it was not
     apparent that many of the ones ultimately found illegal by the appeals court were ones that the government was
     pursuing seriously. In addition, limiting each side to only 15 witnesses (12 during the main case and three in
     rebuttal) also made it impractical to call witnesses to testify on all of the factual issues raised. To a great degree,
     many factual issues were not addressed in testimony, or were addressed only through hearsay (which the trial
     judge freely allowed because there was no jury and he could decide for himself how much weight to give to the
     evidence).

     The ultimate impact of any case depends both on the direct impact and on the indirect precedential effects. We
     argue below that the likely precedential effects of both the D.C. Circuit Court’s Microsoft decisions, taken
     together, will be to reinforce traditional, pro-consumer antitrust principles.

forbid Microsoft from requiring or inducing anyone—whether OEM, IAP, or ICP—not to

distribute “any non-Microsoft Internet browser software or other software product,” and not to

take action or threaten to take action for non-distribution of Microsoft products or distribution

of non-Microsoft products. (The key term “software product” was not defined.) The court was

also asked to order Microsoft to eliminate restrictive terms from its OEM contracts

corresponding to the OEM allegations in Table 2. In addition, the states’ complaint asked that

Microsoft be ordered to license its intellectual property in “interfaces” that were necessary to

permit alternative browsers to work effectively with Windows and that it be required broadly to

provide necessary information and technical support to ISVs.

       The Department of Justice asked that for a period of three years, Microsoft be allowed

to distribute a single version of Windows with IE only if it also included Navigator and

permitted each OEM “to delete the software that provides the Internet Explorer icon and the

other means by which users may readily use IE to browse the web, the software that provides

the icon and the other means by which users may readily use the Netscape Internet browser, or

both.” In addition, the Department of Justice asked that Microsoft be permanently barred from

distributing IE with Windows unless it made available to OEMs, “a practical and commercially

reasonable option of deleting … or not installing … the software that provides the Internet

Explorer icon and the other means by which users may readily use IE to browse the web” and

gave a price break to OEMs that deleted or did not install IE.

       It is important to recognize that, even after Web browsing became more tightly

integrated into Windows starting with the release of IE 3 in 1996, removing user access to IE,

as the Department of Justice’s complaint requested, does not require removal of the modules of

code that support APIs related to Internet browsing. Thus, application programs (and other



                                                                                              18
parts of Windows) can call on Windows to perform functions, such as display of files in HTML

format, that are also used in Web browsing. If some OEMs removed the files supporting these

APIs, however, developers of applications software would have to recognize that programs

relying on those APIs would not work on some computers running Windows. If these

computers were numerous, application developers would need either to avoid using the

functions involved or to bundle the necessary Windows code with their applications software to

perform those functions so that consumers did not face inconsistent application performance.

           In November 1999, the trial judge issued findings of fact that made it clear that he

would conclude that Microsoft had violated the Sherman Act. He encouraged Microsoft and the

government to agree on a consent decree, and he appointed a mediator, Judge Richard Posner.

On April 3, after mediation had failed, the District Court issued its Conclusions of Law, which

are summarized in Table 1 and Table 2.

           On April 28, 2000, plaintiffs submitted their proposed relief. In addition to interim

restrictions on Microsoft’s conduct that were similar to those that had been proposed in the

complaint, they proposed that Microsoft be split into two independent companies, with one

producing operating systems (“OpsCo”) and one producing applications and everything else

(“AppsCo”), including IE. While there had been much press speculation about breaking up

Microsoft,53 this proposal was nonetheless surprising because it would neither directly increase

competition in operating systems nor reduce the incentives of OpsCo, which would inherit

Windows and its market power, to continue to add new features and functions to its products.54

     Indeed, several noted economists filed an amicus brief with the trial court arguing that this relief was insufficient

The government filed affidavits with its proposal that advanced the argument, which had not

been made at trial, that competition would be enhanced because AppsCo would transform

Microsoft Office, a very popular product containing a word processor, a spreadsheet, and other

applications, into middleware that would compete with Windows for the loyalty of applications

developers. No evidence related to such a transformation had been introduced at trial, nor had

the concept been discussed in the Findings of Fact or Conclusions of Law.55

           On May 10, Microsoft responded that the proposed remedy was too severe and that it

would be impossible to resolve remedy-specific factual disputes without substantial discovery

and a full hearing. At a one-day hearing on May 24, the judge indicated that he was prepared to

enter a relief order without any further process. Microsoft then offered to produce testimony

from various experts showing, among other things,56 that the proposed divestiture would not

induce entry into operating systems; that it would be expensive and difficult, that it would

disrupt product development, and that it would result in substantial price increases for both

Windows and Office.57 The District Court nonetheless held no further proceedings and issued a

relief order on June 7 that was essentially identical to the government’s proposal.

     The states’ initial May 1998 complaint had included a claim concerning Microsoft’s alleged monopolization of
     business productivity applications (Office) by denying competitors access to undocumented Windows interfaces
     that Office applications used. The states dropped that claim, however, in their first amended complaint. The only
     way in which Office appeared during the trial concerned Microsoft’s threat to stop offering Office for the
     Macintosh if Apple did not promote the Macintosh version of IE more prominently on new Macintosh
     computers.

       B. The First Appeal

           As noted above, the D.C. Circuit’s decision of June 2001 vacated the District Court’s

relief order in part because of judicial misconduct on the part of the District Judge and

remanded the case to a new judge for the purpose of fashioning appropriate relief. It also

vacated the order because the District Court failed to hold an evidentiary hearing on remedies-

specific factual disputes and because it failed to offer an adequate explanation for the relief it

ordered.58 Had that been all the court of appeals had to say on the subject of relief, the new

judge conceivably might simply have received additional written testimony, held a brief

evidentiary hearing, and entered the same order as the trial court—this time with a summary of

the government’s explanation of the order’s virtues attached.

           However, the D.C. Circuit gave a third reason for vacating the District Court’s remedies

decree that made such a course impossible: “[w]e have drastically altered the scope of

Microsoft’s liability, and it is for the District Court in the first instance to determine the

propriety of a specific remedy for the limited ground of liability which we have upheld”

(emphasis added).59 The discussion in Section I, summarized in Tables 1 and Table 2, makes

clear just how drastically the D.C. Circuit had reduced the scope of Microsoft’s liability: of the

three violations found by the trial court, one had been reversed, one had been vacated, and,

while the monopoly maintenance violation was upheld, the list of condemned actions had been

shortened substantially.

            In providing guidance to the District Court on remand, the appeals court noted that

unitary companies, not formed by mergers and acquisitions, are rarely split in antitrust

proceedings because of the cost and difficulty involved, and it noted that Microsoft claimed to

be a unitary corporation. It then turned to the critical issue of causation, asserting that “the

District Court also should consider whether plaintiffs have established a sufficient causal

connection between Microsoft’s anticompetitive conduct and its dominant position in the OS

market.”60 As we noted above, the court had defended its “edentulous” standard for liability

with a citation from Areeda and Hovenkamp that applied “to actions seeking injunctive

relief.”61 It reinforced this linkage in its discussion of remedy by citing Areeda and Hovenkamp

with approval to the effect that “structural relief … ‘require[s] a clearer indication of a

significant causal connection between the conduct and creation or maintenance of market

power’” (emphasis added by the court) and that “[a]bsent such causation, the antitrust

defendant’s unlawful behavior should be remedied by ‘an injunction against continuation of

that conduct.’”62

            The court then referred to the weak standard for causation that it had adopted for

liability: “we have found a causal connection between Microsoft’s exclusionary conduct and its

continuing position in the operating systems market only through inference.”63 The D.C.

Circuit noted that the District Court, although it had found much more of Microsoft’s conduct

illegal, had expressly found that, “There is insufficient evidence to find that, absent Microsoft’s

actions, Navigator and Java already would have ignited genuine competition in the market for

Intel-compatible PC operating systems.”64 The appeals court concluded that, “While we do not

undertake to dictate to the District Court the precise form that relief should take on remand, we

note again that it should be tailored to fit the wrong creating the occasion for the remedy.”65

            This guidance left open the possibility that on remand the government would provide

evidence of “a significant causal connection” that would convince the new district judge that

more than injunctive relief was in order. Absent such evidence, however, structural relief was

clearly ruled out, and one could doubt whether the appeals court would sustain relief much

beyond “an injunction against continuation” of the conduct it had found illegal. In this first

appellate decision, the D.C. Circuit thus enunciated both a weak standard for liability and a

strong standard for relief: liability did not require much evidence of causation, particularly

when nascent competition was involved, but serious proof of causation was required to go

beyond straightforward injunctive relief. The rationale seems clear: if there is no evidence that

the illegal conduct actually did harm consumers by reducing competition, there is no

justification for relief intended to increase competition beyond what market forces would

produce, since relief of this sort almost inevitably involves costs of various sorts.66

       C. Settlement and Hearings

            Shortly after September 11, 2001, making reference to the events of that day, the new

District Judge ordered the remaining parties to enter into settlement negotiations.67 The U.S.

Department of Justice and nine of the state plaintiffs (the “settling plaintiffs”) reached

resolution in the form of a proposed settlement in early November, but nine states and the

District of Columbia (the “litigating states”) proposed a different, more severe remedy.

Beginning in March 2002, the district court held a 32-day evidentiary hearing on the issue of

remedies proposed by the litigating states. In addition, as part of its review under the Tunney

Act the court held separate, shorter hearings of whether the proposed settlement was in the

public interest. In November 2002, the District Court approved the settlement and entered a

relief order that differed only slightly from the proposed consent decree. Table 3 summarizes

the substantive provisions of that order and relates them to the actions listed in Table 2.

           We defer a detailed discussion of those substantive provisions and their enforcement to

Sections IV and V, below. We note here, however, that the consent decree order goes far

beyond the relief sought by plaintiffs in their 1998 complaints: a wider range of actions is

prohibited or required (including some that were neither complained of nor related to actions

found illegal), a greater variety of software products is affected (including any new middleware

technologies that might emerge, as well as more of Microsoft’s existing offerings), and, as a

consequence, the required changes to Windows are more extensive. The only provision in the

complaint’s relief not present in the final relief order is the requirement that for a three-year

period Microsoft either bundle Netscape Navigator along with Windows or offer a version of

Windows without IE. Since Navigator no longer had a large share of browser usage by late

2002, and the District Court found that Navigator’s distribution had not been foreclosed by

Microsoft’s actions,68 this omission is not particularly surprising.

           Thus, if Microsoft had simply surrendered when it received the government’s complaint

in 1998, it almost certainly would have received a less onerous order. One might argue that it

     See Table 1 for disposition of the charges.


                                                                                                24
also would have been spared considerable cost as well as a great deal of hostile media coverage

and a wave of derivative litigation.69 But, of course, surrendering would have entailed

admitting to having broken the law, and Microsoft did not believe it had done so. That nine

states felt the final relief order was too weak, even though it was much stronger than the order

plaintiffs initially sought, testifies both to the difficulty of managing a large coalition of

litigants and to the tendency of bitter, protracted litigation to drive parties to extreme positions.

Our own view, to add to the Monday morning quarterbacking, is that Microsoft inevitably

would have been subject to significant protracted litigation even if it had settled the IE issue in

1998. Many in government and elsewhere felt that it was necessary for antitrust to rein in

Microsoft’s perceived market power and arrogance, and some other grounds for suit almost

certainly would have been found.

            The remedy proposed by the litigating states differed in a number of important respects

from that proposed by the Justice Department and Microsoft and finally adopted. It had a much

broader definition of middleware. It required disclosure of considerable additional Microsoft

intellectual property—including making the source code of Internet Explorer available on an

open source basis and licensing three companies to use the source code of Microsoft Office to

port it to operating systems other than Windows and Macintosh. And it required that Microsoft

offer “unbound” versions of Windows that would allow licensees to remove any combination

of “middleware” that they wished. The litigating states defined “middleware” as any software

that provides one or more interfaces and that “could, if ported to or made Interoperable with

multiple Operating Systems, enable software products written for that Middleware to be run on

multiple Operating System Products.”70 The states’ computer science expert witness equated

“middleware” with all code in operating system products that is not part of the “kernel,” a very

tiny part of most operating systems (about 1.5 percent of Windows XP and as little as 0.2

percent of one major Linux distribution in 200271).

           Thus, instead of requiring that Microsoft enable the blocking of end user access to

specific pieces of Microsoft middleware (e.g., in the language of the Department of Justice

complaint, enabling OEMs to delete or not install “the software that provides the Internet

Explorer icon and the other means by which users may readily use IE to browse the web”), the

litigating states would have required Microsoft to make available versions of Windows in

which the corresponding computer code for various combinations of middleware had been

removed. One of the goals of the states’ proposal was to remove code that supported APIs, so

that ISVs would no longer be able to count on every copy of Windows of a particular vintage

supporting the same set of APIs.72 We return to these issues in Section III.

           In discussing the general standards and guidance from the D.C. Circuit that it followed

in shaping the final relief order, the District Judge noted that “the Court’s determination of the

appropriate remedy in this case reflects, among other considerations, the strength of the

evidence linking Defendant’s anticompetitive behavior to its present position in the market.”73

Two economists testified on the issue of causality.74 The judge found the litigating states’

economist’s “‘assessment’ to have been based entirely upon his examination of the district and

appellate courts’ opinions in this case,” and that he “did not make any attempt to separate the

effect of the illegal conduct from the effect of the conduct found not to be illegal.”75 The judge

therefore gave little weight to Carl Shapiro’s testimony.

           Microsoft’s economic expert, Professor Kevin Murphy, testified, based on analyses and

evidence that were not part of the trial record, that the conduct that had been found illegal had

had essentially no effect on Microsoft’s market position. Recall that the trial court found that

neither Netscape nor Java had ever actually developed a product that posed a threat to

Windows: “no middleware product [including Navigator and Java] exposes enough APIs to

allow independent software vendors (‘ISVs’) profitably to write full-featured personal

productivity applications that rely solely on those APIs.”76

           Professor Murphy noted that even by the time of the remedies hearing in 2002,

Navigator had exposed only a handful of APIs that, in aggregate, did not provide significant

middleware functionality, and Java had not become a significant platform for desktop

applications. He argued that these outcomes reflected the technical limitations of Web browsers

and Java as application platforms and business decisions by Netscape, not anticompetitive

actions by Microsoft.77 When Netscape was an independent company, it never intended to turn

Navigator into a middleware platform of the sort envisioned by the government’s theory.78

            After AOL agreed to acquire Netscape in late 1998, funds for developing Navigator into

middleware could hardly have been an issue, and AOL’s huge membership provided an

obvious basis for developing a middleware platform. Yet the development of Navigator slowed

dramatically after this time, and AOL continued to use IE components rather than Navigator in

its client software. Java continues to be widely used as a development platform, but mainly for

small “Web applets” and for applications that run on servers and on cell phones and other small

devices, where the nature of the applications makes Java’s technical limitations less troubling

than with PC applications. Serious attempts by several major ISVs in the late 1990s to write PC

applications in Java failed, and Microsoft’s large share of the desktop operating system

business has made the cross-platform ability of Java not very valuable.

            The court concluded, however, that Professor Murphy’s testimony could not be given

much weight because his “conclusion that the anticompetitive conduct identified in this case

had no effect upon Microsoft’s monopoly can be seen to undercut, if not directly contradict, the

inference of causation necessary to the appellate court’s imposition of liability.”79

     1233). We would argue that this testimony shows that the court of appeals was too pessimistic about the
     possibility of applying a test for causation with some evidentiary teeth in this case. Had it asked a District Court
     to consider the issue of consumer harm seriously on remand before finding liability, expert economists would
     have been able to present new, relevant data and analysis to supplement what was a very thin record on the acts
     found to be violations by the court of appeals. It might not have been possible to settle the issue definitively, but,
     as in other complex matters, Professor Murphy’s testimony demonstrates by example that there would have
     been substantive evidence that a trial judge could weigh.


                                                                                                                     28
            The combined effect of rejecting Shapiro’s testimony for the litigating states and

Murphy’s testimony for Microsoft, however, was to lead the new trial judge to rely on the

record from the original trial that the appeals court had relied upon in its liability findings. But,

as noted above, the appeals court had gone out of its way to emphasize that it was using a

“toothless” standard for liability—something it would not have had to do if the government

could have met a stronger standard—and that a higher standard was needed for the sort of

structural relief sought by the litigating states. Not surprisingly, then, the new trial judge found,

“Neither the evidentiary record from the liability phase, nor the record in this portion of the

proceeding, establishes that the present success of IE is attributable entirely, or even in

predominant part, to Microsoft’s illegal conduct.”80 And the court of appeals had instructed the

new district court that in the absence of “a sufficient causal connection between Microsoft’s

anticompetitive conduct and its dominant position in the OS market … the antitrust defendant’s

unlawful behavior should be remedied by ‘an injunction against the continuation of that

conduct.’”81

            Under these conditions, one could argue that the District Court was obliged only to

enjoin repetition of the conduct described in the third part of Table 2.82 The Court rejected this

approach and, along with a 324-page opinion discussing factual and legal issues in depth,

issued the order sketched in Table 3, which it said “exceeds a mere proscription of the precise

     state the courts’ findings on causation. See, e.g., Bresnahan, supra note 5, at 67 (discussing the negotiated
     settlement that differed only slightly from the final remedies order): “The government plaintiffs successfully
     proved to the district court and a unanimous appeals court sitting en banc that Microsoft illegally prevented the
     widespread distribution of new technologies that would have substantially lowered the entry barriers into its
     Windows monopoly.” This, of course, goes far beyond what even the trial court found.

conduct found to be anticompetitive and is forward-looking…” as well as being “crafted to

foster competition in the monopolized market in a manner consistent with the theory of liability

in this case.”83 But of course at this point Microsoft had already entered into a consent decree

with the U.S. Department of Justice and other states that was much stronger than mere

injunctive proscription.

           In contrast, the trial judge described the litigating states as having “shown little respect

for the parameters of liability that were so precisely delineated by the appellate court” and

described many of their remedial proposals as “unjustifiably in conflict with the imposition as

well as the rejection of liability in this case.”84 In addition, “the Court observes that a number

of the remedial provisions proposed by [the litigating states] would require drastic alterations to

Microsoft’s products, as well as to aspects of its business model which do not involve illegal

conduct.”85 Further, “[c]ertain of Microsoft’s competitors appear to be those who most desire

these provisions and, concomitantly, are the likely beneficiaries, while other competitors in the

relevant market would not necessarily benefit.”86

           At the end of the day only a single non-settling state, our own Commonwealth of

Massachusetts, decided the expected benefits of an appeal from this decision outweighed the

expected costs, and it asked the D.C. Circuit to set aside the District Court’s remedial decree.

court’s decree in its entirety.87

            The D.C. Circuit found none of the new trial court’s challenged findings of fact failed

the appropriate “clearly erroneous” test, nor did its relief decree fall afoul of the “abuse of

discretion” standard. As we discuss in more detail in Section III, the appeals court was

particularly strong and clear on the issue of code removal versus removal of end-user access. It

supported the District Court’s decision not to adopt any provision, and in particular not to adopt

a broad provision proposed by the litigating states, aimed at Action C.11 in Table 2—deception

of Java developers.88 And it reaffirmed the importance of its earlier decision reducing the scope

of Microsoft’s liability: “The parties’ relative positions were considerably changed by our

decision in [the first appeal].”89 Following the court’s decision, Massachusetts announced that

it would not pursue an appeal to the Supreme Court.90

conclusion of law was set aside by the D.C. Circuit on the first appeal, the illegality of actions

C.1-C.3 in Table 2 was upheld. In effect, the appeals court held that for technical reasons a

further rule of reason analysis was necessary to decide whether Microsoft could tie by refusing

to license Windows to OEMs without IE, while relatively little evidence was required to

condemn Microsoft actions that seemed to prevent OEMs from, in effect, discarding IE rather

than including it as part of the Windows-based systems they distributed to consumers.91 The

rule of reason argument as to why this actually harmed Netscape and thus constituted a Section

2 violation was that consumers would be confused by having icons on their desktops for

multiple pieces of software that performed the same basic functions. If such confusion actually

harms competition, the natural remedy would seem to be to prohibit Microsoft from creating

it—in this case by making it possible for OEMs to discard IE. But, as we discuss below, it has

not been simple for the courts to decide exactly what that requires.

       A. Windows Architecture and the Commingling Confusion

           Versions 1 and 2 of Internet Explorer were conventional applications, making the

meaning of “removal” straightforward.92 That is, the corresponding binary code was relatively

isolated and could be deleted easily; it exposed few if any APIs; and its removal from Windows




91
     In outlining the steps that plaintiffs would need to take in pursuing a tying claim under rule of reason, the D.C.
     circuit wrote that “the fact that we have already considered some of the behavior plaintiffs allege to constitute
     tying violations in the monopoly maintenance section does not resolve the § 1 inquiry. The two practices that
     plaintiffs have most ardently claimed as tying violations are, indeed, a basis for liability under plaintiffs’ § 2
     monopoly maintenance claim. These are Microsoft’s refusal to allow OEMs to uninstall IE or remove it from
     the Windows desktop and its removal of the IE entry from the Add/Remove Programs utility in Windows 98. In
     order for the District Court to conclude these practices also constitute § 1 tying violations, plaintiffs must
     demonstrate that their benefits—if any—are outweighed by the harms in the tied product market.” Microsoft,

would not cause other application programs or other Windows processes to crash. There was

thus no meaningful “commingling” issue.

           If the architecture of Version 3 and later versions of IE had been the same as Versions 1

and 2, to permit OEMs to discard IE Microsoft would have involved only the provision of a

suitable add-remove utility (Action C.2 in Table 2) and removal of the contractual prohibitions

of icon, folder, or “Start” menu entry removal (Action C.3). But starting with version 3, IE was

designed to be an integral part of the Windows platform, not just an application. Much of the

code that was used in Internet browsing was also used to perform other operating system

functions in support of both Windows itself and applications. Deleting that code, through some

sort of Add/Remove utility or in any other way, would disable those operating system

functions.

           Consider, for instance, the HTML rendering engine mentioned above.93 In the first two

versions of IE, this code could only be invoked when an end user, browsing the Internet, used

Internet Explorer to display a Web page. Starting with IE 3, however, the code for HTML

rendering was a separate component that exposed APIs that Microsoft documented for use by

applications programs to display HTML files on screen, whether or not those files had been

obtained from the Internet.94 The end user could employ it to display an HTML file stored on

the hard disk, for instance. Moreover, starting with IE 4, Microsoft used HTML to display


93
     In its remedy decision, the district court includes a discussion of the HTML rendering engine in Windows to
     illustrate the difficulty of defining middleware separate from an operating system and of removing middleware
     without degrading an operating system’s functions. (In the case of Windows, the HTML engine, which Plaintiffs
     argued OEMs must have the right to remove, is required for Windows Help and Windows Explorer to work
     properly, so Microsoft could not effect the removal without subjecting itself to claims of providing a degraded
     operating system product.) Memorandum Opinion at 289–290, New York. v. Microsoft Corp., 231 F. Supp. 2d

     In the District Court hearing on remedy, two computer scientists testified for Microsoft on the problems
     associated with code removal. For a discussion of how IE relied on a series of modules—including the HTML
     rendering engine, see Direct Testimony of Stuart M. Madnick, at ¶¶ 181–186, Id.,


                                                                                                              33
directories of folders and files on users’ hard disks or corporate networks, and the same code

used to provide the “shell” for IE was also used for file management and other purposes,

including Windows Media Player.

       On its face, this approach would seem to be efficient, since the same code is used for

multiple purposes. That also means that when the code is revised, updating that file updates all

of the functions and applications that rely on it. But it makes it essentially impossible to define

“removing IE” via an Add-Remove utility or other means. If the binary code that renders

HTML files is removed, for example, important parts of Windows will not work.

       In the binary, working version of an operating system or other complex program, code

performing different functions is grouped together in files. It is our understanding that the best

way to structure these files in any particular case depends on, among other things, how

frequently different functions are called close together in time. There are tradeoffs between

using fewer, larger files or more numerous smaller files, and part of the final development

process is to experiment with alternatives to see how they perform under various likely

scenarios.

       The original trial judge heard, correctly, that in Windows some code used for Internet

browsing was in the same files as code used for other purposes, and that deleting those files

would disable other parts of Windows and third-party applications. He did not seem to

understand that some code was used for both sorts of purposes, or that there were software

engineering reasons for grouping different code modules in larger files for distribution and

execution. Accordingly, the Findings of Fact stated that Microsoft had bound IE to Windows

98 “by placing code specific to Web browsing in the same files as code that provided operating

system functions” and that this “ensure[s] that the deletion of any file containing browsing-



                                                                                                34
specific routines would also delete vital operating system routines and thus cripple

Windows…”95 In his Conclusions of Law, this “commingling” became a violation of Section II

of the Sherman Act:


            [C]onsumers today perceive operating systems and browsers as separate
            “products,”… This is true notwithstanding the fact that the software code
            supplying their discrete functionalities can be commingled in virtually infinite
            combinations, rendering each indistinguishable from the whole in terms of files
            of code or any other taxonomy… Microsoft’s decision to offer only the
            bundled—“integrated”—version of Windows and Internet Explorer derived not
            from technical necessity or business efficiencies; rather, it was the result of a
            deliberate and purposeful choice to quell incipient competition before it reached
            truly minatory proportions.96

            On appeal, Microsoft challenged these particular findings as clearly erroneous,

characterizing as uncontradicted expert testimony that “‘[t]he very same code in Windows 98

that provides Web browsing functionality’ also performs essential operating system

functions—not code in the same files, but the very same software code.”97 Thus the grouping of

code into files or the inclusion of IE in an Add/Remove utility had nothing to do with the

inability of OEMs to delete IE without adverse consequences; that was determined by the basic

architecture of the operating system. Apparently not grasping that some code was used for both

purposes, the court of appeals found that this testimony was contradicted by testimony that

some code used for Web browsing was in files with code not used for web browsing.98 Finding

     It is interesting to note that elsewhere in its decision, in a discussion of possible benefits from tying, the court of
     appeals seemed to understand quite clearly both that multi-use code was present in Windows and that it could
     reflect efficient design: it pointed to “…the ‘shared’ library files that perform OS and browser functions with the
     very same lines of code and thus may save drive space from the clutter of redundant routines and memory when
     consumers use both the OS and the browser simultaneously.” Microsoft, 253 F.3d 34 at 87.

contradictory testimony, the appeals court ruled that the judge’s findings were not clearly

erroneous and thus upheld his conclusion that “commingling” violated the Sherman Act.99

            The settlement negotiated subsequently between Microsoft and the U.S. Department of

Justice, and agreed to by nine states, dealt with both the commingling and Add-Remove

violations by enabling OEMs to block end-user access to IE, as well as a range of other

Microsoft “middleware,” such as Windows Media Player and Windows Messenger.100 The

litigating states argued that this provision was inadequate. Since the commingling offense had

the effect of making it difficult for OEMs to remove code, they argued, the remedy must be to

require Microsoft to produce versions of Windows with the code for Internet Explorer and,

upon request, for a wide range of other middleware removed entirely. The litigating states’

economic expert refused to endorse this provision of their proposed remedy.101

       B. Multi-Use Code and Multi-Sided Platform Markets

            An important source of the commingling confusion was the trial and appeals courts’

apparent failure to recognize the implications that software, like the HTML rendering engine,

could perform both browsing and non-browsing functions. In the presence of such software, it

is unclear as an operational matter what it means to “delete” Internet Explorer and it is clear

that what code is in what files is irrelevant to any substantive issue. The courts presumably

could eliminate this ambiguity by requiring Microsoft not to have any code perform more than

one function or to block access by application developers to some APIs, but the first remedy

     removing more code would disable other parts of Windows and various applications. See Trial Transcript, New

would make Windows more complex and less efficient, and the second remedy would force

applications developers to write code to perform functions that could be performed for them by

Windows. Neither remedy would benefit consumers.102

        A second source of the commingling confusion, we believe, was the failure of any party

to understand clearly the antitrust policy implications of the fact that Windows is a multi-sided

market platform.103 This is hardly a surprise, since the economic literature on multi-sided

platform markets post-dates most of this proceeding, and most of it has been concerned with

payment cards rather than software platforms.104 In essence, a firm providing a multi-sided

market platform needs to attract two or more groups because the value of the platform to one

group depends on the participation of the other group and vice versa. Singles bars need to

attract both men and women; shopping malls need stores and shoppers; payment card ventures

like American Express need to attract both merchants and consumers; video game console

makers need game software developers and game users; and operating system vendors need to

attract both applications software developers and end users.105 As Microsoft management

   The district court addressed the two solutions discussed here, as well as two others put forward by the
  government’s computer science expert, Dr. Appel. The court found that none of the proposed solutions would

  Testimony of Stuart M. Madnick, ¶¶ 180–185, Id.,

   The government and Microsoft both recognized that software platforms had indirect network effects, which
  created a positive feedback loop between users and applications developers. There is extensive economic
  literature on industries with indirect network effects that was developed in the 1980s and early 1990s. For a
  summary, see Michael L. Katz and Carl Shapiro, Systems Competition and Network Effects, 8 J. OF ECON.
  PERSP. 93 (1994); see also, David S. Evans & Richard Schmalensee, A Guide to the Antitrust Economics of
  Networks, 16 ANTITRUST (1996). And Microsoft executives clearly understood the business implications of
  these externalities.

   Microsoft receives most of its Windows revenue from OEMs rather than directly from end-users, but to analyze
  the issues here, it is most useful to think of OEMs as distributors of Windows. When it designs new versions of
  Windows, however, Microsoft works closely with OEMs to ensure that hardware and operating systems
  capabilities evolve in compatible ways. In that context it makes sense to think of OEMs as a “side” of the
  market whose loyalty is important to secure. One can also think of Microsoft’s task as three-sided, as it must

                                                                                                             37
clearly understood, an operating system is more valuable to applications developers the more

end-users are potential buyers of programs written for it, and an operating system is more

valuable to end-users the more attractive applications have been developed to work with it.

           One of the insights from the economic literature on multi-sided markets is that both

profit-maximizing and socially efficient pricing structures are not driven only by side-specific

costs but also by details of demand conditions and indirect network externalities. Even if it is

more expensive to serve side A than side B, for instance, it may make business sense and

enhance economic efficiency to sell below cost to A because more sales to A have a powerful

stimulating effect on sales to B. In the case of computer operating systems, for instance, no

vendor charges applications developers for the right to use the system’s APIs, even though

Microsoft, Apple, and other firms devote substantial resources to wooing and informing ISVs.

Operating system vendors receive almost all their income from end-users, in Microsoft’s case

through OEMs. On the other hand, makers of video game systems receive almost all their net

income from license fees charged to game developers; game consoles with operating systems

installed break even at best.106 The economic literature on two-sided markets makes it clear that

there is nothing inherently inefficient or anticompetitive in this sort of pricing, even if pricing

on one side of the market is below the marginal cost incurred there.107

           Another insight that emerges when one views markets through the multi-sided lens is

that the analysis of product design decisions, like the analysis of pricing decisions, must take

into account effects on all sides of the market. An important way in which all operating system


  work with hardware vendors (most prominently Intel) to ensure that Windows takes advantage of new devices
  and that those devices are designed to work well with Windows.

vendors compete for the allegiance of applications developers is by expanding the set of APIs

that can be employed to develop attractive applications.108 Since the marginal cost of

distributing additional APIs, once developed, as part of the operating system is zero, while

separate distribution would entail additional costs, this sort of bundling makes economic

sense.109 No court in this litigation—or any other of which we are aware—has condemned this

form of competition, even though in the case of Microsoft adding features and functionality to

Windows may help to preserve its market position. Indeed, the decision in the first appeal

explicitly said that “a monopolist does not violate the Sherman Act simply by developing an

attractive product.”110

           Operating systems also provide services directly to end-users. In the earliest versions of

MS-DOS, for instance, tiny programs were provided that enabled end users to rename, copy,

move, or delete files by calling the same code that applications programs could call. Similarly,

using IE 3 and later versions most commonly involved running a tiny application (itself called

by double-clicking the IE icon) to call published APIs (including those for the HTML rendering

engine) also available to application developers.111

           Generally, offering a better product to end-users would also be considered socially

valuable competition. Here, however, the courts found that because OEMs licensed Windows

in its entirety and were required to distribute and display this product with all of its features to

their customers, e.g., by retaining the IE icon on the Windows desktop, OEMs were reluctant to

distribute Navigator. The courts found that this at least could have prevented Navigator from

attaining the ubiquity it would have needed to become a platform competitor. Thus the offense

directly affected the end-user side of the market, not the ISV side, even though the alleged

competitive impact ultimately involved ISV behavior.

       C. Remedies Hearings and the Second Appeal

            The district court in the remedies hearing heard a good deal of expert testimony on

multi-use code, including the HTML rendering engine.112 The court did not explicitly

contradict the D.C. Circuit’s findings on commingling and add-remove, but it did note that

“Plaintiffs [i.e., the litigating states] have been unsuccessful at distinguishing the code which

comprises an ‘operating system’ from the code which comprises a non-operating system

‘Microsoft Middleware Product,’ such as a browser” and thus “Plaintiffs have not offered a

reasonable way for Microsoft to separate the code in order to comply with the code removal

requirements in Plaintiffs’ unbundling proposal.”113 If multi-use code is important, of course, it

is logically impossible to meet these burdens.

            The court went on to show an understanding of the multi-sided issues discussed above.

It found that even if one could remove middleware code without breaking Windows, “the

record is overwhelmed with significant unrebutted evidence that Plaintiffs proposal of code

computers would be reduced, and thus the quality of the product provided to the ISV side of the

market would be degraded.115 ISVs testified that the quality of their products would be reduced

because they could not count on the availability of all Windows APIs, and this obviously would

be a direct source of consumer harm.116 Moreover, the reliability of Windows would suffer.

Microsoft would be required to offer many different versions of Windows117 and it clearly

could not test each one as extensively as it now tests the single version it provides to OEMs.118

            Finally, the court pointed out that the violation had to do with discouraging OEMs from

distributing Netscape Navigator, because they were not free to choose to present Navigator or

another non-Microsoft browser by itself. IE always had to remain visible, and earlier decisions

found that OEMs were reluctant to present more than one browser because users would find it

confusing. Thus, the problem is on the end user side of the market, and “the evidence presented

to the Court indicates that the ability to remove end-user access to any commingled

functionality would sufficiently address the anticompetitive aspect of the conduct and would

prove far less disruptive to consumers and industry participants.”119

   One could argue, based on the recent experience discussed in III.D, that no OEM would have licensed a version
  of Windows with code removed, so that Windows would not in fact fragment. If this is true, of course, the
  litigating states remedy would have failed to achieve its stated purpose of fragmenting Windows. Memorandum

            On (the second) appeal, the D.C. Circuit unanimously and enthusiastically endorsed the

District Court’s choice of access removal over code removal: “Far from abusing its discretion,

therefore, the district court, by remedying the anticompetitive effect of commingling, went to

the heart of the problem that Microsoft had created, and it did so without intruding itself into

the design and engineering of the Windows operating system. We say, Well done!”120

        D. Recent Experience

            Microsoft began complying with the terms of the settlement in December 2001. In

September 2002, it released an updated version of Windows that included a new feature (Set

Program Access and Defaults) that made it easy for end users to disable access to Microsoft

middleware; made it easy for end users to set non-Microsoft products as the defaults for related

functions; and that made it easy for OEMs and end users to change their default Web browsers

and various other pieces of “middleware.”121 Also in August 2002, Microsoft announced that

the client-server communications protocols covered by the decree (roughly 100) had been

documented and were available for license.122

            After the consent decree, OEMs knew with certainty that shipping rival middleware

products would have no effect on their royalty payments or their terms and conditions for

Windows. Instead, OEMs make their own software choices and have, in fact, distributed third

party middleware in considerable numbers. Indeed, every major OEM has installed at least one

non-Microsoft media player on its consumer-oriented (as opposed to business-oriented) PCs,

   The other features that can be disabled are: Windows Media Player, Windows Messenger, Outlook Express,
  and Microsoft’s Java Virtual Machine.

                                                                                                           42
but none has blocked access to Windows Media Player.123 Similarly, all major OEMs display

an icon for America Online (AOL), but none has removed the icon for Microsoft’s competitive

service, MSN.124

        At the very least, this experience casts doubt on the liability theory that OEMs were

reluctant to install Navigator because they could not remove end-user access to Internet

Explorer. After all, end users always have been free to ignore and/or remove the icon and menu

entry for any piece of software that they do not want to use. On the other hand, little harm has

been done by giving OEMs this option. Consumers have not been deprived of choice;

Microsoft had been required to produce only a single version of Windows (albeit with a new

access-disabling feature); and ISVs know what APIs will be exposed by (and thus what

applications will run on) a Windows-based computer system.

        If the litigating states’ code removal proposal had been adopted instead, this experience

suggests that it is at least plausible that all major OEMs would nonetheless have licensed the

version of Windows from which no code had been removed (the “intact” version). While the

litigating states proposal would have made versions from which code had been removed

(“disabled” versions) somewhat cheaper than the intact version, the disabled versions would

124
   In connection with Microsoft’s appeal of the European Commission’s decision in Case COMP/C-3/37.792
  Microsoft, LECG staff undertook a study to determine the extent to which major OEMs in installed media
  players on computers that are sold for home and small office use. In the United States, they identified six OEMs
  that each accounted for at least 2 percent of units sold (Dell, eMachines, Gateway, HP/Compaq, Sony and
  Toshiba). Each of the PCs examined came with at least one third-party media player installed and an icon for
  America Online. Examination of the PCs also demonstrated that while some OEMs had made other media
  players the default players for various types of media files (including those using Microsoft’s own formats),
  none of the OEMs had blocked access to either Windows Media Player or MSN. A similar study done in 2002
  for Kevin Murphy’s testimony in Sun’s suit against Microsoft found that home and small office PCs from the
  leading OEMs included many third-party applications (many of which were classified as “middleware”),
  including media players. (Declaration of Kevin M. Murphy in Support of Microsoft’s Opposition to Sun

not only have lacked one or more features aimed at end-users, just as if end-user access had

been removed, but they would also have lacked the corresponding APIs. Accordingly, at least

some applications that ran on the intact version of Windows would fail to run on one or more

disabled versions. If this suggestion is right, and no significant OEM would sell PCs without

the intact version of Windows, only Microsoft would bear additional costs—the substantial

costs of designing and testing many disabled versions of Windows with ambiguous design

requirements.125 On the other hand, if this suggestion is wrong and some major OEMs would

distribute disabled versions of Windows, additional costs would be borne by consumers and

applications vendors (including Microsoft in that capacity), because, absent extensive and

expensive redesign, some Windows applications simply would not run on some Windows

machines. Accordingly, we believe the courts’ clear rejection of code removal benefited

consumers.

        Despite the rejection of code-removal by these two U.S. courts and the general access-

removal remedy provision in force worldwide since 2002, the European Commission has

ordered Microsoft to produce a version of Windows with the code for Windows Media Player

removed.126 The Commission’s order requires that the versions of Windows with code removed

126
   The Commission defined the files that constitute “Windows Media Player” as those identified as part of
  “multimedia applications” in Windows XP Embedded, a product designed to help manufacturers create very
  small versions of Windows for special purpose products (such as ATMs) that typically run only one or at most a
  handful of custom designed applications. (Commission Decision of 24.03.2004 relating to a proceeding under
  Article 82 of the EC Treaty (Case COMP/C-3/37.792 Microsoft), ¶¶ 1019, 1021, 1029, Article 1.6, available at
  http://europa.eu.int/comm/competition/antitrust/cases/decisions/37792/en.pdf.). For the current version of
  Windows, this definition results in the removal of 186 different files. The Korean FTC has been investigating
  tying claims against Microsoft, first with respect to instant messenger software and more recently with respect to
  media players, and it apparently is considering ordering code removal.


                                                                                                              44
be priced “no higher” than the intact version.127 That presumably recognizes the fact that media

players are widely available for free so that there is no basis for having a price difference

between software that includes or excludes this “free” feature. Since it is hard to imagine that

there would be much demand for Windows without media player, especially given that OEMs

and consumers are free to disable access to this feature under the U.S. consent decree, it would

appear likely that this remedy will impose costs on Microsoft but have little or no effect on the

market.128

V.      Other Substantive Provisions and Enforcement

      A. Other Substantive Remedy Provisions

        As Table 3 indicates, the remedy finally ordered went beyond the liability findings in

several ways. It defined “middleware” to include numerous features—such as instant

messaging and media players—that, unlike Java and Web browsers, had never been held out as

likely to become general-purpose platforms that could challenge Windows.129 In addition, the

remedy addressed Microsoft practices that had not been found illegal by the court of appeals.

Notable among these is action A.1 in Table 2: individually negotiated royalty rates and

discounts for large OEMs that met the terms of “market development agreements.” Under the

remedy, Microsoft has to offer uniform terms to the top 10 OEMs, with prices varying only by

volume and with any discounts based on criteria that are objectively verifiable.

            Similarly, even though the case had focused on “client” PCs, and there had been no

allegations of anticompetitive conduct with respect to servers, provision III.E of the remedy

required that Microsoft license all communications protocols used to exchange information

between Windows clients and servers. Microsoft was allowed to charge reasonable and non-

discriminatory royalties, and the licenses were restricted to use in achieving interoperability

between Windows clients and non-Microsoft servers. The district court judge stated that this

provision, “[i]n all likelihood…is the most forward-looking provision in the Court’s

remedy.”130 This provision was a limited version of what Sun and other server vendors

(including Novell and IBM) had been seeking from the European Commission since 1998.131

             As summarized in Table 3, the decree included numerous other provisions limiting

Microsoft’s conduct, including prohibitions on taking any retaliatory action against a wide

range of firms for their support of products that compete with Microsoft products (III.A, C, and

F), a requirement to document any interfaces used between Microsoft middleware and other

parts of Windows (III.D), and a prohibition on entering into agreements that require the other

party to use any Microsoft platform software exclusively or that place quantitative limits on the

use of competing non-Microsoft software by the other party (III.G).

       B. Enforcement Mechanisms and Results

            The settlement agreement required that Microsoft begin complying with its terms before

it was entered by the courts. As noted earlier, that process started in December 2001, a month

after the settlement was reached, with Microsoft offering uniform terms for Windows licenses

   The 2004 European Commission decision discussed above requires Microsoft to license a subset of these
  protocols, but does not restrict their use to client-server communication. More importantly, it also requires that
  Microsoft license additional protocols used in server-to-server communication.


                                                                                                                46
to the top 20 OEMs.132 By September 2002, Microsoft had met all of the deadlines in the

settlement/decree that called for specific actions.

        To aid the government in monitoring Microsoft’s compliance and resolving technical

issues, the remedy set up a “Technical Advisory Committee” with three members (plus staff),

to be funded by Microsoft. The committee members were selected in early 2003. Starting in

April 2003, the government and Microsoft have submitted status reports to the district court at

roughly three-month intervals, with shorter interim reports on specific issues submitted from

time to time.133

        The status reports indicate that implementation of the remedy has gone smoothly for

almost all provisions. To the extent that issues have arisen, for the most part they have been

resolved quickly. For example, in response to the government’s request, Microsoft moved the

icon for the Set Program Access and Defaults feature to a more prominent position134 and

changed a new feature (Shop for Music Online) so that it used the default browser rather than

Internet Explorer.135 Government representatives meet with those from Microsoft on a regular

basis. Recent status reports indicate that the government is taking a proactive approach to the

next major version of Windows—code named Longhorn—which is not scheduled for release

until some time in 2006. The government has given Microsoft a list of topics related to the final

judgment that it wants to be tracked and has asked for “regular briefings…to enable early

detection and resolution of any potential areas of concern.”136

        The licensing program for client-server protocols has been the exception to this pattern

of smooth implementation, with the government raising a series of issues starting with the first

status report and continuing to the present. That this provision, which does not correspond to

any of the acts found illegal, should be the biggest source of friction in enforcement is perhaps

ironic, but not surprising.137 The licensing program is complicated and open to conflicting

interpretations. Microsoft is required to license use of the protocols on reasonable and

nondiscriminatory terms. Most of the initial concerns focused on those terms, leading to

significant changes in the licenses (e.g., simplifying the terms), the conditions under which

potential licensees can review the licenses and protocol specifications, and royalty rates. Those

issues appear largely to have been resolved by Microsoft’s changes.138

        More recently, the government has focused on the completeness of the specifications.

Microsoft created about 5,000 pages of technical documentation for the roughly 100 protocols

covered by the program. Determining how much documentation is required to implement

137
   It is also interesting to note that implementation of a 1994/95 settlement between Microsoft and the Department
  of Justice also proceeded smoothly with respect to the provisions related directly to the alleged anticompetitive
  behavior: certain types of contracts with OEMs. The provision that led to the greatest controversy and conflict,
  including a 1997 contempt hearing and the 1998 lawsuit that is the focus of this paper, was one that prohibited
  “tying” except in the case of “integrated products.” Tying had not been an issue during the several years of
  investigation by the DOJ and the FTC that preceded the settlement, and we understand from participants in the
  settlement negotiations that it was added at the end, as an afterthought.

complex software protocols in operational code is inherently complex, with differences in

interpretation and understanding almost inevitable. Microsoft has supplemented its

specifications, and the Technical Advisory Committee (with the aid of consultants and staff)

has developed 50 pages of clarifying detail for the specifications (which were already over

2,000 pages).139 Microsoft submitted revisions in December 2004, which the plaintiffs

characterized in the January 2005 report as an improvement. The report stated that Microsoft

had agreed with plaintiffs on a “comprehensive plan to ensure the completeness and accuracy

of the technical documentation and to accomplish further work on the documentation.”140

Earlier, as of the July 2004 report, Microsoft had unilaterally extended the licensing program

for an additional two years—from 2007 to 2009—to address concerns about the time it had

taken to resolve various related issues.141

        On the whole, the remedy appears to be working as intended, but it is much less clear

that it has had a material impact on market outcomes. As we noted earlier, for example,

apparently no OEM has exercised its right under the decree to disable ready access to IE or any

other covered middleware. Nonetheless, OEMs appear to feel free to install non-Microsoft

middleware (sometimes several different brands), such as media players and Internet access

services, in addition to the features in Windows—as they have always been permitted to do

under the terms of Windows license agreements, even before this litigation began.

        With respect to the protocol licensing program, the government’s status reports have

expressed concern that there have not been many licensees (21 as of January 2005) and that

virtually all have been for specialized uses, rather than server operating systems or other

software seen as posing a significant potential threat to Microsoft’s position in PC operating

systems.142 Some argue that this reveals that the remedy was inadequate, but it seems at least as

plausible that the theory behind the licensing provision—that potential competitors in server

operating systems or server-based middleware needed access to those protocols in order to

compete effectively—was incorrect. The government reports that prospective licensees cite

three types of reasons for not obtaining a license: (1) they found certain provisions (such as

royalties or the lack of actual source code in addition to specifications) unattractive; (2) they

did not need the protocols; or (3) they had not invested the resources to evaluate the terms of

the licenses or the value of the technology.143 The second and third reasons cast no doubt on the

remedy’s adequacy, and complaints about licensing terms may mean that the effective cost is

“too high” (by some unspecified standard) or simply that the value to the potential licensees is

too low to justify paying even “reasonable” costs.

VI.     Evaluation and Conclusions
        Who won the Microsoft case? One could argue that the government won. Microsoft was

found to have monopoly power in PC operating systems and to have violated the Sherman Act

in trying to keep that monopoly. That finding has enabled various parties—from class actions

representing consumers to companies such as AOL and Sun—to obtain billions of dollars in

settlements as well as other concessions from Microsoft.144 Moreover, ultimate relief was much

more than the government sought in its initial complaints and more than might have been

entered by the trial court, on remand, if it had construed the D.C. Circuit’s instructions

narrowly.

        Of course, one seldom hears the case’s strongest early proponents declaring victory.

More often, there are complaints that Microsoft got off too lightly. Many of the case’s

proponents and press accounts suggest that Microsoft benefited from a Republican

administration taking over from a Democratic one.145 We do not believe a careful reading of the

two unanimous en banc decisions of the D.C. Circuit supports that view.

        One can also argue that Microsoft won a victory of sorts—or lost much less than it

might have. Most of its challenged behavior—particularly its heavy investment in developing,

   Mike Pettit, President of ProComp, issued this statement in November 2002 after the release of J. Colleen
  Kollar-Kotelly’s decision: “Microsoft has terrorized the industry for more than a decade. Victims of Microsoft's
  predatory conduct are legion. This was the moment in time when competition could have been restored; that
  task will be much more difficult in the future. The right case was brought and won resoundingly. Eight federal
  judges ruled unanimously against Microsoft. And then what happened can only be explained this way: the Bush
  Justice Department surrendered to Microsoft.” (See, ProComp, Microsoft Settlement Sets Dangerous Precedent
  in Antitrust Law, Nov. 1, 2002, available at http://www.procompetition.org/headlines/110102.html (last visited

                                                                                                             51
improving, promoting, and distributing Internet Explorer—was found lawful. The company

managed to defeat some remedy proposals that would have been highly damaging. Most

importantly, the U.S. courts did not condemn Microsoft’s inclusion of new features in the

operating system as a general matter, and the D.C. Circuit at least has specifically ruled that

tying issues related to software platforms must be considered under the rule of reason rather

than the Jefferson Parish per se test.

        But Microsoft has not declared victory—in fact it has been conciliatory146 and vows to

do better. While we suspect that many of its executives long for the days of go-for-the-throat

competition, willingly or unwillingly, and for better or worse, the company is a more careful

competitor than it was seven years ago.

        We have argued here that consumers in the aggregate could justifiably declare at least a

modest victory. While we, as noted above, believe the appeals court should have required

evidence of actual or likely future consumer harm before finding Microsoft to have violated the

Sherman Act, it is hard to argue that the remedy ultimately imposed will harm consumers by

appreciably restricting Microsoft’s ability to innovate or compete on the merits—though it will

certainly make life more complex for Microsoft executives. If one believes that Microsoft is

prone to anticompetitive behavior of the sort at issue in the case, then one must believe that the

remedy is likely to prevent future at least some violations that might harm consumers. Finally,

if one believes that during the relevant period Microsoft was simply an immature company,

prone to behavior that the second District Judge described as “unsavory” and

Table 2. Disposition of Monopoly Maintenance Violations

A.   Not Adjudicated by the Court of Appeals
     1.      Microsoft used discounts and other devices to reward or punish OEMs, depending on whether they
             aided or resisted its anticompetitive agenda.
     2.      In June 1995, Microsoft proposed a division of the market to Netscape.
     3.      Microsoft withheld important technical information from Netscape.
     4–7.    To further anticompetitive objectives, Microsoft pressured Intel concerning its “Native Signal
             Processing” (NSP) software, Apple and RealNetworks concerning their media players, and IBM
             concerning promotion of its “Smart Suite” business productivity software.
B.   Reversed by the Court of Appeals
     Course of Conduct
     1.      Microsoft’s general course of conduct was predatory, particularly its large investments in Internet
             Explorer (IE), which it gave away.
     Binding Internet Explorer
     2.      Windows overrode the user’s choice of a default browser by launching IE in some circumstances.
     Original Equipment (Computer) Manufacturers (OEMs)
     3.      Microsoft barred OEMs from causing a user interface other than the Windows desktop to launch
             automatically.
     Internet Access Providers (IAPs)
     4.      Microsoft provided IE for free to IAPs.
     5.      Microsoft offered IAPs a bounty for each customer signed up using IE.
     6.      Microsoft provided at no charge valuable software that IAPs could use to customize IE—the
             Internet Explorer Access Kit.
     Internet Content Providers (ICPs)
     7.      Microsoft gave some ICPs prominent placement on the Windows “Active Desktop” in exchange for
             agreeing to limit promotion and distribution of non-Microsoft Web browsers.
     Java
     8.      Microsoft developed a Java Virtual Machine that was incompatible with Sun’s.
C.   Affirmed by the Court of Appeals
     Binding Internet Explorer
     1.      Commingling code specific to Web browsing with code that performs core operating system
             functions, so that deletion of browsing-specific code would cripple Windows.
     2.      Microsoft’s Add/Remove utility for Windows 98, which could be used by consumers to remove
             some features and functions, could not be used to remove Internet Explorer.
     Original Equipment (Computer) Manufacturers (OEMs)
     3.      Microsoft prohibited OEMs from removing any desktop icons, folders, or “Start” menu entries,
             thereby preventing them from removing visible means of user access to IE.
     4.      Microsoft prohibited OEMs from modifying the initial boot sequence, which occurs the first time
             the computer is turned on, thus preventing them from using that process to promote the services of
             IAPs distributing Navigator.
     5.      Microsoft prohibited OEMs from adding icons or folders different in size or shape from those
             supplied by Microsoft, thereby preventing OEMs from using such folders or icons to promote rival
             browsers more prominently.
     6.      Microsoft prohibited OEMs from using the ‘Active Desktop’ feature to promote third-party
             browsers or IAPs.
                                                                                             continued below…




                                                                                                          55
Table 2 (continued). Disposition of Monopoly Maintenance Violations
     Internet Access Providers (IAPs)
     7.      Microsoft agreed to provide promotion or distribution to IAPs in return for the IAPs’ agreement to
             promote IE exclusively and to ensure that IE comprised at least a specified percentage of the IAPs’
             distribution of Web browsing software.
     Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) and Apple
     8.*     In “First Wave” agreements, Microsoft promised to give preferential technical support to ISVs that
             agree, among other things, to use IE as the default for any software they developed under the
             program with a hypertext-based user interface.
     9.      Microsoft agreed to continue developing Office for the Macintosh only when Apple agreed to make
             IE the default browser on its operating system and not to put icons for non-Microsoft browsers on
             the Macintosh desktop.
     Java
     10.     One of the conditions in Microsoft’s “First Wave” agreements was that ISVs that developed a Java
             application under the program make Microsoft’s JRE the default and distribute that JRE with the
             application.
     11.     Microsoft’s Java application development tools deceived developers into writing Java applications
             that were not portable but ran only on Windows.
     12.     Microsoft threatened Intel and induced it to stop working with Sun on certain multimedia
             technologies for Java.




                                                                                                          56
Table 3. Major Definitions and Substantive Remedy Provisions

Definitions
    Microsoft Platform Software: Windows and its successor operating systems, and Microsoft Middleware.
    Microsoft Middleware: Includes Microsoft’s Internet browser, Java Virtual Machine, email client
    software, media player, instant messaging software, and more.
    Non-Microsoft Middleware: A product running on Windows “that exposes a range of functionality to
    ISVs through published APIs” and that could make it easier for an ISV to port an application using that
    functionality to a non-Microsoft operating system.
Key Provisions
    III.A      Microsoft shall not threaten or act against an OEM for “developing, distributing, promoting,
               using, selling or licensing” any product that competes with Microsoft Platform Software or that
               distributes or promotes any “Non-Microsoft Middleware” or for shipping a PC including or
               capable of booting with a non-Microsoft operating system.
               Addresses: Action A.1.
    III.B      Microsoft may not negotiate license terms with each of the top 20 OEMs individually but must
               instead work from a published royalty schedule that meets certain conditions on allowable
               discounts and allowances.
               Addresses: Action A.1.
    III.C. Microsoft may not restrict any OEM from installing and displaying icons, shortcuts of any size or
    1–2        shape, or menu entries that for any “non-Microsoft Middleware” or any product or service
               (including but not limited to IAPs) that “distributes, uses, promotes, or supports” any such
               middleware.
               Addresses: Actions C.5 and C.6, with more software covered.
    III.C. Microsoft may not restrict any OEM from modifying the boot sequence, choosing non-Microsoft
    3-5        middleware to launch if Microsoft middleware would otherwise launch “upon connections to or
               disconnections from the Internet,” providing the option to launch other operating systems, or
               presenting its own IAP offer in the initial boot sequence.
               Addresses: Action C.4.
    III.D      Microsoft must document all interfaces used by “Microsoft Middleware” to operate with other
               parts of Microsoft operating systems.
               Addresses: Issues not raised in the trial.
    III.E      Microsoft must license to third parties on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms all
               communications protocols used by Microsoft operating systems to interoperate or communicate
               directly with a Microsoft server operating system.
               Addresses: Issues not raised in the trial.
    III.F      Microsoft shall not threaten or act against any ISV or IHV (independent hardware vendor, e.g.
               Apple) for developing, using, distributing or promoting any software that competes with (or runs
               on software that competes with) “Microsoft Platform Software” nor may it enter into any
               agreement with an ISV relating to a Microsoft operating system that provides that ISV with
               consideration for refraining from such acts.
               Addresses: Actions C.8, C.9, C.10, and C.12, with more software covered.
    III.G      Microsoft shall not enter into any agreement that grants consideration on the condition that any
               Microsoft Platform Software be distributed, promoted, used, or supported exclusively or in a
               fixed percentage (unless competing software can obtain a higher percentage) or grant any IAP or
               ICP placement on the Windows desktop on condition that it refrain from distributing, promoting,
               or using software that competes with Microsoft Middleware.
               Addresses: Actions C.7, C.8, C.9, and C.10, with more software covered.
                                                                                                continued below…
Note: Except where explicitly noted, these descriptions are paraphrases, not quotations. With the exception of
          III.E, which Microsoft unilaterally extended to 2009, these provisions will expire in November 2007
          unless the District Court orders an extension. Note that Actions A.1-A.7 were not considered by the Court
          of Appeals; Actions B.1-B.8 were explicitly found not to be violations; while Actions C.1-C.12 were
          explicitly found to be violations.

Table 3 (continued). Major Definitions and Substantive Remedy Provisions

Key Provisions (continued)
    III.H.     Microsoft must make it easy for end users and OEMs to enable or remove access to each
    1–2        Microsoft Middleware Product or non-Microsoft Middleware Product and to designate either a
               non-Microsoft Middleware Product or a Microsoft Middleware Product as the default, to be
               invoked whenever Windows would ordinarily launch the Microsoft Middleware Product.
               Addresses: Actions C.1, C.2, C.3, with more software covered.
    III.H. Windows may not alter an OEM’s configuration of icons, shortcuts, or menu entries without first
    3          seeking confirmation from the end user, and any pre-defined alteration must be unbiased between
               Microsoft and non-Microsoft Middleware.
               Addresses: Action C.5, with more software covered.
    III.I      Microsoft must license to third parties under reasonable and non-discriminatory terms any
               intellectual property rights needed to exercise any of the options or alternatives provided to them
               under this order.
               Addresses: Workability of other provisions.
Note: Except where explicitly noted, these descriptions are paraphrases, not quotations. With the exception of
