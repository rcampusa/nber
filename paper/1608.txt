                     Part—Time Work vs. Full—Time
                    Work of Married Women in Japan


                                ABSTRACT




     In this paper, we attempt to resolve the drawbacks in previous
studies of the labor supply of women in Japan. We hypothesize here
that the response to the socioeconomic factors that influence the
decision to work varies among different groups of women, and we estimate

separately the labor supply of part—time employed, and that of full—
time employed, married women by using the 1980 Population Census
data for Japan.

     The major finding is that there is a clear difference in the
labor supply behavior of women who are employed part time and those
who are employed full time. For example, the estimated elasticities
are noticeably different for the following factors: women's wages,
men's wages, the unemployment rate, the industry—mix variable, and
the provision of day—care centers and nursery schools.

     Our empirical results suggest that, in public policy implementa-
tion, giving special attention to the specific characteristics of the
labor market of women in Japan would be useful and important in under-

standing the different responses to the factors influencing the deci-
sion to work among the different socioeconomic groups.

I. INTRODUCTION

Over the two decades from the early 1960s to the present, the propor-
tion of married women in the labor force as employees has grown conspi-

cuously, from 32.7 percent in 1962 to 58.0 percent in 1981.1 The 1980
Population Census of Japan reveals that approximately 50 percent of
married women (with spouses present) in urban Japan were employed
either part time or full time. The proportion of employed married

women in urban Japan who worked part time was surprisingly large:
50 percent. For the purpose of assisting public policy implementation,
it would be useful to understand the factors influencing the decision

of women to join the labor market, both for part—time, and for full—
time, employed married women. In this study, we hypothesize that the
behavioral pattern will differ for part-time employed, and full—time
employed, married women.

     Among a number of the explanations for the steady increase in
the labor force participation of married women in Japan is the notion

that the changing industrial structure has influenced the nature of
the composition of the labor force, e.g., the increasing proportion of

married women as employees. The shortage of youth labor due to the
unprecedented increase in the number of young people obtaining higher

education compelled employers to hire married women in secondary and
tertiary industries. In addition, the historic increase in women's
life expectancy and the rapid decrease in marital fertility, by
                                 —2—

increasing the number of years women can work, have made it possible
for more married women to join the labor market.
     In previous studies of the labor force behavior of women in
Japan, the estimates of the effect of women's wage rate on their
labor supply differ sharply according to the type of data on the labor
supply of women used. In particular, there are three noticeable draw-
backs in those studies. First, the studies do not isolate employees

from self—employed and unpaid family workers, e.g., Hamilton (1979).
Second, the studies do not differentiate part—time employed women from
their full-time counterparts, e.g., Nagano (1980) and Shirnada et al.

(1981), as summarized by Hill (1982). Third, the studies do not separate
married women from single women, e.g., Hill (1984)
     The first drawback often results in observed negative estimates of
women's wage rates in models of their labor supply. The second one
indicates that the difference in the response to socioeconomic factors

by part-time and full-time employed women is totally ignored. Finally,
the third drawback is that the estimates obtained from the models, in
which married women and single women are lumped together, produce mis-
leading policy implications because the behavioral pattern of labor
supply decisions of married women differs that of single women in
response to socioeconomic factors.

     The present paper specifically focuses on the difference in the
behavioral response to the socioeconomic factors that affect the labor
supply decision of part-time and full-time employed women. To elimi-
nate the drawbacks arising from the previous analyses, we apply a logit
                                  —3—

model to the labor supply of married women in urban Japan, rather than

to the labor supply of part-time and full—time employed married women
lumped together. The logit model with a discrete—choice variable is
considered a closer approximation of the reality of the labor supply
decision for married women than the models with a continuous dependent

variable, e.g., working hours, in Japan (Shimada and Higuchi 1985).
In other words, this study will assist in the understanding of the
labor supply of married women in contrast to most previous studies,

which treated married women together with single women in the labor
supply models.

     The organization of the subsequent sections is as follows:
Section II describes our method of analysis of the labor supply of

married women and briefly mentions theoretical predictions of the
variables in the model. Section III reports the empirical results.
Finally, Section IV gives our conclusion.

II. METHOD OF ANALYSIS

The variables in our model are cross—sectional market averages obtained

from the 1980 Population Census of Japan. The units of observation are
the 47 prefectures of Japan.2 Cain and Dooley (1976) and Link and
Settle (1981) discuss the advantages of models that use cross-sectional
market averages 3; variations in tastes and transitory wages within a

given geographical area can be averaged out. In addition, by treating
part—time and full—time employment of married women in separate models,
differentiating married women from all women, and urban Japan from all

of Japan, will represent a relatively homogeneous group of married
women and produce consistent estimates of the structural parameters.
     Our model assumes that each individual married women has a choice

either to participate in the labor force as an employee or not.4 The
logit model of the labor supply of married women is defined as follows:


                 P = F(Y) = 1 / (1 + e   ), ..... (1)
where P is the probability of participation in the labor force, F() is
the cumulative logistic probability function, and X is a vector of
independent variables (a subscript is omitted for brevity). P in the
model is not observable and is limited between 0 and 1. The variable
for P in our model uses three different measures: LFPART, the propor-
tion of married women over age 15 who participate in the labor force

as part—time employees; LFFULL, the proportion of married women over
age 15 who participate in the labor force as full—time employees; and
LFPR, the proportion of married women over age 15 who are either
                                      —5—

 part—time employed, full—time employed, or unemployed, married women.5
      Our econometric model is defined as follows:


LF* = g(LNwOMw, LNALW, INDMIX, UNEMPL, EDUCAT, NURSER)
                                                                        (2)
          +       —       +     +or—     —       +

where LF* = log(P/(l—P)) and the variables in equation (2) are defined
in Table 3. Equation (2) is estimated with the weight, WGT = (TOTMAR x
P x (1—P))1'12 in which TOTMAR is the number of total married women, 15

years of age and over.6

      The symbols under each variable in the model indicate the expected

sign of the estimated regression coefficients. The rationale for these
expected signs is well understood in the literature (e.g., Cain and

Dooley 1976; Dooley 1982; Fields 1976; Long and Jones 1980; and Mincer
1962) ,   which we may summarize briefly here. Women's market wages in a
natural logarithm (LNWONW) will have a positive effect on the partici-
pation of married women in the labor force because the higher market
wages will cover more individuals with different reservation wages,

ceteris paribus (Ben—Porath 1973). The expected sign of an industry—
mix variable (INDMIX), which represents employment opportunities for
women, is positive since the variable measures the relative importance

of industries that are relatively heavy employers of women (Bowen and
Finegan 1969; Fields 1976) .    The effect of the market unemployment
rate (LJNENPL) is ambiguous, although a negative discouraged worker
effect seems to dominate a positive added worker effect, in Japan

(Furugori 1980; Shimada and Higuchi 1985) and in the United States

(Dooley 1982). The proportion of pre—school children who attend either
                                  —6—

day—care centers or nursery schools (NURSER) will have a positive effect
because of the potential opportunity for married women with pre—school
children to substitute those services for their own time—inputs in child-

rearing (Schultz 1978).
    Now we examine the difference in the behavioral response between

part—time and full—time employed married women to the socioeconomic
factors affecting their labor supply decision.

 III. EMPIRICAL RESULTS

We applied the logit model of the labor supply of the married women to
 the 1980 Population Census data for Japan by the method of generalized
 least squares (GLS). The empirical estimates are given in Table 1.
The first column in the table reports the results for the model of the

part-time labor supply of married women (LFPART), the second for the
model of their full-time counterparts (LFFULL), and the third for the
model of the labor force participation rate of married women (LFPR)

The corresponding elasticities at the sample means are reported in
Table 2.

     In each of the three models in Table 1, the women's wages (LNWOMW)9

are statistically significant. We obtain the positive sign by differen-
tiating employees from self—employed and unpaid family workers in cont-
rast to the negative coefficients obtained by Hamilton (1979) and
Umetani (1972), which treated the three groups together as the female
labor supply. The estimated own—wage elasticities of the part—time
employed married women (LFPART), the full-time employed married women
(LFFULL), and the labor force participation rate of married women (LFPR)
are 0.65, 0.15, and 0.63, respectively, as reported in Table 2. The
relatively large own-wage elasticity for the part—time employed married
women indicates the strong substitution between leisure, work at home,
and work in the labor market, compared with the own—wage elasticity of
the full-time employed married women. A recent study by Hill (1984)
based on the 1970 Population Census data reports 0.44 for the own—wage
elasticity of all females in all of Japan. In addition to the sample
differences in time and data, the reason for the different own—wage
                                  —8—

elasticity obtained by Hill probably comes from the fact that the part—
time and full—time employed married women as well as those single women

were lumped together as the female labor supply. Shimada and Higuchi
(1985) report the own—wage elasticities for female labor supply in the
range of 0.50 (ages 30—34) and 0.04 (ages 35—39) based on time—series
quarterly data, 1967—81, while their estimates on the own—wage elasti-
city based on cross—sectional micro data in 1977 are negative for

married women ages 25-34, but postive ranging from 0.04 to 0.22 for
                                                        10
those married women ages 35—49 and ages 50 and older.

     In comparison with recent studies of the labor supply of married
women with U.S. data, our estimated own-wage elasticity of LFPART is
larger, and that of LFPR is generally smaller, than the corresponding

own—wage elasticities of married women in the United States.11 Long
and Jones (1980) report 0.25 for the own-wage elasticity of part—time
married women workers. Other studies, which do not differentiate
part—time from full—time employed married women, show 1.28 for a mean
of eleven studies (Keeley 1981), 2.0 (Cain and Dooley 1976), and
2.2 and 3.5 (Shapiro and Shaw 1983).

    The estimated men's wage effect (LNMALW in a natural logarithm)12
is significantly negative. The estimated elasticities at the sample
means are —0.13, -1.18, and —0.70 for LFPART, LFFULL, and LFPR, respec-
tively, as shown in Table 2. The observed elasticity of LFPR (—0.70)
conceals the clear difference in the response to LNMALW between the

part-time and full-time employed married women. Nagano (1980), using
1977 prefectural data, and Shimada et al. (1981) and Shimada and

Higuchi (1985), using 1977 micro data, report the various men's wage
                                    —9—

elasticities for different age groups ranging from —0.38 to —0.72, from
—0.02 to —0.31, and from —0.02 to —0.40, respectively. Since these
studies do not differentiate part—time from full—time female employ-

ment, the ranges of their estimated elsticities will vary on a larger
scale than their findings if each group of employment was separately
estimated.

     The predominantly negative sign of the unemployment coefficient
(UNEMPL) for LFPR in the third column in Table 1 reflects the fact

that a discouraged worker effect considerably outweighs an added worker
effect for married women in Japan. This finding based on the cross—
sectional data of the 1980 Population Census supports the previous
time—series studies of female labor force by Furugori (1980) and
Shimada and Higuchi (1985). However, our finding shows that the domi-
nant discouraged worker effect is pertinent to the part—time employed
married women (LFPART) rather than to the full-time employed married
women (LFFULL) .   That is, part—time employees are more vulnerable to
the business cycle than their full—time counterparts. The elasticity of
the part—time employed married women is —0.25 at the sample means
(See the first column under LFPART in Table 2).

     The effect of the industry—mix variable (INDMIX) is significantly
positive for part—time employed married women while it is negative for
their full—time counterparts. The seemingly "wrong" sign f or the full—
time employed married women might reflect the particular labor market
for them after the 1979 oil crisis in Japan. The uncertain economic

enviroment and prospect in 1980 right after the oil crisis likely
                                  — 10 —



induced employers to avoid hiring full-time employed married women with
high quasi—fixed costs, and to substitute part—time employees with the
relatively lower costs. (See the significantly positive coefficient of
1NDNIX for the part-time employed married women under LFPART in Table 1).
     The results of the estimated coefficients of female education

(EDUCAT) are significant for LFPART (-1.03) and LFPR (-1.22), but not
for LFFULL (0.26). The negative effect of EDUCAT is prevalent in the
studies of female labor supply in Japan, e.g., Umetani (1972), Nagano
(1980), and Hill (1984). The negative coefficient for LFPART in our
study indicates that an increase in female education incurs higher
opportunity costs for married women to stay in low—wage—paid jobs such

as part—time employment. Therefore, married women with more education
tend to avoid joining the part-time labor markets, which are largely
manual jobs in Japan (Japan, Department of Labor 1982) •13
     The enrollment of pre—school children in either day—care centers
or nursery schools (NURSER) is statistically significant for LFPART
(0.62), LFFULL (1.59), and LFPR (2.05) and the sign is as hypothesized.
The estimated elasticities for part—time and full—time employed married

women are 0.32 and 0.80, respectively (See Table 2). The relatively
large elasticity of the full—time employed married women shows that the
recent increase in the number of day—care centers and nursery schools
in Japan has made it easier for married women to obtain full-time

employment than part—time employment jobs. However, with a higher
participation of married women with pre-school children in the labor
force, the demand for day—care centers and nursery schools will increase.
Therefore, the causality between NURSER and LFFULL (and/or LFPART) may
be dual.

IV.   CONCLUSION

In this paper, we have attempted to resolve the drawbacks in previous
studies of the labor supply of women in Japan. The three noticeable

drawbacks were: first, employees, self—employed workers, and unpaid
family workers are often lumped together in measuring the labor supply
of women; second, part—time and full—time employees are treated toge-
ther; and third, the labor supply of single and married women are
estimated together.
      We hypothesized that the response to the socioeconomic factors
that influence the decision to work varies among different groups of

of women. Because of the importance of the growing number of employed
married women, we focused separately on part—time and full—time employed
married wOmen, using the 1980 Population Census data for Japan.
      The major finding is that there is a clear behavioral difference
for married women in the decision to work either part time or full

time. The relatively large own—wage elasticity for the part—time
employed married women, compared with their full—time counterparts,
indicates the strong substitution among leisure, work at home, and
work in the labor force. The effect of men's wages on the labor
supply of married women varies for the part—time and full—time

employees very strongly. The part—time employed married women are more
vulnerable to the business cycle than their full—time counterparts.

The changing industrial structure has helped married women to work
part time in manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade, and the service
industries. Finally, the recent increase in the number of day—care
                                  — 15 —



centers   and nursery schools has made it easier for married women to
choose full—time jobs rather than part-time jobs.

     To assist public policy implementation, the above empirical
results suggest that special attention to the specific characteristics
of the labor market of women in Japan would be useful and important

in understanding the difference in the response to the factors
influencing the decision to work among the different socioeconomic
groups.

                                 NOTES
     1. Japan, Department of Labor, Actual Conditions of Women's Labor

(Fujin Roudo No Jitsujou in Japanese), 1982.

     2. In Japan, there are 47 prefectures (legislative units), each of
which has rural and urban areas. In this study, we used the grouped
data for urban areas.
     3. By using micro data, the recent theoretical and empirical works
of labor supply can be found in Gronau (1974), Heckman (1974 and 1979),

Hill (1983) , and Smith (1980)

     4. Shirnada and Higuchi (1985) point out that "analysis of aggregate
female labor force data is misleading since these data include hetero-

geneous groups of the self—employed, unpaid family workers, and paid
employees, whose behaviors are quite different. The analysis of paid

employees alone,..., provided reasonable results, comparable with recent
experiences of other advanced economies (p.372) ."

     5. LFPR is not exactly comparable to the standard definition of
labor force participation rate because self—employed and unpaid family
workers of married women are not included in the numerator of LFPR.

     6. p in the model is substituted by LFPART for part-time employees,
LFFULL for full-time employees, and LFPR for employees and unemployed
married women.
     7. The industry-mix variable is constructed by using the following

industries: agriculture, forestry and hunting, fishery and aquaculture,
mining, construction, manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade, finance

and insurance, real estate, transportation and communication, utilities
(electricity, water, and steam), services, and government.
                                   N- 2


      8. We used a dichotomous choice model for each of LFPART, LFFULL,
 and LFPR since our cross—sectional data are market averages. In micro

data analysis, a trichotomous choice model (part—time, full—time, and
not in the labor force) of the labor supply is, however, more suitable

than the dichotomous choice model. The trichotorrtous choice model

normalizes the parameters of independent variables such as          =   0,
where B represents the parameters of a given independent variable in

the model and "j" represents part—time, full—time, and not in the labor
force.

     9. LNWONW is a natural logarithm of PARTWG for LFPART, that of
WIFEWG for LFFULL, and that of a weighted average of FENAWG and PARTWG

weighted by the respective fractions of full—time and part—time employees
for LFPR.

    10. The unsatisfactory results for married women ages 25—34 in
addition to those of the relatively small own—wage elasticities may

indicate that their model is inadequately specified, e.g., errors in

measurement or omission of relevant variables. For example, they
did not correct sample selection bias in their micro data analysis.
    11. Needless to say, a comparison of the own—wage elasticity
for married women in Japan and those in the United States should

require cautious interpretation since specification in the models
differs beside the difference in the labor market structures.

    12. LNMALW is a natural logarithm of MALFIN, rather than MALCIN,

for LFPART because of strong multicollinearity between PARTWG and
MALCIN. A nutural logarithm of MALCIN is used to represent LNMALW
for LFFULL and LFPR.

    13. Female education may reflect their tastes for market work

and/or access to jobs with nonpecuniary benefits (Cain and Dooly
1976) .   Also,   their education may have a nonneutral effect on the
productivity of time in the labor market than that of time spent

in household production (Leibowitz 1974). These hypotheses predict
a positive effect of female education on their labor supply.
