                                         ABSTRACT

Many opioid control policies target the prescribing behavior of health care providers. In this
paper, we study the first comprehensive state-level policy requiring providers to access patients'
opioid history before making prescribing decisions. We compare prescribers in Kentucky, which
implemented this policy in 2012, to those in a control state, Indiana. Our main difference-in-
differences analysis uses the universe of prescriptions filled in the two states to assess how the
information provided affected prescribing behavior. As many as forty percent of low-volume
opioid prescribers stopped prescribing opioids altogether after the policy was implemented.
Among other providers, the major margin of response was to prescribe opioids to approximately
sixteen percent fewer patients. While providers disproportionately discontinued treating patients
whose opioid histories showed the use of multiple providers, there were also economically-
meaningful reductions for patients without multiple providers and single-use acute patients.

                                     I.   Introduction

  The number of prescription opioids filled in the U.S. increased by roughly 300% in the
first decade of the twenty-first century (Kunins, Farley and Dowell, 2013), contributing
to a similarly dramatic increase in overdose deaths (Chen, Hedegaard and Warner, 2014;
Dart et al., 2015; Rudd et al., 2016). Although the total volume of prescriptions has
declined since 2010, nearly 2 million Americans had an opioid addiction in 2015 (Han
et al., 2017). While illicitly imported or manufactured narcotics are now a significant
contributor, the epidemic has its roots in the misuse of prescriptions legally obtained from
medical professionals. Thus, a number of policy responses to the opioid epidemic have
targeted prescribing behavior.
  Among the most significant policy responses to this public health crisis are state-level
Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs). These systems track all purchases
of DEA-scheduled drugs in the state and generate patient histories. The data are often
used to flag inappropriate or suspicious utilization. Current programs are designed to
influence the behavior of healthcare practitioners by providing comprehensive and timely
information about patients' prescription histories. Forty-nine states have established a
PDMP and many have strengthened their programs over time.
  Historically, most PDMPs relied on providers to take the initiative to access patient
prescription histories. Evidence from several states suggests that when PDMPs are vol-
untary, provider engagement is low (Haffajee, Jena and Weiner, 2015). This may explain
results from several studies, which find no effect of PDMPs on a variety of opioid-related
outcomes (Paulozzi, Kilbourne and Desai, 2011; Jena et al., 2014; Brady et al., 2014; Li
et al., 2014). Since 2007, 17 states have increased provider engagement via "mandatory
access" laws. These policies require prescribers to consult the PDMP in certain circum-
stances before prescribing opioids and other DEA-scheduled drugs. Recent studies suggest
that such mandates reduce the volume of opioids prescribed and indicators of misuse (Wen
et al., 2017; Buchmueller and Carey, 2018; Meinhofer, 2018; Haffajee et al., 2018) and fatal
opioid overdoses (Dowell et al., 2016).
 The first comprehensive "mandatory access" policy was enacted and implemented in
Kentucky in 2012. It required all providers in the state, with limited exceptions, to
check the PDMP before prescribing opioids to new patients and at intervals for continuing
patients. In contrast, previous mandates in other states applied only to certain types
of providers or circumstances. Subsequently, several other states (including New Mexico,
New York, Tennessee and West Virginia) enacted similar laws. Thus, Kentucky represents
an excellent case study for investigating the impact of comprehensive "mandatory access"
legislation on opioid prescribing.
                                             2
  We examine how this policy altered the prescribing behavior of Kentucky providers
compared to providers in a neighboring control state, Indiana. Indiana represents a good
counterfactual for Kentucky for several reasons. Both states were among the top ten in
opioid prescriptions per capita in 2012 (Paulozzi, Mack and Hockenberry, 2014). The
two states are also very similar in terms of demographics, economic conditions, health
systems, and health insurance coverage during the period of our analysis. Furthermore,
until Kentucky's 2012 reform, the two states' PDMPs and other opioid policies were quite
similar, as detailed in Section II.
  We estimate the policy's effect on the total morphine-equivalent dosage (MED) pre-
scribed by each provider in each quarter. We find that after the policy went into effect,
Kentucky providers significantly decreased MED prescribed relative to Indiana providers.
To shed light on the changes providers made, we estimate the effect of the policy on four
distinct margins: (1) whether the provider writes any opioid prescriptions; (2) the number
of patients to whom they prescribe opioids; (3) the number of days supplied per patient;
and (4) the average MED per day.
  Our results suggest that providers primarily responded along the first two margins. After
the policy went into effect, there was a 3.8 point decline in the percentage of providers
writing opioid prescriptions in Kentucky (relative to the change in Indiana). Among
providers that wrote any opioid prescriptions in a quarter, there was a roughly 16% decline
in the number of patients. Decreases in the days per prescription and MED per day are
smaller in magnitude and sensitive to specification.
  To test for heterogeneous policy effects, we sort providers into quartiles based on their
prescribing in the six months prior to the mandatory access policy. Like previous research,
we observe substantial variation in opioid prescribing across providers. In our data, prior
to the policy change, providers in the top quartile account for 97% of total MED supplied,
while, conditional on prescribing, the modal provider in the lowest quartile had only one
patient with an opioid prescription. The heterogeneity analysis reveals that the decrease in
the percentage of providers writing opioid prescriptions was largely limited to low-volume
providers. Among high-volume providers, the main response to the policy was to prescribe
opioids to fewer patients.
  Ideally, increasing provider PDMP engagement will not simply reduce opioid prescrib-
ing, but will result in more appropriate prescribing. We thus investigate whether providers
targeted their reductions on patients with histories suggestive of high-risk use. We charac-
terize patients using three mutually-exclusive categories. The first consists of "single use"
patients who fill a single prescription in a quarter and none in the following quarter. This
utilization pattern suggests post-surgical acute care and is generally considered low risk.
                                             3
We divide patients who fill multiple prescriptions into two groups, depending on whether
or not they exhibit behaviors consistent with "shopping," which we define as obtaining
opioids from three or more prescribers or pharmacies in a quarter.
  The results from this part of the analysis suggest that providers target their reductions
on those who meet the "shopping" criteria. The average provider reduced the total number
of patients with opioid prescriptions by 19% and the number of "shoppers" by one-third.
Providers reduce opioid supply to other patient types by a smaller, but statistically signifi-
cant amount. Prescriptions to single-use patients fell by 12%. Thus, while prescriptions to
"shoppers" were most affected, the mandatory access policy may have induced a broader
"chilling" effect on opioid prescribing.

        II.   PDMP and Other Opioid Policies in Kentucky and Indiana

  By 2012 both Kentucky and Indiana had well-established PDMPs. The Kentucky All
Schedule Prescription Electronic Reporting (KASPER) system first became operational,
with its data available to providers and dispensers, in July 1999. Indiana's PDMP, known
as the INSPECT system, was established one year earlier, but access was initially limited
to state regulators; providers and dispensers gained access in March, 2009. Law enforce-
ment agencies in both states are allowed to access the data in connection with ongoing
investigations. Both systems capture data on prescriptions for DEA Schedule II - V drugs.
During our entire sample period, physicians in both Indiana and Kentucky could delegate
access to the PDMP to a nurse or other employee.
  Kentucky's mandatory access requirement was established by House Bill 1 (HB 1), which
was passed in April 2012 and went into effect that July. The law requires all providers
who are licensed to prescribe DEA-scheduled drugs to register with the PDMP and refers
non-compliers to the Kentucky Board of Medical Licensure. With limited exceptions,
providers are also required to query the PDMP the first time they order any Schedule
II prescription (and Schedule III containing hydrocodone) for a patient and every three
months thereafter. During the period we analyze, providers in Indiana faced no such
requirements.
  It is important to note that the Kentucky mandatory access requirement did not change
any aspect of the reporting of controlled substance prescriptions to the Kentucky PDMP.
Over the entire sample period, pharmacies reported all fills of DEA-scheduled prescriptions
to KASPER using established procedures, which are unrelated to provider registration or
querying behavior.
  Indiana makes a useful comparator for Kentucky due to its similarity on numerous
dimensions, including other policies that might affect the demand for and supply of pre-
                                            4
 scription opioids, such as demographics, income, and physicians per capita.1 Neither state
 allowed the medical or recreational use of marijuana. During the period of our analysis,
 Indiana did not have a law allowing access to naloxone. In Kentucky, such a law went
 into effect in June 2013. One difference between the two states is that HB 1 also included
 a provision regulating pain clinics. According to KASPER, between mid-2012, when the
 policy went into effect, and mid-2015, 24 pain clinics closed. While we cannot definitively
 disentangle the effect of the mandatory access policy from these pain clinic provisions, we
 provide evidence suggesting that our results are driven by the mandatory access policy.
   Figure 1 uses raw administrative data on the monthly number of requests for KASPER
 records between 2010 and 2016. The gray bar is at 2012q3, when the mandatory access
 policy was implemented. The figure shows a five-fold increase in KASPER requests coin-
 cident with the policy implementation. Similarly, the number of providers registered with
 KASPER rose from 37% of DEA registrants in June 2012 to 97% a year later (Freeman
 et al., 2015). Available evidence suggests that during the period of our analysis PDMP
 queries in Indiana were comparable to pre-period usage in Kentucky (Allain, 2012).

                            III.    Data and Descriptive Analysis

                                   A.   Aggregate State-Level Data

   Data from Indiana's PDMP begins in the first quarter of 2012, only two quarters before
 mandatory access went into effect in Kentucky. Thus, it is not possible with our main data
 sources to test for parallel pre-trends in the two states. We address this issue by considering
 other data sources. Figure 2 presents annual data from the Centers for Disease Control
 (CDC) on opioid prescriptions per capita and quarterly data from the DEA's ARCOS
 database on MED2 per capita for the years 2006 to 2016.
   Both sources indicate that opioid prescriptions in Kentucky and Indiana were trending
 in a roughly parallel fashion from 2006 through 2011. The ARCOS series, but not the
 CDC series, shows a level shift up in MED beginning with 2010q2. This level shift is due
 entirely to oxycodone, which jumps up in Kentucky and continues a near-linear trend in
 Indiana. The timing of the shift in oxycodone shipments to Kentucky coincides with two
 important events related to this commonly abused drug.
   One is the reformulation of the extended release version of the drug, Oxycontin. Al-
   1
      A disadvantage of using a neighboring state is the potential for cross-border contamination. In the
Appendix, we show our results are virtually unchanged when we exclude the regions near the border where
cross-border contamination is expected to be the largest.
    2
       We converted ARCOS and PDMP opioid prescriptions to their morphine equivalents using conver-
sion factors from the following three sources: Palliative.org (2016); CMS (2015); Ohio Bureau of Workers'
Compensation (2016).
                                                   5
though this change had a large effect on the demand for oxycodone products and their
substitutes, there is little reason to expect a large positive effect on shipments to Kentucky
relative to Indiana. Alpert, Powell and Pacula (2016) show that Kentucky and Indiana
had the same rates of Oxycontin misuse before the reformulation and thus were similarly
exposed to it.
  The other change occurring around this time is a major crackdown on pill mills in Florida
(Kennedy-Hendricks et al., 2016). These clinics were widely reported to be a source of
drugs sold in other states. Indeed, Interstate 75, which runs through both Florida and
Kentucky, was dubbed the "Oxy Express." Evans, Lieber and Power (2019) develop a
measure for cross-state comparisons that suggests Kentucky was obtaining considerably
more opioids from Florida than Indiana was prior to the crackdown. Thus, it is very
plausible that as the supply from Florida was reduced, the demand for oxycodone from
in-state providers increased more in Kentucky than Indiana.
  Table 1 examines trends in aggregate quarterly per capita MED consumption in Ken-
tucky and Indiana using ARCOS data from 2006q1 to 2012q2. The models in columns 1
and 2 include just an indicator for Kentucky, a linear trend and the interaction of the two.
In columns 3 and 4, we include a second Kentucky intercept to capture the level shift in
oxycodone shipments after the Florida pill mill crackdown.
 Using the logged outcome (column 1), the results indicate that in both states the vol-
ume of opioids grew by roughly 8% per quarter over the seven year period. When the
dependent variable is specified in levels, the simpler specification suggests stronger growth
in Kentucky in the pre-period. However, when we include a second intercept for Kentucky
from 2010q2 onwards, we no longer find a difference in the time trends between Kentucky
and Indiana. This suggests that indeed there was simply a level shift in Kentucky rather
than a divergence in the trend.
  Table 2 reports difference-in-differences estimates using quarterly MED per capita for
2006q1 to 2013q4, before and after Kentucky's implementation of the mandatory access
policy (but prior to the Affordable Care Act expansions). Because the implementation
quarter (2012q3) is partially treated we allow it its own dummy. In these results we again
consider the impact of allowing Kentucky a second intercept for the period beginning
in 2010q2. Including this additional variable does not alter the results in a qualitative
sense. The first column suggests that the PDMP mandate reduced the volume of opioids
in Kentucky by 11%. Allowing Kentucky to have a second intercept (similar to beginning
the analysis in 2010q2) increases our estimate of the policy impact to 14%. Similarly, when
the dependent variable is specified in levels both specifications indicate that the effect of
Kentucky's PDMP mandate was statistically and economically significant.

                                      B.   Prescription Records



   Via data use agreements with KASPER and INSPECT, we obtained the states' com-
 plete PDMP records. Each record contains the following fields: encrypted identifiers for
 patients, providers and pharmacies, National Drug Code (from which we derive ingredient,
 strength, and route of administration), number of units, days supply, patient zip code, and
 provider location.

   Our analysis period begins in 2012q1. Though PDMP data for both states are available
 through 2016, we end our sample period in 2013q4 to avoid a possible confounding effect of
 the Affordable Care Act. Kentucky implemented the ACA Medicaid expansion in January
 2014 and also established its own marketplace. Indiana did not expand Medicaid until
 2015 and participated in the Federal Healthcare.gov marketplace. Whereas in 2013 a
 similar percentage of each state's population was uninsured (14.3% in Kentucky, 14.0% in
 Indiana), between 2013 and 2014, the percent uninsured declined by 5.8 percentage points
 in Kentucky compared to only 2 points in Indiana (Smith and Medalia, 2015).

   A key advantage of PDMP administrative data over other opioid utilization data is that
 we observe all or substantially all of an in-state provider's outpatient opioid prescribing,3
 which allows us to conduct a provider-level analysis. By comparison, analyses of aggregate
 opioid supply (e.g., ARCOS data) do not report data at the provider level, and claims from
 a subsample of patients (e.g., Medicare data) do not fully capture a provider's prescribing
 behavior. In particular, our PDMP data include all cash purchases, which is predictive
 of other suspicious behaviors (Cepeda et al., 2013).4 Therefore, analyses based on PDMP
 data yield the maximal insight on how providers respond to mandatory access policies.

   We limit our sample to providers who practiced in Kentucky or Indiana. Prescriptions
 filled in Kentucky and Indiana but written by out-state providers are disregarded because
 those providers are subject to other states' opioid regulations. Our main analyses are done
 on a balanced panel consisting of quarterly observations of providers who wrote at least
 one opioid prescription in any quarter between 2012q1 and 2013q4.

   3
      KASPER and INSPECT capture about 95% of the total MED shipped to a state (as reported by
ARCOS) or about 95% of all prescriptions filled in the state (as reported by the CDC). We expect the
PDMP to capture less than 100% of the ARCOS volume, which includes opioids administered to hospital
inpatients (not reported to PDMPs). The CDC data is based on a sample of retail pharmacies; the CDC
does not give detailed information about its methods.
    4
      While our PDMP datasets always report prescriptions purchased with cash, information on the source
of payment is not available in Kentucky until 2015. In 2015, after both states had expanded their Medicaid
programs, 8% of prescriptions in KASPER and 10% of INSPECT prescriptions were purchased with cash.
Prior to Medicaid expansion, 14% of Indiana's prescriptions were purchased with cash.
                                                    7
                         C.   Hypotheses and Outcome Measures

  There are several possible provider responses to a PDMP use mandate. The requirement
that providers have an active account and check the database before prescribing opioids
introduces fixed compliance costs. Some providers may cease prescribing opioids altogether
rather than bear the cost associated with learning to navigate the system. Therefore, we
test whether the policy induced a change on the extensive margin of writing any opioid
prescriptions in a quarter.
  Fundamentally, PDMPs are designed to alert providers of possible doctor shopping and
other suspicious patterns of patient behavior. Previous research based on Medicare claims
data finds that mandatory access policies significantly reduce the number of patients
receiving prescriptions from multiple providers and the number of "new patient" visits
(Buchmueller and Carey, 2018). Thus, we hypothesize that among providers who continue
to prescribe opioids, the strongest effect of a mandatory access policy will be on the number
of patients to whom they prescribe.
  It is possible that a provider encountering a PDMP report that suggests a patient is
overusing opioids may not refuse to prescribe to that patient, but rather will write a
weaker prescription in hopes of weaning the patient off high-dosage or chronic opioid
use. Additionally, the mandate may indirectly affect prescribing intensity. In a survey of
Kentucky prescribers, roughly three-quarters of respondents said they believed they were
being more closely monitored after the policy went into effect (Freeman et al., 2015). This
perception may have led some to prescribe more conservatively. And checking the PDMP
more often may affect prescribing intensity by raising the salience of safe prescribing
practices. We analyze two measures of prescribing intensity: days supplied per patient
and the average MED per day.
  Table 3 presents summary statistics for these outcomes aggregated to the provider×quarter
level. In the pre-period (2012q1 and 2012q2) the percentage of providers prescribing any
opioids was identical in Indiana and Kentucky (74%). Conditional on prescribing opi-
oids, the average Kentucky provider prescribed to more patients (60.2 vs. 54.5). MED
per provider are higher in Kentucky because of the difference in the number of patients;
the baseline means for days/patient and MED/day were essentially identical in the two
states. Figure 3, which presents the provider-level distribution of log MED prescribed for
the pre-period, also indicates that prescribing patterns were quite similar in the two states
before Kentucky's policy change.
  After the policy change, the number of Indiana providers writing any opioid prescriptions
increased by 2 percentage points, while the percentage in Kentucky fell by 2 points. The
number of patients per provider fell in both states, but more so in Kentucky (-6.1 vs.
                                           8
 -2.4). There was essentially no change in either intensity measure in either state. Overall,
 the mean MED per provider fell by 9.4% in Kentucky and by 0.4% in Indiana.

                                             IV.       Econometric Analysis

                    A.      Overall Impact of Kentucky's Mandatory Access Provision

                                                                                  tot
      The total (MED) quantity of opioids a provider i prescribes in quarter t, Yit   , can be
 expressed as the product of the other four measures presented in Table 3:
        tot             1                    2                    3                  4
      Yit   =         Yit                  Yit                  Yit                Yit
                any prescriptions      # of patients      days per patient      MED per day

      We estimate separate difference-in-differences regressions for each outcome. The econo-
 metric specification is:


                    j                                     j   j
(1)               Yit = j KY postit +  j KY × 2012q 3it + t + i + j
                                                                  it , j = 1, 2, 3, 4


      where j indexes the four separate margins that providers may adjust in response to
 the policy. The policy variable, KY post, equals 1 for Kentucky providers beginning in
 2012q4 and 0 elsewhere; Kentucky's partially-treated implementation quarter, 2012q3, is
 accounted for with its own dummy variable. Because the data from both states include
 encrypted provider identifiers, we are able to condition on provider fixed effects (i ). Our
 models also include year by quarter fixed effects (t ). To account for within-provider
 serial correlation, we cluster it at the provider level. With only two states, asymptotics
 for consistency will not apply if standard errors are clustered at the state level, but we
 explore inference under two alternative models in the Appendix.
   Y 1 is an indicator variable that equals one if a provider wrote at least one prescription
 in the quarter and zero otherwise. Because of the fixed effects we specify this equation as
 a linear probability model. Our preferred specification for the continuous outcomes, Y 2
 through Y 4 , is a log-linear model, which implies that the policy had the same percent effect
 on all providers. And as shown in Figure 3, prior to the policy change the distribution
 of MED prescribed by providers appears to be approximately lognormal. Additionally,
 tests for model specification recommended by Deb, Norton and Manning (2017) suggest
 that the log model fits our data better. For robustness, we also report models where the
 dependent variable is measured in levels.
      We also estimate an event study version of the model in which an indicator variable for
 Kentucky is interacted with each time dummy. Since we have a very short pre-period, we
                                          9
rely on the previous analysis of ARCOS and CDC data to provide evidence on pre-period
trends. We primarily use this specification to confirm that the estimated treatment effect
coincides with the quarter when HB 1 was implemented and to examine the dynamics of
the treatment effect in the post-period.
  The event study results are presented graphically in Figure 4. Each of the four variables
exhibits a sharp decline in 2012q3 relative to the previous quarter, with the full impact
realized by 2012q4. The fact that the movement in the variables is so tightly linked to
the policy timing is reassuring. The pattern in these event studies ­ a sharp change in
prescribing behavior followed by parallel trends in the post-period ­ is well-captured by a
difference-in-differences framework.
  Table 4 reports difference-in-differences regressions for each of our four outcomes. The
first column indicates that mandatory access reduced the probability of any opioid pre-
scribing by nearly 4 percentage points. This significant effect on the extensive margin is
consistent with the hypothesis that fixed compliance costs may have led some providers to
stop prescribing scheduled drugs altogether. We provide further support for the fixed-cost
hypothesis in the next section.
  We hypothesize that requiring providers to check a PDMP before prescribing opioids will
have the strongest effect on the number of patients receiving prescriptions. The regression
results indicate a large provider response along this margin. The log specification implies
that among providers writing any opioid prescriptions in a quarter, Kentucky's mandatory
access policy reduced the number of patients by 16% (exp(-.177) ­ 1 = -.162). Specifying
the model as linear in levels also yields a significant policy effect, though, relative to the
sample mean, the percent effects are slightly smaller (-11%).
  Estimated effects for the average days per patient and MED per day are smaller and more
sensitive to specification. As noted, any effects on these margins are likely to be indirect.
The changes observed for these outcomes may also reflect a change in the composition of
patients receiving opioids after the policy change. As we show below, the effect of the
policy on the patient margin was strongest for patients who filled multiple prescriptions.
Reducing the number of high-use patients will have the effect of also reducing measures of
prescribing intensity. Because of this and the sensitivity of the estimates to specification,
we are reluctant to conclude that providers responded to the policy by reducing the number
of days or MED per day.

         B.   Heterogeneity Across Providers by Pre-Period Prescribing Volume

  We hypothesize that the Kentucky law had different impacts for higher and lower volume
providers. Low-volume providers may be most reluctant to pay the costs of mandatory
                                       10
access compliance, since opioid prescribing is not critical to their practice. Additionally,
low-volume providers may not be sufficiently familiar with opioid prescribing histories to
confidently interpret a PDMP record (Carey, Jena and Barnett, 2018). Thus, we expect
that low-volume providers are more likely than high-volume providers to stop prescribing.
  It is less obvious which types of providers will reduce the number of patients the most.
High-volume providers treat hundreds of patients every quarter and are more likely to
be pain specialists. Since chronic pain patients are at high risk for opioid misuse, pain
specialists may be most likely to learn of suspicious behavior when they begin using the
PDMP. On the other hand, these providers may already use the PDMP prior to the
mandatory access provision. And of course, some high-volume providers may engage in
illicit opioid distribution, and thus may be insensitive to the information contained in the
PDMP.
  To estimate heterogeneous policy effects by volume, we divide the provider sample into
quartiles based on the total MED prescribed in the six months before Kentucky's policy
went into effect. Table 5 provides summary statistics on providers in each quartile. All
of the outcome variables that we analyze increase monotonically across the quartiles,
with the differences being most pronounced for the number of patients treated. The first
quartile is made up of infrequent prescribers. Only 12% wrote an opioid prescription in
each quarter in the pre-period and the modal provider who did so had only one patient.
Conditional on prescribing, mean days per patient and MED per day are low for providers
in quartile 1 relative to other providers. This is consistent with lower-volume providers
treating opioid-naive patients with short-term pain. Quartiles 2 and 3 differ mainly in
terms of the number of patients to whom opioids are prescribed. Quartile 4 appears to
include many pain specialists. The average provider in this quartile prescribes to a high
number of patients and writes prescriptions with longer durations.
  For each quartile, we estimate a separate set of regressions. These results are reported
in Table 6, the first column of which repeats the full sample results from Table 4. For
brevity, we report only the log models for the continuous outcomes, and show the level
models in Appendix Table A3.
  The first panel reports the effect of mandatory access on the probability of writing
any opioid prescriptions in a quarter. We find that the lowest-volume prescribers are 5
percentage points less likely to write a prescription due to the policy change. Relative
to the pre-period mean, this is a 41% decline. The estimated coefficient is slightly larger
for quartile 2, though in percentage terms, the effect is smaller. The vast majority of
providers in quartile 3 and 4 continue to prescribe after the policy change.
  The results by provider quartile support the hypothesis that low-volume providers view
                                            11
 the fixed costs of mandate compliance as excessive relative to the benefits. As a further
 test of the fixed cost hypothesis we also examine whether the number of providers who
 never again write an opioid prescription increases. The results, reported in Appendix
 Table A4, suggest that Kentucky's access mandate did lead low-volume providers to "exit
 the market". We find that high-volume Kentucky prescribers are not more likely to cease
 prescribing than their Indiana counterparts. This suggests that the closure of pain clinics
 is not the main driver of our results.5
   Among providers who continue to prescribe opioids, all quartiles reduce the number of
 patients they prescribe to. Providers in the first quartile write a prescription to 8% fewer
 patients; at higher quartiles, this effect size is even larger (between 15% and 17%).
   The final two panels show that there are also reductions, albeit smaller, in the intensity
 of prescribing. Effects on log days per patient are absent for the lowest volume providers,
 who already write very short duration prescriptions, and small for the highest volume
 providers. The magnitude of the effect sizes for MED per day are monotonically decreasing.
 Among providers in the fourth quartile, who account for the vast majority of all opioid
 prescriptions, we see no significant reduction in MED per day.

                            C.    Prescribing Reductions by Patient Type

   The goal of PDMPs is to alert providers to possible drug-seeking and other indicators
 of high-risk use. We now examine whether providers target reductions on patients with
 suspicious opioid histories that would be revealed in PDMP records. We are also interested
 in whether providers reduce prescribing to patients without suspicious behaviors. Such a
 finding would suggest that mandatory access was associated with a general chilling effect,
 which potentially could have inhibited clinically appropriate prescribing.
    To provide insight on how different types of patients were affected by the policy, we de-
 fine three mutually exclusive patient types. In contrast to our prescriber volume quartiles,
 which are defined using only pre-period data, we categorize patients contemporaneously
 because many obtain a prescription in only a single quarter. "Single use" patients fill a
 single prescription in a quarter and none in the following quarter. As shown in Table 5, in
 the pre-period, 29% of the average provider's patients (about 12 patients) were single-use
 patients. Among patients observed filling multiple prescriptions we distinguish between
 "shoppers" and "non-shoppers." Shoppers are defined as patients who receive prescrip-
 tions from three or more providers or fill prescriptions at three or more pharmacies in a
   5
    Analyses of prescribing behavior by specialty, such as Levy et al. (2015) suggest that pain management
specialists are high-volume prescribers, and Rutkow et al. (2015) show that pain clinic legislation in Florida
primarily affected high-volume prescribers.
                                                     12
given quarter. In the pre-period, roughly 14% of each provider's patients met this stan-
dard. Individuals exhibiting shopping behavior comprised a similar share of providers'
patient set across the volume quartiles. However, since high-volume providers account for
the bulk of all prescriptions, most shoppers (more than two-thirds) obtain opioids from
these prescribers. The most common consumption pattern was filling multiple prescrip-
tions but not meeting our shopping criteria. Presumably, many of these individuals are
chronic pain patients.
  We use our categorization to examine whether providers targeted reductions in opioid
prescriptions on high risk patients. Results are based on a two-part variant of our previous
regressions. For each patient type, we combine the effect on any prescribing (extensive
margin) and the effect on the number of patients (intensive margin) into an overall effect
using standard methods for two-part models (Deb, Norton and Manning, 2017).
  Table 7 reports estimated policy effects by patient type, as well as bootstrapped stan-
dard errors (Belotti et al., 2015). Consistent with the goal of the policy, the effect of
the policy was largest in percentage terms for shoppers and smallest for single-use pa-
tients. The average provider prescribed to 2.6 fewer shoppers, which represents a 34%
effect. Reductions in prescribing to shopping patients is exactly what we expect from the
provision of PDMP information; without a PDMP it is difficult for a provider to observe
prescriptions written by other providers.
  However, there are meaningful declines for the other patient types. A 17% decline in
non-shopping patients and a 12% decline in single-use patients is consistent with providers
imperfectly targeting the reductions in patients. Its possible these patients were adversely
affected by a chilling effect. At the same time, the PDMP may include other information
suggesting that an opioid prescription would be contraindicated, such as prescriptions for
benzodiazepines (Dasgupta et al., 2016). The number of patients with overlapping claims
for opioids and benzodiazepines fell by 5% in Kentucky after the mandatory access policy
went into effect, while there was no change in Indiana.

                                    V.      Conclusion

  Prescription drug monitoring programs have the potential to decrease inappropriate pre-
scribing of opioids. But PDMPs will only be effective if healthcare providers access the
data. In an effort to increase provider engagement, several states have recently enacted
policies requiring providers to query the state's PDMP before prescribing opioids. This
paper evaluates the first comprehensive PDMP mandatory access policy, which was en-
acted by Kentucky in 2012. We find that providers responded to this policy in two main
ways. Some, who prescribed low volumes of opioids before the policy went into effect,
                                       13
stopped prescribing the drugs altogether. This is consistent with the idea that the pol-
icy introduced fixed compliance costs that low-volume providers were not willing to bear.
Higher volume providers continued to prescribe, but wrote prescriptions to fewer patients.
  We also assess what types of patients were affected. Ideally, PDMP data will help
providers identify doctor shoppers and other high risk patients. Our results suggest that
providers reduced prescriptions to patients whose prescription histories suggest possible
doctor or pharmacy shopping. We find large reductions (in percentage terms) in the num-
ber of such patients receiving opioid prescriptions. At the same time, we find economically
significant reductions in the number of patients without suspicious prescribing histories.
These decreases suggest there may also be patients with a clinically-justified need for pain
relief who lose access to treatment as a result of the policy.

   Our study uses PDMP data from only two states, and thus we cannot cluster the stan-
dard errors at the state level and expect standard arguments for consistency to apply. We
instead cluster standard errors in our provider × time regressions at the provider level. In
this section, we explore inference under two alternative models.
   First, we implement the suggestions of Bertrand, Duflo and Mullainathan (2004) and
collapse the data to create a single pre- and post-period observation for each provider, to
account for residual serial correlation in the errors. These results as well as our baseline
model are in Appendix Table A1. Estimating the model on this data set yields similar
point estimates and standard errors that are roughly 30% larger than those obtained using
quarterly data. For Y 1 and Y 2 , this difference does not qualitatively change our inferences:
the estimates remain statistically significant at the 1% level.
   Donald and Lang (2007) suggest assessing inference when standard errors may be too
small by estimating the difference-in-differences coefficient for every consecutive two pe-
riods within the sample period. If standard errors are severely underestimated, these
placebo tests will return statistically significant results. Appendix Table A2 implements
this exercise, reporting the coefficients and t-statistics for all four outcomes across all
seven possible two-quarter intervals. Our implementation period is 2012q3, and the two
regressions that include that period are bolded for reference. The placebo regressions are
generally, though not always null. However, the t-statistics for the implementation period
average more than five times the t-statistics for the placebo tests. This suggests that even
if the standard errors are somewhat too large, inference is likely to be robust to smaller
standard errors.

   A2.   Robustness of Results to Exclusion of Areas Bordering Kentucky and Indiana

  Cross-border migration between the treatment state and its neighboring control has the
potential to contaminate our results. A significant population center, Louisville, lies close
to the Indiana border, giving rise to a region known as "Kentuckiana." If the PDMP
implementation led Kentucky residents to seek more opioids from Indiana providers, then
we may observe a reduction in prescribing among Kentucky providers and an increase
among Indiana providers. In our difference-in-differences model, this would appear to be
a policy-associated reduction in opioid prescribing. Thus, in Appendix Table A5, we repeat
our baseline results (top panel) and exclude the three-digit zip codes that lie along the
Kentucky-Indiana border (bottom panel). Our results are statistically indistinguishable
and nearly the same to the hundredth place. While cross-border contamination need not
be limited to the zip codes that lie along the border, we are reassured by the fact that the
results are so similar when excluding the individuals for whom border effects are likely to
be largest.
