 1. Introduction

        The impact of government budget variables on private-sector consumption

 is a key issue in assessing the implications of fiscal
                                                             and monetary policy
 on the real side of the economy. In fact there are sharp     controversies on
 this     topic,    most of which center around the Ricardian-equjvalence
                1
 proposition.

        The purpose of this      paper   is   to   develop   and estimate         a

stochastic-intertemporal model of consumption behavior and to use it for
testing a version of the Ricardian-equivalence proposition with time series

data.       Our framework allows for two channels that may give rise to
deviations from Ricardian neutrality:          Finite horizons and liquidity
constraints.        In addition, it incorporates explicitly the roles of taxes,

substitution between public and private consumption, and different degrees

of consumption durability.

        The standard approach in empirical studies of the neutrality hypothesis

is based on directly specifying regression equations linking consumption to

disposable income, measures of non-human wealth,
                                                    government spending, taxes,
government transfers, etc. (see for example Kochin (1974), Tanner       (1979),

Feldstejn (1982), Seater (1982), Kormendj (1983), Reid (1985)). While the

results from applying this approach are informative,     a limitation, which
makes the interpretation of the results ambiguous, is that the connection

between the estimated equations and the underlying theoretical model is not

specified explicitly.        Although the theoretical model typically specifies

that current consumption is influenced by current and expected future
                                   —3—

changes in labor income, taxes, etc., most of the empirical applications

focus mainly on current explanatory variables and ignore expected future

ones. Therefore, the estimated coefficients of a given explanatory variable

(such as current government spending or taxes) in a consumption equation may

reflect not only direct effects of this variable, but also its effects as a

predictor of future relevant variables. Moreover, these results cannot be

used to assess the effects of policy changes, as for example a change in
                                                      2
taxation, on consumption (Lucas's (1976) critique).           In contrast, the

present   study    adopts   an   intertemporal   optimizing framework whose

implications, derived explicitly in the analysis, are the subject of

empirical tests.

     Since the seminal contribution of Hall (1978), numerous studies have

applied the intertemporal optimizing approach to examine             consumption

behavior. However, almost none of these studies focus on the comovements of

consumption and government-budget variables.3       Moreover, these studies

typically assume an infinite-horizon representative consumer.              This

assumption restricts the economic channels through which government-budget

finance exerts its effects on consumption, resulting in an extreme case in

which the model exhibits Ricardian properties.            To move away from this

case, Blanchard (1985) extended the intertemporal framework by relaxing the

infinite-horizon assumption.     His formulation allows for a richer set of

interactions between government-budget-deficit variables and consumption,
                                                               4
with Ricardian implications emerging only as a special case. Another factor

that may give rise to deviations from Ricardian neutrality is the existence
                                      -4-



 of liquidity constraints that prevent some consumers from free     access to
 capital markets (see the early work by Tobin and Dolde (1971), and the more

 recent contributions by Hayashi (1985) and Hubbard and Judd (1986)).   In the

 present study, we develop a testable model which allows for deviations from

 neutrality through both these channels.

         By virtue of the assumption of rational expectations, our framework

 results in a set of cross-equation restrictions.     These restrictions are
 taken into account in the joint estimation of the consumption-behavior

 parameters and those of the stochastic processes governing the evolution of

 the forcing variables. We implement the model on monthly time series data

 for Israel covering the 1980-1985 period.5     This case is of particular
 interest in testing the Ricardian-equivalence hypothesis because of the high

volatility      of   movements in the budget deficit, taxes, and private
consumption in an economy with an unusually high government budget deficits,

amounting to 15% of aggregate output, on average, during this period.      The
sizeable deficits have resulted in a relatively large government debt, which

was twice the size of GNP at the end of the period. These characteristics

differ from those of the more stable environments studied in previous

empirical works.      They, therefore, enable a potentially more powerful test

of hypotheses related to the comovements of private-sector consumption and

taxes and public-sector spending.

     The paper is organized as follows.         Section 2 outlines the model.

Empirical specifications and implementation of the model are presented in

section 3. Section 4 extends the basic model to account for direct effects

of public consumption on private consumption. Last, section 5 concludes the

paper.

2. Theoretical Fraiiework
      We assume   that   there are overlapping generations of rational agents

that have finite horizons.          Specifically, there is a probability -y,

smaller than unity, that individuals living in the present period will

survive to the next period. A small open economy is considered, one that

takes as given the world interest rate. We begin by considering the choice

problem of an individual consumer.

2.1. Individual Consumer

      The consumer is assumed to face a given safe interest factor R (where

R — (l+r)      and r denotes the safe rate of interest), but due to lifetime

uncertainty the effective (risk adjusted) interest factor is            R/-y.6

Disposable income is assumed to be stochastic and is denoted by y. Viewed

from the standpoint of period t, consumer's utility from his stock of

consumption goods during period t+r,              is given by 6'U(c÷7), where

6 is the subjective discount factor.        The probability of survival from

period     t      through period t+r is -y', and therefore expected lifetime

utility as of period t is




(1)
               EtY(-16)U(ct+),


where Et is the conditional expectations operator.            Individuals are

assumed to maximize (1) subject to
                                            -6-



 (2a)          c —   (l-)c1 +        x,


 (2b)          x —   b+         -
                                    ()bi,
 and the solvency condition lim (.y/R)tbt — 0.        The variable   x denotes the

flow of consumption purchases,         c denotes the stock of consumer goods, and

      denotes the rate of depreciation of this stock. The variable       b is the
one period debt issued in period t. Consolidating eqs.(2a) and (2b), the

expected value of the lifetime budget constraint is given by




                                                  -
                                                      ()b1 + (l-)c1

where Ew           is (a specific definition of) expected wealth.             This

consolidated budget constraint is implied from the equality of the expected

value of the discounted sum of the flow of consumption purchases and the

corresponding discounted sum of the flow of disposable income, minus initial

debt commitment.

        With a view towards empirical implementation, we specify the utility

function to be quadratic. That is,



                            -
                                12
(3)           U(c) —   ac
                                       -7-



where a > 0 and c <a.
        It is shown in the Appendix that the solution to the optimization

problem is



(4)            c 0 + iEtWt,


where
                      1- SR
               -ya 6R(R-)
and

               [1 -
                               -



Equation     (4)       is a linear consumption function, relating the stock of

consumer goods c to the expected value of wealth, where                is the

marginal propensity to consume out of wealth.

2.2. Aggregate Consuiiption

      The economy consists of overlapping generations. The size of each

cohort is normalized to 1, there are          individuals of age a,   and the

size of population is constant at the level l/(l--y).

        From equation (4), the consumption of an individual of age a at time

t is



(5)
               Ct,a           + l[EtY ()Tyt+r t-l,a-l + (l)Ctlal]•
                                               -8-



Aggregating consumption over all cohorts and dividing by the size of

population, yields per-capita aggregate consumption, C, as




(6) Ct —
              (l7)°1Cta                o +                     -
                                                                   t-l   +



where Btl is aggregate per-capita debt issued in period t-l.
        It is shown in the Appendix that Eq.(6) can be rearranged as follows:



                           6R- 1
(7a) C —     7a(R-l)      SR(R--y)

     +   (l--y)(l   -
                                                      (f)T(y       -
                                                                       T+)   +
                                                                                 TC1   +



where        r —
                    [&R
                            +
                                7(l)[1i(l + _i7]][l ()(l)]1,
                                                           -                 and where 'i'   is

gross income and T is the level of taxes (both in per-capita terms), and

Et
        is   a zero mean, finite variance, error term. In order to express the

consumption equation in terms of observed consumer purchases, we use

recursively the per capita aggregate version of eq.(2a) applied to aggregate

per-capita consumption, and substitute it into eq.(7a). This yields:




(7b) X - -ya(R-l)                    + (1)(1 -
                        6R(R--y)


          T+)      + (r -
                            7(l))            T(l)Tx    1
                                                           +



where X is the aggregate per-capita value of consumer purchases.
                                       -9-



     Equation (7b) is the focal relation for our empirical work. It

expresses aggregate consumption purchases (per-capita) as a function of a

constant term, expected human wealth, lagged purchases, and an error term.

The present formulation is general enough to encompass both Ricardian and

non-Ricardian systems as special cases. The key parameter, in this context,

is   -y.   When -'   =1   the system possesses Ricardian neutrality, and eq. (7b)

indicates that only lagged consumer purchases can be used to predict current

purchases (similar to Hall (1978)). However, when -y <         1,   expected human

wealth affects current consumption purchases over and beyond the impact of

lagged consumption purchases. For example, a current-period cut in taxes

raises expected human wealth and thus results in an increase in consumption.

The reason is that the future tax hike, needed in order to balance the

intertemporal budget constraint of the government, is given a smaller

weight, by finite-horizon consumers, than the weight attached by them to the

current cut in taxes.

2.3. LiquIdity-Constrained Consumers

     The    foregoing specifications hold under the assumption that all

consumers have free access to the capital market and thus can borrow

against future incomes. In that case, Ricardian neutrality breaks down due

to finite horizons (as captured by        <   1).   In this subsection, we extend

the model to allow for an additional channel through which nonequivalence

results may arise: The existence of liquidity constraints. Accordingly, we

allow here for the possibility that while a fraction           II    of aggregate

consumption is due to consumers that have access to capital markets, a

fraction (1-Il) is due to consumers that are liquidity constrained in their

consumption purchases. Formally,
                                     - 10   -




 (8)                rix + (lII)X,

 where      X denotes consumption purchases of liquidity-unconstrained
 individuals, and X denotes purchases of those that are subject to
 liquidity constraints. For X, we use the specification in equation (7b),

 and for Xct we use the following simple specification,



 (9)
               Xct 't-1 + Vt.


        That is, consumption purchases under liquidity constraints are modelled

as the sum of two components: Last period's net income and an error term.7

        It can be easily verified that in this augmented version of the model,

Ricardian equivalence holds only under the restriction that    -y = 1   and
II     1. This restriction is tested in the next section.



3. Empirical Implementation

3.1. Specifications

       To implement equation (7b) it is necessary to specify, under rational

expectations, the stochastic processes which govern the evolution of gross

income and taxes.        Accordingly, we stipulate simple first-order auto
                                         8
regressive processes for these variables,
                                                        - 11    -




(10)                  -
                             't-l      '°Yt-l -         't-2 + Yt
(11)              Tt -       Ttl       PT(Ttl -         Tt2) + Tt'

where the           p's            are time-independent, and the                                    's       are serially

uncorrelated zero-mean stochastic terms that are orthogonal to variables
                                            9
dated t-l and previously.

       Using equations (10) and (11) to calculate expected human wealth

yields, as shown in the Appendix, the following expression for consumption

purchases:

     Equations (8)-(12), form the system to be empirically analyzed.

3.2. Findings

     Several versions of the system consisting of eqs.(8)-(12) are estimated

using Israeli monthly data covering the period 1980-1985. The use of

monthly data clearly limits our choice of the actual time series that serve

as counterparts for the variables in the model. For consumption purchases,

X, we use an index of purchases within the organized retail trade)0 Total

wage bill is used for income, Y, and government tax receipts are used for

T. The data source is Bank of Israel's Publication Main Econoai.c Indicators

(various issues).

     Estimation was performed by non-linear least squares (from the TSP

program) jointly applied to the system. The estimator is based on computing

maximum likelihood, and the estimates are obtained by concentrating variance

parameters out of the multivariate likelihood and then maximizing the

negative of the logdeterminant of the residual covariance matrix. As is

well known, the estimates are efficient if the disturbances are multivariate
                                     - 13   -




normal and identically distributed. Table 1 reports different versions of
the estimated model, allowing for seven lags in the estimation of the

durability parameter and setting the monthly risk-free real interest factor
            11
to 1.002.          Column (1) gives the parameter estimates of the model. The

likelihood ratio test of the model against its unrestricted counterpart

yields a         x2 statistic of 12.3 (with 8 degrees of freedom), which is not

significant at the one-percent-significance level. The statistic for the

test equals twice the difference between the unrestricted and restricted

values of the log-likelihood function.              Estimates of the unrestricted

version are given in the Appendix. While this indicates that the data do

not reject the model, some of the parameters obtain somewhat implausible

estimated values.       In particular, 6 and II seem to be too high relative

to what is commonly expected. The parameter -y is smaller but close to

unity.      Under Blanchard's formulation, this parameter stands for the

survival probability.        A monthly          y    0.989   implies    under    this

interpretation an expected life of y12/[(l.yl2)]2 — 58 years. Although

viewed from the time of birth this is a low life expectancy, it seems more

plausible when viewed from the point-of-view of the average horizon for

consumption-decision-making of the mature population.

     Columns (2) and (3) impose further restrictions on the estimated model.

In column (2), we set consumer's time horizon to infinity (-y —         1.0) and the
estimated model is not rejected when compared to the unrestricted model.

(The likelihood ratio is 18.96, with 9 degrees of freedom).            Interestingly,

more plausible parameter estimates obtain in this colunuu than in the
                                        - 14   -




 previous one, including an estimated value               for    the   fraction    of

 liquidity-unconstrained consumption close to (and below) unity. Column (3)

 allows for estimation of y, but sets the parameter II            equal to unity.
Again, this version of the model is not rejected using a likelihood ratio

 test (whose value is about the same as the one for column (2)).                  The

parameter y obtains a value of 0.999 which is larger than the one reported

 in column (1).         Notice that in moving from column (1) to the next columns

the estimated values of 6 decline and become closer to unity.

      The Ricardian-equivalence proposition implies the                   II      1.0

restriction, which is tested in column (4).               The likelihood ratio for

testing this restriction against the unrestricted counterpart of the model

is 19.32 (with 10 degrees of freedom). This is lower than the one-percent

chi-square critical value of 23.2.             Thus, Ricardian neutrality is not
rejected by the data.12

      Having established this result, we can now discuss the parameter

estimates for the specification of the model that embodies the
                                                                         neutrality
properties.        The parameters generally obtain the hypothesized signs and are

significantly different from zero. The estimated first-order autoregressive

parameters of the processes for (Y -                and   (T -   Ti)   are negative

indicating that shocks to these variables tend to be reversed in subsequent

months.         Shocks to the gross income variable show a larger degree of
persistence than shocks to the tax variable.               The estimated monthly

subjective discount factor is slightly above unity; however, we have tested
for       6 —   1.0 and the test does not reject this hypothesis.13 The utility
                                    - 15   -




function   parameter a is positive and equal to 301.8. An important feature

of this value is that it satisfies the assumption that marginal utility of

consumption is positive, i.e., a> c. Specifically, the maximal value of

consumption purchases in the sample implies, using a durability parameter of

0.79, for seven lags, a maximal stock of consumption goods of about 85

(index units) which is smaller than the estimated         a. Further, this

estimated parameter can be used to calculate the implied degree of relative

risk aversion (C/(a-C)), which turns out to be equal to 0.3 (at the mean

sample value of consumption purchases).14 The parameter estimate for

implies that twenty one percent of the stock of consumer goods depreciates

from month to month. Since, due to lack of more refined monthly data, our

measure of consumption purchases includes goods with different degrees of

durability, this parameter      4     should be interpreted as an average

depreciation rate.

4.     Substitution Between   Public and Private Consumption
        We now. extend the model by allowing direct effects of government

spending on private consumption. The model's specification in section 2 can

be interpreted as one that incorporates public goods in the utility function

in a separable way, implying that public goods have neutral effects on the

consumption of private goods.           The present extension differs from the

foregoing specifications since it allows for substitutability between public

and private consumption. When the degree of substitution approaches zero we

are back to the original model.

        Let the utility function be specified by

(13a)          1J(c, G) a(c + 9G)
                                         -

where     C denotes the stock of public consumption, g denotes the flow of

government purchases, and           0 is a parameter that measures the weight of

public consumption in total private effective consumption, c +         9C   (see

Aschauer (1985)). For tractability, the rates of depreciation of the stocks

of private and public consumption goods are assumed to be identical and are

denoted by q. As shown in the Appendix, in this case, the analogue of

equation (6), expressing aggregate per-capita consumption, is:

    Note that eq.(l7) holds for liquidity-unconstrained consumers.      As in
section (2.3) we embed this equation in a more general framework in which

aggregate consumption includes also another component which is due to

liquidity-constrained individuals. Accordingly, eqs. (8)-(ll), and (16)-(17)

constitute the more general system to be implemented in this section.

    Table 2 reports the results of estimating two versions of the system.

To save degrees of freedom under this augmented version of the model, the

number of lags used in estimating the durability parameter is set equal to

3. Column (1) gives the parameter estimates under the model's restrictions.

These restrictions are not rejected against the unrestricted version of the

model; the pertinent likelihood ratio is 14.52 (with seven degrees of

freedom), a value that is below the critical one-percent value of 18.5.

Column (2) can be used to test Ricardian neutrality which implies the    -y —   II

  1.0 restriction. As before, this hypothesis is not rejected by the data.

In extending the model and going from Table 1 to Table 2 it can be observed

that most of the parameter estimates do not change noticeably. However, in

contrast to the notion of government consumption yielding positive marginal

utility, the estimated value of      0       is negative.15   Thus, although

statistically the specification underlying column (2)is not rejected by the

data, the public consumption variable has effects that do not conform with

the theoretical model.

5.   Conclusions

      In this paper, we have developed a stochastic framework in which the

intertemporal implications of the Ricardian-equivalence proposition can be

tested with aggregate time series data. The framework allows for two types

of deviations from Ricardian neutrality.         The first is due to finite

consumers' planning horizons, and is modelled as an extension of Blanchard

(1985) to a stochastic environment. The second is due to the existence of

liquidity constraints on consumption behavior. In addition, our framework

allows for direct substitutability between private and public consumption,

and treats explicitly the degree of durability of aggregate consumption.

      The model was implemented on monthly data for Israel during the first

half of the 1980's, a period of high and volatile government budget

deficits. Our main findings are that the restrictions implied by the

Ricardian-neutrality hypothesis are not rejected by the sample information,

and that the resulting parameter estimates generally conform with the

theoretical model.       These features held up when the model was extended to

allow for public goods consumption, with the exception that the parameter

capturing the direct effects of public consumption on private utility turned

out to be implausible.

      There are several interesting possible extensions of the present

research. First, it would be important to allow for additional sources of

deviations from Ricardian neutrality, such as the existence of distortionary

taxes, (e.g., income, value added and inflation taxes). In this context, it
                                  - 22   -




is   desirable to decompose taxes into at least two categories, consumption

and income taxes.16    Second, another channel through which government

policies can affect private consumption is related to monetary and exchange

rate policies.17 Third, the model's specifications can be modified to allow

for different effects on private consumption of various components of

government spending, potentially capturing substitutability as well as

complementarity with private consumption.    Fourth, the model could be
extended to allow for a bequest motive. Since negative bequests are not

feasible, individuals may become bequest constrained.    In such a case
Ricardian neutrality breaks down. In this specification the key factor to

be tested in the context of Ricardian neutrality is the strength of the

bequest motive relative to the path of income growth in the economy. These

extensions to the intertemporal framework of consumption determination are

necessary before policy recommendations based on the Ricardian neutrality

theme are advanced.

1.   Derivation of the Consumption Function (Equation (4)).

        The maximization problem described in section 2.1 can be expressed in

dynamic programming terms by the value function V as



(A.l)         V(y- t-l = Max(U(x+(l)c          1)+y6EV(yt±i+ (yt-x-



Differentiating the right-hand-side of (A.l) and equating to zero yields



(A.2)         U'(c) - 6REV'(.) = 0,


where primes denote derivatives.

Totally differentiating (A.l) yields




(A.3)         V'(y- t-l [U'(c) -           &REV'(.)] ÷   6REV'(.) —



where use has been made of (A.2). Equations (A.2) and (A.3) imply



(A.4)         U'(c) = &REU'(ct+i).


Using the quadratic utility function specified in equation (3), eq.(A.4) can

be expressed as
                                             - 24   -

Define expected human wealth by




(A.6)         Eh —    EtY()'y+.
From eq.(A.6) we obtain



(A.7)
              y Eh - Eh+i.

Define expected wealth by

                                  -i     +



Then, from the constraints (eqs.(2a) and (2b)) and from eq.(A.7) we get

                                  ()Ew+i.

Substituting (A.ll) into (A.l2) yields

Rearranging terms in equation (A.l3) yields

The solution specified in equation (A.lO) is confirmed when (A.14) holds for

all Ewt. This requirement is fulfilled when the bracketed terms                         in    (A.14)

equal zero. Thus,

in the empirical analysis.

separate stochastic processes for Y and Tt                     as in eqs.(8) and (9),

This gives equation (14) of the text.

To see this, one can use equations (A.9) and (A.21) to obtain



(A.3l)      [(1 - ÔR)a

                + [i + &                                — 0,



which holds for any values of                and          when        and fl   are chosen SO
that the bracketed terms are zero.

     It can be verified that the expressions for                        and      which solve

(A.3l) are given in equations (A.15) and (A.16), respectively.                      Equation
(15) of the text is obtained from equation (A.30) using similar calculations

as done in section 1 of the appendix.

5.   The present/addresses the issue of consumption and government finance

     that was analyzed also in Leiderman and Razin (1986). However, the

     present framework is different from the previous one in five major

     respects:    (1)    It explicitly models the stochastic environment (by

     using a quadratic utility function);       (2)    It allows for a joint
     estimation of the consumption and the driving-force equations;      (3) It
     allows for consumption durability;          (4) It allows for substitution

     between public and private consumption;          and (5)    It permits the
     existence of liquidity constraints.

6.   See Blanchard (1985). Throughout we use the assumption of a constant

     real rate. While this is a restrictive assumption, it need not be very

     unrealistic in an economy with widespread indexation in financial

     markets.

7.   We use         in this formulation because earned income (wages) during

     period t-l is typically paid at the beginning of period t.     We   also

     allow for a stochastic component of payment, Vt, during period t.

8.   On the sensitivity of the empirical results with respect to alternative

     specifications see fn.7, below.

9.   Experimentation with univariate         and multivariate autoregressive

     processes with longer lag structures for the forcing variables and with

     constant terms yielded results that do not reject the present first-

     difference univariate system (with no constants).

10. These monthly measures of consumption are closely correlated with the

     national-accounts series for consumption.       Using quarterly moving
     averages of the monthly purchases data we obtain a correlation

     coefficient of 0.9 between our time series and the national-accounts

     quarterly consumption series. (See also Fisher (1986)) In conformity

     with the theoretical model one should have used per-capita data.

     However, in view of the small changes in population during the short

     sample period and the unavailability of these data on a monthly basis

     we use aggregate data in the study..

11. Experimenting with different lags as well as different realistic values

     of R did not yield noticeably different results from those reported in

     Table 1. We a-priori set the value of R in order to identify the

     other parameters.

12. This result is different from that in Leiderman and Razin (1986). It

     turns out that once we allow for some degree of durability in

     consumption   (as in the present paper) the results become more

     favourable to Ricardian neutrality.

13.   Interestingly, Hansen and Singleton (1983) also found that the point

      estimate of 6 (with monthly U.S. data) is close to (and sometimes

      above) unity.

14. This estimate for the degree of relative risk aversion falls within the

      range of those reported in studies for the U.S.

15. This may reflect improper measurement of public consumption in our data

      set.   This measure is derived from cash-flow accounts of the Treasury,

      which partly include transfer payments such as consumption subsidies.

      In a study based on U.S. data, Aschauer (1985) reports estimated value

      for 0 of 0.23.

16. As shown by Frenkel and Razin (1986), private spending responds

      differently to cuts in alternative types of taxes.

17. For a theoretical analysis, see Helpman and Razin (1987, forthcoming).
