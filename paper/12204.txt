Intergenerational Risksharing and Equilibrium Asset Prices

JEL No. G1, H3

                                           ABSTRACT

In the presence of overlapping generations, markets are incomplete because it is impossible to
engage in risksharing trades with the unborn. In such an environment the government can use a
social security system, with contingent taxes and benefits, to improve risksharing across generations.
An interesting question is how the form of the social security system affects asset prices in
equilibrium. In this paper we set up a simple model with two risky factors of production: human
capital, owned by the young, and physical capital, owned by all older generations. We show that a
social security system that optimally shares risks across generations exposes future generations to
a share of the risk in physical capital returns. Such a system reduces precautionary saving and
increases the risk-bearing capacity of the economy. Under plausible conditions it increases the
riskless interest rate, lowers the price of physical capital, and reduces the risk premium on physical
capital.

1    Introduction
The design of public pension systems is a subject of active discussion around the world.
Important questions are how to combine pay-as-you-go with prefunded pension benefits,
and how to adjust benefits and taxes to unanticipated shocks. Traditional public pension
systems set fixed benefit rates to be financed by fixed rates of payroll taxation. Economic
shocks may require adjustments in benefits, tax rates, or both, and adjustments have often
been made (McHale 2001); but the nature of these adjustments is not always spelled out in
advance. This lack of clarity is unfortunate, because pay-as-you-go pension systems with
contingent taxes and benefits can be used to improve risksharing between generations. In
eﬀect, the government can use its powers of taxation to share capital and labor income risks
across generations. Private markets cannot accomplish this because future generations are
absent from the marketplace today.
    Any analysis of a contingent public pension system, or contingent social security, should
consider the eﬀect of the system on private asset markets. The willingness of households to
save, and to bear private investment risk, depends on their expectations about future social
security payments and the correlation of these payments with risky asset returns. Thus the
form of the social security system can influence the riskless interest rate and the pricing of
risky assets.
    To analyze such eﬀects, we need a model with overlapping generations (OLG) in order
to capture the special role of social security.    Unfortunately, OLG models are hard to
work with. The classic two-period OLG model of Samuelson (1958) and Diamond (1965)
has inelastic supply of assets by the old (who have no reason to save), and inelastic demand
for assets by the young (who have no reason to consume). A three-period extension of
the model (Constantinides, Donaldson, and Mehra 2002) is more realistic, but analytically
intractable. In this paper, we follow Blanchard (1985) and Gertler (1999) and use a model
in which agents face a constant probability of death each period.
   We simplify our analysis further by assuming fixed supplies of two assets, human capital
that is owned entirely by the youngest generation alive in each period, and physical capital
that is used for savings. Our assumption that physical capital cannot be accumulated is often
used in the finance literature on the pricing of the aggregate equity market, following Lucas
(1978) and Mehra and Prescott (1985). Following Lucas, we can think of our economy as
having two “fruit trees”. The first tree produces fruit that is owned by each new generation,
but no single generation owns the tree itself. The second tree is owned by older generations
and sold to younger ones. The assumption of fixed asset supplies means that the social
security system has large eﬀects on asset prices but no eﬀects on asset quantities; however
our model suggests the direction of quantity eﬀects that would arise in a model with factor
accumulation.
    We assume that both human capital and physical capital pay risky dividends. In a
laissez-faire economy, these risks are shared across generations through their eﬀects on the
equilibrium price of physical capital. Although the old do not own human capital, they are
aﬀected by a low human capital dividend because this lowers the resources of the young and
thus lowers the price of physical capital that the old sell to the young. Similarly, although

                                              1
the young do not initially own physical capital, the dividend on physical capital aﬀects the
price of the capital that they buy. It turns out that in our model, the laissez-faire equilibrium
shares human capital risk, but not physical capital risk, optimally between the young and
the old. Thus there is a role for a contingent social security system to improve risksharing.
    Some previous authors, including Shiller (1999) and Ball and Mankiw (2001), have as-
sumed that human capital is riskless and have concentrated on the need to share physical
capital risk across generations. Bohn (2002, 2003) points out that in a standard production
model, labor income and physical capital income are proportionately exposed to technology
shocks.2 Empirical estimates of human capital risk are often quite low (Campbell, Cocco,
Gomes, and Maenhout 2001), but cointegration between human and capital income could
increase long-run measures of human capital risk (Benzoni, Collin-Dufresne, and Goldstein
2005). Our model justifies the concentration on physical capital risk without relying on the
assumption that human capital is riskless.


2         A Simple Model
We assume that each period (1 − χ) new agents are born and that each agent survives into
the next period with probability χ. This implies that there is a unit measure of agents alive
in every period. Agents stay young for one period and the young generation holds all the
human capital in the economy. Labor supply is inelastic and the aggregate stream of wages
earned by young workers is given by {ht }∞t=0 , where ht > 0 for all t. There are two tradable
assets in the economy, riskfree one-period bonds and risky physical capital. There is a fixed
supply of one unit of risky physical capital which pays a dividend stream {dt }∞    t=0 , where
dt > 0 for all t. The ex-dividend unit price of physical capital is denoted by pt .
        These assumptions could be justified by a production function of the following form:

                                 Yt = ht H + dt K, with H = K = 1,

where H denotes aggregate human capital and K the total supply of physical capital.


2.1        Annuitization
We assume that individual investors purchase physical capital from annuity companies which
operate in a competitive market. The contract investors sign with the annuity company
specifies that their physical capital holdings are taken over by the company at the time of
their death. In exchange for this contingent claim, the annuity company agrees to pay them
an extra income stream {At } per unit of physical capital during their lifetime.
   At the beginning of every period, a fraction (1 − χ) of the population dies and is replaced
by an equal measure of young agents. With homogeneous horizons, the death rates are
equal at all points of the wealth distribution. This implies that, at the beginning of every
    2
    Bohn also assumes that the price of physical capital is stable, so that the owners of physical capital have
a lower overall exposure to technology shocks than the owners of human capital.


                                                      2
period, the annuity companies are left with a fraction (1 − χ) of the aggregate claims on
physical capital from those who die. Given that only a measure χ of agents survive from the
previous period, the total amount of annuity payments due by the annuity company at the
beginning of period t equals χAt . It follows that an annuity company can break even every
period by oﬀering individual investors a per period annuity payment per unit of physical
capital equal to:
                                           1−χ
                                    At =        (dt + pt )
                                             χ
in exchange for a contingent claim to their physical capital holdings in the event of their
death. This multiplies the gross return on physical capital by a factor 1/χ.
    We also assume that individuals can use the annuity company to borrow or lend at a
deterministic rate. Again, the idea is that the annuity company takes over the debt or
assets of individuals when they die. With a large enough population of agents, the annuity
company can break even by oﬀering a higher rate on savings and asking for a higher rate
on loans than the going riskless rate in the bond market. With a competitive market for
annuities and homogeneous horizons, the gross interest rate in the annuities market Ra,t+1
is 1/χ times the gross riskless rate in the bond market Rf,t+1 :
                                                   1
                                    1 + Ra,t+1 =     (1 + Rf,t+1 ).

2.2     Laissez Faire Equilibrium
With log utility of consumption, an agent born at date r 6 t (and surviving up to date t),
maximizes the following objective function at date t:
                                   (∞                    )
                                     X
                                Et      (βχ)s log(Cbt+s
                                                    r
                                                        ) ,
                                          s=0

      bt+s
where C r
           denotes per capita consumption3 at date t + s of a consumer born at date r.
   The assumption of log utility implies that in period t, agents of any generation r consume
a constant fraction of their wealth at date t:

                                         C             ctr ,
                                         btr = (1 − βχ)W                                           (1)

      ctr denotes per capita wealth in period t of an agent born in period r 6 t.
where W
   Summing equation (1) for all consumers alive in period t gives the following relationship
between aggregate consumption and aggregate wealth:

                                         Ct = (1 − βχ)Wt .
  3                                                                      btr the per capita consumption
    We adopt the following convention throughout the paper. We denote by C
in period t of an individual born in period r 6 t.                  r
                                                     We denote by Ct the aggregate consumption of all
the agents who were born in period r and who survived up to period t. Finally, Ct denotes aggregate
consumption of all agents alive in period t.

                                                   3
    We assume that only net output can be consumed. Then aggregate consumption needs
to equal net output in equilibrium:

                                     Ct = Yt = (ht + dt ).

Aggregate wealth of the economy is given by current output plus the ex dividend value of
physical capital:
                                  Wt = (ht + dt ) + pt.

   These equilibrium conditions pin down the current price of physical capital in terms of
current output and parameters of the model:
                                              βχ(ht + dt )
                                       pt =                .                               (2)
                                                1 − βχ
The one period return on physical capital is then given by:
                                       dt+1 + pt+1   βχht+1 + dt+1
                          1 + Rt+1 =               =               .                       (3)
                                            pt.       βχ(ht + dt )

    These results can also be derived from equilibrium in the physical capital market. Since
all consumers invest the same fraction αt of their savings in the risky asset, the value of
physical capital and aggregate wealth need to satisfy the following relationship:

                                        pt = αt (βχWt ).

But because physical capital is the only asset in positive net supply, we must have αt = 1,
which implies the solution for the physical capital price given in equation (2).
    The ex dividend value of physical capital in (2) is increasing in both labor income ht and
the physical capital dividend dt . Labor income increases the value of physical capital by
increasing the desired saving of the young, while the physical capital dividend increases it by
reducing the desire of the old to sell physical capital to finance their current consumption.
That is, labor income increases the demand for physical capital, while dividend income
reduces the supply.
   The consumption of the young and the old in the laissez faire equilibrium are given by

                                       Ctt = (1 − βχ)ht                                    (4)

                           Ctr<t = dt + βχht = (1 − βχ)(dt + pt ),
where Ctt denotes the aggregate consumption of the young, that is the aggregate consumption
in period t of all agents born in period t, and Ctr<t denotes the aggregate consumption of
the old, that is the aggregate consumption in period t of all agents born in periods r < t
and surviving up to period t.
    The young consume a fraction (1 −βχ) of their wealth ht , and use the rest of their wealth
to buy physical capital. The old consume the dividend on physical capital and the proceeds
from their capital sales to the young. Equivalently, they consume a fraction (1 − βχ) of
their wealth (dt + pt ).

2.3     Asset Pricing Under Laissez Faire
Aggregating over all agents alive in both periods t and t+1 leads to a valid stochastic discount
factor (SDF). This group’s consumption in period t is equal to a fraction χ of aggregate
consumption Ct since only a fraction χ of all agents alive in period t survive into period
                                                              r<t+1
t+1. In period t+1 the group’s consumption is given by Ct+1         which, by definition, is the
aggregate consumption at date t + 1 of all the cohorts born before period t + 1.
    In the case of log utility, a valid SDF is therefore given by:
                                                 βχCt
                                        Mt+1 =    r<t+1 .                                   (5)
                                                 Ct+1

Using the equilibrium conditions from the previous section, the SDF simplifies to:
                                        βχ(ht + dt )      1
                              Mt+1 =                 =          .                           (6)
                                       βχht+1 + dt+1   1 + Rt+1
This condition, that the SDF is the reciprocal of the gross return on wealth, is standard
in a model with log utility. It is straightforward to check that the SDF in equation (6) is
consistent with the equilibrium price for physical capital derived in equation (2):

                    pt = Et [Mt+1 (dt+1 + pt+1 )]
                             ∙               µ                          ¶¸
                                βχ(ht + dt )           βχ(ht+1 + dt+1 )
                       = Et                     dt+1 +
                               βχht+1 + dt+1              1 − βχ
                         βχ(ht + dt )
                       =              .
                            1 − βχ

    The riskless rate in the laissez faire economy is given by:
                                                         µ          ¶

3.1    Risk Exposures Under Laissez Faire
Expected lifetime utility of an agent of generation t, by which we mean an agent born at the
beginning of period t, is given by:
                                         (∞                   )
                                          X
                               Ubtt ≡ Et     (βχ)s log(Cbt+s
                                                          t
                                                             ) .
                                           s=0

As before, hats denote per capita variables and time superscripts index an agent’s generation.
In period t, there is a measure (1 − χ) of agents of generation t, a measure χ(1 − χ) of agents
of generation t − 1, a measure χ2 (1 − χ) of agents of generation t − 2, and so on.

                                                 5
    The first thing to note is that all generations have some exposure to both human capital
risk and physical capital dividend risk in the laissez faire equilibrium. In particular, young
agents are exposed to dividend risk indirectly through the price of physical capital, which
determines the share of physical capital they can acquire with their savings. More formally,
                                                                              ht
agents of generation t have a deterministic per capita labor income of 1−χ       in the first period
of their life but no initial claims to physical capital. With log utility, they consume a fraction
(1 − βχ) of their wealth:

                                              ctt = (1 − βχ) ht .
                                btt = (1 − βχ)W
                                C
                                                            1−χ
The remainder of their wealth is invested in physical capital. The fraction of aggregate
                  t
physical capital b
                 θt an agent of generation t acquires depends on the price of physical capital
in period t:
                                  t    βχWctt   1 − βχ ht
                                 b
                                 θt =         =                 .
                                         pt      1 − χ ht + dt
A high dividend in period t has a negative eﬀect on the expected lifetime utility of agents of
generation t because it results in a higher physical capital price, which reduces the amount of
physical capital that these agents can acquire with their initial savings. High labor income
has an intuitive positive eﬀect on the expected lifetime utility of the agents who earn it.
    Older cohorts are exposed indirectly to human capital risk through its eﬀects on the
price of physical capital and thereby on the returns on their savings. The purpose of the
remainder of this section is to derive precise expressions for the exposures of the diﬀerent
cohorts to the two types of risk in this economy. In the Appendix we show that, for an
agent of generation t, expected lifetime utility at the beginning of period t is given by:

Agents of any generation r < t also consume a constant fraction of their wealth in period t:

                             ctr = (1 − βχ)br  1              r  1

                                               χ                 χ
         r
where b
      θt−1 denotes the share of physical capital brought forward from period t-1 by an agent
born at date r. The factor χ1 is due to the fact that consumers purchase the physical capital
from annuity companies in a competitive market.
   4
    In general, the parameter ϕt is time dependent due to potential persistence in the dividend process. In
the special case of i.i.d. dividends, ϕt is constant.


                                                    6
   The remainder is invested in physical capital. The share of physical capital acquired in
period t by an agent of generation r is:

                                r   βχWctr   1 βχht + dt br

The expected lifetime utility at the beginning of period t for an agent of generation r < t is
given by:

      btr =     1        btr ) − βχ log(ht + dt ) + ϕt
      U             log(C

The four terms in this rexpression may be interpreted as follows. The first term is a function
of the state variable b
                      θt−1 which gives the share of physical capital acquired in the previous
period by an agent of generation r < t. It incorporates the eﬀects of all past shocks since
the birth of generation r and up to period t − 1 on the expected lifetime utility of the agent.
The second term gives the eﬀect of the current shocks ht and dt on the unit value of physical
capital holdings (inclusive of annuity payments) brought forward from last period. Agents
of generation r consume a constant fraction of their wealth during period t and reinvest the
rest in physical capital. The amount of physical capital they can buy to carry forward into
period t + 1 depends negatively on the current price of physical capital and thus on current
output. This eﬀect is captured by the third term and could be described as reinvestment
risk. Finally, the last term measures the expected eﬀect of future output realizations on
                                                                       1
lifetime utility. This term is identical for all generations. The 1−βχ    factors multiplying
these terms arise because the eﬀects on consumption are permanent.
    Equation (8) shows that agents of all generations born before the current period have
exactly the same exposure of expected lifetime utility to current shocks. Furthermore,
comparing equations (7) and (8), one can see that agents of all generations are exposed to the
same reinvestment risk. Hence the only diﬀerence in exposure to current shocks across the
diﬀerent generations arises from diﬀerent exposures of period t wealth to contemporaneous
realizations of ht and dt .
   >From this argument it also follows that, in order to share the exposure to ht and dt
equally among all agents, it is suﬃcient to have a tax-transfer system that equalizes the
sensitivity of current wealth, and hence current consumption, to ht and dt across agents.


3.2    First Best Intergenerational Consumption Allocation
Suppose that the social planner designs a social security system behind a Rawlsian veil of
ignorance. The purpose of the social security system is to allocate net output optimally
between the diﬀerent cohorts alive in any given period. We assume that the planner places
equal weight on the welfare of all agents. The first order conditions of the planner’s problem
imply that the expected consumption path of any individual should decline at rate β, con-
ditional on survival of the agent. Given that only a fraction χ of any cohort survives into

                                              7
the next period, this implies the following optimal consumption allocations for the diﬀerent
cohorts:
                                    Ctt = (1 − βχ)(ht + dt )
                          Ctr = (1 − βχ)(βχ)t−r (ht + dt ), for r < t,
where Ctr denotes aggregate consumption in period t of the cohort born in period r. Aggre-
gating over all the old cohorts, the solution to the social planner’s problem calls for dividing
net output in each period between the young and old cohorts according to the following
fractions:
                                    Ctt = (1 − βχ)(ht + dt )
                                     Ctr<t = βχ(ht + dt ).
Comparing this to the consumption allocations in the decentralized equilibrium,

                                       Ctt = (1 − βχ)ht                                     (9)

                                      Ctr<t = βχht + dt ,
shows that the optimal policy in this economy calls for a net wealth transfer of dt from the
old to the young in each period, contrary to what we usually think of as a social security
system. This comparison also highlights the fact that human capital risk is shared optimally
in the laissez faire equilibrium. The old already hold the optimal exposure to human capital
risk indirectly through the price of physical capital.


3.3    “Second Best” with Full Risksharing
In order to distinguish between redistribution of the average physical capital dividend and
reallocation of physical capital risk, we now write the physical capital dividend as

                                         dt = μdt + εt ,

where μdt = Et−1 (dt ) and εt is the pure risk component of the dividend on physical capital.
We assume that εt is independent and identically distributed over time.
    Suppose that, instead of implementing the first best consumption allocation, the social
planner only partially reallocates the mean consumption level between generations but still
tries to achieve the optimal allocation of consumption risk:

                             Ctt = (1 − βχ)(ht + εt ) + (1 − θ)μdt                         (10)

                                  Ctr<t = βχ(ht + εt ) + θμdt ,
where θ > βχ, with θ = βχ corresponding to the first best consumption allocation. This
setup allows for deterministic transfers from old to young (θ < 1) or from young to old




                                               8
(θ > 1)5 . The knife-edge case of θ = 1 corresponds to “pure risksharing”.                    In the pure
risksharing equilibrium, the desired consumption allocations are given by:

                                        Ctt = (1 − βχ)(ht + εt )                                       (11)

                                       Ctr<t = βχ(ht + εt ) + μdt .

    We require the aggregate payroll tax on the young Tt to equal the aggregate social security
payouts to all old cohorts St , so that the system is balanced each period. In the presence of
social security, the expected lifetime wealth of agents includes expected future social security
transfers. The anticipated transfer stream accruing to the cohort that is young in period t
is given by:

                 {−Tt , (1 − βχ)St+1 , (1 − βχ)βχSt+2 , (1 − βχ)(βχ)2 St+3 , ......}.

The value of this expected income stream in period t may be written as:

                                           −Tt + (1 − βχ)zt ,

where zt is the value of the following stream of payments:

                                   {St+1 , βχSt+2 , (βχ)2 St+3 , ......}.

Similarly, the value of present and future social security transfers to those who are old in
period t may be written as:
                                         St + βχzt .
zt can be interpreted as the present value of future social security payouts accruing to all
generations currently alive.
   The correct measure of wealth in the presence of social security incorporates anticipated
future payouts:

                                   Wtt = [ht − Tt + (1 − βχ)zt ]
                                  Wtr<t = [dt + pt + St + βχzt ].

With log utility, individual optimization implies that consumption is a constant fraction of
wealth:

                                Ctt = (1 − βχ)[ht − Tt + (1 − βχ)zt ]
                              Ctr<t = (1 − βχ)[dt + pt + St + βχzt ].

It is easy to verify that the following transfer policy implements the social planner’s con-
sumption allocations in equation (10):
                                         θ − βχ
                         Tt = St = μdt          + βχht − (1 − βχ)(dt + pt ).                           (12)
                                         1 − βχ
   5
     In order to rule out the possibility of negative consumption in some states of the world for either age
group, we assume that the human dividend process has a lower bound h> μdt and we restrict the range of
the deterministic part of the transfer to βχ < θ < βχ + (1 − βχ) μh .
                                                                  dt

3.4    Asset Pricing in the Presence of Social Security
In the presence of a social security system, the SDF is given by:

                    s       βχCt                  βχ(ht + dt )
                   Mt+1 =    r<t+1 =                                                           (13)
                            Ct+1     (1 − βχ)[dt+1 + pt+1 + St+1 + βχzt+1 ]

When social security takes the particular form assumed in the previous section, the expression
for the SDF simplifies to:

                    s             βχ(ht + dt )                ht + dt
                   Mt+1 =                             =        θμdt+1
                                                                                               (14)
                            βχ(ht+1 + εt+1 ) + θμdt+1   ht+1 + βχ     + εt+1

   In the presence of social security, aggregate consumption in period t is given by:

           Ct = Ctt + Ctr<t
              = (1 − βχ)[ht − Tt + (1 − βχ)zt ] + (1 − βχ)[dt + pt + St + βχzt ]
              = (1 − βχ)[ht + dt + pt + zt ].

Aggregate consumption needs to equal net output in equilibrium:

                                        Ct = Yt = ht + dt .

This equilibrium condition pins down the sum of the aggregate ex dividend value of physical
capital and expected future social security payouts accruing to those currently alive:

                                                 βχ(ht + dt )
                                     pt + zt =                .                                (15)
                                                   1 − βχ

The stochastic discount factor for general social security derived in equation (13) should
price physical capital and the social security payout stream {St+1 , βχSt+2 , (βχ)2 St+3 , ......} :
                                             s
                                   pt = Et [Mt+1 (dt+1 + pt+1 )]                               (16)
                                            s
                                  zt = Et [Mt+1 (St+1 + βχzt+1 )]
                          s
It is easy to check that Mt+1 is consistent with the equilibrium condition (15):

   pt + zt = Et [Mt+1  (dt+1 + pt+1 + St+1 + βχzt+1 )]

3.5       Eﬀect of Social Security on the Riskless Rate of Interest
The simple expressions for the SDF in the two economies derived in equations (6) and (14)
provide a direct way of assessing the eﬀect of diﬀerent social security arrangements on the
riskless rate of interest. In what follows, ρhd denotes the correlation between the human
and physical capital dividends. The variances of the innovations to the human and physical
dividend processes are denoted by σ 2h and σ 2d .
   Proposition 1a In the case of deterministic dividends to human capital, a pure risk-
sharing social security policy unambiguously increases the riskless rate of interest. For θ = 1
                         lf
               s
and σ 2h = 0, Rf,t+1 > Rf,t+1 .
    In the case of stochastic dividends to human capital, a pure risksharing social security
policy increases the riskless rate of interest provided that the dividends to human and physical
                                                                         lf
                                                                s
capital are positively correlated. For θ = 1 and σ 2h > 0, Rf,t+1    > Rf,t+1 if ρhd ≥ 0.
      Proof. See Appendix.
    The intuition for this eﬀect is that pure risksharing social security is a form of insurance
whereby all future generations eﬀectively hedge some of the rate of return risk on the savings
of those cohorts that are currently alive. As a result, those currently alive have a reduced
need for precautionary savings. Given that the riskless asset is in zero net supply in this
economy, the equilibrium riskless rate needs to rise in order to clear the bond market.
    The condition ρhd ≥ 0 is suﬃcient for this result to hold, but is stronger than necessary.
                                                                                    2βχ
A necessary and suﬃcient condition derived in the Appendix is that σσhd > −ρhd 1+βχ     . Note
that this will hold if human capital is suﬃciently safe relative to physical capital. To
understand this condition, consider what happens if it fails. If the two dividends are
negatively correlated (ρhd < 0) and the human capital dividend is riskier than the physical
capital dividend (σ h > σ d ), the old bear too little consumption risk under laissez faire. In
this case physical capital is a valuable hedge against human capital risk and the first best
policy increases the consumption risk of the old by giving future young generations the
benefit of this hedge. But this perverse case is unlikely to be empirically relevant, since
estimates of the correlation between human and physical capital risk tend to be positive
(Benzoni, Collin-Dufresne, and Goldstein 2005).
   Proposition 1b The eﬀect of a purely deterministic transfer stream from the young to
the old is to increase the riskless rate of interest. The opposite is true of a deterministic
transfer stream from the old to the young.
      Proof. See Appendix.
    Under a purely deterministic transfer τ , the consumption of the old and the young are
given by
                                   Ctt = (1 − βχ)ht − τ
                                          Ctr<t = βχht + dt + τ ,
where τ > 0 implies a net transfer from young to old and τ < 0 a net transfer from old to
young6 . The allocation of risk is identical to the decentralized equilibrium.

      In order to rule out the possibility of negative values of consumption in some states of the world for

                                                     11
   A deterministic transfer scheme from the young to the old in all future periods reduces
the need to save for those who are currently alive. In order for the bond market to clear,
the equilibrium riskless interest rate needs to rise. The opposite holds for a deterministic
transfer from the old to the young.


3.6     Eﬀect of Social Security on the Price of Physical Capital
The SDF derived in equation (14) can be used to solve explicitly for the price of physical
capital in the equilibrium with social security. Details are given in the Appendix. In the
case of i.i.d. dividends (μdt = μd for all t), the price of physical capital in the presence of
social security is equal to a constant multiple of the price under laissez faire:

                                               pst = F plf
                                                        t ,

where an explicit expression for the constant F is given in the Appendix. Depending on
the form of the social security system, this factor F can be smaller or larger than one. The
next two propositions give more precise conditions.

idends to physical capital, a pure risksharing social security policy (θ = 1) unambiguously
leads to a fall in the price of physical capital (F<1).
   In the case of i.i.d. dividends to human capital and i.i.d. dividends to physical capital, a
pure risksharing
          ∙      social security policy
                                  ¸     leads to a fall in the price of physical capital provided
                           1

   Proof. See Appendix.
    As noted in the previous section, a pure risksharing social security system reduces the
need for precautionary savings by those currently alive. The only savings vehicle available
in this economy is the risky physical capital asset. Since physical capital is in fixed supply,
this reduction in demand results in a lower equilibrium price.
    The covariance condition for Proposition 2a holds unambiguously when human capital
dividends are deterministic. It also holds for the particular stochastic processes we consider
for human capital dividends in our calibration exercise.
    Proposition 2b The eﬀect of a deterministic transfer stream from the young to the old
is to decrease the price of physical capital. The opposite is true of a deterministic transfer
stream from the old to the young.
   Proof. See Appendix.
   As in the previous section, these eﬀects may be interpreted as the result of changes in
savings needs of those currently alive.
   Equation (15) provides an alternative way of stating the intuition for these eﬀects. The
sum (pt + zt ) takes the same value irrespective of the particular form of the social security
either of the two age groups, we assume that the transfer is in the range −βχh < τ < (1 − βχ)h.

system. A pure risksharing policy means that social security is valuable, implying a positive
value for zt and therefore a lower physical capital price pt compared to laissez faire. The
same is true of a social security system that consists of deterministic transfers from the young
to the old.


3.7       Eﬀect of Social Security on the Return on Physical Capital
In the presence of social security and when dividends are i.i.d., the rate of return on physical
capital is given by:
                                                           dt+1
                                     s
                                          ht+1 + 1+F βχ−βχ
                                                     F      βχ
                               1 + Rt+1 =                       .
                                                 ht + dt
                                                     s                lf
   Proposition 3 When dividends are i.i.d., Et (1 + Rt+1 ) > Et (1 + Rt+1 ) iﬀ F < 1 and
            s                   lf
V art (1 + Rt+1 ) > V art (1 + Rt+1 ) iﬀ F < 1.
       Proof. See Appendix.
    If the price of physical capital falls, its average return increases but its volatility also
increases because the volatile current dividend has a larger proportional impact on the return.
This result implies that a pure risksharing social security system leads to an increase in the
expected rate of return on physical capital as well as an increase in its return volatility
compared to the laissez faire equilibrium. A deterministic transfer from the young to the
old has the same qualitative eﬀects, while a deterministic transfer from the old to the young
reduces expected returns and return volatilities on the risky asset.


3.8       Eﬀect of Social Security on the Risk Premium
There are two oﬀsetting eﬀects on the risk premium on physical capital. A pure risksharing
social security system improves the allocation of risk in the economy. This results in a
higher overall riskbearing capacity. A way to see this is to look at the portfolios of investors
in the two economies. In the presence of social security, investors eﬀectively hold an implicit
second asset (their claim to future social security benefits) in their portfolio. By design, this
second asset hedges the returns on the original asset (physical capital) held in the portfolio.
This makes investors less averse to the risk on the physical capital asset, thereby reducing
the risk premium they demand in equilibrium. There is however an oﬀsetting eﬀect. As
the previous section has demonstrated, a pure risksharing social security also increases the
return volatility of the risky asset, which, by itself, would tend to increase the risk premium.
    In our numerical analysis we find that, for all empirically plausible parameter values, the
first eﬀect dominates and the risk premium on physical capital falls as a result of introducing
a pure risksharing social security system.7
   7
     We can find counterexamples but they are somewhat artificial. In particular, if the physical capital
dividend is lognormally distributed with low mean and high volatility (e.g. μd = 0.1, σ d = 0.5), it is possible
for the risk premium to increase. This counterexample works with a deterministic human capital dividend
(μh = 1, σh = 0). However, the implied return volatilities on the risky asset are implausibly high, on the


                                                      13
4      Calibrating the Model
We interpret one period to last for twenty years. We set the survival probability χ equal to
2/3. This implies an expected economic lifetime of sixty years. The idea is that economic life
starts at around age twenty, there is an initial period of twenty years where agents earn labor
income, followed on average by two twenty year periods of financing consumption through
savings. The discount factor β is set to 0.96 on an annual basis.
    For the purpose of the simulations, we assume i.i.d. lognormal processes. The mean
of the human capital dividend μh is normalized to one. We set the mean of the physical
capital dividend μd equal to 1/2 in order to match the relative magnitudes of capital and
labor shares in national income for the United States. The standard deviation of the human
capital dividend σ h is set to 0.1 and we assume a correlation of 0.5 between human and
physical capital dividends at the 20 year horizon8 . We report results for several values of
the standard deviation of the physical capital dividend; σ d ranges from 0 to 0.12. These
parameter values imply that the endogenous volatility of the return on physical capital is
in a range between 0 and 35 per cent on an annual basis. In our figures, all variables are
plotted against the volatility of returns on physical capital.
    Figure 1 plots the riskless interest rate in the laissez faire and pure risksharing equilibria.
It confirms the result in Proposition 1 that a shift to a pure risksharing social security
system increases the riskless interest rate. The corresponding change in the risk premium
on physical capital is plotted in Figure 2. For our range of parameter values, the risk
premium always falls as a result of pure risksharing. The eﬀect of increased riskbearing
capacity thus dominates the eﬀect of the increased return volatility. Indeed, Figure 3 shows
that the increase in the volatility of returns on physical capital is relatively modest. We
should also note that the risk premia predicted by our model are generally much lower than
those observed empirically. This is a manifestation of the familiar equity premium puzzle. It
arises here in part because of our assumption of log utility and the low associated coeﬃcient
of relative risk aversion. Figure 4 illustrates the fact that the price of physical capital is
lower under pure risksharing, as shown in Proposition 2.


5      Conclusion
In this paper we have studied the eﬀects of government intergenerational transfers on asset
prices. Real-world social security systems can be interpreted as combinations of determinis-
tic transfers from young to old, and contingent transfers that enable young and old to share
their income risks. We have shown that both elements of social security systems have similar
eﬀects on asset prices. They reduce life-cycle and precautionary savings motives, and thus
increase the riskless interest rate and lower the price of physical capital. The lower price for
order of 100% on an annual basis.
   8
     In order to rule out the possibility of negative values of consumption for the young under pure risksharing,
we assume that ht follows the following process: ht = μd + z, where z is distributed lognormally with mean
(μh − μd ) and standard deviation σ h . This specification implies a lower bound on the human capital dividend
of h=μd .

physical capital increases the expected return on capital, but also increases the volatility of
that return because volatile dividends have a larger proportional impact. The eﬀect on the
risk premium is theoretically ambiguous; on the one hand the riskbearing capacity of the
economy increases when risks are better shared across generations, but on the other hand the
return risk of physical capital is greater. In realistic examples the former eﬀect dominates,
and social security reduces the risk premium for physical capital.
   We have derived these results using a stylized model in which physical capital cannot
be accumulated. A natural extension of our approach would allow capital accumulation.
Social security would then have smaller eﬀects on asset prices, but would lower the capital
stock in long-run equilibrium. If risky and riskless capital could be separately accumulated,
our results suggest that social security systems would have a milder negative eﬀect on the
accumulation of risky capital because the increased riskbearing capacity of the economy
partially oﬀsets the eﬀect of reduced saving.
    All these results apply in reverse if we consider recent proposals to reduce intergenera-
tional transfers and encourage private retirement saving. These proposals have the potential
to increase overall capital accumulation and drive down interest rates, but if they reduce in-
tergenerational risksharing the increased saving may be disproportionately directed towards
safe assets in which case the equity premium may increase.

   Derivation of risk exposures under laissez faire
    It is easy to derive closed form relationships relating the share of physical capital hold-
ings, consumption and wealth of an agent of generation t in all future periods to dividend
realizations since the time of birth and parameters of the model. The share of physical
capital holdings purchased in period t + s, conditional on survival, is given by the following

   Proof of Proposition 1a
   Noting that,
                                           1
                                                  = Et [Mt+1 ],
                                       1 + Rf,t+1
                            s        lf            s            lf
                           Rf,t+1 > Rf,t+1 iﬀ Et [Mt+1 ] < Et [Mt+1 ].
By Jensen’s inequality, this condition is equivalent to:
                                   μdt+1                         μ       εt+1
                   V art [ht+1 +         + εt+1 ] < V art [ht+1 + dt+1 +      ],
                                    βχ                            βχ     βχ
which says that the denominator of the SDF in the decentralized equilibrium is a mean-
preserving spread of the denominator of the SDF under pure risksharing social security.
This last condition is clearly satisfied in the case of deterministic dividends to human capital
since βχ < 1.
   In the case of stochastic dividends to human capital, the condition can be rewritten as
                                         σd         2βχ
                                            > −ρhd        .
                                         σh        1 + βχ
Hence a suﬃcient condition in the case of stochastic dividends to human capital is that
ρhd ≥ 0.
   Proof of Proposition 1b
   With a purely deterministic social security transfer, the SDF is given by:

                                      s            ht + dt
                                     Mt+1 =                        .
                                              ht+1 + dβχ
                                                      t+1
                                                          +    τ
                                                              βχ

Comparing this expression to the SDF under laissez-faire,

                                         lf        ht + dt
                                        Mt+1 =               ,
                                                 ht+1 + dβχ
                                                         t+1




shows that:
                                        s            lf
                                   Et [Mt+1 ] < Et [Mt+1 ] iﬀ τ > 0.

   Derivation of the price of physical capital with social security
   We can use the SDF in the presence of social security to price physical capital:

                                    pst = Et [Mt+1
                                               s
                                                   (dt+1 + pt+1 )].

Substituting in the expression for the SDF:
                                "                                    #
                         s              ht + dt
                        pt = Et          θμdt+1
                                                       (dt+1 + pt+1 ) .

     The limit case θ = βχ corresponds to the first best consumption allocation. The land price goes to
infinity in this case.

    Under this condition the price of physical capital is finite, given by the following expres-
sion:
                                         ©                            ª
                        pst = (ht + dt ) E2 + E2 E1 + E2 (E1 )2 ...
                                            E2
                            = (ht + dt )         .
                                         1 − E1
The price of physical capital in the presence of social security is thus equal to a constant
fraction of the price under laissez faire:

                                            pst = F plf

      Proof of Proposition 2a
      In the case where θ = 1, the expression for F may be rewritten:

   Note that limσ2d →0 F = 1. More generally, the expectation term in the denominator is
positive since dividends are positive by assumption. Hence:
                                     "                            #
                                                      1
                      F < 1 iﬀ Covt dt+1 ,                          < 0.
                                            ht+1 + dt+1 + 1−βχ

This condition holds unambiguously in the special case when the human capital dividend is
deterministic (ht+1 = h). Indeed, in this case:
     "                       #            "                                          #

   For stochastic human capital dividends on the other hand, we need to impose that:
                              "                            #

                                                        μd

for the result to hold.
   Proof of Proposition 2b
  With a purely deterministic social security transfer, the expressions for E1 and E2 are
modified as follows:                  "                    #
                                           ht+1 + dt+1
                             E1 = Et
                                        ht+1 + dβχ
                                                 t+1
                                                     + βχτ

                                      "                    #
                                              dt+1
                             E2 = Et                         .
                                        ht+1 + dβχ
                                                t+1     τ
                                                     + βχ
In this case, the expression for F can be rewritten as:
                                                 ∙                  ¸
                                                           1
                                              Et          dt+1
                              1           τ        ht+1 + βχ      τ
                                                               + βχ
                                 =1+             ∙                  ¸
                              F        1 − βχ            dt+1
                                              Et          dt+1    τ
                                                                ht+1 +   βχ
                                                                              + βχ


The two expectations in this expressions are positive since dividends are positive by assump-
tion and the expression in the denominator of the expectations is a scalar multiple of the
consumption of the old age group, which is positive as long as −βχh < τ < (1 − βχ)h (the
restriction on transfers discussed in the main text).
   Hence F < 1 iﬀ τ > 0, which means that transfer is from the young to the old.
   Proof of Proposition 3
   Note that the return on physical capital in the presence of social security may be rewrit-
ten:                                    ∙        µ             ¶     ¸
                          s        1                   1 − βχ
                     1 + Rt+1 =          ht+1 + 1 +              dt+1 .
                                ht + dt                 F βχ
         ∂Et (Rst+1 )             ∂V art (Rst+1 )                             s      lf
Hence        ∂F
                        < 0 and        ∂F
                                                    < 0. Noting that limF →1 Rt+1 = Rt+1 completes the
proof.
