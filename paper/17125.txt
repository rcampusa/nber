                                            ABSTRACT

We examine provider responses to the Medicare inpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF) prospective
payment system (PPS), which simultaneously reduced marginal reimbursement and increased average
reimbursement. IRFs could respond to the PPS by changing the total number of patients admitted,
admitting different types of patients, or changing the intensity of care for admitted patients. We use
Medicare claims data to separately estimate each type of provider response to the PPS. We also examine
changes in patient outcomes and spillover effects on other post acute care providers. We find that costs
of care initially fell following the PPS implementation, which we attribute to changes in treatment
decisions rather than the types of patients admitted to IRFs. However, the probability of admission
to IRFs increased after the PPS due to the expanded admission policies of providers. We find modest
spillover effects on skilled nursing home costs and no substantive impact on patient health outcomes.

1. Introduction


         Concerns over the financial solvency of Medicare have focused attention on curtailing

health care spending for Medicare beneficiaries. However, these concerns are not new, and the

Medicare program has attempted to curtail costs for the past several decades. Perhaps the most

important, and certainly the most used, weapon in Medicare’s arsenal for lowering costs is a

change in the method of Medicare reimbursement to health care providers. The first such major

attempt at cost containment was the 1983 implementation of the acute care hospital prospective

payment system. The hope was that shifting providers from a cost-based reimbursement to

prospectively defined reimbursement would decrease costs. Early evidence certainly suggested

that the new payment system reduced both costs and average acute length of stay (Kahn et al.

1990).

         However, Medicare continued to reimburse post-acute care (PAC) providers on a cost-

basis, leading to an explosion in post-acute care facilities and utilization of post-acute care

services in the late 1980s and 1990s (Newhouse 2002). Medicare responded again to this dramatic

increase in costs by using its weapon of choice: prospective payment. Between 1997 and 2003,

prospective payment systems were implemented for each type of post-acute setting including

home health agencies, skilled nursing facilities, inpatient rehabilitation facilities, and long-term

care hospitals.

         More recently, passage of the health care reform bill has generated interest in a new

approach to prospective payment that provides a single "bundled" payment for an episode of care

consisting of an acute-care hospitalization and any post-acute care that occurs within a defined

period of time. The hope is that this new payment system can tackle the thorny problem of high

Medicare costs without diminishing quality of care. In this context, analyzing past experience with



                                                   3
prospective payment for post-acute care and understanding its potential effects is important from

both an academic and policy perspective.

       In this paper, we estimate the effects of the Medicare fee-for-service inpatient

rehabilitation prospective payment system (IRF-PPS). Under the IRF-PPS, an IRF receives a

payment for providing care to a patient that is based on a "case-mix group", defined by a patient’s

age, diagnosis, comorbidities, and functional status (Buntin et al. 2006). By decreasing marginal

reimbursement for additional services, the IRF-PPS was meant to reduce the use of unnecessary

services and lead to a more efficient provision of post-acute care. By determining reimbursement

as a function of a facility's case mix and increasing reimbursement for more critical patients, the

PPS was meant to improve access to IRF care and discourage selective admission of less severe

patients (Buntin et al. 2006, Stineman 2002). Increased average reimbursement for patients treated

at IRFs thereby mitigated the incentives to curtail costs inherent in reduced marginal payments

(Sood et al. 2008).

       We use the experience with IRF-PPS to understand how a change in payment policy such

as a bundled payment that simultaneously reduces marginal reimbursement and increases average

reimbursement can influence provider behavior. We are not only interested in understanding the

effect of this payment change on costs but also in understanding the pathways through which

changes might occur. Changes in payments can influence costs in two ways: first, by affecting the

“admission policies" or "admission thresholds” of IRFs, that is, the likelihood that a particular

patient is admitted to an IRF, and second by affecting the "treatment policies" of IRFs, that is, the

intensity of care and type of treatment that a particular patient receives. Moreover, both types of

payment changes may have important spillovers for other post-acute care providers because of the

substitutability of care across sites (Buntin, et al., 2010). Finally, prospective payment might have




                                                  4
deleterious effects on access to or outcomes of post-acute care if facilities respond to prospective

payment incentives by either cream skimming or stinting on care (Ellis and McGuire 1996, Rogers

et al. 1990).

        In this study, we use a consistent empirical framework and a unique and rich data set to

estimate these complex and varied effects of the IRF-PPS. Past empirical research on the IRF-PPS

and other prospective payment systems, while contributing to our understanding of the impacts of

prospective payment, does not simultaneously evaluate all of the potential changes in provider

behavior stemming from payment changes (e.g. McCall et al. 2003ab, McKnight 2006, White

2003). In some cases, authors estimate effects conditional on using a site of care and do not take a

Medicare-wide perspective in analyzing costs, payments and other outcomes of care (e.g. Sood et

al. 2008).

        We show that the IRF-PPS led to a substantial increase in payments to IRFs. For example,

in the first quarter of 2001, Medicare spent approximately $11,000 per IRF patient with a

diagnosis of hip fracture. By the full phase-in of the IRF-PPS in the first quarter of 2003, Medicare

spent over 25 percent more on IRF care. Our results suggest that this increase in payments led to

an increase in the probability of using IRFs, and that changes in admission probabilities were

driven by changes in admission policies of IRFs rather than changes in composition of patients

being discharged from acute care hospitals. Despite more generous reimbursement for providers,

patients received less intense care once they were admitted to IRFs after the PPS. Again, this

reflects changes in treatment policy of IRFs rather than changes in the types of patients admitted to

IRFs. Finally, some of the cost savings from reduced intensity of care in IRFs were offset by

increased costs at other post-acute care settings. The various changes in patterns of post-acute

care, however, did not substantively affect mortality, institutionalization, or acute readmissions.




                                                  5
       The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. In section 2, we discuss the IRF-PPS in greater

detail. Section 3 describes the conceptual framework, section 4 data, section 5 our empirical

strategy, and section 6 presents results. Section 7 concludes.



2. The IRF-PPS

       IRFs are inpatient post-acute care sites that provide rehabilitative therapy, either in a

hospital-based unit or as part of a freestanding provider. In 2008, over 300,000 Medicare FFS

patients received IRF care, with Medicare payments of almost $6 billion dollars (Medpac 2010a).

An important factor distinguishing IRFs from other post-acute settings is the intensity of

rehabilitation. Medicare requires that patients in IRFs receive 3 hours of therapy per day and

mandates that 75 percent of IRFs’ patients must be among a set of conditions deemed sufficiently

complicated to require such an intense level of therapy.

       Prior to the IRF-PPS in January 2002, IRFs were reimbursed based on average costs per

discharge, up to a facility-specific limit based on a facility’s average costs in its base year of

operation (Medpac 2006, Sood et al. 2008). Following the enactment of the IRF-PPS, IRF

payment shifted to a prospectively predetermined payment amount per discharge. This payment is

a function of the patient's case-mix group (defined by the primary reason for rehabilitation,

functional status, age, and comorbidities) and the provider's wage index and other characteristics,

and is adjusted for rural status, share of low-income patients, and short-stay and high-cost outliers

(Medpac 2010b). Each IRF transitioned to the PPS in its first fiscal year starting after January 1,

2002. Because of variation in fiscal year start dates, the PPS was effectively phased in throughout

2002, with the transition completed by January 2003.




                                                   6
3. Conceptual framework

          The conceptual model for the paper is adapted from Hodgkin and McGuire (1994) and

Ellis and McGuire (1996). Hodgkin and McGuire (1994) examine the effects of payment change

on the intensity of treatment (the “treatment policy”). We model both the decision of the provider

to admit patients (the “admission policy”) as well as decisions regarding treatment intensity (the

“treatment policy”).

          Consider a provider who has N potential patients eligible for admission into its facility. For

each patient, the provider needs to decide the probability of admitting that patient        , as well as

the intensity of care,      , provided to the patient once admitted. We assume a general objective

function for the provider where the provider derives utility from profits, the probabilities of

admitting patients and the intensity of care provided to patients. The probabilities of admitting

patients and the intensity of care enter the utility function directly as health care providers might

have altruistic concerns about the welfare or health of eligible patients. The provider faces a

mixed payment system with an average reimbursement of a and a marginal reimbursement of m .

          First consider the providers’ admission problem:

(1.)                ,   ,                       ∑                   1


       Where     is the average reimbursement and mj is the marginal reimbursement, which is a

       function of observed accounting costs,       is the probability of admitting patient and   is the

       intensity of treatment or the costs of treating patient . Thus,               1     is the profit

       from patient . The first order condition for admission policy is:



(2.)      :                         1




                                                       7
        The above condition shows that providers choose the probability of admission so that the

marginal utility of increase in admission probability for a particular patient equals the change in

profits from admitting the patient times the marginal utility of profits. Also note that if the patient

is profitable,              1        0, the probability of admission is one. In other words, all

profitable patients will be admitted, assuming no capacity constraints. If there are such constraints,

the provider takes the most profitable patients until the constraint is binding.

        We are interested in understanding how provider decisions with regard to admissions

change as average,       , and marginal,       , reimbursement change. An increase in either type of

reimbursement increases the expected profitability of patients. Assuming                    1        is

negative, this makes the right hand side of (2.) smaller and hence increases the probability of

admission and the total volume of patients seen by the provider.

        As noted earlier, the IRF-PPS simultaneously increased average reimbursement but

decreased marginal reimbursement. Thus, the effects of the IRF-PPS on admission policy are a

priori ambiguous. Furthermore, the effects of the IRF-PPS on profitability of patients might vary

by patient characteristics and depend on how well the case mix adjustment of payments under the

IRF-PPS matches the expected costs of treating patients. In general, IRFs have the incentive to

increase admission probabilities for patients who became more profitable due to the

implementation of the IRF-PPS. We refer to the change in the severity or type of patients seen at

IRFs after the implementation of the IRF-PPS as the “selection” effect of the IRF-PPS.

        Now we consider the effect of changes in reimbursement on treatment policy or decisions

about treatment intensity after a patient is admitted to a facility. The first order condition for

treatment policy is:



                                                   8
(3.)   :           1




        The above condition shows that providers choose the treatment policy so that the marginal

utility of an increase in treatment intensity for a particular patient equals the change in profits from

increasing intensity times the marginal utility of profits. Changes in treatment intensity can affect

profits through two channels. First, increases in treatment intensity increase the costs of treating

existing patients and so reduce profits. Second, for-profit providers will choose treatment intensity

to attract profitable patients subject to a capacity constraint (or a population constraint on

profitable patients).

        Equation (3) shows that treatment intensity and marginal reimbursement are positively

related. An increase in marginal reimbursement reduces the loss in profits from increasing

intensity and hence increases the intensity of treatment. An increase in average reimbursement

increases the profits of the provider and hence reduces the marginal utility of profits. This in turn

reduces the marginal value of loss in profits and hence increases the intensity of treatment.

Increases in average reimbursement also increase the profitability of patients, thus making it more

lucrative to attract patients by increasing intensity of treatment. Therefore, consistent with the

results in Hodgkin and McGuire (1994), our model also predicts that increases in average or

marginal reimbursement will increase the intensity of care. Because the IRF-PPS reduced

marginal reimbursement and increased average reimbursement, the effects of the IRF-PPS on

intensity of treatment are ambiguous.

        Finally, the changes in treatment and admission policy of IRFs could also affect patient

outcomes and have spillover effects on the behavior of other providers. For example, patients



                                                   9
discharged “too early” from IRFs might be at higher risk of suffering adverse health outcomes,

being readmitted to acute care hospitals or receiving care from other post-acute care providers.



4. Data and Measures

          Our analysis examines post-acute care payments, costs, and health outcomes for patients

discharged from acute care hospitals between January 2001 and June 2003 and whose principal

diagnosis for the acute admission was stroke, lower extremity joint replacement, or hip fracture.

These three conditions are the most prevalent conditions receiving post-acute care, accounting for

25% of all beneficiaries receiving post-acute care. Stroke patients are defined as those with a

principal diagnosis in the acute hospital stay of intracerebral hemorrhage (diagnosis code 431.xx),

occlusion and stenosis of precerebral arteries with infarction (433.x1), occlusion of cerebral

arteries with infarction (434.x1), or acute but ill-defined cerebrovascular disease (436.xx). Hip

fracture patients are defined as patients with a primary diagnosis of fractures of the neck of the

femur (820.xx). Lower extremity joint replacement patients1 were defined as patients with a

primary diagnosis for joint replacement, excluding hip fracture patients and patients with

reattachment procedures. Hip fracture patients who were treated with partial or total joint

replacement are included in the hip fracture group.

          The unit of analysis is an episode of care consisting of an acute-care hospitalization for one

of the three study conditions, which we call the index hospitalization, plus a fixed period of 90

days following discharge from the acute care hospital. We link a number of data sources to

construct the outcome and explanatory variables used in our analysis. In the sections that follow,

we describe the construction of the measures used in the analysis.

                                                   10
4.1. Data

4.1.1. Medicare Payments and Costs

       We use the Medicare claims data linked to data from Medicare cost reports to construct the

key Medicare reimbursement and cost measures. The Medicare claims data include 100 percent

Medicare standard analytic files (SAF) for home health agency claims from January 2001 to June

2003, 100 percent Medicare standard analytic files (SAF) for skilled nursing facility claims from

January 2001 to June 2003, and 100 percent MEDPAR data for acute hospital, IRF, and long term

care hospital claims following acute discharges from January 2001 to June 2003. We define IRF

and other post-acute reimbursement for each observation as total Medicare payments to IRFs (or

other post-acute sites) occurring within a 90-day post-acute episode following an initial acute care

discharge.

       We calculate the costs per patient incurred by facilities using charges in the claims data

and cost-to charge ratios from cost-reports. For acute hospital, hospital-based SNF, IRF, and

LTCH costs, we multiply total charges accrued in a given facility by the facility's total calendar

year cost-to-charge ratio. For stand-alone SNFs, we multiply routine costs-per-day by the total

number of days, plus the ancillary cost-to-charge ratio by ancillary (departmental) charges. For

HHAs, we multiply the number of visits by a facility's average calendar year cost per visit.

4.1.2. Health Outcomes

       The main health outcome in the study is a binary measure of whether a patient died or was

institutionalized in a nursing home at the end of the 90-day period following discharge from the

acute-care hospital as opposed to returning to the community. We identify deaths using Medicare




                                                 11
denominator files, and whether patients were institutionalized using data from the Minimum Data

Set, which reports information from all nursing homes that are certified by Medicare or Medicaid.

These nursing homes, including those that provide only custodial care, are required periodically to

assess the health and functional status of patients who reside in the facility for longer than 14 days.

We also assess readmissions to an acute-care hospital during the 90-day period following

discharge from the index hospitalization.2

4.1.3. Patient Characteristics

          We use information from the index hospitalization and Medicare denominator files to

measure patient characteristics. For each patient we collect and control for the list of comorbidities

developed by Elixhauser et al. (1998)3. We also measure a list of complications that occurred

during the index hospitalization4 including post-operative pulmonary compromise; post-operative

gastrointestinal hemorrhage; cellulitis or decubitus ulcer; septicemia; pneumonia; mechanical

complications due to a device, implant, or graft; shock or arrest in the hospital; post-operative

myocardial infarction; post-operative cardiac abnormalities other than AMI; procedure-related

perforation or laceration; venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism; acute renal failure;

miscellaneous complications; delirium; and dementia. We control for hip fracture in stroke and

joint replacement patients and for stroke in hip fracture and joint replacement patients. We use

information from Medicare enrollment files to describe patient demographics including gender,

2
  Longer post-acute episodes may capture later unrelated readmissions and subsequent costs, whereas shorter episodes may miss
related costs, readmissions, and patient outcome. We examine the sensitivity of the results to differing post-acute episode lengths,
in analysis not shown, and find similar results.

3
 Comorbidities include AIDS, alcoholism, deficiency anemias, rheumatoid arthritis/ collagen vascular diseases, blood loss anemia,
congestive heart failure, chronic pulmonary disease, coagulopathy, depression, diabetes without complications, diabetes with
chronic complications, drug abuse, hypothyroidism, liver disease, lymphoma, fluid and electrolye disorders, metastatic cancer,
other neurologic disorders, obesity, paralysis, peripheral vascular disease, psychoses, pulmonary circulation disease, renal failure,
solid tumor without metastasis, peptic ulcer disease excluding bleeding, valvular disease,, and weight loss. We do not include
hypertension, as it is ubiquitous in these populations, or cardiac arrythmias.

4 Because we are interested in the costs and health outcomes of post-acute-care, complications that occur during the index
hospitalization are important measures of the severity of patients when they are discharged from the acute-care hospital.


                                                                 12
age (controlled for separately in 5-year bands), race, whether a patient was covered by Medicaid,

and whether the patient lives in a MSA, adjacent to a MSA, or in a rural area.

4.1.4. Acute-care Hospital Characteristics

       Our analysis also controls for the characteristics of discharging acute-care hospitals, as

these may influence post-acute care. We derive information on the Medicare patient percentage in

the previous year from providers’ cost reports to CMS. We use the Medicare Provider of Services

file, a provider level database maintained by CMS, to determine the ownership status of a

particular facility (government, non-profit, or for-profit) and its size. We use information from the

Acute Impact file on the wage index, average daily census, number of acute beds, case-mix,

teaching status, previous year Medicare patient percentage (of total days), and low-income patient

percentage (disproportionate share patient percentage) as additional controls. Finally, we use

information from POS files to construct the distance from each patient's zip code to the closest of

each type of post-acute care provider as a measure of density of post-acute providers.

       Our analysis sample consists of 503,220, 776,249, and 645,213 episodes of care for hip

fracture, joint replacement, and stroke respectively. We drop 2.1%, 3.4%, and 2.2% of hip

fracture, joint replacement, and stroke episodes respectively due to various missing data.

Summary statistics for the analytic sample are presented in Table 1.



5. Empirical Approach

       The goal of our empirical analyses is to understand the sources of post-PPS changes in IRF

payments and costs across all acute care discharges for each of the three study conditions. To

achieve this goal, we develop an empirical strategy that enables us to estimate the effect of the

IRF-PPS on per-patient Medicare payments to IRFs, admission policies of IRFs, and per-patient




                                                 13
costs incurred by IRFs, holding constant the composition of patients discharged from acute-care

hospitals with one of the study conditions as well as the composition of patients receiving care in

IRFs. Our strategy also enables us to estimate the changes in outcomes after implementation of the

IRF-PPS that are due to changes in the composition of patients discharged from acute-care or

receiving care in IRFs. We also investigate the effects of the IRF-PPS on average costs to other

post-acute providers, acute readmissions, and mortality and institutionalization. For all analyses,

we define the pre-PPS period as acute care discharges occurring during the four calendar quarters

from January 2001 through December 2001 and the post-PPS period as the six quarters from 1

January 2002 through 30 June 2003. We estimate separate models for each study condition: hip

fracture, lower extremity joint replacement, and stroke.

       To summarize, our estimation approach involves empirically describing payment,

admission, and treatment policies as a function of patients' observable characteristics, where

changes in payments reflect Medicare payment policy and changes in admissions and costs reflect

IRF provider behavior. We use these estimates to simulate policies in pre- and post-PPS periods

for a constant patient cohort, to isolate the effects of the IRF-PPS on Medicare payments and

providers' treatment and admission policies5. We then simulate payments, costs, and admissions

using a constant set of post-PPS parameters for pre and post-PPS patient cohorts, to isolate effects

coming from changes in the composition of patients discharged from acute-care hospitals for

admission probabilities and of patients treated in IRFs for payments and costs. We now describe

our approach in detail.




5 This approach is similar in principle to the simulated instrumental variables strategy developed
in Currie and Gruber (1996ab).

          We characterize the admission policy of IRFs by modeling the probability of using any

IRF care for patients discharged from acute care hospitals with one of the study conditions.

Specifically, we estimate a probit model with an indicator variable for using any IRF care during a

90-day post-acute episode as the dependent variable. The covariates in the model include patient

demographics, comorbidities, complications, acute care provider characteristics, and density of

post-acute care providers, as described in the data section. We estimate separate probit models for

each quarter. Thus, we allow the admission policy of IRFs or the probability of admissions to IRFs

to change flexibly over time, including changes in the intercept that are common across all patients

and changes in coefficients on covariates which produce differential changes in admission

probabilities depending on patient characteristics or other covariates in the model.

   (4.)        Φ


          Next, we use these estimated probit coefficients to estimate the probability of using IRF

care in each quarter for a constant cohort of patients discharged from acute care in the first quarter

of 2001. These estimates isolate the changes in admission policy of IRFs, as they project the

probabilities of admission into IRFs in quarters 2 to 10, with a constant sample of acute discharges

from the first quarter of 2001. In order to estimate whether the IRF-PPS caused a change in the

admission policies of the IRF we estimate the following interrupted time series model:

   (5.)        α   δ             ∑       δ


Where,       is the probability of IRF admission for patient if he or she was discharged from acute

care in quarter .             is a linear time trend in quarter of discharge and       is an indicator

variable for the kth quarter after implementation of IRF-PPS in January 2002. The coefficients of

interest are δ which show the average change in probability of admission to IRFs in the kth




                                                   15
quarter due to changes in admission policies of IRFs assuming the linear time trend in the four

pre-PPS quarters continued.

          We use a similar strategy to estimate the effects of the IRF-PPS on the treatment policies

of IRFs. First, we estimate a series of OLS models for patients admitted to IRFs in each quarter

that estimate the costs of IRF care as a function of patient demographics, comorbidities,

complications, acute care provider characteristics and density of post-acute care providers. Next,

we use the estimated cost functions to calculate the costs of IRF care in each quarter for the cohort

of patients that were admitted to IRFs in the first quarter of 2001. Finally, to determine whether

the IRF-PPS caused a change in the treatment policies of the IRF we estimate the following

interrupted time series model:



   (6.)        λ   λ             ∑        λ


          The coefficients λ to λ describe the evolution of treatment policy or cost of care

conditional on using an IRF following the implementation of the IRF-PPS.

          We also simulate the effects of the IRF-PPS on payments in each quarter for a constant

IRF patient cohort and estimate equation (6), in order to show the magnitude of changes in

Medicare payments to providers.

          We are also interested in estimating the “selection effects” of the IRF-PPS, that is, the

extent to which payments and costs of care at IRFs changed due to changes in the types and

severity of patients admitted (within each tracer condition), and the extent to which the probability

of admission to an IRF changed as a result of changes in the composition of patients discharged

from acute-care hospitals. To quantify these effects, we estimate the counterfactual costs for each

cohort of patients admitted to IRFs from quarter 1 to quarter 10 using the cost function estimated



                                                    16
for IRF patients in the second quarter of 2003, after the IRF-PPS phase-in was complete. Thus, we

allow the patient population admitted to IRFs to change over time but keep the treatment policy

fixed at 2003 levels. Next, we use the interrupted time series model described above to describe

the evolution of selection effects following the implementation of the IRF-PPS. We conduct a

similar analysis to estimate the extent to which the probability of admission into IRFs changed due

to changes in the composition of patients being discharged from acute care hospitals. To quantify

these effects, we estimate the counterfactual probability of IRF admission for each cohort of

patients discharged from quarter 1 to quarter 10 using the admission function estimated in 2003

and use the interrupted time series model described above to describe the evolution of admission

and selection effects following the implementation of the IRF-PPS.

        Finally, we estimate the effects of the IRF-PPS on the costs of care for other post-acute

care providers, the probability of readmission to acute care, and the probability of death or

institutionalization. The empirical strategy for these outcomes is similar to the strategy used for

estimating treatment and admission policy effects. We omit a full description of the strategy in the

interest of brevity.

        Standard errors in all regression models are clustered at the health referral region (HRR)

level (Dartmouth Medical School 1996).



6. Results

        We begin by describing our estimates of the IRF-PPS on IRF reimbursement, resource use,

and admissions. We then consider the spillover effects of the IRF-PPS on other post-acute settings

and its effect on patient outcomes. Finally, we examine heterogeneous effects by differential

changes in average payments.




                                                  17
6.1. IRF reimbursement, treatment, and admissions policies

       Figure 1 graphically displays predicted IRF payments using coefficient estimates from

equations 5 and 6 for each study condition. In each case, the solid line represents the predicted

values and the dashed line represents the linear counterfactual trend had the PPS not been

implemented (i.e., predictions where the indicator variables POST1-POST6 are set to zero).

Accompanying coefficient estimates are displayed in Tables 2a-c for each study condition.

       Figure 1a displays simulated Medicare payments in each quarter from 2001 through the

second quarter of 2003, for the cohort of hip fracture patients in IRFs discharged from acute care

in the first quarter of 2001. Thus, this figure shows changes in Medicare IRF expenditures

stemming solely from changes in payment policy. This graph clearly shows a dramatic increase in

Medicare payments after PPS implementation beginning in 2002 relative to the payment trend

prior to the PPS. The increase in payments flattens after the full phase-in in 2003, nearly $2,400 or

more than 20 percent higher than pre-PPS levels. Figures 1b and 1c, show similar payment effects

for joint patients (~$2,300 increase) and an even larger effect for stroke patients (>$3,000

increase).

       Figures 2 and 3 examine the effects of this dramatic increase in payments on treatment and

admission policies of IRFs. Specifically, they display predicted IRF costs and admissions using

coefficient estimates from equations 5 and 6 for the three study conditions. As in Figure 1, the

solid line represents the predicted values and the dashed line represents the linear counterfactual

trend had the PPS not occurred. Accompanying coefficient estimates are displayed in Tables 2a-c

and 3a-c for each study condition.

        Figure 2a displays projected costs, simulated over the sample period for the 2001 quarter 1

cohort of IRF hip fracture patients. Despite Medicare's increased generosity, resource use for IRF




                                                 18
patients initially decreased following the PPS. Corresponding effects for joint and stroke patients

are are shown in Figures 2b and 2c. Decreases in resource use are slightly smaller for joint

patients and larger for stroke patients .

        Figures 3a to 3c show predicted admission probabilities for hip fracture patients

discharged from acute care hospitals in the first quarter of 2001, simulated in each later quarter

using estimates of equation (4). Because the patient cohort is held constant, changes in admissions

probabilities come only from changes in the policies of IRFs. Figure 3a shows a substantial

increase of 2.5 percentage points in the probability of IRF admission for hip fracture patients after

the PPS. Figures 3b and 3c show corresponding effects for joint and stroke patients. The results

for stroke patients are similar to those for hip fracture patients, showing a substantial increase in

the probability of admission to IRFs. Probability of IRF admission for joint replacement patients

are similar increases following the PPS, but not substantially relative to the pre-existing trend.

        Figures 4a and 4b simulate post-PPS (2003 q2) IRF payments for each quarterly cohort of

IRF hip fracture patients. Because the simulated payment and cost functions are held constant, the

values in these time series only change with shifts in observed patient composition. These results

show negligible changes in Medicare payments or provider costs stemming from changes in the

composition of IRF patients. Tables 2b and c, columns 2 and 4 show similarly small effects for

joint and stroke patients. Finally, Figure 4c simulates post-PPS admission policies (2003 quarter 2)

for each acute care discharge cohort. These results also suggest that, relative to pre-PPS trends,

there were not substantial changes in patient population discharged from acute care hospitals to

IRFs. Estimates in Column (6) in Tables 2b and 2c are qualitatively similar for joint and stroke

patients. Overall, we found little evidence to suggest that patient selection based on either the

observable characteristics of patients admitted to IRFs or the characteristics of patients discharged




                                                  19
from acute care hospitals influenced IRF costs or the probability of IRF use after the

implementation of the PPS.

       In summary, our results imply that average IRF payments (across all acute discharges)

increased after the IRF-PPS both due to more patients from expanded admissions policies and

from greater reimbursement per patient. Despite increases in average Medicare payments per IRF

patient, changes in treatment policy actually led to reduced resource use initially after the PPS,

possibly reflecting decreased marginal reimbursement. The average severity of patients seen in

IRFs changed little after the PPS, and played little role in changes in IRF payments or costs.

6.2. Costs in other post-acute settings and patient outcome

       Changes in admission and treatment policies in IRFs could in principle lead to changes in

costs in other post-acute settings because at least for some patients the various settings are

substitutes. For example, the increased admissions in IRFs could have diverted patients from

other post-acute settings, while the decreased resource use could increase readmissions. In

addition, changes in treatment patterns could affect health outcomes.

       Figure 5 shows predicted average costs in other post-acute settings for hip fracture patients

– including SNFs, LTCHs, and HHAs – both together and separately. Simulated average costs

across all acute discharges are computed by estimating admissions and treatment functions in each

quarter. First, we simulate admissions by applying each quarter's admission function to a fixed

cohort of patients discharged from acute care hospitals in the first quarter of 2001. Next, we

simulate resource use in each quarter by applying each quarter's cost function to a fixed cohort of

patients seen in other post-acute settings in the first quarter of 2001. These simulated admissions

and resource use measures are multiplied to provide simulated unconditional costs for each

quarter. In this calculation, the simulated unconditional costs only change with changes in




                                                  20
admissions and treatment policies of other PAC settings, because the patient samples are held

constant. In each case, the solid line represents predicted unconditional costs, and the dashed line

represents the counterfactual trend without the PPS (i.e. POST1-POST6 in equation 5 set to zero).

Results are presented in Figure 5 and Tables 3 and 4.

       Figure 5a shows that other post-acute costs initially increased slightly following the IRF-

PPS, and Figures 5b-d suggests that this was driven primarily by increased SNF costs. SNF costs

subsequently fell, possibly reflecting decreased average payments after the expiration of add-on

payments at the end of fiscal year 2002 (Medpac 2007). Similar SNF results are found for joint

replacement and stroke patients in Table 4; however, LTCH costs fell substantially for stroke

patients after the IRF-PPS, suggesting that some new IRF patients may have previously gone to

LTCHs.

       Finally, we also simulated the patient outcomes of dead or institutionalized at the end of a

90-day post-acute episode and acute readmission. We followed our previous method of simulating

outcomes by first estimating "predicted outcome" functions for each quarter in our sample as a

function of observable characteristics, and then using those estimated equations to simulate

outcomes for a fixed patient cohort (in this case acute discharges in the first quarter of 2001).

Results of this analysis are presented in Table 5. After the IRF-PPS, no appreciable or consistent

change was present in the fractions dead/institutionalized or readmitted, suggesting that changes in

treatment and admission policies had little effect on patient health.

6.3. Heterogeneous Effects by Average Reimbursement

       Finally, we examine how changes in admissions and treatment policies differ across

patients with varying changes in average reimbursement. Recall that our empirical framework

allows us to estimate heterogeneous treatment and admission policy effects because the treatment




                                                  21
and admission functions in each quarter are a function of patient characteristics. Similarly, our

empirical framework also allows for heterogeneous changes in Medicare reimbursement following

PPS because the payment functions for each quarter are also functions of patient characteristics.

Table 6 shows the results from regressing changes in simulated probability, conditional costs, and

unconditional costs on changes in simulated payments for the cohort of patients discharged from

acute care in the first quarter of 2002. These estimates show that patients with positive predicted

changes in payments were less likely to be admitted after the PPS. To the extent that more severe

patients received higher average reimbursement (an explicit goal of the PPS), this may reflect a

higher perceived financial riskiness of zero marginal reimbursement for such patients. In contrast,

a positive and strong relationship exists between changes in average payments and changes in

costs (resource use) in panels 2 and 3, signaling that decreases in resource use were smaller for

patients with larger increases in Medicare reimbursement to IRFs. For example, the results show

that a $1 increase in reimbursement to IRFs is associated with a 52 to 64 cent increase in resource

use conditional on admission to IRFs. The estimates for unconditional costs are smaller, of course,

because only a fraction of patients use IRFs.



6. Conclusion

       In this paper we investigated the impacts of the IRF-PPS. We developed a conceptual

framework showing that the PPS may affect facilities' admission criteria, as well as the intensity

with which IRFs treat patients. We then employ an empirical strategy that isolates changes in

resource use due to changes in treatment policy and patient selection, and decomposes changes in

admission probabilities into changes in admission policies and shifts in the composition of patients

discharged from acute care hospitals.




                                                 22
       We find that average Medicare IRF expenditures across all acute discharges for hip

fracture, lower extremity joint replacement, and stroke increased substantially after the IRF-PPS.

Increases were driven primarily by increased reimbursement for the types of patients already seen

in IRFs and through increased IRF admissions. Despite increased reimbursement, treatment

intensity in IRFs decreased after the PPS, implying providers responded to reduced marginal

reimbursement by reducing treatment. However, the composition of patients seen in IRFs changed

little over this period, reflecting a minimal amount of selection or "cream skimming" by providers

after the PPS. Average costs for other post-acute providers increased immediately after the PPS,

suggesting that additional rehabilitation occurred elsewhere after the PPS. However, we find little

impact of the PPS on patient health outcomes or acute readmissions.

       Policymakers continue to wrestle with the joint goals of containing Medicare expenditures

while improving quality of care and minimizing acute readmissions. Policy prescriptions range

from tweaking post-acute payment updates to proposals for a single "bundled" payment for a

combined acute + post-acute episode, possibly including physician cost. Our results show that

policies focusing on a single site of care are likely to have some effects on other post-acute

settings, supporting more comprehensive payment "bundling" type reforms. However, to the

extent that bundling represents a further decrease in marginal reimbursement for providers, our

results suggest that this may lead to decreased treatment intensity, even if paired with higher

average reimbursement. The decreased intensity that we observed, however, did not lead to

changes measures of outcome including death or institutionalization and readmission to the acute

care hospital.
