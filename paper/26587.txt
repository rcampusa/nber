                                       ABSTRACT

Will the Opportunity Zone program, America's largest new place-based policy in decades,
generate neighborhood change? We compare single-family housing price growth in Opportunity
Zones with price growth in areas that were eligible but not included in the program. We also
compare Opportunity Zones to their nearest geographic neighbors. All estimates rule out price
impacts greater than 1.3 percentage points with 95% confidence, suggesting that, so far, home
buyers don't believe that this subsidy will generate major neighborhood change. Opportunity
Zone status reduces prices in areas with little employment, perhaps because buyers think that
subsidizing new investment will increase housing supply.

1     Introduction
Opportunity Zones, established by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, arguably represent the U.S.
government's largest place-based policy innovation since Empowerment Zones were introduced in
1993. When capital gains are invested in Opportunity Zones, taxes on the original gains are deferred
and can be reduced; taxes on future gains from qualifying investments in Opportunity Zones are
largely eliminated. Will this significant tax-based subsidy lead to neighborhood improvements?
    We test this hypothesis by examining whether areas that are designated as Opportunity Zones
in mid-2018 subsequently experience an increase in residential real estate prices after 2017. If
Opportunity Zone designation is seen as a harbinger of future investment and upgrading, then
new buyers should presumably anticipate future neighborhood improvements and be willing to pay
more for homes. If Opportunity Zones are ineffective, or act primarily to generate more residential
supply, then Opportunity Zones will have little impact on price. It is too early to test the more
interesting and important question of whether Opportunity Zones impact people as well as place,
and whether they positively impact the lives of neighborhood residents.1 Moreover, we only have
price data available for 2018, and the Opportunity Zone tracts were designated by governors in the
first few months of 2018 and officially posted in July.2
    A non-academic study of housing prices, done by Zillow (Casey, 2019), found a positive effect
of Opportunity Zones on prices when comparing Opportunity Zone areas with areas that did not
receive zone status, but there are two reasons to be cautious about this work. First, Zillow's price
data reflects an opaque algorithm, rather than actual sales data. Second, the pre-2017 trends in
prices between their treatment and control samples do not appear to be parallel, although they
provide no tested pre-trends. Third, Casey (2019) results also do not control for changes in the
quality of houses sold, since they include all arms' length sales prices.
    We use Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) repeat sales-indices for single-family homes at
the Census tract and ZIP code level to measure price changes. We perform three different empirical
exercises. First, we follow the Zillow study (Casey, 2019) and compare Opportunity Zone areas with
areas that were initially eligible for Opportunity Zone status, but then not included as Opportunity
Zones, assuming and testing for parallel trends. Second, we use propensity-score weighting methods
to include observed characteristics nonparametrically in the difference-in-difference design, making
and testing a conditional parallel trends assumption. Third, we compare Opportunity Zone areas
with bordering areas. As many tracts have missing data, we perform the exercises at the ZIP code
level in addition to at the Census tract level as well.
    All exercises yield a similar result: Opportunity Zones appear to have a negligible price impact
that is statistically indistinct from zero. Our results are sufficiently precise that we can generally rule
   1
     Busso and Kline (2008) provide a thorough analysis of the economic impact of national employment zones, which
appear to have meaningfully impacts both housing prices and employment. Neumark and Kolko (2010) find fewer
positive effects of state level Enterprise Zones.
   2
     Consequently, only one-half of the year should be counted as treated by the program. We can do nothing to
extend the analysis temporally until more data is released, and we think that a reasonable interpretation is to double
the estimated coefficients to reflect the fact that only one-half of the year was fully treated by the policy.



                                                          1
out a price impact of 1.3 percentage points or more at the tract level with 95% confidence. Our point
estimates are typically between 0.3 and -0.5 percentage points. This finding suggests that buyers
do not believe that Opportunity Zone status will generate a significant change in the economic
fortunes of the neighborhood. Alternatively, buyers could be myopic, but that seems unlikely if
the zone status attracts professional investors. One possibility is that this null result reflects a
combination of a positive demand shock and positive housing supply shock, since Opportunity
Zone status might encourage more residential construction. To test this possibility, we compare
ZIP codes that are predominantly residential with ZIP codes that are predominantly commercial.
The positive impact of Opportunity Zones on housing supply should be stronger in non-commercial
areas, yet we find that Zone status has an essentially identical impact in commercial and residential
areas.
        We find that Opportunity Zone status is associated with price declines in highly residential
areas. In the treated ZIP codes with the lowest share of employment to residences, as the share
of households that lies within an opportunity zone increases from 0 to 100 percent, prices fall by
1.7 percentage points. In areas with more employment, the impact of Opportunity Zone status is
generally positive. The highest point estimate in regressions that include time-varying coefficients
on covariates is 1.1, meaning that varying from no Opportunity Zone households to 100 percent
Opportunity Zone households is associated with 1.1 percentage points higher housing prices at the
ZIP level.
        This work does not imply that Opportunity Zones were a mistake or that there are no benefits
from these zones. These tax subsidies may generate neighborhood change in the future that is not
anticipated by buyers today. The costs of these subsidies may end up being so small that they
are offset by even tiny price gains. Nonetheless, the absence of a visible price effect does suggest
the limits of place-based policies, especially those that focus on investment in physical rather than
human capital.
        This paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 discusses the institutional context, policy details,
and selection procedures for Opportunity Zones. Section 3 discusses the various data sources used
in our study. Section 4 introduces our three main empirical strategies. Section 5 discusses the
empirical results. Section 6 concludes.


2        Institutional Context
Opportunity Zones were created in December 22, 2017, when President Trump signed the Tax Cuts
and Jobs Act (Public Law 115-97, henceforth TCJA) into law. They are intended to spur economic
development in distressed communities. The law provides three benefits for investing capital gains
in one of 8,762 Census tracts3 (12% of all Census tracts) across the country through intermediaries
called Opportunity Funds: Tax on the initial capital gain is deferred until 2026 or when the asset
is sold. For capital gains placed in an Opportunity Fund for at least five years, investors' basis
    3
    Two additional tracts in Puerto Rico were added by subsequent legislation, bringing the total to 8,764. We do
not have housing data for Puerto Rico.


                                                       2
on the original investment increases by 10%; if invested for seven years, by 15%.4 For investments
in Opportunity Funds held for at least 10 years, the gains on the investments in the zones are
not subject to capital gains tax. Funds can be invested in commercial, residential and industrial
real estate; infrastructure, and businesses. For real estate projects to qualify, the investment must
result in the property being "substantially improved."
        The outlines of a proposal to create Opportunity Zones was published by the Economic Inno-
vation Group in April 2015.5 Bills to create them were first introduced in Congress in April 2016
and re-introduced in February 2017, but got little attention initially. As in the bill that eventually
became law, the proposals authorized governors to nominate as Opportunity Zones 25% of the "low
income communities" in their states; in states with fewer than 100 low income communities, the
governor could choose 25. The definition of low income communities was borrowed from a 2000
law that created the New Markets Tax Credit: Census tracts were designated as low income if the
poverty rate is at least 20%, or the median family income doesn't exceed 80% of the statewide
median for a tract outside the metropolitan area, or the median income doesn't exceed 80% of the
statewide median or the metro area statewide median for a tract inside a metropolitan area. Tracts
contiguous with low income communities also are eligible, provided their median family income
doesn't exceed 125% of the contiguous low income community.
        The Opportunity Zone provision was not included in the House version of the TCJA, which
was introduced on Nov. 2, 2017. With very little public attention, Sen. Tim Scott (R, S.C.), a
member of the Senate Finance Committee, successfully pushed to include the Opportunity Zone
provision in the TCJA, which was introduced on Nov. 28, 2017. The first reference in the press
to the Opportunity Zone provision in the TCJA came on November 28, 2017, in South Carolina's
Post and Courier, according to the Factiva database.6
        Governors had 90 days after the passage of the law--until March 21, 2018 unless they sought
a 30-day extension--to nominate zones from a list of 31,866 eligible Census tracts prepared by the
Treasury based on 2010-2015 American Community Survey data. The Treasury posted a list of all
qualified Opportunity Zones on July 9, 2018. Of the 8,762 Opportunity Zones, 8,534 are low income
communities and 230 are contiguous Census tracts. A map of the zones in the U.S. mainland is
shown in Figure 1.


3        Data
Our measure of housing price growth is the annual change in the housing price index computed
by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). The housing price index is a weighted, repeat-
sales price index of the movement of single-family house prices. Like all repeated-sales indices, it

step-up in basis is for investments by Dec. 31, 2019.

attempts to correct for quality changes. We use the annual house price indices by Census tract and
by five-digit ZIP codes,7 and treat 2018 as the treated year.
        Information about the Opportunity Zones is provided by the Urban Institute.8 The data in-
cludes whether a tract belongs to the 31,866 eligible tracts and to the selected 8,762 tracts and
whether a tract is eligible for selection as a low income community or as contiguous Census tracts,
which we use in our first and second empirical designs in Section 4. Characteristics of the Census
tracts are from the American Community Survey (ACS) 2013­2017 5-year estimates.
        Geographical comparison between tracts and their non-selected geographical neighbors uses the
TIGER 2018 geographic shapefiles provided by the Census.9 Aggregating tract-level data to ZIP-
level data, implemented in Section 4.4, uses the geographical crosswalks between 5-digit USPS ZIP
codes and Census tracts are provided by the Office of Policy Development and Research at the
Department of Housing and Urban Development, where we use the data for the first quarter of
2017.10 Lastly, splitting ZIP codes by employment population in Table 2 uses population data at
the ZCTA level in the 2012­2016 ACS 5-year estimates and employment data from the ZIP code
level County Business Patterns in 2016.11


4        Empirical Strategy
We use three main empirical strategies. First, following Casey (2019), we compare Opportunity
Zones to Census tracts that are eligible for Opportunity Zones but are not selected.12 In this case, we
use a difference-in-differences design that optionally incorporates observable tract-level covariates
interacted with year fixed effects. We supplement the analysis in Casey (2019) with formal tests
of pre-treatment trends. Second, we refine our analysis in the first design with semiparametric
propensity score weighting methods in a difference-in-differences setting (Abadie, 2005; Callaway
and Sant'Anna, 2018; Sant'Anna and Zhao, 2018). Third, we compare Opportunity Zones with
their geographical neighbors that are not selected.
        The FHFA tract-level data covers only about half of the selected Census tracts. Concerned
with the data attrition, we also aggregate tract-level data to the ZIP code level, and uses FHFA
data at the ZIP code level, which has better coverage.13 Lastly, we split the ZIP-code level data
into quartiles by employment population so as to decompose the potential effects of Opportunity
Zones on supply and demand, noting that the positive supply effect has larger impact in residential

  12
     In the results presented in the main text, we compare selected tracts to tracts that are eligible but not selected
conditional on the eligibility criterion being low-income community, as tracts that are eligible for contiguity reasons
are overrepresented in the non-selected group. Qualitative conclusions do not change if we remove this condition
(Appendix C).
  13
     Although only 16, 007 of the total 39, 300 ZIP codes with crosswalk data do not have missing data in 2018, these
ZIP codes intersect with 6, 854 selected Opportunity Zones.

T . For each Census tract i, we observe annualized housing price growth Yit
Dit =     1(t = T )Di along with a vector of covariates Xi . The potential outcomes are Yit (1) and
               obs = D Y (1) + (1 - D )Y (0). We are interested in the estimand

                                        = E [YiT (1) - YiT (0) | Di = 1] ,                                               (1)

which is the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT). Assume we have a balanced panel
where Zi = (Yi , Xi , Di ) are independently and identically distributed.

4.1      Baseline difference-in-differences (Casey, 2019)
In the first design, we compare tracts that are selected as Opportunity Zones to tracts that are
eligible but not selected. The parallel trends assumption allows us to identify the treatment effect
in a difference-in-differences design. As we see in Figure 3, parallel trends is a more plausible
assumption when comparing selected tracts to eligible but not selected tracts than when comparing
selected tracts to all other tracts.
       Our first estimation strategy specifies a model where we allow for individual-specific het-
erogeneity in levels and overall trends (Angrist and Pischke, 2008) via two-way fixed effects:
Yit (0) = µi + t +     0    and Yit (1) = µi + t +  +         1    with E[   0    | Di ] = E[   1    | Di ] = 0.14 The usual
                       it                                     it             it                 it
parallel trends assumption is implied by the model, since E[Yit (0) - Yi,t-1 (0) | Di = d] = t - t-1 ,
which does not depend on treatment status d. Thus  is consistently estimated by  in the OLS
regression
                                     obs
                                   Yit   = µi + t +  1(t = T, Di = 1) +                it                                (2)

Column (1) in the top panel of Table 1 implements this design, clustering standard errors at the
tract level.15 We also adapt the two-way fixed effect model (2) by including covariates, replacing
t with it = Xi t for a vector of covariates Xi . This specification assumes conditional parallel
trends, as E[Yit (0) - Yi,t-1 (0) | Xi = x, Di = d] = x (t - t-1 ), is free of the treatment status d.
Column (2) in the top panel of Table 1 implements this design, where the test against pre-trends
is defined analogously.

4.2      Propensity-score-weighted difference-in-differences
Identification using the selection of Opportunity Zones from eligible Census tracts faces the chal-
lenge that, selected tracts and tracts that are eligible but not selected differ in observable char-
  14
      The model assumes constant treatment effects. When treatment effects are heterogeneous, the two-way fixed
effect estimator is consistent for a weighted average of individual treatment effects.
   15
      We can test against the identification assumption by testing aginst against the hypothesis t = 0 for all t < T in
the regression
                                                 obs
                                               Yit   = µi + t + t Di + it .
The coefficients t are plotted in an event-study plot in Figure 3.


                                                          5
acteristics. Unbalanced characteristics suggests that parallel trends may not hold.16 We alleviate
these concerns by incorporating observed covariates in a nonparametric fashion, in our second
empirical strategy. We use an adaptation of propensity score weighting estimator introduced by
Abadie (2005). In Abadie (2005), the probability of treatment is nonparametrically estimated as a
function of the covariates; the estimated propensity scores are then used to form an inverse propen-
sity weighting estimator of the ATT. Recent work by Callaway and Sant'Anna (2018) extends this
approach to settings with multiple periods, multiple treatment groups, and multiple treatment
timings.17 We apply the Callaway and Sant'Anna (2018) approach in Column (3) of the top panel
of Table 1. Sant'Anna and Zhao (2018) extend Abadie (2005)'s two-period, two-group model and
introduces a doubly-robust version of the semiparametric estimator in Abadie (2005). The ATT
estimator is consistent if either the propensity score model or the outcome regression model is cor-
rectly specified. Column (4) in the top panel of Table 1 implements this approach with a balanced
panel from 2017­2018.

4.3    Comparison of geographical neighbors
Our third empirical strategy uses geographic proximity to construct a paired sample of tracts. For
each selected tract i, we construct its non-selected neighbor ~
                                                              i to be the tract that is (i) not selected
as an Opportunity Zone, (ii) closest to i by distance between centroids, (iii) in the same state as
i, and (iv) has no missing housing price data in 2018.18 Within each pair  = (i, ~    i), we specify
Yit (0) =  + t +       t ,   Y~
                              it (0) = ~ + t + ~t such that Yit (0) - Y~
                                                                       it (0) = ( - ~ ) + (          t - ~t ),   leading
to the estimation procedure

                                    obs
                                  Yit   - Y~obs
                                           it
                                                =  1(t = T, Di = 1) + µ + t ,                                        (3)

which is consistent assuming E[t | Di ] = 0. The identification assumption in the third strategy
is the pair, i, ~
                i has the same trend t , which is differenced away as we construct the estimator.
We implement this approach in Column (5) in the top panel of Table 1, where an additional linear
trend is included in Column (6). We also plot the mean paired differences in Figure 3, normalizing
the difference in 2017 to zero.
   16
      We do find substantial imbalance in covariate values in Tables 4 and 5 in the Appendix. Technically, the
identification assumption, (conditional) parallel trends, does not require covariate balance, since trends are only
required to be parallel and may differ in levels.
   17
      In our design, we only have multiple pre-periods. There is a recent literature on the failure of the two-way fixed
effect estimator (2) in situations with variable treatment timing and heterogeneous treatment effects, as the estimator
becomes a weighted average of individual treatment effects with non-convex weights in large samples (Abraham and
Sun, 2018; Athey and Imbens, 2018; Callaway and Sant'Anna, 2018; Goodman-Bacon, 2018; Imai and Kim, 2016;
Borusyak and Jaravel, 2017; De Chaisemartin and D'Haultfoeuille, 2017). The issue is not as pertinent in our setting
as we do not have variable treatment timing.
   18
      The distance between centroids is calculated using the Haversine formula, assuming the Earth is a sphere with
radius 6,371 kilometers. The average centroid distance between pairs is 2.718 (5.724) kilometers.

4.4        Aggregating to ZIP codes
The FHFA tract-level data only covers half of all treated Opportunity Zones. Moreover, the sample
suffers from further attrition due to panel balance and missing Census covariates. To address
the data availability concern, we include an alternative design by aggregating tracts to the ZIP
code level. Mimicking our tract-level analysis, we drop ZIP codes that do not intersect with
any Census tracts that are eligible to be selected as Opportunity Zones.19 Each ZIP code z is
                                     z proportion of total addresses within tract i. We choose this
partitioned into tracts i  Iz , with i
aggregation method because crosswalks are readily provided by the Department of Housing and
Urban Development and addresses are the most relevant measure for residential housing prices. For

has a continuous distribution on [0, 1].
         We report estimates after aggregation to the ZIP level in the bottom panel of Table 1. The
strategy in (2) extends to this setting, which is implemented in Columns (1) and (2) of the bottom
panel of Table 1. We discretize Dz for weighting based estimator in Sant'Anna and Zhao (2018), by
taking D~ z = 1(Dz  q ) where q is chosen such that the sample mean of D  ~ z equals the proportion
of treated tracts among all tracts. The Sant'Anna and Zhao (2018) estimator is implemented in
Column (3) in the bottom panel of Table 1.
         As a refinement of the ZIP-code level analysis, we use data from County Business Patterns
and split our sample on quartiles of the ratio between population employed in the ZIP code to
population residing in the ZIP code,20 and perform the analysis of Columns (1) and (2) in Table 1
separately for each quartile.21 The results are presented in Table 2 and discussed in Section 5.1.


5         Results
The top panel of Table 1 provides tract-level results, corresponding to empirical strategies in Sec-
tions 4.1 and 4.3. The bottom panel shows ZIP code level results corresponding to Section 4.4. As
discussed above, the key independent variable in the tract level regressions is an indicator variable
that takes on a value of one if the tract is designated an Opportunity Zone. In the ZIP code level
regression, the key independent variable is the share of the addresses within each ZIP code that lie
within an Opportunity Zone.
         The first two regressions in Table 1 show results where the treated tracts are compared with
tracts that were eligible for inclusion within Opportunity Zones, but were ultimately not included in
the Zones. These results include time and tract fixed effects, and the estimated coefficient is 0.248,
meaning that prices rose by about one-fourth of a percentage point in tracts that were included in
Opportunity Zones in 2018. This coefficient is small in magnitude, statistically insignificant and
precisely enough estimated so that we can rule out an effect of more than 0.7 percentage points.
    19
       Our empirical results are not sensitive to this choice.
    20
       This ratio can exceed 1 if the ZIP code is more commercial than residential.
    21
       The quartile thresholds are 0.134, 0.244, 0.409 in the employment to population ratio.

       In the second column, we show results allowing for interactions between tract-level character-
istics and year, so that we estimate coefficients on tract income and other characteristics for each
year. The tract level covariates do not change over time. With these added controls, the coefficient
falls to 0.151. Again, the coefficient is small and insignificant. In this case, we can rule out effects
of greater than 0.6 percentage points with 95% confidence.
       Figure 2 shows the tract level housing price indices visually. The top two lines show annual
growth rates from 2014 to 2018 for the treatment and control samples that are evaluated in the first
two columns of Table 1. Both of these lines are quite distinct from the third line, which contains
all of the tracts in the U.S. that were never eligible for Opportunity Zone status. The top two lines
lie essentially on top of one another. Pre-trends appear to be quite similar for the two top groups
and quite different from the third group, which supports the finding of the pre-trends test reported
in Table 1. There is also no visual change after the law is enacted in 2018. Both before and after
the law is enacted, price growth in the two groups appears to be almost exactly the same.
       The bottom panel of Table 1 shows results for the ZIP code analysis. In this case, the estimated
coefficient represents the impact of moving from having no Opportunity Zone tracts within the ZIP
code to having 100 percent Opportunity Zone tracts within the ZIP code.22 If the benefits of
Opportunity Zone status spill over to neighboring tracts, then we would expect this coefficient to
be larger than the coefficient in the tract-level analysis. The coefficient in the first column is indeed
relatively large in the entire table, and it suggests that as the share of households that live in
Opportunity Zone tracts increase from zero to one, prices increased by 0.48 percentage points. As
the standard errors suggest that the true coefficient could be as high as 1.2, this coefficient might
be economically meaningful.
       Yet there are two reasons to be cautious. First, the pre-trend test p-value suggests that the
parallel trends assumption may be violated. ZIP codes with a higher share of addresses residing in
Opportunity Zones seem to diverging from ZIP codes with a lower share of such households prior
to 2018. Moreover, when we allow for time varying effects of other tract level characteristics in the
second column, the coefficient becomes negative. That second coefficient is estimated with enough
precision to rule out a coefficient greater than 0.6 at conventional confidence levels. We interpret
these results to suggest that the ZIP code level analysis also rules out large positive price impacts
of Opportunity Zone status in 2018.
       In the third column, we show the tract-level analyses using the Callaway and Sant'Anna (2018)
propensity score weighting method. The coefficient estimate is 0.25, and the upper bound on the
confidence interval is 0.89. The fourth regression shows the doubly-robust coefficient estimate that
follows Sant'Anna and Zhao (2018). This coefficient is even smaller. The point estimate is .08
and the upper bound estimate is 0.73. The Callaway and Sant'Anna (2018) procedure tests for
pre-trends, and we do not reject the null hypothesis that there is no pre-trend; the doubly-robust
procedure (Sant'Anna and Zhao, 2018) follows a two-period model, and does not provide a pre-
  22
    The average ZIP code has 13.3% of its addresses in a selected Opportunity Zone; the median ZIP code has 0.0%;
and the 75th percentile has 19.7%.

trend test. In both cases, the results imply that Opportunity Zone status increased prices by less
than one percentage point in 2018 related to previous years.
   In regressions (5) and (6), we match Opportunity Zone Census tracts with the nearest Census
tract that is not in an Opportunity Zone. In some cases, the Opportunity Zone tracts are matched
with the same non-Opportunity Zone tract. In regression (5), we find a coefficient of 0.74, which
is statistically significant at conventional levels, but the result is not robust to inclusion of a linear
time trend in regression (6). The coefficient falls to 0.534 and the 95%-confidence interval rules out
a coefficient greater than 1.3.
   Figure 3 shows year-by-year results that correspond to regressions (1), (2) and (5). The first
two sets of coefficients show no pre-trend, but only a small and statistically insignificant increase
in price in 2018. The third set of coefficients shows a statistically significant price increase in 2018,
but also suggestions of violation of parallel trends in 2014. Our interpretation of these results is
that Opportunity Zone tracts did experience a modest increase in price in 2018 relative to the
nearest geographic neighbors, but that this could easily be a reflection of a pre-existing trend that
started before that year.
   Taken together, these results suggest that if Opportunity Zone status did generate a positive
impact, that impact was quite small. There seems to be little possibility that home buyers antic-
ipated that inclusion in an Opportunity Zone would have a dramatic impact on the character of
the neighborhood. This fact does not imply that the Opportunity Zone program was a mistake,
but rather that it is anticipated to have little effect on the neighborhood.

5.1   Heterogeneous Impacts of Opportunity Zone Designation
Opportunity Zone status confers subsidies to physical investment in a neighborhood. Such subsidies
might have a different impact on housing prices if they largely work by subsidizing commercial space
or if they largely work by subsidizing residential space. If a capital subsidy increases the presence
of job-generating commercial properties, then standard urban theory predicts that the subsidy will
increase residential prices. If the subsidy increases investment in residential properties, then the
impact on housing prices could be negative.
   Consider a subsidy that decreases the costs of adding residential density, but assume that
existing homes must be bought to provide the land needed to build. If the new building generates
supply but not externalities, then this should decrease the value of housing units. The value of lower
density homes, which make up the bulk of the FHFA repeat sales properties, could still increase
because they are providing land for future investment. If the new investment generates positive
externalities, then there could be a positive price impact even if supply increases.
   We test the hypothesis that Opportunity Zone status may actually decrease prices by boosting
residential supply by splitting ZIP codes into quartiles based on the level of employment to pop-
ulation before 2017. We use County Business Pattern data on employment levels, and we do not
have this data below the ZIP Code level. Our core assumption is that Opportunity Zone status
will act primarily as a subsidy to commercial properties in the quartiles that initially have the


                                                    9
highest levels of employment to population and that Zone status will act primarily as a subsidy to
residential properties in the lowest quartile, where employment to population begins at a low level.
    We test for this heterogeneity in Table 2. As in the first two regressions in Table 1, the first
column includes no covariates. The second columns include fixed covariates that are allowed to
have a different coefficient in each year. Our primary interest lies in the top panel, which includes
those ZIP codes with the lowest employment to population ratios and consequently the areas in
which the subsidy is likely to primarily produce more residential housing supply.
    The first columns shows a coefficient of -1.1. Controlling for covariates pushes the coefficient
to -1.7, which rejects zero at the p = 0.1 level with values like -3.7 lying within the confidence
bounds. These results suggest that Opportunity Zone status may well have meaningfully reduced
housing prices in largely residential areas, presumably because home buyers anticipated that the
capital subsidy would lead to a larger supply of new homes in the future.
    The bottom three panels show a hodge-podge of coefficients. The second column of results, with
covariate-time interactions, show a result that is close to zero for the second quartile, a positive
coefficient that is over one for the third quartile and a negative coefficient that is close to minus one
for the fourth quartile. None of the second column results are statistically significant at conventional
rejection levels. We interpret these results as implying that we are unable to meaningfully estimate
treatment heterogeneity outside the areas with the lowest levels of employment.
    The results in Table 2 do, however, support the view that capital subsidies that reduce the cost
of building homes reduce the price of homes in largely residential areas. Once again, these results
do not imply that the Opportunity Zone program was a mistake. Lower housing prices in these
areas may be a social good. Yet there is little evidence to support the view that Opportunity Zone
status generated the expectation, at least among home buyers, that these areas would transition
from poverty to prosperity.


6    Conclusion
Opportunity Zones are America's most important new national spatial policy since the Empower-
ment Zone program began during the Clinton era. They are intended to spur investment in high
poverty areas. The hope of this program is that it would generate neighborhood revival, yet we
find little evidence to support this view at this early date. Housing prices may have gone up in
Opportunity Zone areas after their enactment in 2018, but if they did the overall price impact
seems to have been less than one percentage point. In highly residential areas, Opportunity Zone
status seems to have more meaningfully reduced residential home prices, presumably because Zone
status generated a subsidy for building new homes.
    The designation of the Opportunity Zone tracts was only made public in the summer of 2018.
Consequently, our results reflect a mixture of treated and non-treated months, and an observer
could reasonably double our estimated coefficients to form a posterior belief of the treatment effect
of opportunity zone status. Moreover, the early nature of these results should make us cautious


                                                   10
about any interpretation. We are at an early point and home price effects can, at best, capture
the expectations about neighborhood change held by current home buyers. These buyers could
be wrong: In the future Opportunity Zone status could end up correlated with neighborhood
upgrading. Moreover, we have not evaluated the cost of the Opportunity Zone program, and
so we can say nothing about overall program evaluation. Still, these early results do make us
wonder whether America's troubled areas most need capital subsidies, or whether instead they
need investments in human capital and neighborhood amenities.

A     Covariates, summary statistics, and balance
Variable definitions for covariates and simple calculations, along with their associated code used
in the Census API, are shown in Table 3. Summary statistics and covariate balance are shown in
Tables 4 and 5. We see that compare to the control group, the selected OZs are less populated,
less employed, less likely to attain higher education, have more rental units, and are less wealthy.
Similar trends persist when compared to their non-selected geographical neighbors in Table 5.
While the covariate non-balance threatens identification by making the (conditional) parallel trends
assumption less plausible, it does not reject parallel trends either. Since identification requires only
trends to be parallel and allows for level differences, it also allows for level differences in observed
or unobserved characteristics, so long as the trends are the same (conditionally).


B     Simple parametric design
We also include a simple parametric design by regression the time-difference of housing price growth
(2018 minus 2017) on treatment status and on covariates. We present the results in Table 6. The
estimated treatment effects are similar to those in the main text.


C     Including all Opportunity Zones
In the main text, we compare treated zones to control zones that are strictly low-income. We
remove this restriction in this section. We regenerate Figures 2 and 3 with Figure 4, Table 1 with
Table 7, and Table 2 with Table 8. The modification does not change our qualitative results.

      Covariates include log median household income, total housing units, percent white, percent with post-secondary education, percent rental units, percent covered
      by health insurance among native-born individuals, percent below poverty line, percent receiving supplemental income, and percent employed. For Column (2),
      only including log median household income and percent white as covariates gives 0.033 (0.211) for the top panel and -0.279 (0.419) for the bottom panel.
      Pretest for Column (2) interacts covariates with time dummies. Discrete treatment in Column (4) is defined as the highest 88.3% of treated tract coverage, so as
      to keep the percentage of treated ZIPs the same as treated tracts.
