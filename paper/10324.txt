The Illusion of Sustainability

                                            ABSTRACT

The history of foreign development assistance is one of movement away from addressing immediate

needs and toward focusing on the underlying causes of poverty. A recent manifestation is the move

towards "sustainability," which stresses community mobilization, education, and cost-recovery. This

stands in contrast to the traditional economic analysis of development projects, with its focus on

providing public goods and correcting externalities. We examine evidence from randomized

evaluations on strategies for combating intestinal worms, which affect one in four people worldwide.

Providing medicine to treat worms was extremely cost effective, although medicine must be

provided twice per year indefinitely to keep children worm-free. An effort to promote sustainability

by educating Kenyan schoolchildren on worm prevention was ineffective, and a "mobilization"

intervention from psychology failed to boost deworming drug take-up. Take-up was highly sensitive

to drug cost: a small increase in cost led to an 80 percent reduction in take-up (relative to free

treatment). The results suggest that, in the context we examine, the pursuit of sustainability may be

an illusion, and that in the short-run, at least, external subsidies will remain necessary.

                                               I. Introduction

The history of overseas development assistance can be viewed as a series of attempts to identify and

address ever more fundamental causes of global poverty. Oxfam, for example, founded in 1942 as the

Oxford Committee for Famine Relief, later shifted to “support for self-help schemes whereby

communities improved their own water supplies, farming practices, and health provision”1. In the 1950's

and 1960's, it was widely argued that long-run economic performance depended on capital investment,

and raising savings through a “big push” [Rosenstein-Rodin, 1943] would launch countries into self-

sustaining growth or “take-off” [Rostow, 1960]. Accordingly, the World Bank largely funded

infrastructure like dams and roads. By the 1980’s international financial institution policymakers decided

that capital accumulation and technological progress depended not so much on investment and careful

engineering, but rather on a better economic policy environment [Williamson, 1990; World Bank, 1993a].

Development assistance was extended conditionally to encourage countries to adopt economic policies

associated with this “Washington Consensus” view, characterized by reduced tariffs, appropriate foreign

exchange rates and low inflation. By the 1990’s, this approach also became seen as inadequate by many.

According to a new consensus, these policies would have only limited impact in the absence of more

fundamental institutional reforms [World Bank, 1998].

        Part of this new consensus in overseas development assistance involved reforms to national level

institutions, but given widespread central government failures in delivering public goods, another strand

emphasized encouraging local communities to sustainably provide their own public goods. Whereas

orthodox public finance analysis suggests that governments or donors should indefinitely fund activities

that generate positive externalities, advocates of sustainability emphasize the importance of local project

“ownership”, and promote public goods projects that only require start-up funding and can then continue

without external support. These efforts typically rely on voluntary activities by community members

rather than on the granting of coercive fundraising powers to local governments.

        The idea that development projects should aim at financial sustainability through voluntary local

action has had tremendous influence in development thinking, in areas from microfinance to the


                                                                                                              1
environment.2 In public health and water supply, sustainability advocates concentrate on cost-recovery

from beneficiaries, community mobilization, and health education rather than simply building wells or

subsidizing medical treatments that generate externalities. The idea of replacing dependency on aid with a

one-time investment that leads to long-run sustainability is certainly ideologically attractive.

        Yet anecdotal evidence suggests that financial sustainability has often been an illusion, and

sometimes a costly one. Morduch [1999] argues that the pursuit of sustainability by microfinance

organizations has led them to move away from serving the poor. Meuwissen [2002] argues that a health

cost-recovery program in Niger led to unexpectedly large drops in health care utilization, and that the

local health committees set up by the program failed in most of their responsibilities. In a large water

project in the Kenyan area we study, 43% of borehole wells were useless ten years after the shift from

external donor support for water-well maintenance to the training of local maintenance committees

[Miguel and Gugerty, 2005].

        While it is certainly true that in some cases communities have developed institutions that lead

individuals to contribute to local public goods [Ostrom, 1990], it is less clear that external interventions,

such as training sessions or the formation of user committees by donors, reliably lead to sustainable

voluntary provision of local public goods. It is difficult for outsiders to understand how other societies’

institutions and politics function, let alone how to influence them in a way that creates the correct

incentives and does not generate unforeseen negative consequences.

     In this paper we seek to shed light on these issues using evidence from a randomized evaluation of a

deworming program in Kenya. Intestinal worms infect one in four people worldwide. They can be fought

in several different ways. One approach emphasizes periodic medical treatment with low-cost drugs.

Public provision of deworming medicine can likely be justified on standard public finance grounds since

an estimated three quarters of the social benefit of treatment comes through reducing disease transmission

[Miguel and Kremer, 2004]. However, some argue that too much emphasis has been placed on just

handing out deworming drugs. Since people soon become reinfected, deworming drug treatment must be

continued twice per year indefinitely. In a Lancet article entitled “Sustainable Schistosomiasis Control –


                                                                                                                2
The Way Forward,” Utzinger et al. [2003] argue that rather than focusing narrowly on drugs, a broader

approach with greater emphasis on health education would be more sustainable. Other potential ways to

make anti-worm programs sustainable include requiring cost-sharing payments from those taking the

drugs, promoting the diffusion of worm prevention information and behaviors through social networks,

and encouraging local ownership of deworming programs.

        In this study we find that, first, the introduction of a small fee for deworming drugs (“cost-

sharing”) led to an 80% reduction in treatment rates, consistent with the hypothesis that people have low

private valuation for deworming. Take-up dropped sharply when going from a zero price to a positive

price but was not sensitive to the exact (positive) price level, suggesting that it may be particularly

counter-productive to charge small positive prices for the treatment of infectious diseases. Second, an

intensive school health education intervention had no impact on worm prevention behaviors. Third, a

verbal commitment “mobilization” intervention – in which people were asked in advance whether they

planned to take deworming drugs, exploiting a finding from social psychology that individuals strive for

consistency in their statements and actions – had no impact on adoption.

        We also examine peer effects in adoption, since if imitation effects in technology adoption are

sufficiently strong, then a sufficiently large temporary investment to introduce deworming drugs could

move society from a low-adoption to a high-adoption equilibrium. A number of recent papers, including

Foster and Rosenzweig [1995], Conley and Udry [2000], Burke et al. [2003], and Munshi [2004] find

evidence for peer effects in technology adoption using nonexperimental data. Like Like Duflo and Saez

[2003], we exploit experimental variation in exposure to a new technology to address the well-known

econometric challenges in estimating peer effects [Manski, 1993]. We develop a theoretical framework

that allows for peer effects from pure imitation, social learning about how to use technologies optimally,

social learning about the benefits of new technologies, and epidemiological externalities. This model

suggests that as long as a small fraction of the population receives subsidies sufficient to induce their

adoption, further subsidies will affect steady state take-up only in the presence of imitation effects. We

collect data on the network structure of links between school communities and use this to empirically


                                                                                                             3
estimate the impact on adoption decisions not only of individuals’ direct social links, but also of higher-

order social links. Rather than imposing a preexisting definition of social links, based for example on

geography [Foster and Rosenzweig, 1995; Burke et al., 2003], we allow survey respondents to specify

their social links themselves and estimate the impact of learning through different types of links. We then

simulate the impact of alternative ways of seeding the new technology given the observed network

structure of links across schools in our sample.

        We find that additional social links to early treatment schools reduce the probability that children

take deworming drugs, and increase the probability that parents say that deworming drugs are “not

effective”. This negative take-up result holds both for direct social links and for indirect second order

connections. We find evidence that Granovetter’s [1973] “weak ties” are important, with individuals

learning both from “close” and “distant” contacts, as measured by the frequency with which they

communicate. There is also some evidence for learning through child networks, in addition to the parent

networks that form the core of the analysis. In contrast, analysis of our data using nonexperimental

methods would imply that individuals are more likely to take the drugs if they have greater social contact

with others who have recently been exposed to deworming, suggesting substantial omitted variable bias in

the nonexperimental estimates.

        The lower take-up among those with more knowledge may be due to the high proportion of

deworming benefits flowing not to the treated child or her family, but to others in the local community

through externalities. People may only have realized how much of the benefits were external as they

gained experience with the program. Negative social effects on take-up are especially large empirically

for families with more schooling, a group who start out with particularly favorable beliefs about the

technology but then rapidly revise their beliefs downwards as they acquire more information.

     Our results are consistent with peer effects due to learning from others about the benefits of the

technology, and suggest that at least in this context, peer effects due to imitation, or due to learning about

how to use the technology, are small. In this context, a policymaker uncertain about the benefits of a new




                                                                                                              4
technology might want to subsidize a small number of people to adopt in hopes of spurring a shift to a

new equilibrium, but temporary subsidies beyond this level would not affect steady-state adoption.

        Overall, the empirical results on cost-sharing, health education, and social learning, are all

consistent with the hypothesis that people put limited private value on deworming. Miguel and Kremer

[2004], however, suggest the social value is large. Together these results suggest that large ongoing

external subsidies may be necessary to sustain high take-up. These results may generalize to other

infectious and parasitic diseases characterized by large positive treatment externalities. More generally, it

is probably an illusion to think that a one-time infusion of external assistance will lead to the indefinitely

sustainable voluntary provision of most local public goods. There may simply be no alternative to

ongoing subsidies financed by tax revenue raised either from local or national governments, or

international donors.3

        The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section II provides information on worm

infections and the project we study. In Section III we present a simple theoretical framework for

understanding the determinants of deworming take-up. Section IV describes the empirical take-up

impacts of direct and higher-order social links. Sections V, VI, and VII describe the cost-sharing, health

education, and verbal commitment results, respectively. The final section discusses broader implications

for public finance and development assistance in less developed countries. Readers interested primarily in

social learning may wish to focus on sections III and IV while those interested in development policy

issues could focus mainly on sections V through VIII.



                                 II. The Primary School Deworming Project

Over 1.3 billion people worldwide are infected with hookworm, 1.3 billion with roundworm, 900 million

with whipworm, and 200 million with schistosomiasis [Bundy 1994]. Most have light infections, which

are often asymptomatic, but more severe worm infections can lead to iron-deficiency anemia, protein

energy malnutrition, stunting, wasting, listlessness, and abdominal pain. Heavy schistosomiasis infections

can have even more severe consequences.4


                                                                                                                 5
        Helminths do not reproduce within the human host, so high worm burdens are the result of

frequent reinfection. The geohelminths (hookworm, roundworm, and whipworm) are transmitted through

ingestion of, or contact with, infected fecal matter. This can occur, for example, if children defecate in the

fields near their home or school, areas where they also play. Schistosomiasis is acquired through contact

with infected freshwater. For example, in our Kenyan study area people often walk to nearby Lake

Victoria to bathe and fish. Medical treatment for helminth infections creates externality benefits by

reducing worm deposition in the community and thus limiting reinfection among other community

members [Anderson and May, 1991]. The geohelminths and schistosomiasis can be treated using the

low-cost single-dose oral therapies of albendazole and praziquantel, respectively. The drugs sometimes

cause unpleasant and salient, but medically minor, side effects including stomach ache, diarrhea, fever

and occasionally vomiting [WHO, 1992], but these effects rarely last more than one day. Side effects are

more severe for heavier schistosomiasis infections, but can be mitigated by not consuming the drugs on

an empty stomach. Private benefits of deworming may not always be particularly salient to individuals

since they typically occur gradually as individual nutritional status improves in the months following

treatment.

        Miguel and Kremer [2004] found that deworming treatment can generate large externality

benefits by interfering with disease transmission. Providing treatment to Kenyan school children led to

large reductions in worm infections and increased school participation among both treated and untreated

children in the treatment schools, and among children in neighboring schools. Three quarters of the social

benefit of treatment was in the form of externalities. Since deworming costs only $3.50 per extra year of

school participation generated, it is likely one of the most cost-effective ways to boost participation.

        Both this paper and Miguel and Kremer [2004] study the Primary School Deworming Project

(PSDP), a school health program carried out by a Dutch non-governmental organization (NGO), ICS

Africa, in cooperation with the Kenyan Ministry of Health. The project took place in Busia district, a poor

and densely-settled farming region in western Kenya, and the 75 project schools include nearly all rural

primary schools in the area, with over 30,000 enrolled pupils between the ages of six and 18, over 90% of


                                                                                                             6
whom suffer from intestinal worm infections. In January 1998, the schools were randomly divided into

three groups (Group 1, Group 2, and Group 3) of twenty-five schools each: the schools were first divided

by administrative sub-unit (zone) and by involvement in other non-governmental assistance programs,

and were then listed alphabetically and every third school assigned to a given project group.

        The intervention included both health education on worm prevention behaviors and the provision

of deworming medicine. Due to administrative and financial constraints the program was phased in over

several years. Group 1 schools received assistance in 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001, and Group 2 schools in

1999, 2000 and 2001, while Group 3 began receiving assistance in 2001. This design implies that in 1998

Group 1 schools were treatment schools, while Group 2 and Group 3 schools were the comparison

schools; and in 1999 and 2000 Group 1 and Group 2 schools were the treatment schools and Group 3

schools were comparison schools. At each school, the project started out with a community meeting of

parents and teachers organized by the NGO, which included a discussion of worm infections, the nature

of medical deworming treatment, and worm prevention measures. All primary school communities in the

baseline sample agreed to participate in the project. Starting in 1999, the Ministry of Health required

signed individual parental consent, while in 1998 only community consent had been required, with

individuals having the ability to opt out of the program if they wished. This change in 1999 may have

reduced take-up in some cases if parents were reluctant to visit the school headmaster, particularly if they

were late on other school fee payments.

        Health education efforts focused on preventing worms through hand washing, wearing shoes, and

avoiding infected fresh water. This included classroom lectures and culturally appropriate Swahili

language health education materials. This health education effort was considerably more intensive than is

typical in Kenyan primary schools, and thus the program may be more likely than existing government

programs to impact child behavior. Two teachers in each school attended a full day training session on

worm prevention lessons as well as on the details of the deworming program, and were instructed to

impart these lessons during school hours. These classroom lessons were supplemented through lectures




                                                                                                           7
by an experienced NGO field team (the team leader was a trained Public Health Technician) which visited

each treatment school several times per year.

        At all schools where helminth prevalence was sufficiently high, the project provided periodic

treatment with deworming drugs to be taken at the school. The World Health Organization has endorsed

mass school-based deworming in areas with prevalence over 50% since mass treatment eliminates the

need for costly individual screening [Warren et al., 1993; WHO, 1987], and the drugs are cheap when

purchased in bulk.5

        Our best estimate is that teacher training, teacher lessons at school, the lectures delivered by the

NGO field team, and the classroom wall-charts and other educational materials taken together cost at least

US$0.44 per pupil per year in the assisted schools6 – which is comparable to the total cost of deworming

drug purchase and delivery in a nearby Tanzanian program, at US$0.49 [PCD, 1999]. In our case, it is

difficult to break out the costs of health education, data collection, and drug delivery since the same field

team was responsible for all activities, so cost estimates should be seen as approximate.

        The NGO we worked with has a policy of using community cost-recovery in its projects to

promote sustainability and confer project ownership on beneficiaries. In the case of deworming, the NGO

temporarily waived this policy initially, and then planned to phase it in gradually. The 50 Group 1 and

Group 2 schools were stratified by treatment group and geographic location and then 25 were randomly

selected (using a computer random number generator) to pay user fees for medical treatment in 2001,

while the other 25 continued to receive free medical treatment that year; all Group 3 schools received free

treatment in 2001. The deworming fee was set on a per family basis like most Kenyan primary school

fees at the time. This introduced within-school variation in the per child cost of deworming since

households have different numbers of primary school children, variation that we also use to estimate the

effect of price on drug take-up. Of the 25 Group 1 and Group 2 schools participating in cost-sharing, two

thirds received albendazole at a cost of 30 Kenyan shillings per family (US$0.40 in 2001) and one third

received both albendazole and praziquantel at a cost of 100 shillings (approximately US$1.30). Whether

praziquantel was given depended on the local prevalence of schistosomiasis. Since parents have 2.7


                                                                                                                8
children in school on average, the average cost of deworming per child in cost-sharing schools was

slightly more than US$0.30 – still a heavily subsidized price, about one fifth the cost of drug purchase

and delivery through this program (at US$1.49) and 60% of the cost in the Tanzania program.7

        The study area seems fertile ground for encouraging voluntary community provision of local

public goods like deworming control. Kenya has a long history of community self-help programs, and

indeed the national motto of “Harambee” refers to such programs. The project we examine was

conducted at primary schools, one of the most widespread and firmly established institutions in rural

Kenya. All primary schools have a committee composed of parents and community representatives, and

historically these committees have been entrusted with raising funds locally for most non-salary costs of

running the school, including everything from chalk to classroom construction.

        Cultural understandings of health, and particularly worms, in our study area also merit a brief

discussion; this account draws heavily on the work of Geissler [1998a, 1998b, 2000], who studies

deworming take-up in the Kenyan district that borders our study area. Medical anthropologists have long

pointed out that people can simultaneously hold traditional and biomedical views of health, in a manner

similar to religious syncretism, and Geissler argues that this is the case for views about worms in western

Kenya. In the traditional view, worms are an integral part of the human body and necessary for digestion,

and many infection symptoms are attributed to malevolent occult forces (“witchcraft”) or breaking taboos

[Government of Kenya, 1986]. Educated people are more likely to engage in the biomedical discourse

and thus more likely to treat illnesses medically rather than using traditional remedies. Geissler finds that

most people do not place much value on deworming treatment because worms are not seen as a pressing

health problem, especially compared to malaria and HIV/AIDS.8 As a result, there was almost no

deworming outside the school health program he studies, and most children relied on local herbal

remedies to alleviate the abdominal discomfort caused by worms.

        Local knowledge regarding private benefits of receiving treatment under a mass deworming

program was likely very poor in our study area. The project we study was the first mass deworming

treatment program in the district, to our knowledge. Albendazole and praziquantel were only approved for


                                                                                                            9
human use in the mid-1980s and by 1998 were still rarely used in the area. Prior to the program, fewer

than five percent of people reported taking deworming drugs [Miguel and Kremer, 2004]. While many

medicines, such as aspirin and anti-malarials, are cheaply available in nearly all local shops, deworming

was only available in a few shops and at high mark-ups, presumably due to a thin market. In fact, none of

64 local shops surveyed in 1999 had either albendazole (or its close substitute, mebendazole) or

praziquantel in stock, though a minority carried less effective deworming drugs (levamisole

hydrochloride and piperazine). Albendazole and praziquantel were available in some local health clinics.

Inference about likely mass treatment impacts based on observed individual impacts was complicated for

local residents by non-random selection into treatment, as well as the possibility of spillover effects.



             III. A Framework for Understanding the Adoption of a New Health Technology

We model the spread of information and the evolution of take-up of a new technology in a social network.

The model provides a framework for the empirical estimation of adoption peer effects and helps clarify

the conditions under which a one-time subsidy can change the long-run level of adoption and thus achieve

“sustainability”.

        We develop a simple framework in which people adopt deworming if expected private benefits

exceed the expected cost. They are heterogeneous both in their taste for deworming and in their priors

about the effectiveness of the drugs. People are linked in a social network and receive signals about

adoption, drug effectiveness, and how to use the drugs. The model nests four types of peer effects

proposed in the existing literature. Others’ adoption can (i) influence own adoption through the disease

environment, (ii) directly enter the utility function through a pure imitation effect, (iii) provide

information about how to effectively use the technology (as in Jovanovic and Nyarko [1996] or Foster

and Rosenzweig [1995]), or (iv) provide information on the benefits of the technology (as in Banerjee

[1992] or Ellison and Fudenberg [1993]).



A. Assumptions


                                                                                                           10
We assume that an individual i decides to adopt a new technology (or health practice) if the expected

private benefits are greater than the costs, conditional on her prior beliefs and the information received

from social contacts. As noted above, the cost of deworming adoption is privately incurred, immediate

and salient, while much of the benefit is in the form of externalities and even the private benefits are

delayed, so private benefits may not exceed costs, particularly for people with high discount rates.

        Suppose that the total private benefit to taking the deworming drug depends on the individual’s

infection level γ ; the effectiveness of the drug φ (which incorporates the percentage reduction in worm

load that results from taking the drug and the rapidity of re-infection) 9; and an idiosyncratic individual

specific taste for deworming μi which is assumed to have a continuous distribution with no mass points

and a sufficiently large support such that some individuals always take up the drug. (Note that

policymakers can always guarantee that some take up the drug, by heavily subsidizing a small fraction of

consumers.) Individual infection γ may depend on individual characteristics X, and also on others'

treatment history. Because worms are transmitted through environmental contamination rather than from

person to person, infection levels are likely to depend on average population treatment, rather than an

individual’s social links.

        Financial, time, or utility costs of treatment are denoted by C > 0. Below we allow for the

possibility that people may learn from their own experience and from others about how to reduce the cost

of using the technology (for example, how to control side effects by taking food with the medicine), but,

as in Jovanovic and Nyarko [1996] and Foster and Rosenzweig [1995], we assume this learning is

bounded so that C approaches some positive C∞. The drug subsidies, health education, and verbal

commitment interventions discussed in sections V, VI, and VII can be regarded as changing the adoption

cost.

        Finally, a desire to imitate one’s social contacts may influence the decision to take up the

technology. The parameter β > 0 captures the importance of this effect.




                                                                                                              11
        Let φˆit denote the individual’s beliefs in period t about drug effectiveness φ conditional on prior

beliefs and any signals received, and let Tit∈{0, 1} be an indicator variable for drug take-up in period t.

Then the individual’s expected private benefit from adoption can be expressed as

(1)              E [U (Tit = 1) − U (Tit = 0 )] = φˆit h(γ it )μ i − C + βω it

where U is individual utility from deworming, conditional on the treatment choices of other individuals,

and ω it is the share of social contacts who took up the drug in the previous period.

        We assume that individuals decide whether to adopt deworming at time t based on the current

costs and benefits of adoption, and do not consider the additional motive of adopting in order to learn

more about the impact of the technology or how to use it in the future. This is partly to keep the model

tractable, but is also a reasonable assumption in our context. Discount rates were likely high given the

temporary nature of the program and the limited foresight of schoolchildren. Moreover, deworming was

introduced at the level of whole schools, so most people offered the chance to take it would have many

opportunities to learn about impacts from classmates, limiting the marginal value of their own experience.



B. Information Structure

At the moment the new technology is introduced, individual i has a prior belief about the effectiveness of

taking deworming medicine as part of a mass campaign, denoted φi0, which may be greater or less than

the actual effectiveness φ. Priors could be less than φ due to traditional beliefs about worms in the study

region [Geissler, 1998a, 1998b]. However, people could also have had overly optimistic estimates about

private benefits. The enthusiasm of NGO field officers promoting deworming at schools may have

reflected the drugs’ social rather than private benefits. Although the scripts made clear that the medicine

kills worms in the body but does not prevent reinfection, people may not have realized how quickly they

would be reinfected. Moreover, if people estimated their expected private benefits by comparing

individuals in treatment versus comparison schools, they would incorrectly assign some of the school-




                                                                                                              12
wide treatment externality to private benefits, again making prior beliefs about private deworming

benefits overly optimistic.

        Priors about deworming effectiveness could also vary systematically with individual

characteristics, such as education. This is a departure from the standard assumption of common priors but

is plausible for Kenya. In the context of rural Kenya, formal schooling is considered an important

predictor of favorable views about new health technologies [Akwara, 1996; Kohler et al., 2001]. This

could reflect either the causal impact of education, or simply the fact that people who are more open to

“modern” or “Western” ideas and technologies obtain more education. We formalize this variation in

prior beliefs by modeling the common effectiveness parameter φ as a draw from a distribution believed to

have mean φ0(Xi) and variance σ02. While people can learn about the realization of φ through signals from

their social links, beliefs about its distribution need not have converged to a common prior before the

program intervention since mass deworming had not taken place in the area before.

        All individuals who take the drug obtain a signal about effectiveness. These signals are noisy due

to individual time-specific shocks to health status (e.g., malaria, typhoid, cholera) that are hard to

distinguish from drug effects. Let these signals have mean φ and variance σε2.

        We assume information diffuses through an infinite social network with a simple structure in

which the network, viewed from the perspective of any node, is a proper tree. This implies that a single

path connects any two nodes.10 Each individual has m direct social links, people with whom they may

exchange information, where m is a positive integer. Each of those links, in turn, also has m direct links.

In the special case where m=2, this is equivalent to people being arrayed along an infinite line, each with

direct links to two immediate neighbors.

        Time is discrete. At the beginning of each period, individuals can send messages to their direct

links with information both from their own signals received and from others’ signals. Signals are

transmitted to each link with probability p each period. Later in the same period, people receive these




                                                                                                           13
messages from their social contacts. These lags in information diffusion are consistent with the data from

Kenya, as discussed below.



C. Steady State Adoption

We first solve the steady state of this model, before turning to the transition path.

        Note that in our model as long as some fraction of people always adopt, information will

eventually diffuse completely. This implies that in steady state φˆit = φ and C = C∞ for all individuals i.

Consider first the case in which β = 0 (no pure imitation effects). Let λ denote the share of the

population taking up treatment and let λ* denote the steady state share such that if a proportion λ* of the

population took the drug in the past, the same proportion will find it optimal to take the drug. An

individual will adopt in the steady state if:

(2)                       φh(γ (λ *, X i ))μ i − C ∞ > 0

and forgo treatment if not. It is straightforward to show that there exists a unique equilibrium cutoff

value λ* =   ∫∫1{φh(γ (λ*, X ))μ − C   ∞   > 0}⋅ P( X , μ )dXdμ , where P(X, μ) denotes the probability of those

values occurring in the population.11

        While λ* is unique if β = 0 , there can be multiple steady states under sufficiently strong pure

imitation effects, in which others' take-up decisions directly enter the utility function in a manner

complementary with own take-up. Even if parameters are such that λ* is arbitrarily close to zero in the

absence of imitation effects, if imitation effects are sufficiently strong that

β > C ∞ − φ min{h(γ (1, X i ))μ i } , there will be another steady state in which everyone uses the
                i


technology since then: φh(γ (1, X i ))μ i − C∞ + β > 0 for all i. A sufficiently large temporary subsidy can

in this case lead to a switch from the partial use equilibrium to the full use equilibrium, leading to

sustainable increases in take-up.




                                                                                                              14
           Peer effects in technology adoption are sometimes cited as a rationale for why temporary

subsidies may have long run effects. The model suggests that subsidizing a small number of people will

be sufficient to ensure that those people will learn both the returns to the technology and how to best use

the technology. In the absence of pure imitation effects, this will be enough to assure widespread long-run

adoption of technologies with positive private returns.12 There is no need to subsidize a large number of

people to achieve steady state diffusion. While this result is specific to this particular model, we

conjecture that similar results will apply under other Bayesian learning models. If policymakers are

uncertain about the benefits of a particular technology, then providing heavy subsidies to a few people

seems much more prudent than widely subsidizing what may turn out to be an unattractive technology.13



D. Take-up along the Transition Path

We next turn to modeling take-up along the transition path. By time τ, the probability that a signal is

transmitted from a first-order link to the receiver is [1 – (1 – p)τ], the probability that signal is transmitted

from a second-order link to the receiver is [∑k = 2…τ (k–1)⋅{p2(1 – p)k – 2}], and more generally the


                                                                                          ∑ ⎜⎜ j − 1⎟⎟ ⋅ {p (1 − p ) } for j ≤ τ, and 0
                                                                                           τ
                                                                                             ⎛ k − 1⎞      j         k− j
probability that a signal is transmitted from a jth order link is
                                                                                          k= j   ⎝   ⎠

for j > τ.

           Holding fixed the take-up behavior of intermediate nodes, the direct impact of an additional

signal acquired by a jth order link on take-up is then the probability that the signal is transmitted,

multiplied by an indicator for whether the receiver changes her take-up decision in response to the new

signal. Let i index an individual node as above. Take-up occurs (Tit = 1) if and only if E[U(Tit = 1) –

U(Tit = 0)] > 0, and the direct impact of an additional signal from a jth order link by time τ is thus:

If a Bayesian individual has N itE total signals from early treatment school links, both direct (first-order)

and indirect (higher-order), she then weights her prior beliefs and signals received from social links such

that the posterior belief on expected effectiveness becomes:

                       ⎡⎧    σ N2 ⎫                   ⎛ ⎧ σ N2 ⎫ ⎞           ⎤

where φ0(Xi) is the mean of her prior distribution, φS is the sample average of signals received through the

social network, and σN2 ≡ σε2 / N itE denotes the variance of the sample average. As individuals accumulate

more signals through their social network, the variance of the sample average goes to zero, and the value

of both the sample average and posterior beliefs approach the true expected effectiveness, φ.

        When the prior belief is greater than the true expected effectiveness (φ0(Xi) > φ), individuals with

more early treatment social links tend to have falling posterior beliefs about expected effectiveness, and

thus the likelihood of adoption declines in the number of early treatment links. From equation 4, the

decline in the expected benefit of treatment with respect to early links will be convex, as the posterior

asymptotically approaches the true expected effectiveness. Similarly, when the prior is less than the true

expected effectiveness, the posterior asymptotically approaches the true benefit from below. When φ0(Xi)

> φ for all education levels (Xi) and the prior is increasing in Xi, then individuals with more education

generally have higher adoption, but additional early links will lead to sharper drops in their adoption.

        Similarly, the framework allows for the possibility that people may learn from signals they

receive as well as from their own experience about how to use the technology so C(•) is a decreasing

function of the total number of signals ever received about the technology, N itE , with C′(•) < 0, C′′ (•) >

0, C(0) > 0, and C(∞) = C∞.

        Although epidemiological effects are likely to depend on the broader population rather than

immediate social contacts, because worm infections result from contamination of water or soil rather than

direct person-to-person transmission, it is worth considering the possibility that children whose families




                                                                                                            16
have close social interactions with households in early treatment schools may experience somewhat lower

helminth infection rates and thus reductions in infection intensity. We model this by allowing the

infection level to be a function of the share of direct social contacts treated.

        The impact of early treatment links on the expected private benefits to adoption is thus

        The first right-hand side term is the social effect from information on drug effectiveness, and can

be positive or negative depending on the difference between priors and true private adoption benefits. The

second term captures the social effect from learning how to use the drugs described above, and is always

positive. The third term is the infection social effect, which should be negative because having more early

treatment links could lead to a lower individual infection level (due to epidemiological externalities),

which in turn reduces treatment benefits. The positive imitation effect is captured in the fourth term.

        We conclude that, to the extent that we observe negative overall social effects empirically, this is

evidence that the combined effect of the information and infection externalities is larger than the learning-

by-doing effect plus the pure imitation effect. Furthermore, since infection externalities appear small

empirically, as we show below, we interpret negative estimated social effects as strong evidence that

social effects work through the transmission of information about drug effectiveness. We find no

evidence for learning-by-doing or imitation here, although we cannot rule out small effects of these types.

        These formulae describe the impact of an additional signal holding fixed the behavior of

intermediate nodes in the social network. In the long run, with repeated opportunities for adoption, there

will be additional effects mediated by the effect of a link’s information on the take-up behavior of

intermediate nodes, and thus on the subsequent number of signals that intermediate nodes possess and can

send to the receiver, as well as any effects on the information and take-up of intermediate nodes mediated



                                                                                                                          17
by imitation effects. These indirect effects would accumulate over time, but since in our experiment

people could only adopt every six months, and they were only able to adopt the drugs through the

program for either zero, two or three years (depending on their treatment group), we focus above on the

case in which the direct effects of signals dominate the indirect effects. In section 4.6, though, we report

results from a simulation of the transition path allowing for these indirect effects.



              IV. Empirical Results on Networks, Social Learning and Technology Adoption

A. Data, Measurement, and Estimation

We test whether households with more social links to schools randomly chosen for early treatment were

more likely to take deworming drugs, conditional on their total number of links to all project schools.

        The PSDP Parent Questionnaire was collected in 2001 during household visits among a

representative subsample of parents with children currently enrolled in Group 2 and Group 3 schools. A

representative subsample of children (typically 10 to 17 years old) present in school on the survey day

were administered a Pupil Questionnaire.

        Parent Questionnaire respondents were asked for information on their closest social links: the five

friends they speak with most frequently, the five relatives they speak with most frequently, additional

social contacts whose children attend local primary schools, and individuals with whom they speak

specifically about child health issues. These individuals are collectively referred to as the respondent’s

direct “social links.” The survey also collected information on the deworming treatment status of social

links’ children and the effects of treatment on their health, how frequently the respondent speaks with

each social link, which primary schools links’ children attend, the global positioning system (GPS)

location of the respondent’s home, and the respondent’s knowledge of worm infections and attitudes

toward deworming. The Parent Questionnaire was administered in two rounds in 2001 with households

randomly allocated between the rounds. The Round 2 survey collected more detailed information on the

impact of deworming on links’ children. Two different samples are used in the analysis. Sample 1




                                                                                                             18
contains the 1,678 parents surveyed in either Round 1 or 2 with complete child treatment and parent

social network data.14 Sample 2 contains the 886 parents surveyed in Round 2.

        On average, parent respondents have 10.2 direct (first-order) social links with children in primary

school, of whom 4.4 attend the respondent’s child’s own school, 2.8 attend other project schools (Groups

1, 2, or 3), and 1.9 attend nearby “early treatment schools” (Groups 1 and 2—Table I, panel A). There is

considerable variation in the number of direct early treatment links: the standard deviation is 2.0, and

approximately one third of respondents have no social links to Group 1 or 2 schools, one third have one

or two links, and one third have three or more links.

        Approximately 40 parents were surveyed in each Group 2 and Group 3 school to construct

second-order link measures. For each school we compute the average number of links that parents have to

early treatment (Group 1, Group 2) schools and to late treatment (Group 3) schools, once again excluding

links to their own school. We do not have information on the social links’ own social contacts at the

individual level, and so rely on average school social network contacts in the higher-order analysis. In all

main specifications, we exclude all self-referential links, in other words, all direct and higher-order links

back to the respondent’s own school.

        The school average of second order social connections is likely to be a noisy proxy for the true

individual level second-order measures, first due to idiosyncratic variation in the number of social

contacts to particular schools, and second due to the fact that the social network data is based on surveys

with samples of Group 2 and 3 parents alone, rather than with all parents in all local schools. This

measurement error should not be systematically correlated with the randomized deworming group

assignment of social contacts’ schools, preserving the identification strategy. However, it is likely to

generate some attenuation bias towards zero in the estimated impact of second (and higher) order social

contacts on deworming take-up.

        In order to keep the theoretical framework tractable, above we considered a network of

individuals with uncorrelated signals arranged in a proper tree such that two individuals are linked by a

single pathway and there are no redundant links. In practice, however, signals on the impact of


                                                                                                            19
deworming are likely to be correlated among individuals within the same school (due to the geographic

proximity of particular local schools), and there will be cases in which school A is linked directly to

school B both directly through first order links, and indirectly through second order links to school C

which in turn has direct links to School B. In such cases, the second order links will still convey some

new information since the correlation among signals within a school is not perfect, but they are likely to

convey less additional information than second-order links to a school where an individual has no direct

first-order links. We focus below on specifications that exclude all such redundant higher-order links to a

school, but results are similar when redundant links are included (results not shown).

        Parents have 2.9 second-order social links to early treatment schools (standard deviation 2.9) and

4.5 second-order links to all program schools (excluding the respondent’s own school, Table I Panel A).

There remains considerable variation in these second-order link measures across individuals, and similar

patterns hold for third-order social links.

        We have also examined the structure of social connections among the 50 Group 2 and Group 3

schools with complete social network data. In our data there is not a marked sense in which some schools

are net “senders” and others net “receivers” of information. The social network is remarkably symmetric:

the correlation coefficient of the average number of social links to school A named by individuals in

school B, and the average number of links to school B named by individuals in school A, is high at 0.82.

The pattern of connections between schools is most strongly influenced by physical distance: for every

additional 10 km separating two schools, the average number of named links falls by 0.06 (standard error

0.005, statistically significant at 99% confidence). Perhaps surprisingly, schools with the same dominant

ethnic group do not have significantly more social connections, nor do schools with similar test score

results. An indicator for the location of one of the schools in a market center is not statistically

significantly associated with more social connections at traditional confidence levels (regressions not

shown). Thus there does not appear to be huge scope for take-up gains here by exploiting knowledge of

the social network to optimally “seed” deworming interventions, and we expand on this point below in

the simulations (section IV.F).


                                                                                                           20
         The social effect analysis with parent network data is conducted at the household level using

probit estimation, and the outcome measure takes on a value of one if any child in the household was

treated with deworming drugs in 2001, and zero otherwise (although results are similar if the analysis is

conducted using the child as the unit of observation, results not shown).15 Tij is the main dependent

variable, the 2001 treatment indicator, where i is a household in school j. The idiosyncratic deworming

benefit term, eij, captures unobserved variation in parent beliefs about deworming benefits, tastes for

deworming, or the costs of obtaining treatment (for instance, whether the pupil was sick on the treatment

day, which increases the cost of walking to school). The individual treatment decision becomes Tij =

        ′
1( N ijE a + X ij ′ b + eij > 0 ), where N ijE is a vector of social links to early treatment schools, defined in

2001 as the Group 1 and 2 schools (not including the respondent’s own school). This vector may include

both direct (first-order) social links as well as higher-order exposure to early treatment schools.

         Among the explanatory variables, Xij, we include total links to all program schools other than the

respondent’s own school (both for direct and higher-order links), as well as the number of links to non-

program schools and these are represented by the vector N ij . Given the randomized design of the original

deworming program, the number of social links to early treatment schools is randomly assigned

conditional on total links to other program schools. The interpretation of the coefficient on the total

number of links is complicated by the possibility that more sociable individuals (i.e., those able to name

more social links) differ from less sociable people in certain unobserved dimensions. However, given the

design, this does not affect the estimated impact of early treatment links since the number of early

treatment links is orthogonal to the error term conditional on total named links.

         The cost-sharing indicator variable, COSTj, takes on a value of one for schools participating in the

cost-sharing project, where the financial cost of treatment was higher. Zij is a vector of additional

household socioeconomic characteristics (parents’ education and asset ownership), demographic

characteristics (respondent fertility), and other controls (respondent membership in community groups,

and a Group 2 indicator) that may affect real or perceived deworming benefits and costs. Idiosyncratic



                                                                                                                    21
disturbance terms are allowed to be correlated within each school as a result of common influences, such

as headmaster efforts in promoting the program. Equation 6 presents the main probit specification:

                                      ′       ′                      ′
                 Pr(Tij = 1) = Φ{N ij a + N ij b1 + b2 COST j + Z ij b3 + eij } .
                                    E
(6)


We include interaction terms between household characteristics and social links to estimate

heterogeneous treatment effects, for example, as a function of respondent education, and also estimate

effects of different types of social connections (e.g., links to relatives versus friends).

        To validate the identification strategy, we first confirm that the randomization succeeded in

creating program groups balanced along observable dimensions: the number of direct (first-order) social

links and second- and third-order exposure to early treatment schools, as well as the Group 2 indicator

variable and the cost-sharing indicator, are not significantly associated with most observable household

characteristics (Table II), including parent years of education, community group membership (e.g.,

women's or farming groups), or the total number of children in the household, or with household ethnic

group or religious affiliation variables (ethnic and religious results not shown). The numbers of first

order and second order early links are, however, positively and significantly associated with iron roof

ownership in one specification (Table II, regression 4), and we thus include these controls in most

specifications below to control for any independent effects they may have on take-up. The measure of

second-order links to early treatment schools is significantly associated with moderate to heavy infection

in 2001 at the 10% level, but the coefficient is small (and, surprisingly, positive). Third-order links to

early treatment schools are not significantly associated with any observable characteristics.



B. Nonexperimental Social Effect Estimates

We first present nonexperimental social effect estimates. In a specification similar to many existing

studies, we examine the take-up rate of children in a predefined local social unit—here the primary

school—as the key explanatory variable. We find that the local school treatment rate (excluding the

respondent) is strongly positively correlated with take-up, as expected, with coefficient estimate 0.84


                                                                                                             22
(standard error 0.11—Table III, regression 1). Take-up among children who are members of the

respondent’s own ethnic group in their school is somewhat more influential than take-up in other ethnic

groups (regression not shown), a finding similar to Munshi and Myaux [2002], although in our case we

argue that this pattern is likely due to omitted variable bias rather than to actual social learning as they

claim in their context. Similarly, there is a positive, though not statistically significant relationship

(estimate 0.015, standard error 0.011, regression 2) between the number of treated first-order links named

in the survey (among those attending the respondent’s school) and take-up, in a specification similar to

several other recent studies [Kohler et al., 2001; Bandiera and Rasul, 2005].

         Social links’ experiences with deworming may also affect individuals’ choices. In particular, we

test whether take-up is higher when first-order links had “good” experiences with the technology, as in

Conley and Udry [2000]. Having more links whose children had “good effects” is not associated with

higher take-up, but those who had more links with “side effects” are somewhat less likely to be treated

(Table III, regression 3)—the p-value on the hypothesis that the two estimates are equal is 0.09—but this

is only suggestive.16



C. Experimental Social Effect Estimates

Experimental social effect estimates are markedly different from the nonexperimental estimates above,

suggesting that omitted variable bias in the nonexperimental estimates is large and positive. We begin by

considering direct first-order social effects to be comparable with existing work, before moving onto

higher-order social effect estimates.

        Each additional direct parent social link to an early treatment school is associated with 3.1

percentage points lower likelihood that the respondent’s children received deworming drugs in 2001, and

this effect is significantly different from zero at over 95% confidence (Table IV, regression 1 presents

marginal probit estimates evaluated at mean values). This suggests that the respondent’s small, self-

defined social network has a major impact on treatment choices: having two additional early treatment

links (roughly a one standard deviation increase) reduces take-up by 6 percentage points.


                                                                                                               23
        This result cannot simply be due to imitation, or to social effects related to learning about how to

use the new technology, since the overall effect is negative. This implies that learning about the benefits

of the technology plus the infection externality, taken together, are negative and larger in magnitude than

the sum of the effect of imitation and the effect due to learning to use the technology. A quadratic term in

parent social links to early treatment schools is also statistically significantly different from zero at 95%

confidence in some specifications (Appendix Table A.I., regression 1). However, this quadratic term is

not significant for interactions with household characteristics nor is the quadratic second-order early

treatment exposure term statistically significant (regressions not shown), so we principally focus on the

linear measure for simplicity in what follows.17

        None of the demographic or socioeconomic controls is significantly associated with 2001 take-up

except for distance from home to school, which is negatively related to take-up and large: take-up drops

nearly two percentage points for each additional kilometer from home to school (using GPS measures).

Distance apparently makes it costlier for parents to walk to school to provide written consent for

deworming and for children to attend school, a first piece of empirical evidence that take-up is sensitive to

treatment costs. Parent years of education (typically maternal education in our sample) is positively but

not statistically significantly associated with higher take-up (point estimate 0.003, standard error 0.003,

Table IV, regression 1).

        Social effects are more negative for Group 3 schools (point estimate –0.041, Table IV, regression

2) than for Group 2 (–0.023, the sum of the direct effect of early treatment links and its interaction with

the Group 2 indicator), although the difference is not statistically significant. This pattern of coefficient

estimates is reasonable: Group 2 parents had by 2001 already observed the impact of deworming

treatment in their own household and community and should therefore be less influenced than Group 3

parents by early links (i.e., in equation 5, σ N2 is smaller for Group 2 parents than Group 3 parents).

Nonetheless, the persistent influence of early links on Group 2 households after two years of the program




                                                                                                                24
is noteworthy. One possible non-Bayesian explanation is that initial pieces of information carry

disproportionate weight in subsequent decision making [Rabin and Schrag, 1999].18

        The results are robust to including the proportion of links with children in early treatment schools

rather than the number of such links (Table IV, regression 3), and to controlling for the total number of

parent social links nonparametrically using a set of indicator variables (results not shown). An interaction

between the cost-sharing indicator and the number of early treatment links is imprecisely estimated, but is

near zero and not statistically significant (estimate -0.013, standard error 0.039 – regression not shown).19

        Several pieces of evidence suggest that learning takes place not only among individuals with

strong social ties but also among those with relatively weak ties, along the lines of Granovetter [1973].

When the framework is extended to include different types of parent social links – “close” friends,

defined as those with whom the respondent speaks at least twice a week, versus relatively “distant”

friends – each additional close link to an early treatment school is associated with 0.030 lower probability

of deworming treatment in 2001 and the estimated effect of distant links is similar, although not

statistically significant due to reduced precision (Table IV, regression 4, estimate –0.033, standard error

0.033).20 We are similarly unable to reject the hypotheses that social effects are the same for links to

relatives versus non-relatives, or for members of the respondent’s own ethnic group versus other groups,

conditional on being named a social link (results not shown).

        Social effects are more strongly negative for respondents with more education (Table IV,

regression 5). Other studies—most notably Foster and Rosenzweig [1995]—find that educated

individuals learn most rapidly about new technologies and adopt first. Note that the overall impact of an

additional year of schooling on deworming take-up remains positive though not statistically significant

when all the education interaction terms, including the terms interacting education with total links, are

considered (interaction term coefficient estimates not shown in regression 5).

        Additional social links could have a larger impact on more educated individuals in the theoretical

framework presented above if they had overly optimistic prior beliefs (φi0) about the drugs, rather than

any greater receptiveness to new information. Although we cannot decisively distinguish these two


                                                                                                            25
explanations empirically, the relation between respondents’ education and their stated belief that

deworming drugs are “very effective” does provide further evidence supporting the overoptimism model.

Among Group 3 parents interviewed in Round 1, before deworming treatment was phased into their

schools individuals who had completed primary school were 17 percentage points more likely to believe

deworming drugs are “very effective” than parents who had not completed primary school. However,

several months after deworming had been introduced into their schools, this falls by about half to a 9

percentage point gap between more educated and less educated Group 3 parents interviewed in Round 2

(recall that parents were randomly allocated between survey rounds), and there is a similar gap among

Group 2 parents in 2001, at 10 percentage points, two years after these schools had begun receiving

treatment. Presenting the result in levels rather than differences, among Group 3 parents who completed

primary school the perceived effectiveness of deworming also fell dramatically from 59% to 45% from

Round 1 to Round 2, but fell only slightly among the less educated. To summarize, through exposure to

deworming over time, views toward the drugs partially converged across parents with different

educational levels and the drugs were increasingly viewed as ineffective among Group 3 parents. As the

medical effectiveness of the drugs is well documented, we conjecture that their disillusionment with the

drugs is due to reinfection.

        We also estimate social effects as a function of child social contacts in early treatment schools

using the 2001 Pupil Questionnaire data. Average social connections across schools (for the Group 2 and

Group 3 schools) are very similar for parents and children with a correlation coefficient of 0.92, and this

complicates the task of distinguishing between parent and child impacts. Among those children aged 13

years and older, the estimated effect of direct child social links is negative, similar to the parent first-order

early treatment estimate and statistically significant at over 95% confidence in a specification analogous

to those in Table IV (point estimate -0.028, standard error 0.012). However, the point estimate is much

smaller for younger children (-0.006, standard error 0.014 – regressions not shown). Multiple

interpretations of this pattern are possible, including the possibility that adolescents are more influenced

by peer information or pressure than younger children, as claimed by Steinberg and Cauffman [1996], or


                                                                                                              26
perhaps that younger children are less able to process health information from their social contacts, or that

the interaction of information from parents and adolescents is particularly influential.

        Unfortunately, we only have limited statistical power to disentangle parent and child impacts or

to investigate possible interaction effects due to the high correlation of parent and child social networks

and because matched information on both parent and child social networks exists for only a limited subset

of children, reducing the sample size in the child network regressions by over half. When parent and child

first order social links to early treatment schools are both included as explanatory variables, both

coefficient estimates remain negative but are no longer statistically significant due to the large increase in

standard errors (regression not shown).21

        We next consider higher-order exposure to early treatment schools through parent social

networks. After reproducing the main direct first-order social link result (Table V, regression 1), we

examine the impact of second-order exposure to early treatment schools, where second-order links are

constructed using school average connections, and find that second-exposure to early treatment schools is

also associated with significantly lower deworming drug take-up in 2001 (estimate -0.035, standard error

0.013, regression 2), conditional on total second-order exposure to all program schools. When both first-

order and second-order social networks terms are included, the estimated second-order effect is -0.047,

nearly identical to the average first-order effect of -0.044, and both effects are statistically significant at

high levels of confidence (regression 3). While the theoretical framework predicts that coefficients should

decline monotonically for higher-order links along the transition path to steady state (since information

from more distant social links is less likely to have reached the individual), we cannot reject the

hypothesis that the coefficient estimates on the first-order and second-order links are equal or that first-

order effects are somewhat more negative, so we do not emphasize this difference. An increase of one

standard deviation in second-order early treatment school exposure is associated with a very large 19

percentage point reduction in deworming take-up. Mirroring the first-order results, more total second-

order exposure to all schools (not just early treatment schools) is associated with higher take-up, which




                                                                                                                  27
we interpret as reflecting a positive correlation between overall individual “sociability” and positive

priors toward deworming in our sample.

        The negative second-order effects we estimate suggest that higher-order links can affect behavior

not only by influencing the take-up behavior of first-order links, but also through changing the

information of first-order links. To see this, note that theoretically one could imagine negative imitation

effects, if people like to be different than their neighbors. However, a model in which higher-order links

affect behavior only through changing the behavior of intermediate links (such as a pure imitation model)

would imply that the impact of second order link adoption should be equal to the square of the first-order

link effect of -0.044, or 0.002. Given the results below ruling out large infection externalities at the level

of individual social contacts, the large negative coefficient on second-order adoption we estimate thus

provides additional evidence that diffusion works via information transmission through social networks.

        This negative social learning result holds and is highly statistically significant for both first-order

and second-order links when the proportion of early treatment exposure is used (Table V, regression 4)

rather than the number of links. The interaction between second-order early treatment school exposure

and respondent education remains negative, as was the case for first-order links, but the point estimate is

not statistically significant (regression not shown). The second-order exposure results also hold if the

first-order exposure is constructed using average school social network connections in a manner

analogous to the construction of the higher-order links (coefficient estimate is -0.077, standard error

0.036, significant at 95% confidence – regression not shown).

        Extending the analysis, we find that third-order exposure to early treatment schools – constructed

analogously to the second-order links, using school averages for higher-order connections – is not

statistically significantly associated with deworming take-up, although the point estimate is again

negative (Table V, regression 5). Within the theoretical framework we outline in Section III, a possible

explanation for the weaker estimated third order effect is that insufficient time had passed for some third-

order social contacts’ information to reach respondents, perhaps because social contacts only discuss

deworming infrequently, as suggested by our survey data.


                                                                                                             28
D. Further Econometric Identification Issues

The estimated negative peer effect in technology adoption implies that social learning about the benefits

of deworming and the infection externality taken together are negative and far larger in magnitude than

any possible social learning about how use the new technology plus imitation effects. Here we argue that

infection effects cannot empirically explain even a small fraction of the overall direct first-order social

effect of –3.1% (Table IV, regression 1), since any plausible estimate of the effect of early treatment

school social contacts on infection status, times the effect of infection on take-up, is much smaller. Thus

social learning about deworming benefits appears to be the key channel driving our results.

        First, having additional direct social links to early treatment schools is associated with lower rates

of moderate-heavy helminth infection, as expected (Table II, regression 6), but the effect is small and not

statistically significant (coefficient estimate –0.3 percentage points, relative to a mean moderate-heavy

infection rate of 27%). An additional second-order social link to early treatment schools is even

associated with a somewhat higher rate of infection, though the estimate is only statistically significant at

90% confidence. Note that this relatively weak relationship between early treatment school social links

and child infection is not inconsistent with the strong infection externality findings in Miguel and Kremer

[2004]. Worm infections are not transmitted directly person to person but rather through contaminated

soil and water, and a child’s named social links constitute only a small fraction of all people who defecate

near the child’s home, school, and church, or who bathe at the same points on Lake Victoria.

        In terms of the second step—from infection status to take-up—prior infection status is not

significantly associated with drug treatment for either Group 1 in 1998 or Group 2 in 1999 [Miguel and

Kremer, 2004], or for Groups 2 and 3 in 2001 (results not shown) and the point estimates suggest that

moderate-heavy worm infection is weakly negatively related to treatment rates.22 Of course, the cross-

sectional correlation between infection and treatment cannot be interpreted as causal due to omitted

variables: children from unobservably low socioeconomic status households may have both high infection

rates and low take-up, for example. However, the treated and untreated children look remarkably similar


                                                                                                              29
along many observable baseline socioeconomic and health characteristics [Miguel and Kremer, 2004],

and the relationship is similar using school-level average infection rates rather than individual data (not

shown), weakening the case for strong selection into deworming treatment.

        Further evidence that more infected people are not much more likely to take up the drugs is

provided by the 1999 cross-school infection externality estimates, identified using exogenous program

variation in the local density of early treatment schools. Although we find large average reductions in

moderate-heavy worm infection rates as a result of cross-school externalities (an average reduction in

infection of 0.23, Miguel and Kremer, [2004]), proximity to early treatment schools leads to an average

reduction in drug take-up of only 0.02, which has the expected sign but is near zero (regression not

shown). Using this estimate, having a moderate-heavy infection is associated with a 0.02/0.23 = 0.09

reduction in the likelihood of treatment, and this implies a drop in take-up due to infection first-order

social effects of only (0.09)*(-0.3%) = 0.03%, rather than the -3.1% overall reduction we estimate. Even

if eliminating a moderate-heavy infection reduced the likelihood of drug take-up by a massive 0.5 on

average (rather than the 0.09 we estimate), health externalities would account only for a (0.5)*(-0.3%) =

-0.15% reduction in take-up.

        Pupil transfers among local primary schools are another potential concern, but any resulting bias

would likely work against our findings. For example, parents with more health-conscious social contacts,

whose children may have been more likely to transfer into early treatment schools to receive deworming,

may themselves also be more health-conscious and eager to have their own children receive treatment.

This would bias the estimated social effect upward, in which case our negative social effect estimate

would be a bound on the true negative effect. In any case, the rate of pupil transfers between treatment

and comparison schools was low and nearly symmetric in both directions [Miguel and Kremer, 2004],

suggesting that any transfer bias is likely to be small.

        A related identification issue concerns whether social networks measured in 2001—three years

after the program started—were themselves affected by the program. Any extent to which health-

conscious individuals became more socially linked to individuals with children in early treatment schools


                                                                                                              30
would again lead to an upward bias, working against the negative effects we estimate. However,

respondents were statistically no more likely to name early treatment links than links to other schools: the

average number of links to early treatment schools is 1.92, while (Total number of links to PSDP schools)

x (Total number of Group 1, 2 pupils / Total number of Groups 1, 2, 3 pupils) is nearly identical at 1.91.



E. Parent Attitudes and Knowledge

Respondents with more direct (first-order) early treatment links are significantly more likely to claim that

deworming drugs are “not effective” (respondents could choose between “not effective”, “somewhat

effective” and “very effective”, Table VI, row 1).23 This is consistent with the hypothesis that some

people initially thought deworming would provide large and persistent private benefits but learned

otherwise from their early treatment school contacts. We do not find a significant impact of additional

early links on beliefs that deworming drugs are “very effective” although the point estimate is negative

(row 2), nor that the drugs have “side effects” (row 3). This last result is evidence against the possibility

that drug side effect rumors were the key driver of lower take-up among those with more early treatment

links.

         Second-order early treatment exposure does not have a statistically significant effect on parents’

belief that deworming drugs are “not effective” (regressions not shown). The discrepancy between first-

order and second-order effects on deworming attitudes may be due to the deterioration of information

quality with higher-order social connections: speculatively, individuals may learn from their higher-order

social contacts that deworming is basically “not good” even though the precise reason why is lost to them.

         Although direct first-order early treatment links do affect the belief that deworming drugs are

“not effective”, they do not affect beliefs that “worms and schistosomiasis are very bad for child health”

(Table VI, row 4). However, some parents may report what they think the survey enumerator wants to

hear regarding worms’ health consequences: 92% of respondents claimed that helminth infections are

“very bad” for child health, even though take-up is much lower than 92%. The number of direct early

treatment links has no effect on parents’ self-reported knowledge of the ICS (NGO) deworming program,


                                                                                                            31
the effects of worms and schistosomiasis , (rows 5 and 6), ) or the deworming treatment status of their

own child (not shown). It also did not affect their objective knowledge of common worm infection

symptoms (rows 7 to 10). Respondents could name only 1.8 of ten common symptoms on average.24 This

suggests health education messages failed to spread.

        Nonexperimental methods would have suggested different results. The actual number of treated

social links, and the number of social links with whom the respondent speaks directly about deworming,

are both positively and significantly related to most deworming attitudes and knowledge outcomes (Table

VI). The observed positive correlation in outcomes within social networks in the study area appears to be

due to omitted variables rather than actual peer effects. Those with unobservably more interest in child

health plausibly discuss worms more frequently with social links, who are themselves more likely to have

their own children receive treatment.



F. Simulating Take-up along the Transition Path

The framework in section III suggests that subsidies to take-up will not affect steady state adoption under

social learning either about how to use new technologies or learning about their benefits, as long as at

least a subset of the population uses the technology. However, subsidies could potentially have effects

along the transition path to the steady state. We therefore use the empirical school-to-school social

connections matrix to simulate the take-up gains along the transition path from a one-time drug subsidy

for parameter values that match the estimated first-order social effects. We consider a hypothetical

technology where true private benefits exceed most people’s expectations as it is of more general interest

to study technologies where social learning could potentially contribute to take-up.

        The simulation is based on the theoretical framework in section III with several functional form

assumptions made for tractability. We assume that the health benefits of the technology times

idiosyncratic utility from using the technology (the γ(Xi)⋅μi term) is uniformly distributed on the interval

[b, b] ; assume that everyone in a given school starts out with the same prior belief on benefits but that



                                                                                                             32
priors differ across schools (and thus focus on the diffusion of information across schools rather than on

heterogeneity within schools); and assume that all the social effects we observe are due to learning about

the benefits of the technology.

        One time period in the simulation roughly corresponds to one month. Information may diffuse

between schools in each period, but individuals only get an opportunity to adopt the technology once

every six months (as in the program we study). Our results are qualitatively robust to either shorter (τ = 1)

or longer (τ = 12) lags between adoption opportunities. For tractability we assume that information

diffuses instantly within schools.

        We consider parameter values for which the simulated first-order social effects fall within two

standard deviations of the first-order social effect estimated empirically, though again, we consider

diffusion of a hypothetical technology for which actual returns exceed prior beliefs, so social learning

speeds adoption. 25 While we do not explicitly match parameter values to the empirically estimated

second-order social effect, the simulated second-order effect is on average close to the estimated second-

order effects. As in our data, the simulated second-order effect is of a similar magnitude to the simulated

first-order effect – the difference between the simulated second-order and first-order social effects is on

average 0.006 (relative to an average simulated first-order effect of 0.02, a slightly smaller magnitude

than the effect estimated in section IV.C above).

        For a wide range of parameter values, we find that beliefs about the technology and take-up rates

converge quickly (within five adoption opportunities) to very close to the correct long-run value. Even in

a case where signals have high variance (e.g, σ ε2 = 9), by the third adoption opportunity the variance of

posterior beliefs is on average less than 0.01.

        Optimal “seeding” of a particular school with a one-time drug subsidy (in period one) makes little

difference to total discounted technology take-up. After 30 opportunities to adopt (15 years of a program

like the one we study), the difference in total discounted take-up between seeding the single “best” school

– the school that generates the highest total discounted take-up when seeded – versus the average of




                                                                                                              33
seeding a randomly chosen school in the sample is negligible (less than 0.01%) for our range of plausible

parameter values. This finding of small gains to “optimal seeding” is consistent with the largely

symmetric observed social network structure across schools (section IV.A). Given that it may be costly to

identify the optimal school to subsidize, and that those funds could alternatively be spent on subsidizing

drugs for additional schools (or subsidizing them for a longer period), efforts to target temporary drug

subsidies to influential “opinion leader” schools appear misguided in our context.

        Finally, even the take-up gains from one-time subsidies to additional schools are quite small on

average. Since information diffuses rapidly, these gains are primarily comprised of the direct effect of the

subsidy on take-up in the initial round; the impact of information spillovers is negligible. The indirect

effects on take-up (through the generation of additional information) are small in magnitude and exhibit

diminishing returns to additional subsidies. Total discounted take-up increases by only 0.027% (as a

percentage of take-up in the absence of the subsidy) on average above and beyond the direct effect of the

subsidy when a single school is subsidized at random. Going from subsidizing five to ten schools yields

an additional marginal gain of only 0.016% per school.

        Thus, at least in this particular context, there is little reason to think temporary subsidies will lead

to a sustainable increase in technology adoption. More generally, even if a hypothetical social planner

knew the returns to a particular technology were better than people expected, subsidizing even a small

fraction of the population for a relatively brief period would have been sufficient to assure long-run

diffusion. In the absence of strong imitation effects, the fact that dynamic gains to subsidizing additional

schools are small suggest that a “big push” is unnecessary for a technology that spreads naturally – and of

course is futile in the long-run for a technology where social effects are negative. To be effective in

boosting adoption, ongoing subsidies appear necessary in that case.



                               V. The Impact of Subsidies on Drug Take-up




                                                                                                             34
In the remainder part of the paper, we examine the effects of three other approaches to making

deworming sustainable: cost-sharing through user fees (section V), health education lessons (section VI),

and a mobilization intervention (section VII).

        Cost-sharing through user fees has been advocated as necessary for the sustainability of public

health services in many less developed countries [World Bank, 1993b]. Revenues from these fees could

be used to improve the quality of health services (i.e., through expanded drug availability) or to fund other

government expenditures. User fees could theoretically promote more efficient use of scarce public

resources if those in greatest need of health services are willing to pay the most for them.

        Several non-experimental studies from Africa have found large drops in health care utilization

after the introduction of user fees (e.g., McPake [1993], Meuwissen [2002]), including in Kenya, where

Mwabu et al. [1995] find utilization fell by 52% in 1989. Our analysis uses random assignment to

estimate the effect of cost sharing.26 The theoretical framework in section III suggests that increasing the

monetary cost of deworming should lead to lower drug take-up, but the actual elasticity of demand needs

to be estimated. 75% of households in the free treatment schools received deworming drugs in 2001

(Table I, Panel C), while the rate was only 19% in cost-sharing schools (the survey data used in these

regressions is described in Section IV). A regression analysis suggests the small fee reduced treatment by

62 percentage points (Table VII, regression 1), with the effect similar across households with various

socioeconomic characteristics (regression 2).27 This negative effect of monetary cost is consistent with

our finding (in Table IV) of large negative effects of household distance to the school, which proxies for

the time costs as parents need to walk to school to provide written consent.

        The drop in take-up in cost-sharing schools cannot be attributed to the hypothesis that user fees

help ensure that scarce health resources are directed to those who need them most. In fact, sicker pupils

were no more likely to pay for deworming drugs: the coefficient estimate on the interaction between 2001

helminth infection status and the cost-sharing indicator is not statistically significant (not shown).

        Variation in the deworming price per child was generated by the fact that cost-sharing came in the

form of a per family fee, so that parents with more children in the primary school in 2001 effectively


                                                                                                            35
faced a lower price per child. Cost-sharing reduced treatment rates regardless of the per child price that

the household was required to pay (Table VII, regression 3). Ariely and Shampan’er [2004] similarly find

sharp decreases in demand for goods with a small positive price relative to goods with a zero price in lab

experiments. This regression specification also includes the inverse of the number of household children

in primary school and the total number of household children of all ages as additional explanatory

variables to control for the direct effects of household demographic structure on deworming drug demand

and thus to isolate the price effect. However, we cannot explicitly control for the interaction between

family size and price changes given the school-level randomization design.

        The cost-sharing results suggest that introducing a small positive user fee is a particularly

unattractive policy in this context, since it dramatically reduces take-up while raising little revenue, and

typically requires considerable administrative cost. Yet this is precisely the approach that many less

developed countries, including Kenya, have adopted in the health sector [World Bank, 1994; McPake,

1993]. The net public cost per pupil treated in our program under a full subsidy was US$1.478. Assuming

a US$15 per school fixed cost of visiting a school (which we base on actual field costs), and a US$0.03

cost per pupil of collecting funds, the net public cost per student treated under cost sharing was

US$1.374. Pupils contributed about US$0.30 additionally in cost-sharing schools. For a fixed public

budget B, the difference between the total number of students treated under cost-sharing versus under a

full subsidy in this case will be (B/1.374) – (B/1.478) = B*0.0512. The extra revenue collected from the

private sector under cost-sharing will be US$0.30*(B/1.374) = B*0.2183. The cost per additional student

treated under cost-sharing is thus (B*0.2183)/(B*0.0512) = US$4.26. One can understand why a program

administrator with a fixed public budget might institute cost-sharing, but since the cost per additional

student treated under a full subsidy would be only US$1.478, the deadweight cost of taxation would have

to be enormous to make it rational for governments to seek to finance deworming out of user fees rather

than through taxation.

        It is worth bearing in mind the sequencing of the current project in interpreting the cost-sharing

results. Prior to the program fewer than 5% of people reported taking deworming drugs [Miguel and


                                                                                                               36
Kremer, 2004]. The schools received free treatment for two or three years, after which half the Group 1

and 2 schools were assigned to cost-sharing, following NGO policy. One rationale behind this sequencing

was that people may be more likely to spend money on a new product if they can first try it and witness

its benefits first-hand. However, some could argue that it is essential to introduce cost-sharing from the

outset, because after becoming accustomed to free treatment people will develop a sense of entitlement

and will refuse to pay when positive prices are later introduced. Although we are unable to directly test

either hypothesis here given the study design, it is worth noting that there was no significant difference in

the impact of cost-sharing on take-up across Group 1 and Group 2 schools despite their differing lengths

of exposure to free treatment (three versus two years, respectively – regression not shown), exposure that

could theoretically have provided a stronger sense of entitlement among Group 1 households.

        The huge drop in take-up with cost-sharing and the extremely low level of private deworming

purchases both suggest that most households in the study area place little value on deworming drugs.

Even if deworming is socially beneficial, perceived private gains were smaller than private costs for most

households under the cost-sharing regime. The social learning results indicate that additional information

about deworming through social contacts only reinforces this view, further depressing adoption.



                                    VI. The Impact of Health Education

There were no significant differences across treatment and comparison school pupils in early 1999 (one

year into the program) on the three worm prevention behaviors that the program emphasized: pupil

cleanliness (of the hands and uniform) observed by enumerators28, the proportion of pupils observed

wearing shoes, or self-reported exposure to fresh water (Table VIII, Panel A). The results do not vary

significantly by pupil age, gender, or grade (results not shown). As we found with cost-sharing for

deworming drugs, individuals appear unwilling to take a costly private action – here, buying shoes for

their children or adopting new hygiene practices – that help to combat worms in their local community.

        One alternative explanation is that treatment school children neglected to adopt worm prevention

practices precisely because they were also taking deworming drugs and thus (falsely) felt protected from


                                                                                                             37
re-infection. This does not seem to explain the lack of health education impacts, however, since there was

no evidence of behavioral change even among older girls who did not receive the medical treatment (due

to concerns about potential embryotoxicity, Table VIII, Panel B). The lack of basic knowledge about

worm infections in this area makes remote the possibility that older girls in treatment schools neglected to

adopt better worm prevention practices because they realized that they were benefiting from spillovers.

        Moreover, there is no evidence that other children benefiting from treatment spillovers changed

their prevention behavior: children attending comparison (Group 2) primary schools located near

deworming treatment schools in early 1999 showed large reductions in worm infection levels [Miguel and

Kremer, 2004] but they did not receive health education, and there was no significant change in their

worm prevention behaviors either (Table VIII, Panel C), although one limitation of this analysis is that

these cross-school effects are very imprecisely estimated.

        Although we cannot directly measure the depreciation of knowledge, other researchers find that

depreciation of health education knowledge and practices is often rapid even in settings where direct

short-run program impacts were positive (Aziz et al. [1990], Haggerty et al. [1994], Hoque et al. [1996]).



                                      VII. The Impact of Commitment

Advocates of the sustainability approach in development argue that projects should only be implemented

if there is local “ownership”, often conveyed by beneficiaries making an affirmative commitment to the

project. In the project we study, for instance, treatment took place only after the community collectively

decided to participate during a village meeting.

        The notion of ownership also relates to the claim in social psychology that asking individuals

whether they plan to take an action will make it more likely that they go through with it. A number of

studies suggest that individuals can be motivated to take socially beneficial, but individually costly,

actions by being asked whether they intend to perform them. Most people answer that they do and many

then feel motivated to follow through with their commitment. For example, Cioffi and Garner [1998] find

large impacts of such commitments on blood donation on a U.S. university campus. (Greenwald et al.


                                                                                                           38
[1987] find such effects for voting behavior among university students in the United States, but in recent

work Smith et al. [2003] fail to reproduce this finding using a much larger and more representative

sample of U.S. voters.)

        In an application of this technique, a random subsample of pupils in PSDP schools were asked

whether they would take deworming drugs in the upcoming treatment round, in an attempt to boost drug

take-up without providing additional external subsidies. During 2001 Pupil Questionnaire administration,

a random subsample of pupils were asked whether they were planning to come to school on the treatment

day and whether the PSDP workers should bring pills for them on that day: 98% of children answered

“Yes” to both questions. All pupils interviewed – including both those offered the opportunity for verbal

commitment and those not offered this opportunity – were provided the same information on the effects

of deworming and the upcoming date of medical treatment. (All respondents were, of course, also

informed that participation in data collection and treatment was voluntary.)

        The verbal commitment intervention failed, reducing drug take-up by one percentage point in

2001, although this effect is not statistically significant (Table IX, regression 1). This result is robust to

controls for pupil age and gender (regression 2), and the impact of the intervention did not vary

significantly with child characteristics (regression 3). The effect is somewhat more negative for pupils in

cost-sharing schools and those with moderate-heavy worm infections, although in neither case are the

estimates on these interactions significantly different than zero (results not shown).

        These results underscore the need for further research clarifying when and where marketing

techniques based on prior commitments have an impact.



                                               VIII. Conclusion

A program which provided free deworming drugs for primary school students led to high drug take-up,

large reductions in moderate-heavy worm infections, and increased school participation, all at low cost.

Most of the deworming program benefit was in the form of externalities due to reduced disease




                                                                                                                 39
transmission [Miguel and Kremer, 2004]. Yet mass deworming treatment programs like the one we study

are rare, and one in four people worldwide still suffer from these easily treated infections.

     One reason for this failure is that rather than allocating funding on the basis of a standard public

finance analysis, development agencies often prefer to fund “sustainable” interventions that do not require

continued external funding. We examine several “sustainable” approaches to worm control in this paper,

including cost-recovery from beneficiaries, health education, and individual mobilization and find all

were ineffective at combating worms relative to the provision of free deworming drugs. The fact that drug

take-up fell as more individuals were exposed to deworming through their social network is consistent

with the idea that private valuation is low and casts doubt on the notion that a temporary intervention

could lead to a sustainable long-run increase in deworming take-up through a process of social learning in

this context. The analysis suggests people learned about the private benefits of deworming but provides

no evidence for large pure imitation effects. Our model suggest that in the absence of such effects,

expending temporary subsidies beyond a small number of people will not affect long-run take-up.

        Taken together, these findings suggest that continued subsidies may be needed to control diseases

characterized by large positive treatment externalities, like worms. In Africa, where half the disease

burden is associated with infectious and parasitic diseases [WHO, 1999], this means extensive and

indefinite health care subsidies may be needed to adequately address public health problems.

        A broader lesson of this paper is that it may be difficult for external interventions to promote

sustainable voluntary local public good provision. If local public goods are to be provided, they will

likely have to be paid for by tax revenue collected either by local governments, national governments, or

by external donors. Standard theories of fiscal federalism suggest local governments might be best suited

to this task, but in Kenya as in many other developing countries, there are no locally elected bodies with

taxation powers or control over revenue, perhaps because this could threaten central government primacy

by creating rival power centers. National governments in Africa have not historically supplied deworming

and have a poor record on local public goods provision. Donors have sometimes provided local public




                                                                                                            40
goods, but typically not on a long-term basis. Rather they often structure projects so as to be able to claim

they are sustainable.

        Donors may simply choose not to provide local public goods under these circumstances, or they

may choose to provide them on an ongoing long-run basis, but there is little economic rationale for

pursuing the illusion of sustainability. Even if donors wish to fund investment activities rather than

consumption, there is little reason why they should seek projects that are sustainable on a project-by-

project basis rather than taking a broader view of what constitutes a good investment. For instance, a

public health project providing subsidized deworming may not be financially sustainable by itself in the

short-run – in the sense that communities will not voluntarily provide it – but it will help children obtain

more education and this can contribute to long-run development for society as a whole. If donors are

concerned that projects such as roads or wells will go awry without regular maintenance, they could

endow funds earmarked for this purpose rather than counting on potentially illusory voluntary local

contributions for maintenance.

        Why then do aid agencies place so much emphasis on financial sustainability?

        We believe that rather than reflecting an economic social welfare calculation on behalf of

optimizing donors, this reflects the politics of aid and principal-agent problems between aid agencies and

their ultimate funders in wealthy countries, who are generally ill-informed about conditions in countries

receiving aid. Aid agencies competing for limited donor funds have incentives to make bold claims about

what their programs can achieve. In the short-run, these claims may be useful fundraising tools if the

ultimate funders find it impossible to distinguish between, say, genuine claims regarding the temporary

health benefits of providing free deworming medicine (as in the project we study) versus overstated

claims about the permanent benefits of a one-time worm prevention health education intervention.

Individual claims about spectacular project “bang for the buck” typically remain unchallenged since aid

agencies are not directly accountable to their programs’ beneficiaries through either political mechanisms

(e.g., democratic elections) or through the market mechanism, and rigorous development program

evaluations remain rare.


                                                                                                           41
         In the longer-term, of course, pursuing sustainability leads to failed projects, disillusionment

among donors, and the search for the next development panacea. Rather than pursue the illusion of

sustainability, development organizations and developing country governments would be better off

rigorously evaluating their projects, ultimately identifying a limited number with high social returns, and

funding these interventions on an ongoing basis.

Notes: Data from 2001 Parent Survey, and 1999 and 2001 administrative records. Probit estimation, robust standard
errors in parentheses. Disturbance terms are clustered within schools. Significantly different than zero at 99 (***),
95 (**), and 90 (*) percent confidence. Parent social links controls include total number of parent links, number of
parent links to Group 1, 2, 3 schools (not own school), and number of parent links to non-program schools. Other
household controls include respondent years of education, community group member indicator variable, total
number of children, iron roof at home indicator variable, and distance from home to school in km, as well as the
Group 2 indicator and Cost-sharing school indicator.

Ethnic controls include indicators for Luhya-Samia, Luhya-Nyala, Luo, Luhya-Khayo, Luhya-Marachi, and Teso
groups, and an indicator for being a member of the largest ethnic group in the school (which is near zero and
statistically insignificant). Religion controls include indicators for Catholic, Anglican, Pentecostal, Apostolic, Legio
Mario, Roho, and Muslim faiths, and an indicator for being a member of the largest religious group in the school
(which is negative and marginally statistically significant). In regression 2, no household controls are included as
explanatory variables other than the standard social link controls from Table IV.

1. Refer to the Oxfam website for the details (http://www.oxfam.org.uk/about_us/history/history2.htm).

2. Sustainability has other meanings, including an environmental meaning, but we focus on financial sustainability.

3. Lengeler [1999] reaches similar conclusions.

4. Refer to Adams et al. [1994], Corbett et al. [1992], Hotez and Pritchard [1995], and Pollitt [1990].

5. The project followed the standard practice at the time in mass deworming programs of not treating girls of
reproductive age – typically aged 13 years and older in practice – due to concern about the possibility that
albendazole could cause birth defects [WHO, 1992; Cowden and Hotez, 2000]. The WHO recently called for this
policy to be changed based on an accumulating record of safe usage by pregnant women (see Savioli et al. [2003]).

6. This figure is based on an estimate that each health education teacher taught two full hours on worm prevention
behaviors in each grade per school year (given an annual teacher salary and benefits of approximately US$2,000),
and that the NGO team also provided two hours of health education per school per year.

7. Kenyan per capita income was US$340 [World Bank, 1999], and incomes may be even lower in Busia.

8. Geissler studies an ethnically Luo population (Luos speak a Nilotic language). The majority of our sample are
ethnically Luhya (a Bantu-speaking group) though Luos are four percent of our sample. However, traditional
Luo,views are closely related to views found among other African groups [Green et al., 1994; Green, 1997].




                                                                                                                   46
9. The effect of other people’s treatment choices on the magnitude of private treatment benefits is unclear a priori.
As a benchmark, if helminth reinfection rates are independent of own current worm load, and if the health burden of
infection is linear in own worm load, the private health benefits of treatment are independent of others’ choices. If,
instead, the health costs of infection are convex in worm load, deworming benefits will be greater in an environment
that is expected to have high exposure to worms in the future. Thus the net private benefits of treatment will be
lower if others are treated. The opposite holds with concavity. Miguel and Kremer [2004] estimate average
deworming treatment spillovers and find that they are roughly linear in local treatment rates, but due to data
limitations have little power to detect nonlinear higher order terms. Here we assume the benchmark linear case.

10. As observed by Watts and Strogatz [1998], the addition of even a few links to a sparsely connected network
greatly reduces the average path length between any two nodes, so in general information will propagate more
quickly in more densely connected networks than in the simple tree we consider.

11. Note that infection status will in general be a function of the entire treatment history of the network. In the
steady state, however, the equilibrium takeup rate λ* is a sufficient statistic for the entire history since the take-up
rate is the same in every period.

12. We conjecture that even in the presence of peer effects, if social connections are in a tree network structure as
modeled here, then subsidizing a small group of tightly socially linked people may be sufficient to ensure adoption
and further diffusion of the technology, unless private returns are low enough and peer effects strong enough that
people will not adopt unless a majority of contacts adopt. This is because subsidizing a small group of
interconnected people will be sufficient to ensure adoption within this group, and once learning takes place within
the group, adoption can then spread outwards to others.

13. Of course, additional subsidies may be justified if there is learning by doing in production. Here we examine the
extent to which social learning by consumers generates a case for subsidies.

14. Survey refusal rates were low, as is typical for this region. 13% of households were dropped due to either
missing network information, treatment information, household characteristics, or difficulty matching across the
2001 surveys and earlier PSDP datasets.

15. Treatment within a family is highly correlated, as expected, so we use the household as the unit of analysis.

16. The experiences and choices of people in social links’ communities may theoretically affect respondent take-up
[Munshi, 2004]. For each early treatment school, we computed the average difference in 1999 school participation
between treated and untreated pupils and use this to classify schools into “large treated minus untreated difference”
schools (those above the median difference) versus small difference schools. The treated minus untreated difference
captures the average observed private benefit to deworming in that school. However, the effect of links to early
treatment schools in large difference schools is not significantly different than the effect in small difference schools.
Similarly, links to early treatment schools with low take-up do have a somewhat more negative effect on respondent
treatment rates than links to schools with high take-up, but the difference is not significant (not shown). However,
omitted variable bias concerns and limited statistical power mean these results should be interpreted cautiously.

17. Given the correlation of information among individuals in the same school, it is theoretically possible that the
first signal in a particular school would be more influential than subsequent signals. We estimated these effects in
our data, but due to limited statistical power cannot reject the hypothesis that the first, second, and third links to a
particular early treatment school all have the same impact on take-up (regressions not shown).

18. A finding that casts some doubt on the “first impressions matter” explanation, however, is the fact that links to
Group 1 schools (phased in during 1998) have nearly identical impacts as links to Group 2 schools (phased in during
1999, estimates not shown). Note that the persistent effects of early treatment links on take-up might be reconciled
with Bayesian learning, though, if individuals believed there was an important school-year specific random
component to treatment effects, leading them to place extra weight on outcomes in schools other than their own.




                                                                                                                           47
19. The results are also robust to a specification without socioeconomic controls (Appendix Table A.I, regression 2),
and to the inclusion of additional ethnic and religious controls, and indicators for whether the respondent is a
member of the dominant local ethnic and religious group (regression 3); none of the six ethnic group indicator
variables is significantly related to take-up. The results are similar when the local density of early treatment school
pupils (located within 3 km of the respondent’s school), and the density of all local primary school pupils, are
included as controls (regression 4). However, the point estimate on early links falls by more than a third and loses
statistical significance, possibly because the local density of early treatment schools picks up part of the effect of
interactions with other individuals not named in the social links roster. An F-test indicates that the early treatment
social links and local density of early treatment pupils terms are jointly significant at 99% confidence.

20. Using another definition of link strength yields similar results. While most links were provided in response to
questions about the individuals with whom the respondent speaks most frequently, others were provided in response
to prompts about contacts in particular local schools. There is not a statistically significant difference in the effects
of “unprompted” and “prompted” links (in fact, prompted links are somewhat more influential—not shown).

21. Refer to the working paper version [Miguel and Kremer, 2003] for further discussion of child social effects.

22. The 2001 worm infection results are for a subsample of only 745 children who were randomly sampled for stool
collection and were present in school on the day of the parasitological survey. Due to the relatively small sample
size, we do not focus on the parasitological data in the main empirical analysis.

23. A fourth option, “effective, but the worms come back” was rarely chosen by respondents.

24. The ten symptoms (row 7) include fatigue, anemia, weight loss, stunted growth, stomach ache, bloated stomach,
blood in stool, worms in stool, diarrhea, and fever. Parents were asked: “Could you name the symptoms of worm
and schistosomiasis infections?” and their unprompted responses were recorded by the enumerator.

25. We focus on the following range of parameter values for the model: b =0, b =2,       σ 02 =1, σ ε2 =1 to 10, C=0.1 to
2, φ=0.75, τ=6, annual discount rate δ=0.9 to 1, and p=0.05 to 0.2. In the simulation, we assume that all students
within a school receive separate signals and exchange information. However, to compensate for making this
extreme assumption, we also assume there are only a maximum of 50 possible signals that can be received per
school with full take-up; with more signals per school, convergence is even faster. Given b and b , varying C
between 0.1 and 2 covers all of the relevant cases. Similarly, fixing   σ 02 , choosing various values for σ ε2   covers all
of the interesting cases, since only their relative magnitudes influence weight placed on signals versus prior beliefs.
The simulation code and complete results are available from the authors upon request.

26. Gertler and Molyneaux [1996] find that utilization of medical care is highly sensitive to price in an experimental
study in Indonesia, but since the unit of randomization in their analysis is the district, and their intervention affected
only eleven districts, statistical power is relatively low. In a large-scale experimental study, Manning et al. [1987]
find in contrast that the price elasticity of demand for medical services in the United States is a modest –0.2.

27. Results are unchanged if Group 1 households are included in the analysis (results not shown). They are excluded
here since they lack the social networks data that we use as explanatory variables here and in Section 4 above.

28. This also holds controlling for initial 1998 cleanliness or using differences-in-differences (regressions not
shown).

links to program schools (other than their own), hence the reduced sample since the denominator is zero in that case.

are clustered within schools. Significantly different than zero at 99 (***), 95 (**), and 90 (*) percent confidence. The socioeconomic controls include
Respondent years of education, Community group member, Total number of children, Iron roof at home, and Distance from home to school (but when any of
these is the dependent variable, it is not included as an explanatory variable). The other social link controls include # Parent links with children not in Group 1, 2,

Notes: Data from 2001 Parent Survey, and 2001 administrative records. Marginal probit coefficient estimates are
presented. Robust standard errors in parentheses. Disturbance terms are clustered within schools. Significantly
different than zero at 99 (***), 95 (**), and 90 (*) percent confidence. Social links controls include total number of
parent links, number of parent links to Group 1, 2, 3 schools (not own school), and number of links parent to non-
program schools. Other controls include respondent years of education, community group member indicator
variable, total number of children, iron roof at home indicator variable, and distance from home to school in km, as
well as the Group 2 indicator and Cost-sharing school indicator. Regression 1 presents results from Round 1 and
Round 2 of the 2001 Parent Survey, and regressions 2 and 3 present results from Round 2 alone, since only Round 2
has detailed information regarding deworming treatment impacts on social links. In regression 3, we can reject that
the coefficient estimates on (# Links with children in early treatment schools whose children received deworming
and had good effects) and on (# Links with children in early treatment schools whose children received deworming
and had side effects) are equal at 90% confidence (p-value=0.092).

Notes: Data from 2001 Parent Survey, and 2001 administrative records. Marginal probit coefficient estimates are
presented, and each entry is the result of a separate regression. Robust standard errors in parentheses. Disturbance
terms are clustered within schools. Significantly different than zero at 99 (***), 95 (**), and 90 (*) percent
confidence. Social links controls and other controls are included in all specifications. Social links controls include
total number of parent links, number of parent links to Group 1, 2, 3 schools (not own school), and number of parent
links to non-program schools. Other controls include respondent years of education, community group member
indicator variable, total number of children, iron roof at home indicator variable, and distance from home to school
in km, as well as the Group 2 indicator and Cost-sharing school indicator. The number of observations (parents)
across regressions ranges from 1656 to 1678 depending on the extent of missing data for the dependent variable.

The ten possible infection symptoms (row 7) include fatigue, anemia, weight loss, stunted growth, stomach ache,
bloated stomach, blood in stool, worms in stool, diarrhea, and fever. Parents were asked: “Could you name the
symptoms of worm and schistosomiasis infections?”, and their responses were recorded by the enumerator.

Notes: These results use the data from Miguel and Kremer (2004). These are averages of individual-level data for grade 3-8 pupils; disturbance terms are
clustered within schools. Robust standard errors in parentheses. Significantly different than zero at 99 (***), 95 (**), and 90 (*) percent confidence.

The effects in Panel C are the result of a regression in which the dependent variable is the change in the health behavior between 1998 and 1999 (school average),
and the local density of Group 1 pupils within 3 km (per 1000 pupils), Group 1 pupils within 3-6 km (per 1000 pupils), Total pupils within 3 km (per 1000
pupils) and Total pupils within 3-6 km (per 1000 pupils) are the key explanatory variables. Grade indicators, school assistance controls (for other NGO
programs), and the average school district mock exam score are additional explanatory variables (as in Miguel and Kremer 2004).

Notes: Data from 2001 Parent and Pupil Surveys, and administrative records. Marginal probit coefficient estimates are presented, robust standard errors in
parentheses. Disturbance terms are clustered within schools. Significantly different than zero at 99 (***), 95 (**), and 90 (*) percent confidence. Social links
controls are described in Miguel and Kremer (2003). Other controls include respondent years of education, community group member indicator variable, total
number of children, iron roof at home indicator variable, and distance from home to school in km, as well as the Group 2 and Cost-sharing school indicators.
Summary statistics from the 2001 Pupil Questionnaire (Mean [s.d.]): Pupil age (12.9 [2.3]), Pupil female indicator (0.23 [0.42]) (older girls were dropped from
the sample because they were not eligible for deworming, due to the potential embryotoxicity of the drugs).
