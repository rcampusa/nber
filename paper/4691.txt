                                         ABSTRACT


       Investment in production outside the United States is a method by which U.S. finns raise

their shares in foreign markets and defend them against foreign rivals from the host countries and

from other countries. The investing firms are exploiting their firm-specific assets such as

proprietary technologies, patents, or skills in advertising or marketing, and the opportunity to

produce abroad raises the value of these assets and encourages firms' investment in them by

extending the range of markets and the length of time over which they can be exploited.

       Overseas production has contributed to the ability of American multinationals to retain

world market shares in the face of the long-term decline in the share of the U.S. as a country and

short-term changes such as exchange rate fluctuations. It has performed the same functions for

Swedish firms and, more recently, for Japanese firms.

       Within U.S. multinationals, those with higher shares of their production overseas have

higher employment at home relative to home production. Foreign production appears to require

larger numbers of employees in headquarters activities such as R&D and supervision.

      Any judgjeent about the wisdom of tax changes that raise or lower the

profitability of American firms' foreign operations, must involve some

judgment as to the desirability of increasing or decreasing the extent of

these operations. The purpose of this paper is to review past research on the

effects of U.S. firms' overseas activities on the U.S. economy and to report

some further analysis with more recent data.

      The first question to be answered is what we mean by the U.S. economy.

The ambiguity of the term troubles appraisals of many policies. One way of

looking at it is to ask whether the object is to maximize Cross National

Product or Cross Domestic Product. The former is an ownership-based concept

that includes the profits from overseas operations of U.S. firms and other

income earned overseas by U.S. residents, but excludes profits earned in the

United States by foreign residents. The latter is a geographically-based

concept that covers production that takes place in the United States,

regardless of ownership. It thus excludes profits and other income earned

overseas (from overseas production), but includes all income earned in the

U.S. (from production in the U.S.) by both U.S. and foreign residents. One

way in which the distinction surfaces in policy discussions is over whether

various types of assistance or preferences are to be applied to U.S. -

controlled   firms, regardless of where they operate, or to firms producing in

the U.S., whether domestically' or foreign-owned.
                                      -2-
      I will try to construe the issue broadly. That means I will consider

effects of outward foreign direct investment on the labor employed in the U.S.

by the investing companies and also those on the companies themselves,

including their stockholders, and more generally on the trade and other

aspects of the U.S. economy.

      Various studies of the behavior of multinational firms, including some

of my own, view the firms as facing fixed or relatively fixed, worldwide

markets for their products and making decisions mainly about how to supply

that demand most profitably. The firm is pictured as choosing whether to

supply the demand by exporting from the U.S., by producing abroad, or by

licensing technology, patents, or other assets owned by the firm to foreign

licensees who would produce outside the United States.

      The assumption of a fixed market for a firm tends to bias conclusions

toward finding that foreign production by U.S. firms substitutes for

production in the United States. An alternative view is that production

abroad is often mainly a way of enlarging a fin's share of foreign markets,

or of preventing or slowing a decline in that share. The inadequacy of the

fixed market assumption is obvious in any attempt to examine the impact of

direct investment in service industries, since the nature of most of these

industries precludes substantial exporting trot one country to another and

market share is almost completely contingent on production at the site of

consumption. While this is most obvious for service industries, it applies

equally to the service component of manufacturing industries, a major part of

the final value of sales of manufactured products.

The Growth of Internationalized Production

        The establishment of foreign operations by American firms, and the

establishment by any country's firms of production, including sales and

service activities, outside the home country, is often referred to as the

internationalization of production. In order to understand the process, and

the reasons behind it, it is useful to ask whether it is uniquely or mainly an

American   phenomenon or is, under   some circumstances common to foreign firms as

well.

        The studies of Cleona Lewis (1938) and Mira Wilkins   (1989) on foreign

investment in the United States make it clear that direct investment and

internationalized production were not an American invention. When the United

States lagged technologically in many fields, foreign fins found it

profitable to develop marketing and production facilities in the United States

to exploit their superior sophistication. The industrial distributions of

these operations from different countries clearly reflected some specific

technological advantages, such as those of Great Britain in various aspects of

the textile industry and of Germany in chemicals.

        What has been unique about the United States is that direct investment

has been the characteristic form of U.S. foreign investment as far back as

data exist, even when the U.S. was still, on balance, importing capital

(Lipsey, 1988). That fact, and the lists of early U.S. investors (Lewis,

1938, Southard, 1931, Wilkins, 1970), concentrated among the leading firms in

various U.S. industries, emphasize the association of direct foreign

investment not with large aggregate supplies of financial or physical capital

but with the possession of firm-specific assets, knowledge and techniques,

sometimes reflected in patents or brand names, that are mobile within firms,
                                     -4-
even across national borders, but not among firms.

      Not only was direct investment the dominant form of U.S. outward

investment, but the U.S. was the dominant source of the world's direct

investment for a long period. The U.S. share of the world's stock of outward

direct investment was over half around 1970, with the U.K., the next most

important investor, far behind the U.S. at about 15-17 per cent and no other

single country the source of more than 6 per cent. The share of the developed

countries outward direct investment flows originating in the U.S. was well

over half in the l960s and still over 40 per cent in the 1970s. In the late

1980s, however, less than 20 per cent of the world's outward flows originated

in the U.S. and, in a reversal of roles1 the U.S. absorbed over 40 per cent of

the flows from other countries (Lipsey, 1993). In the early l990s, Japan's

role as a source of direct investment flows and the U.S. role as a recipient

both declined sharply. In 1992, the U.S. was again the largest supplier, at

about a quarter of the OECD total, and was not a significant net recipient.

withdrawals and losses equaling or exceeding gross inflows (OECD, 1993, Table I).

      The heyday of outward U.S. direct investment outflows, in the 1960s and

at least part of the l910s, involved a considerable internationalization of

U.S. firms' production, in the sense that higher and higher proportions of the

production they controlled took place abroad, larger proportions of their

employees were outside the United States1 and larger shares of their assets

came to be located abroad. Since then, however, the degree of

internationalization of U.S. companies has stabilized or declined, as if the

firms had overshot some desirable level and found it desirable to retreat

somewhat.

      The peak in the extent of internationalization in this sense for the
                                     .5-
U.S. economy as a whole was reached at some time in the late l9lOs (we cannot

date it more closely because comprehensive data exist only for occasional

foreign investment census years). For example, employment in all overseas

affiliates of U.S. firms was almost 11 per cent of total U.S. non-agricultural

employment in 1977, but only 7 1/2 per cent in 1989. Plant and equipment

expenditures by majority-owned foreign affiliates were over 15 per cent of

domestic U.S. plant and equipment expenditures in U.S. dollars in 1974-76 but

fell below 10 per cent from 1984 to 1988 and have not recovered their earlier

levels. Since the exchange value of the U.S. dollar was low in the late

l980s, the decline in real terms was even larger.

      U.S. manufacturing firms have long been much more internationalized than

firms in other industries, with their overseas employment reaching about a

quarter of domestic manufacturing employment in 1977 (from only 10 per cent in

1957) and then declining only slightlyto about 22 per cent in the late 1980s.

Overseas plant and equipment expenditures in manufacturing reached over 20 per

cent of domestic expenditure in dollar terms for a few years in the 1970s. It

fell almost to 10 per cent when the exchange value of the dollar was near its

peak, and then recovered, but so far not to earlier peak levels.

      Within those U.S. firms that are multinational, the changes have not

been so sharp, partly because of the importance of manufacturing firms in the

universe of multinationals. However, the time pattern has been similar since

1977 (there is little parent information available before that).

      Within manufacturing multinationals, foreign affiliate net sales, a

crude measure of production, were larger in the late l980s relative to parent

sales than in 1977 and affiliate employment was close to the earlier levels

relative to parent employment. Thus, this group of fi±ms has not exhibited
                                         -6-
 the shift away from internationalized production that has characterized u.s.

 multinationals in general or the U.S. manufacturing sector as a whole. The

 affiliate share of production may even have increased (though it is too

 volatile to provide a quick judgment that there is an upward trend), and the

 affiliate share of employment has not changed much since 1917.

       The strongest case for increased internationalization in U.S.

manufacturing is in exports. Affiliates accounted for less than a third of

U.S. multinationals' worldwide exports in 1966, but for more than half in the

second half of the l980s. Their importance relative to total manufactured

exports from the U.S. also more than doubled over this period.

      The contrast between the changes in internationalization within U.S.

parents and those for the U.S. economy as a whole reflects the declining role

of multinational parents within the U.S. economy. Parent employment in the

U.S. fell from 28 per cent of U.S.
                                      non-agricultural employment in 1977 to
barely over 20 per cent in the late l98Os, not because employment was moved

overseas, where affiliate employment was also declining, but because these

multinationals were declining in importance as part of the U.S. economy. This

decline was not simply a reflection of the decline of manufacturing's share of

U.S. employment, but took place within manufacturing as well, where

manufacturing parent firms' share of total domestic
                                                      manufacturing employment
fell from over 60 per cent in 1977 to a little over 50 per cent in 1988-90.

Thus, the shrinking of many large, established U.S. manufacturing firms

affected both their domestic and their
                                         foreign employment. The many anecdotes
about the shifting of domestic employment abroad do not seem to add up to much

in the aggregate,
                    especially for the U.S. economy as a whole.

      There is one reason why it is as yet difficult to judge whether the
                                     -7-
apparent retreat of U.S. firms from foreign operations during the 1980s is a

long term trend. The enormous shift in direct investment toward the United

States by foreign firms, to the point where the U.S. absorbed an unprecedented

share of the rest of the world's outflow of direct investment, suggests that

the United States was an exceptionally attractive location for investment

during this period. If that was the case, it might have been particularly

attractive, relative to locations in other countries, to American firms as

well, as to foreign fins, and that attractiveness would show up as a retreat

from internationalization for U.S. firms while it tended to increase the

degree of internationalization of foreign firms.

      One reason for this apparent retreat of American firms from overseas

activity may have been the growth of efficient and aggressive foreign

competitors. The levels of internationalization of the German and Japanese

economies were much lower than that of the United States in the 1970s. Since

then, the internationalization pioneered on a large scale by American firms,

has been copied by European and Japanese firms, and now even by firms from

developing countries.

      How widespread is internationalized production in the sense of firms

producing outside their home countries? And is it expanding in the world

economy as a whole? Two opposite influences are at work. Internationali-

zation is most prevalent in manufacturing and least common in services. The

rising powers in manufacturing, such as Japan and some of the developing

countries of Southeast Asia, are increasing the degree to which their

companies carry out their manufacturing outside the home countries. At the

same time, the share of manufacturing in most of the world's economies is

declining, and that of services is increasing. The net result of these two
                                        -8-
 forces, and of the opposite directions of changes in the U.S. and in other

 countries, is that the share of internationalized production in world
                                                                          output,
 after increasing greatly in the twenty years after 195?, perhaps    tripling, has
 grown little since then. The share of Japanese, Cerman, and Swedish firms'

 internationalized production has been rising, but that rise has been offset by

 the fall in the much larger U.S. share. Internationalized
                                                              production by firms

 from other countries has almost certainly been rising, but is    starting from
 too low a level to have much impact on the total. The share of such

 production in worldwide CDP may have been in the range of 10-15 per cent in

 1990. The U.S. companies accounted for half or more of this total, and if the

 rise from the recent low point in 1988 continues, the world will again be

moving toward a growing importance of internationalized production.

      A less equivocal story can be told about the share of production outside

home countries in world trade in manufactured goods. That share is clearly

over 10 per cent and seems to have risen even since 1977, mainly because of

the growth of Japanese affiliate exports, but also because U.S. affiliates

have held on to or even increased their shares
                                                   since 1977. Thus, world trade
in manufactures, if not
                          necessarily aggregate world production or employment,
is increasingly made up of exports from internationalized production.

      What can we conclude from these trends in the extent of internationa-

lized production? The practice of
                                    producing outside the home country is well

entrenched, especially in manufacturing, not only for U.S. -based companies

but, increasingly, for fins based in other countries. It is increasingly

common for firms in at least the more successful
                                                    developing countries, such as
Korea and Taiwan. Presuniably it is an avenue for increasing profitability,

Probably through increasing market shares that provide economies of scale in
                                       -9-
the exploitation of the firm's assets, such as patents, other technological

assets, reputation, and more generally, skills in production and marketing.

Overseas Production and Exoort Market Shares in Manufacturinc

      The share of the United States, as a country, in world export markets

for manufactured goods has been declining over most of the last     quarter

century. In 1990, after some recovery from the low point in 1987 resulting

partly from the earlier period of high exchange values for the dollar, the

share was about 12 per cent, 30 per cent below the share in 1966. U.s.

 multinational   firms, exporting from the U.S. and from their overseas

 production, held on to their shares much more successfully. gy 1985, when the

 U.S. had already lost more than 20 per cent of its share of twenty years

 earlier, U.S. multinationals had increased their share of world exports.

They then lost some of that share in the next two years, but ended up in 1990

with a share only 9 per cent below that of 1966.      How was this relative

stability of shares achieved? Performance was very different for the parent

fins, exporting from the United States, and the affiliates, exporting from

other countries.

      Until at least 1985, the parent firms lost less of their world export

shares than did non.multinationaj U.S.

sharply, more rapidly than that of other U.S. firms. In the meantime, more

and more of the multinationals' exports were supplied by their overseas

affiliates, more than half since 1986, and at a record high proportion in

1990. Thus one way the U.S. multinationals kept their export markets, as the

U.S. lost competitiveness in their industries, was by supplying these markets

increasingly from overseas operations, a strategy obviously not available to

non-multinational U.S. firms. (The affiliate shares included in this

calculation are only shares of export trade and exclude the much more

important affiliate sales in their host country markets).

      This rise in the importance of exporting from foreign affiliates was not

 unique to the United States. Even in Japan, an extremely successful exporter

 from home-country production, exports by overseas affiliates rose from 8 per

cent of exports from Japan in 1974 to 14 per cent or more in 1986-89. Japan's

share of world manufactured exports reached a peak in 1986, shortly after the

high point in the exchange value of the dollar, and then declined from 1986 to

manufacturing affiliates in their firms' total exports grew from 1986 to 1988

markets for firms under adverse conditions for parent exporting.

      Sweden underwent large losses in trade shares similar to those of the

United States, although not quite as large. Swedish multinational firms, over

the same period, increased their shares, although the increase was all

concentrated in 1965 to 1970. This increase or stability in the

multinationals' shares was accompanied by, or possibly accomplished by,

      These three countries are the only ones that collect fairly

comprehensive information on the trade of their multinationals' overseas

affiliates. The data suggest that one major role for overseas production has

been that of retaining market shares when home country economic conditions and

exchange rate changes made the home countries less suitable locations for

export production.

      An alternative interpretation of the data1 discussed below, might be

that it was the growth of affiliate production and exports that caused the

reduction in home-country exports. However, home country shares can be

explained to a large extent by home-country price and exchange-rate

movements, not a likely path for influences stemming from decisions to produce

abroad.

Does Foreiwn Production Substitute for Home-Country ExDorts?

      Most antagonism against foreign direct investment has historically been

toward inward investment, on the ground that it displaced home-country firms

in home markets. However, there has also been opposition to outward

investment, often led by labor organizations, on the ground that outward

investment "exported jobs," partly by producing products to be imported to the

home-country market but mostly by replacing home-country exports by overseas

production. In the United States, the campaign against outward direct

investment reached a peak with the effort to pass the Eurke-Hartke bill in the

l960s, the Voluntary Program of Capital Restraints from 1965 through 1967, and

then with the compulsory OFDI regulations. These came into effect in 1968 as

an effort to "improve" the U.S. balance of payments, and were specifically

directed against the outflow of capital for foreign direct investment. The

government restrictions were ceilings on the export of funds for foreign
                                       - 16   -



 direct   investment, particularly to Western Europe, but were not aimed at the

 expansion of U.S. firms' foreign operations if the expansion was financed from

 foreign sources (Fiero, 1969). With the defeat of Burke-Hartice and the demise

 of the OFtI in 1974, the campaign has faded, although the Afl-CIO continues to

 take a din view of outward investment in its annual statements on economic

policy.

       Attempts to measure the effects of overseas production on home-country

exports face the problem of defining substitution and of defining a believable

counterfactual case. Exports from Japan's recently established or recently

enlarged operations in Southeast Asia may "replace" exports that formerly came

from Japan, but few would claim, after the rise in the exchange value of the

Yen, that they are replacing exports that could now be made from Japan. A

cross-section analysis does not necessarily escape the problem; it may be Just

those more labor-intensive industries that could no longer export from the

home country that establish production abroad.

      A tong line of studies has attempted to find evidence of a relationship

between overseas production and home-country exports. One of the earliest

U.S. studies, by Gary Hufbauer and F.M. Adler (1968), identified the crucial

importance of the assumptions used to the interpretation of any relationships

found, and a similar wide range of possible effects was reported in a major

U.S. Tariff cormsission (1973) study a few years later. The Reddaway reports

(1967) and (1968) explicitly assumed that in the absence of British foreign

affiliates, their markets would have been supplied not by British exports but

by local or other foreign suppliers.

      The preponderance of evidence from empirical studies points to either no

effect, or a positive effect, of overseas production in a host-country market
                                     - 17 -
on home-country exports to that market. Lipsey and Weiss (1981), in a cross-

section analysis examining exports in 14 manufacturing industries by the U.S.

and by 13 other developed countries, to many destinations, found that the

level of production by U.S. -owned affiliates in a country was positively

related to U.S. exports in that industry to that country and, in some markets,

negatively related to exports by other developed countries. On the other

hand, the presence of affiliates frost countries other than the U.S. was

positively related to those countries' exports to that host country and, where

there was any significant relationship, negatively related to U.S. exports to

the country. iii other words, the presence of, and production by. a home

country's affiliates in a host country tended to attract exports from that

home country and to discourage exports to that host country from other

countries. Thus the main substitution that seemed to take place was of

country A's host country production in country C for country B's exports to

country C, and of country B's host-country production in country C for country

A's exports to country C.   In these calculations, the variables for U.S. -owned

and foreign-owned affiliate activity were superimposed on a set of standard

gravity equations including host-country income or aggregate imports, distance

from hone to host country, and trade bloc membership. The estimated trade

position in the absence of direct investment is represented by the value of

exports when the home-country affiliate activity variable is set at zero while

the other variables, including foreign country affiliate variables, are at

their actual levels. Since the dependent variables in these equations are

total U.S. and other country exports, rather than the exports by parents, they

take account of any displacements of one firm's exports to a country by the

production in that country by affiliates of another firm from the same home

 country.
       Each dollar of overseas affiliate production
                                                          by U.S. affiliates in these
 cross-section equations added, on' average across the
                                                            statistically significant
 coefficients, about $.].6 to U.S. exports. Most of the coefficients were below

 $.20. The coefficients for displacements of other
                                                          countries' exports were not
 so consistently significant and varied widely, but whenever coefficients for

 both U.S. and other countries' exports were
                                                   significant, the displacement of
 other countries' exports was larger than the addition to 11.5. exports. That

 is a reasonable result since the addition to U.S. exports to a host country is

 the net balance of positive and negative effects of U.S. -owned production

 there, while the effect on other countries exports to that host country are

 generally only negative, with no offsetting gains. One
                                                              exception   to this
negative relation to foreign countries'
                                           exports would be the case in which the
U.S. parent has affiliates in the other countries that are potential suppliers

to the host country. Thus a U.S. -owned
                                           auto assembly plant in, say, the
Netherlands might give rise to exports of auto components from the same

company's German affiliate rather than, or in addition to, exports from the
parent in the U.S.

      If a U.S. -owned affiliate in
                                      one country exported to other countries, it
could displace U.S. exports to those countries without the offsetting effect

of exports of components and other
                                      inputs to the manufacturing process. That
displacement would be missed in the
                                      equations just described, and Lipsey and
Weiss (1984) therefore examined the effects of aggregate affiliate
                                                                   production
abroad on the total
                    exports to all destinations of the cross-section of parent
firms. The results were that
                              the displacement of U.S. exports to third
countries if it existed, was
                               not large enough to offset the positive effects
                                        - 19   -



on parent exports to host countries; that is, in each industry, firms that

produced mote abroad also exported more in the aggregate.

     It is natural, to think that exports by affiliates to third countries

would necessarily displace parent exports to them, but that is not necessarily

the case. A plane, truck, or car assembled or even produced completely by a

U.S. affiliate in country A and exported to country B could later give rise to

the export of parts, accessories, and related products from the U.S. to

country B.

      An examination of the same question for a later period (Blomatrom,

Lipsey, and   Kulchycky,   1988). using the direct investment census for 1982

(U.S. Department of Commerce, 1985) produced more ambiguous results. The

later study lacked the information on affiliates of non-U.S. firms that had

been part of the earlier study, but did include a distinction between

affiliate production for export and affiliate production for local sale in the

host country, and also included some equations for production by minority-

owned U.S. affiliates, not available earlier.

      When there was any statistically significant relation at all (a minority

of industries), affiliate export sales, or production for export from the

affiliate's host country, were consistently associated with higher U.S.

exports to that host country. That is to be expected, since substitution of

affiliate production for U.S. exports, if there was any, would take place

outside the host country, in the third country, and would be unobserved. For

sales within the host country, most coefficients were positive but there were

more negative (5 out of 30 industries) than positive coefficients among those

that were statistically significant at the S per cent level.

      When data for minority-owned affiliates in the host countries, including
                                        - 20   -


 those 50 per cent owned, were added to the U.S. export equations, these

 affiliate operations were found to be associated with higher levels of U.S.

 exports to the host countries. In addition, the inclusion of these

 affiliates' operations had a strong effect on the coefficients for production

 by majority-owned affiliates, moving many from showing negative effects      on

 U.S. exports to positive effects.

        The role of minority-owned affiliates is puzzling and we can only

 speculate on the explanation. One factor is that they are very unevenly

 distributed across countries, being, for example, almost the only form of

direct investment in Japan and quite important there. We have speculated that

minority ownership has this strong positive relationship to U.S.    exports
because it may be resorted to in countries or industries where    the U.S. parent
would   otherwise be barred from a market. These may be markets with more
stringent barriers to imports, or where barriers to imports are associated
with barriers to majority ownership of affiliates. Minority-owned affiliates
may, in such cases, be a price for market entry more often than in the case of

majority ownership.

        Swedenis the only country outside the United States for which
individual firm data are available that permit an analysis similar to    those
carried out for the U.S.   A series of Swedish outward direct   investment

surveys was carried out by the Industriens Utredningsinstitut (1131), of

Stockholm, and analyzed in Swedenborg (1973). (1.979),   (1982). and (1985), and,
for the 1986 survey, in Swedenborg,
                                      Johansson-Grahn, and Rtnnwall (1988).
They examined the effects of overseas
                                        production by Swedish firms on Swedish

parent exports. Because of the small number of Swedish parent firms, it was

net possible to run separate
                               equations for individual industries, particularly
                                      - 21   -


industries   as narrowly defined as in the U.S. studies. However, the Swedish

calculations included many firm characteristics that, in effect, incorporated

industry characteristics, and also separated companies based on Swedish

resource industries.

      The Swedish studies included an effort to solve the problem of the

possible simultaneity of direct investment production decisions and home-

country export decisions by a 2SLS approach in which the first stage estimated

the level of production by Swedish affiliates in each host country. The

second stage equation used the estimated production levels from the first

stage, among other variables, in the explanation of parent exports, to each

host country. These equations were applied to each of the survey years and in

a pooled time series-cross section analysis. Swedenborg concluded (1985, p.

235) that OLS estimations, such as those reported above for the U.S.

overstated the positive effects of affiliate production on parent exports.

Her own estimate, from the 2SLS equations, was that each dollar of Swedish

affiliate production added about $.lO to Swedish parent exports, not very far

from the U.S. results mentioned above. From a breakdown of parent exports by

type she concluded that only 2 per cent of the sales provided by foreign

production would be replaced by parent exports if foreign production were

abandoned.

      A somewhat different analysis was performed by Elomstrom, Lipsey, and

Kulchycky for 1978, using the same data source as for Swedenborg's studies but

in more aggregated form and with each industry's total manufactured exports

from Sweden, rather than only parent exports, as the dependent variable. All

the coefficients on affiliate sales were positive and, in fact, larger in a

2SLS analysis than in the OLS equations. There was no evidence in the
                                       - 22   -



 comparison with Swedenborg's estimates for parent exports, that the positive
 effect   on Swedish parent exports came at the expense of exports by other
 Swedish firms.    It seems more likely, although the equations are too different

 from Swedenborg's to produce a definitive conclusion, that affiliate

production encouraged not only parent exports to the affiliates' host

countries, but also exports to the same countries by other Swedish firms.

        An examination of changes over time, between 1970 and 1978, from the

   source of data, showed similar results: the greater the increase in
same

Swedish affiliate production in a country, the greater the growth of exports
of   manufactures from Sweden to that host    country. A single exception was

metal manufacturing, where both a high 1970 level of Swedish-controlled

production and high growth in that production in 1970-78 were associated with

reductions in Swedish exports.

       A. recent JUl report (Svensson, 1993) challenges the earlier findings for

Sweden using some of the same data plus the latest, still
                                                              unpublished, survey
for 1990. The report concludes that an increase in affiliate production for

local host country sale of $1 reduces parent exports by $.14 and that

affiliate production for export to third countries reduces parent exports by

over $.40 for each dollar of such affiliate production.

       The apparent contradiction of earlier results is attributed by the

author to his accounting for the effect of affiliate production for export on

parent sales to third countries. However, such effects were included in the

analysis of total parent exports by U.S. firms in Lipsey and Weiss (1984)

without producing any similar negative effects.     The major source of the

difference from earlier results seems to be the formulation of the equations,

which normalizes across firms by the total worldwide sales of the
                                        - 23   -



multinational   firm rather than by parent sales, as in Swedenborg's earlier

studies. The difference is never pointed out and this normalization is

described as a way of eliminating heteroscedasticity. In fact, the result is

that what is being tested is the relationship between the share of worldwide

sales provided by production carried out in a host country and the share of

home-country (parent) exports to that country in the firm's worldwide sales.

It is virtually a certainty that these coefficients for host country

production shares will be negative, but those negative coefficients can be

interpreted as a negative influence on the absolute value of home-country

exports only on an odd implied assumption that is never discussed. The

assumption is that in the absence of foreign production the total size of the

multinational firm's worldwide sales or production would be the same    as   with

foreign production. If Electrolux did not produce in many countries it would

have the same worldwide sales as it has with foreign production. That

assumption would seem to guarantee a negative coefficient for foreign

production on home-country exports, but is not a plausible assumption on which

to rest a study.

        On the whole, then, it would seem reasonable to conclude that production

outside the U.S. by U.S. based firms has little effect on exports from the

U.S.   by parent firms or by all U.S.   fins as a whole, and that to the extent

there is an effect, it is more likely to be positive than negative. This

relationship is probably a characteristic of other countries' multinationals

as well. One reason this is true is that foreign production is undertaken to

expand or retain a parent firm's foreign markets and that parent exports are

incidental to these decisions. As foreign affiliates mature, their imports

 exchange race changes and other developments, but there is no indication that

 the absolute level of imports from the home country declines over long

periods.

Foreini Production and Home-Country labor

      Aside from the relation of overseas production to exports from the

United States, such production could affect the overall demand hr labor

within the United States by parent firms, and the demand for labor of

different types, even if total production in the United States were not

affected, For example, the demand for labor by parent firms might be reduced

if more labor-intensive products were allocated to multinationals'   foreign

operations, while more capital-intensive operations were allocated to U.S.

operations. Similarly, the demand for unskilled labor by parents might

decline if parts of the production process or products
                                                         requiring highly
skilled labor were allocated to the U.S. while processes or products requiring

relatively low skills were allocated to overseas affiliates.

      The opportunity for multinational firms to engage in such geographical

allocation of their production presumably requires that the product be

tradable. If a fin's output must be consumed where it is produced, as in

many service industries, production will take place where the goods and

services are sold and will respond to host-country demand and to host-country

costs. There could still be differences among production locations in capital

intensity and skill intensity. These might reflect the   elasticity of
substitution between capital and labor or between labor of different skills if

there are significant differences in factor prices, but these should affect

the affiliates' operations rather than those of the parents. More important,

there could still be effects of affiliate operations on parent capital or
                                       - 25   -



skill   intensity if the needs for certain typically central functions, such as

coordination, management, and research and development, were affected by

affiliates' operations.

        In this analysis, the level of home country (parent) production is taken

as given and the question is whether, within this fixed level of home

production, the composition of parent production is affected by the parent

fin's foreign production activity in such a way as to alter the parent firm's

demand for labor and for more skilled, as compared with less skilled, labor.

        One sign that more labor-intensive activities were being allocated to

foreign affiliates or that production methods were being changed in response

to differences in factor prices would be a lower capital intensity in

affiliate production relative to parent production and a lower capital

intensity in low-income countries than in high-income countries. The data on

net property, plant, and equipment per worker from the latest U.S. outward

investment census indicate that in manufacturing as a whole, the physical

capital intensity of production in developed countries by all affiliates of

manufacturing parents was about 80 per cent of that in parents in the United

States. The capital intensity of manufacturing affiliates in developing

countries was only 42 per cent of that in developed countries.    In contrast,

in a broadly defined services group, including all industries except

manufacturing, petroleum, agriculture, mining, and transportation,

communication, and public utilities, the physical capital intensity of

affiliates was higher than that of their parents in the United States. And

for affiliates in developing countries outside of those in manufacturing and

petroleum, physical capital intensity was higher than for affiliates in the

developed countries (U.S. Department of Commerce, 1993, Tables 11.68, 11.813,
                                     - 26   -



II.G4,   ILGI1, ILL.1, and TLP1).   Of course, some of the difference in these

aggregate comparisons nay rest on differences in industry composition not

related to responses to factor price differences at all. However, it is hard

to avoid the impression that manufacturing firms adapt affiliate production to

differences in factor prices to a much larger extent than service industry

firms do.

      A much more thorough investigation of whether multinational fins

adapted their factor proportions to relative factor prices (Lipsey, Kravis,

and Roldan, 1982) concluded that these fins did use more labor-intensive

methods of production, as measured by property, plant, and equipment per

worker, in low-wage countries. The form that the adaptation took could have

been selecting labor-intensive sub-industries for production in low-wage

countries, or selecting labor-intensive production processes for such

production, selecting small-scale operations for which only labor-intensive

methods of production were available, or by operating in a labor-intensive

way, whatever technologies was selected. These relationships were visible not

only within industries but also within individual firms, and for Swedish as

well as American multinationals.

      Judging fron these aggregate data, manufacturing firms were more

responsive to factor price differences in allocating their direct investment

activity than were service industry firms. The reason could be simply a

higher elasticity of substitution between capital and labor in manufacturing

than in services, or it could be that the tradability of manufactured products

makes them more suitable for the allocation of, for example, labor-intensive

activities to labor abundant, cheap-labor countries. In the former case, of

higher elasticity of substitution in manufacturing, there should not be any
                                               - 27   -



effect   of overseas production on parent labor intensity. In the latter      case,
of allocation of activities in response to factor prices, larger overseas

operations should produce less employment in the U.S. relative to sales (lower

labor intensity of production).

      The predominance of evidence for individual manufacturing firms and

their affiliates in six industry groups in the 1982 investment census was that

higher overseas production was associated with lower employment at home, given

the level of parent production (Kravis and Lipsey, 1988). That was the case

for all manufacturing fins as a group and within most of the six major

industry groups. The only exceptions were that sales by majority-owned

affiliates in electrical machinery and by minority-owned affiliates in non-

electrical machinery were positively related te parent employment1 for any

level of parent production.

      Some calculations from the latest outward investment census, for 1989,

suggest a similar relationship, as in equation I:

(1)   PEMP     —   1,234   ÷     6.14 PUS       -      .77 ANS     —   .867
                      (5.0) (58.1)                  (5.9)

      where:

                     PEMP —    Parent employment
                      PNS — Parent net sales (sales less imports from

                               affiliates),     in $ million
                      ANS —    Affiliate net sales (sales less imports from the
                               U.S.),   in $   million

Each million dollars of affiliate production (as proxied by affiliate net

sales), gave rise to a loss of almost one parent employee, given the level of

the parent's production.
                                                 - 28   -



      If we separate net sates of affiliates into those of manufacturing and
non-manufacturing affiliates, we find that the negative relationship comes

from the manufacturing production; each million dollars of manufacturing

affiliate production subtracts about 1.4 workers from parent employment while

each million dollars of non-manufacturing affiliate production adds 1.2 parent

employees (equation 2).


(2) PEMP —   1.160   +          6.16   PNS   -    1.38 MANS   +    1.21 NMANS   —   .870
                (4.7) (58.7)                      (7.6)           (2.8)

      where:

                     MANS    —
                                 Manufacturing     affiliate net sales

                 NMANS      —
                                Nonmanufacturing affiliate net sales

      These equations assume that the impact on parent employment is related

to the absolute value of affiliate production: an addition of a million

dollars of affiliate production has the same impact on parent employment

whether the affiliates are one tenth the parent's size, in the aggregate, or

twice the parent's size.

      The same calculations can be performed within the major manufacturing

industry groups, reducing the influence of inter-industry differences. Across

industries, any relation between parent labor intensity and foreign operations

is more likely to represent an effect of labor intensity on the tendency to

produce abroad than of foreign production on domestic labor intensity.

      The parent employment level equations for major industry groups are

summarized in Table 1, Within the major industry groups, the relationships

are mixed. In transportation equipment, the group with the largest affiliate

sales, the relation is negative; each million dollars of affiliate net sales

is associated with parents having five fewer employees)- In the next largest
                                        - 29   -




industry   in terms of affiliate sales, machinery, except electrical, each

million dollars of affiliate sales adds one employee to the parent rolls (the

story is similar in the other, much smaller, electrical machinery group). And

in the other major investing industry group, chemicals, there is no relation

to parent employment.

      If we separate the affiliates into manufacturing and sales affiliates,

we see that the total affiliate sales coefficients are dominated by those for

manufacturing affiliates, again positive in the two machinery groups and

negative in transportation equipment.

      On the whole, these equations for absolute levels of parent employment

are inconclusive, with a mixture of positive and negative relations. We would

not conclude from these results that there is any clear effect of affiliate

production on aggregate parent employment, given the level of parent

production.

      A different view of tho effect of overseas production on parent labor

intensity is provided by relating employment per dollar of net parent sales -
a measure of labor intensity - to   the ratio of overseas (affiliate) to

domestic (parent) production, as in equation 3. Virtually none of the

variation in parent employment per dollar of output is explained by the

equation. The statisttcally insignificant coefficient suggests a positive

relationship, with a one percentage point increase in the ratio of overseas

production to home production associated with a one and a half percentage

point increase in the ratio of parent employment to sales. Such a positive

relation might occur if affiliate production gave rise to needs for
                                               - 30   -


supervisory,       research, or other types of auxiliary employment in headquarters

operations. The addition of parent net sales as a variable, on the theory

that larger parent firms might be either more efficient or more bureaucratic

than smaller ones, did not reveal any effect of parent size.

        A distinction between manufacturing and non-manufacturing affiliates

pointed to the former as having no impact on parent labor intensity and the

latter close to statistical significance at the 5 per cent level, but still a

negligible degree of explanation of the variance in parent employment per

dollar of production (equation 4).

        Within the six major industry groups, the evidence points to a positive

impact of foreign affiliate production, and particularly foreign manufacturing

affiliate production, on parent employment per dollar of production (Table 2).

The only statistically significant coefficients are in the two machinery

groups, and also for manufacturing production in the food industry. Thus,

from these calculations, we see no evidence of more capital intensive

activities at home from an allocation of labor-intensive activities to

affiliates. More foreign affiliate production, particularly more

manufacturing production, seems to lead to more parent employment in the U.S.

relative to ILS. production. Most likely this is supervisory or other

headquarters employment, but we have no evidence for this conjecture.

       The corresponding equation for parent employment in all service
industries combined, from the 1982 data, showed much larger coefficients            than
for   manufacturing, negative for majority-owned affiliate sales and           positive
                                           - 31   -




 for    sales of minority-owned affiliates. However, the equations for individual

 service industries produced mixed results: half the significant coefficients

 for majority-owned affiliate sales were positive and half
                                                                        negative. For most
 industries, no effect was visible, and only one coefficient for
                                                                             minority-owned
 affiliates was statistically significant. Durable-goods wholesale trade and

 insurance were the two service industries in which
                                                               foreign affiliate sales

were positively related to parent employment per dollar of parent sales, and

nondurable goods wholesaling and engineering, the two            with   negative
relationships (Kravis and Lipsey, 1988).

         One problem with interpreting the data for some service           industries,

particularly those in finance, is that the location of production is hard                  to
define. Part of the sales attributed to a foreign affiliate on the books of

the company for tax or related reasons
                                             may involve activity actually carried
out in the United States. However, banking and insurance activities for host-

country customers, in contrast to that for international customers such               as
U.S. multinationals, are    likely to require         both host-country employment,
without    any substitution for domestic   U.S. employment, and also some

supervisory  or service employment in the U.S. parent firm. It is this likely
effect, and the impact on multinational firm profits, that is the motivation
behind the insistence of the United States on including
                                                        service industry entry
rules    in the Uruguay round of CArl negotiations,
        A rough estimate can be made of the effect         of changes in rules for entry

into the insurance industry in various countries.
                                                             Cross-country regressions
of U.S. insurance affiliate sales (premium values) in various countries

against income and various country characteristics including the severity of

restrictions on entry by foreign finns, suggested that a shift by all, host

countries   to the most liberal regulation regimes would double the sales

(premium values) of life insurance by U.S. -owned affiliates and increase the

sales of nonlife insurance by as much as a third. From the equation for the

relation of insurance parent employment to affiliate sales in icravis and

Lipsey (1988) it can then be estimated that parent employment in the United

States would increase by something in the neighborhood of 10 per tent.

      Aside from effects on the parent firms' level of employment, the extent

of foreign operations might also affect the composition of parent employment

in the U.S. and the demand and wages for different skills. To the extent that

parent firms in manufacturing can allocate activities of different skill

levels to different locations to serve worldwide markets, we might expect that

operations intensive in low-skilled labor would be allocated to foreign

affiliates, especially those in countries where low-skilled labor is cheap,

and that high-skill functions would tend to be concentrated in the United

States or, possibly, in other highly developed countries.

      Two types of evidence might shed light on this possibility. One is

simply the allocation of activities within U.S. multinationals. Another is

the degree to which a larger share of production carried out abroad is

associated with a higher level of skill in a firm's U.S. labor force.

      The data collected on employment include very little on the

characteristics of the parent or affiliate labor forces. One of the few bits

of information is of the proportion of employees engaged in R&D activities,

and another is the average compensation of employees, as a rough indicator of

skill levels.

      The data on R&D employment emphasize the concentration of R&D activity

in parent companies:

      The share     of parent employment in   R&D is more than twice that in
affiliates   in   almost every major industry group. It would be more appropriate

to compare parents with their own affiliates, but those data are not

published.   Thus, many of the affiliates in        wholesale trade are subsidiaries

of manufacturing parents, and including them in the manufacturing sector would

heighten the contrast between parents and affiliates in both manufacturing and

wholesale trade. Judging by the data on R&D expenditures, there is a further

allocation of R&D activities between affiliates in developed and developing

countries, with much higher R&D    intensity   in the former group (Lipsey,

Blomstrom. and Kravis, 1990).

      An indication of responses to the relative price of skilled as compared

with unskilled labor was provided by data for a cross-section of Swedish firms

and their affiliates. Although the definition of skilled and unskilled labor

was a crude one (salaried vs. wage workers) and only a small portion of the
                                       - 34   -


variation    in skill composition was explained, there did seem to be a

consistent relationship in which more skill-intensive activities were

allocated to countries where the price of skilled labor was lower relative to

that of unskilled labor.

        Within U.S. multinational firms, the average level of compensation per

worker, as a crude indicator of average skill levels, can be related to the

extent of production in majority-owned affiliates (Kravis and Lipsey, 1988).

In manufacturing, the association is weak. The !s are low and are

significant at the 5 per cent level only for total manufacturing and for the

food industry. In both cases, the share of assets overseas explained more of

parent compensation levels than the share of production. The only

coefficients that are statistically significant at the S per cent level are

positive ones for affiliate production shares in the same industries (Appendix

Table 5). If parent output and sales by minority-owned and majority-owned

affiliates in absolute terms are used to explain parent compensation, a little

better explanation is reached, but only parent output and minority affiliate

output are ever statistically significant, and the coefficients are always

positive (Table 1).    Thus the general impression is that if there is any

influence of foreign operations it is a tendency toward higher skill levels at
home.

        Among service industries, the share of majority-owned affiliates in

production produced significant Ws only for wholesale trade in nondurable

goods, for all services, and for business services (Appendix Table 5).       Adding

the other variables produced little improvement in the degree of explanation,

but the few significant coefficients for affiliate production were positive.

        On the whole, we can say that in both manufacturing and service
                                       - 35   -



 industries   the effect of foreign operations on the average skill levels in

parent companies, if any, was to raise them, but the effect was not
                                                                       strong and
not universal across industries.

Foreign and Domestic Investment as Comoecitors for Funds

      One channel by which a decision by a finn to invest in foreign

production could affect investment in domestic production in the financial

one. The mechanism that would explain such an interdependence or interaction

would presumably imply an upward sloping supply function for the fin's

external finance, so that investments in different locations compete for

investment funds. It is a channel that would escape the notice of most

analyses that take the level of production in each location as given, or as

determined only by demand and costs of production in each location.

      Studies of this question by Herring and Willett (1913), and, to some

extent, by Severn (1972), and Noorzoy (1980), found mostly positive

relationships over time between domestic and foreign investment. Such

relationships, derived mainly from aggregate data, could reflect common
fluctuations   or trends in demand rather than any interdependence.
      A study   by Stevens and Lipsey (1992). based on individual firm plant and

equipment expenditure data running for 15 to 20 year periods between the 1950s

and the l970s, attempted to disentangle these effects. Although only seven

fins' data were complete enough to be analyzed, the results were fairly

consistent in suggesting that there was such interdependence. A one per cent

exogenous rise in foreign demand or in a finn's overseas output was estimated

to reduce the parent firm's U.S. fixed investment by amounts ranging from .3

to .8 per cent in most of the firms.

     This is a tentative finding based on a small number of firms in a period

of expansion of U.S. firms' foreign production. It would be interesting to
                                            - 36   -

test   the same model over the period of contracting or stagnant overseas

production by U.S. firms and also on larger numbers of firms or on industry

aggregates.

        In any case, the possibility of this type of competition between foreign

and domestic fixed investment is worth further investigation.

Conclusions                             -




        Many   of the analyses of the effects of outward direct investment
reviewed here implicitly assume that differences among firms and industries in
various characteristics can be at least partly explained by differences in the
degree to which they operate abroad. These same characteristics are also used

to explain the propensity of firms and industries to operate abroad. The

explanation of the existence of direct investment and foreign production is

centered around the idea that firms possess individual firm-specific assets,

such as technologies, or patents, or skills in advertising or marketing, that

can be exploited most profitably by producing in many markets. These assets

are mobile across international borders but not among firms, and firms cannot

realize their value by selling them to other firms or by renting them to other

firms by licensing.

        The opportunity to exploit these firm-specific assets via direct

investment adds to the incentive to acquire them. If R&D intensity and human

capital intensity are the strongest explanations of the worldwide trade shares

of   U.S. multinationals (Kravis and Lipsey, 1992), and possibly of their shares

in world production as well, a restriction on direct investment would reduce

the value of investment in such assets and therefore reduce firms' investment

in them.       If much of foreign direct investment is defensive, as suggested

earlier, it may make investment in firm-specific assets more profitable by
                                        - 37   -



extending   the length of time over which they can be exploited, a suggestion

made many years ago by Vernon (1966).

      While firms from different countries tend to possess different firm

comparative advantages, the leading firns in each country tend to

internationalize their production. With the long-term decline in costs of

international travel and communication, the costs of controlling widespread

production must be declining, and firms from most of the countries in the

world are increasing the extent to which they produce outside their hone

countries. With that fact as background, it seems unlikely that the decline

in internationalization of American firms' production will go much further and

more likely that it will be reversed.

      The availability of foreign production locations appears to have

contributed a great deal to the ability of American multinational firms to

retain their market shares in the face of declines in the market share of the

United States as a country, The salle seems to be true for the trade shares of

firms from other countries and this flexibility applies not only to
                                                                      softening
the effects of long term national declines in export shares and in comparative

advantage in individual industries, but also those of short-term events such

as large changes in exchange rates.

      The frequently expressed fear that American multinationals have been, in

some sense, "exporting jobs" by substituting foreign production for American

production has very little empirical support. For one thing, overseas

employment and fixed investment have been for the most part, declining

relative to domestic employment and fixed investment for ten or fifteen yeers.

And U.S. fines that produce more abroad than others tend also to export more

in general and to the countries where the foreign production takes place. The

same relationship is evident for firms based in Sweden, the only other country

collecting similar data on multinational parents and affiliates. Overseas

production has much more to do with contesting market shares than with finding

low-cost production locations, although the latter is also a motivation.

       Within multinational firms, the higher the share of overseas operations

in the total production of the multinational, the higher the ratio of home

employment to home production more often than not. A possible explanation is

that a larger share of foreign production requires a larger number of
headquarters employees such as R&D staff and supervisory personnel whose
contribution to output   is not confined to the fin's domestic production. The

relationship   is not unambiguous, since higher absolute   (rather than relative)

production   abroad is more often associated with lower home employment, given
the   level of home production, a finding we at one time interpreted as implying

an allocation of more capital-intensive parts of total production to the

United States and of more labor-intensive parts to affiliates, especially

those in developing countries. The interpretation that it is technical

activities and management that are allocated to home operations is reinforced

by the fact that higher proportions of foreign activity are associated with

higher average compensation at home.

        On the whole, the evidence suggests that the effect of overseas

production on the home-country labor market involves the composition of a

firm's employment at home rather than the total amount of its home employment.

That change in composition is mainly a shift toward more managerial and

technical employment, much like the effects of increasing trade and other

aspects of the evolution of the American economy.

I. There may be an inter-industry effect here; the group includes two very

different industries, motor vehicles and equipment and other transportation

equipment, mainly aircraft. The motor vehicle industry accounts for almost

all the foreign affiliate sales, while the other transportation equipment

industry accounts for note than half the parent employment.
