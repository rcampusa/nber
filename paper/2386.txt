                 Imperfect Competition and the Keynesian Cross




                                   ABSTRACT




     This paper presents a simple general equilibrium model in which the only
non-Wairasian feature is imperfect competition in the goods market. The model
is shown to exhibit various Keynesian characteristics.
                                                        In particular, as
competition in the goods market becomes less perfect, the fiscal policy
multipliers approach the values implied by the textbook Keynesian cross.

      Fiscal policy multipliers are central to Keynesian macroeconomics.

 In this paper I explore a possible microeconomic foundation for one

 fundamental theory of income determination, the "Keynesian cross." My

 model deviates from a Wairasian equilibrium model only by the assumption of

 imperfect competition in the goods market.   I show that textbook fiscal

policy multipliers arise as a limiting case.1

     Under imperfect competition, firms are always eager to sell an

additional unit of output, since price exceeds marginal cost. This profit

margin creates the potential for the multiplier. An expansionary change in

fiscal policy increases aggregate expenditure, which increases profits,

which in turn increases expenditure, and so on.

     The theme that imperfect competition may be crucial to macroeconomic

issues is increasingly prevalent. See, for example, the work of Weitzman

[1982], Hart [1982], Solow [1984], Blanchard and Kiyotaki [1985], and Startz

[1986]. The purpose of the model presented here is partly pedagogical. I

therefore do not hesitate making strong (yet not implausible) assumptions

about the economic structure: Cobb-Douglas utility, constant marginal cost,

and constant mark-up pricing. There is no reason to suppose, however, that

the sorts of effects highlighted here are specific to these assumptions.

     While the model is in some ways surprisingly similar to the

standard Keynesian model, in other ways it differs greatly. In

particular, it incorporates both an equilibrium labor market and a static

environment. These features are chosen for simplicity rather than realism.

The goal is not to provide a complete reformulation of Keynesian economics,
                                                      —2--


but only to illustrate what sort of Keynesian results one can obtain with a

small movement away from Walrasian equilibrium in the direction of imperfect

competition.



                                                II. THE ECONOMY

     This section describes the economy. The following section discusses the

economy's response to changes in fiscal policy.



People

     All people are the same. The representative person maximizes a

Cobb-Douglas utility function over consumption of the single produced good

(C) and leisure (L):

           U =      a log C +              (1—a) log L.                                  (1)

Leisure is the nunieraire.                 If w is the endowment of time, then w-L is labor

income. Total after—tax income is                    (o—L) +   fl — T, where 11 is profits and T

is the lump-sum tax levied by the government. The individual's budget

constraint is therefore

           PC =      (w-L)   +    fl   - T
                                                                                         (2)

           PC + L    =   w +      11
                                       -   T,

where P is the price of the consumption good.

     The Cobb—Douglas utility function implies a constant share a of "full

income" is devoted to consumption. That is,

           PC = a(w      +   fl   -    1).                                               (3)

Equation (3) is the consumption function, and a is the marginal propensity to

consume.
                                                   —3-

 Government

        The revenue raised by the government is used for two purposes. An

 amount G is used to purchase the produced good, and W government workers are

 hired. The government budget constraint requires that government spending

 equals revenue. That is,

           T = G+W.
                                                                        (4)

 Total expenditure on the produced good is

           Y =   PC    +        G.
                                                                       (5)

 Using equation (3) to substitute into equation (5), we find

           V = a(w     +   II   -
                                     1)   +   6.                       (6)

 Expenditure therefore depends positively on profits and government purchases

and negatively on taxes.


Firms

     There are N firms producing the single good. The industry takes

expenditure in the economy as given.2 That is, the industry demand function
is unit elastic:

          Q = YIP
                                                                       (7)

where Q is total output.

     The N firms have the same increasing returns to scale technology. The

technology requires F units of overhead labor. After the plant is set up,

one unit of output requires c Units of labor. The cost function of each firm

is therefore

          TC(q) =     F +   cq,                                      (8)

where costs are measured in terms of the numeraire, leisure.

    The N firms play some oligopoly game, the details of which I do not need

to specify. This game determines the profit margin
                                                              —4-

                 =       (P -   c)/P.                                                              (9)

As an example, if the firms act as Cournot oligopolists, then ji                            = 1/N.       More

generally, a conjectural variation equilibrium allows all possibilites

between Bertrand competition (ji                   = 0)       and perfect collusion (gi   - 1);   in each

case, ji   depends only on N and the conjectural variation.                           I therefore take

the profit margin i as given for any fixed number of firms N.3

     Note the relation between output and expenditure:

           Q =            E(1-s)/c]      V.                                                        (10)

For given values of the profit margin i and marginal cost c, expenditure on

the produced good and output are proportional. Government workers W are not

included in expenditure V or output Q; hence, these measures are analogous to

industrial production rather than GNP.

     Total profits are revenue less costs:

           fl =          PQ—NF—cQ.                                                                 (11)

Using equations (7) and (9), aggregate profits can be expressed in terms in

terms of expenditure V and the profit margin JA:

            11       =   .tV - NF.                                                                 (12)

Hence, higher aggregate expenditure implies higher aggregate profits.


The Labor Market

     The above discussion centers on the goods market. Walras's Law ensures

that the labor market clears if the above relations are satisfied. To see

that this is true, note that labor supply is the time endowment less the

demand for leisure:

            Labor Supply =                w - (1     -
                                                             a)(w   +       fl — T)                (13)

                                     =        — (1       -
                                                             a)(1I      —    T).
                                                                         —5-

 Labor demand •is the sum of firms' demand, NF + cQ,
                                                     and government demand, W.
 Thus,

             Labor Demand =               (NF + cQ) + W,                                                              (14)
                                     =    (V - H) + (T -

                                     = (a(w           +    11       -
                                                                         T)     + G -     ii)   + (1 -

                                     = aw         —
                                                      (1        -
                                                                        a)(fl   —
                                                                                    1).

 Hence, goods market equilibrium (including the government budget constraint)

 implies that supply equals demand in the labor market as well.


 Summary

     The two key equations are (6) and (12):

            Y = a(w           + IT -     T)   +   0,                                                                  (6)

            fl   =   iY   -    NF.
                                                                                                                     (12)

Expenditure depends on profits and the fiscal policy variables, while profits

depend on expenditure.



                                              III. FISCAL POLICY

     This section addresses the impact of fiscal policy. The analysis is

short—run in that the number of firms N and thus the profit margin gi                                                are    held
fixed.


The Balanced Budget Multiplier

     Consider first an equal increase in government purchases 0 and taxes T.

Equations (6) and (12) imply that

                          -     1-a
           dot                  1 -                                                                                  (15)
                 dT=dG
The multiplier thus depends on both the marginal propensity to consume a and

the profit margin t.            Under perfect competition (ji                                   = 0),    the balanced budget
                                          -6-

multiplier is 1-a. In the limiting case in which the revenue from the

marginal unit goes entirely to profit (i         = 1),   the balanced budget multiplier

is unity.

     The story that accompanies this multiplier is in many ways standard.

Initially, the increase in government purchases of tG raises expenditure by

tG, while the equal tax increase lowers private expenditure by aG. The net

increase in expenditure is thus (1-a)tG, which raises profits by ji(1-a)tG.

The increase in profits in turn raises expenditure by a(1-a)AG, which again

raises profits, and so on. This multiplier process yields the infinite

series,

            (1-a) +   ai(1-a)   +   a2112(1_a)    +   a3j13(1—a)   +

which equals the balanced budget multiplier in equation (15). Imperfect
competition plays a key role here, for if the profit margin were zero, the

process would end after the initial increase in expenditure.



The Tax Multiplier

     Consider now an increase in taxes T, holding constant the level of

government purchases G. The government budget constraint (4) implies that

the amount of labor purchased by the government W must increase by T. The

extra labor income received by government employees exactly equals the extra

taxes paid; on net, individuals give up their time but receive no additional

income. This policy intervention is thus equivalent to a reduction in the

endowment w of T.

     In standard analysis, tax increases are coupled with reductions -in

government debt. Government debt serves the function of transferring
                                                —7-

 resources from future generations to the current generation.           Hence, a tax

 increase is an endowment reduction to the current generation.            In this

 sense, a tax increase in the static model of this paper is analogous to a

 debt-financed tax increase in intertemporal (finite horizon) models.

      Equations (6) and (12) imply that the tax multiplier is

          dv                -a
          dl --     1       -                                                    (16)

 Under perfect competition (ii        = 0),   the tax multiplier is —a. As competition

 becomes less perfect (,i        -+ 1), the tax multiplier approaches —a/(1-a). Again,

 the multiplier process works through profits. The tax increase lowers

expenditure, which lowers profits, which lowers expenditure, and so on.



The Government Purchases Multiplier

     Consider now an increase in government purchases G, holding constant the

level of taxes 1.           In standard analysis, future generations pay for a

debt-financed increase in purchases. Here, the increase in purchases is

financed by a reduction in W. In both cases, there is no immediate impact on

the current individuals' budget constraint (2).

     Equations (6) and (12) imply that the government purchases multiplier is

         dY             1
         dG --                                                                (17)

Under perfect competition, dY/do is unity. As the profit margin approaches

one, dY/dC approaches the standard Keynesian value of 1/(1-a).

     Figure 1 shows how to demonstrate the multiplier graphically.

Expenditure V is a linear function of profits II, with a slope of the marginal

propensity to consume a. Profits are also a linear function of expenditure;
                                                   -8-

the slope of this line is                      In the limiting case in which gi = 1, this

locus becomes the 450 line of the Keynesian cross. An increase in government

purchases shifts the expenditure function upward by tG, which causes a

multiplied increase in total expenditure.


Welfare Analysis

     Here I examine the effect of fiscal policy on the welfare of the

representative person, as judged by his utility function (1). Government

purchases are assumed not to affect utility directly. A complete evaluation

of fiscal policy would also take account of the benefit received from public

expenditure. The analysis here is thus limited in scope.

     An individual's utility increases only if his budget set, as defined by

equation (2), is expanded. Since relative prices are constant, profits less

taxes, 11 —   1, are sufficient for utility. The impacts of the fiscal policy
changes on II - T are


                         - -(1       -
                                         i.)

                  —
            dT          1-au
         d(fl—T)    =                                                               (20)
              dG

     A balanced budget fiscal stimulus in general reduces welfare. In the

limiting case in which gi     = 1,       however, a balanced budget increase has no

impact on welfare. As the textbook Keynesian cross suggests, the increase in

government purchases has no social cost. The increase in income (here,

profits) exactly offsets the higher tax bill.

     Both increases in government purchases and reductions in taxes increase

welfare. In standard analysis, increases in G or reductions in T are
                                      -9-

financed by future generations. Here, these changes are financed by

reductions in government workers W.   In neither case is it surprising that

the welfare of current individuals increases.



                                IV. CONCLUSION

     The model examined here is surprisingly similar to both Walrasian

models of general equilibrium and Keynesian models of income determination.

It deviates from a standard general equilibrium model only by the assumption

of imperfect competition in the goods market. As competition in the goods

market becomes less perfect, the fiscal policy multipliers approach the

values implied by the Keynesian cross.

     The model could be usefully extended in several directions. First, the

labor market might be made less classical. One could posit imperfect

competition among workers, for example. Some of the rents generated by

expansionary fiscal policy would therefore accrue as labor income. The

multiplier would thus work through both labor income and firm profits.5

     Second, the model could be made intertemporal. The impact of

debt-financed fiscal policy obviously cannot be studied in a static model.

That saving and inC'estment play an important role in standard Keynesian

analysis also suggests extending this model to a dynamic setting.

NOTES

1.   For an exposition of the Keynes-ian cross, see Samuelson [1948) or almost

any introductory text.

2.   One might object that this assumption is not reasonable because

expenditure depends on industry profits. The model could easily be amended,

however, to include a continuum of industries; the demand curve of each

industry would depend on aggregate profits.

3.   One could also imagine that each firm produces a differentiated product.

In this case, the profit margin ti depends on each firm's elasticity of

demand, which could plausibly be assumed constant.

4.   Note that the second line is always steeper than the first,

since a < 1 <   1/p.
