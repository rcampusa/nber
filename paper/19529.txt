Incentives, Selection, and Teacher Performance: Evidence from IMPACT

NBER Working Paper No. 19529
October 2013
JEL No. I2,J45

                                              ABSTRACT

Teachers in the United States are compensated largely on the basis of fixed schedules that reward experience
and credentials. However, there is a growing interest in whether performance-based incentives based
on rigorous teacher evaluations can improve teacher retention and performance. The evidence available
to date has been mixed at best. This study presents novel evidence on this topic based on IMPACT,
the controversial teacher-evaluation system introduced in the District of Columbia Public Schools
by then-Chancellor Michelle Rhee. IMPACT implemented uniquely high-powered incentives linked
to multiple measures of teacher performance (i.e., several structured observational measures as well
as test performance). We present regression-discontinuity (RD) estimates that compare the retention
and performance outcomes among low-performing teachers whose ratings placed them near the threshold
that implied a strong dismissal threat. We also compare outcomes among high-performing teachers
whose rating placed them near a threshold that implied an unusually large financial incentive. Our
RD results indicate that dismissal threats increased the voluntary attrition of low-performing teachers
by 11 percentage points (i.e., more than 50 percent) and improved the performance of teachers who
remained by 0.27 of a teacher-level standard deviation. We also find evidence that financial incentives
further improved the performance of high-performing teachers (effect size = 0.24).

INTRODUCTION

In recent years, a research consensus has coalesced around the notion that teacher quality is a
critically important determinant of student development and achievement (Sanders and Rivers,
1996; Aaronson, Barrow and Sander, 2007; Rockoff, 2004; Rivkin, Hanushek and Kain, 2005) as
well as later life outcomes (Chetty et al., 2011). However, there is no similarly wide agreement
on how to systematically drive improvements in the quality of the teacher workforce. Districts
and schools allocate substantial resources to teacher professional development (e.g., in-service
training) despite the fact that there is surprisingly little rigorous evidence on the efficacy of these
efforts (e.g., Yoon et al. 2007). Moreover, almost none of this professional development is driven
by rigorous assessments of the teaching strengths and weaknesses of individual teachers
(Weisberg et al, 2009). Furthermore, decades of empirical research have provided relatively little
evidence on observed teacher traits that can consistently predict teacher quality. Nonetheless, the
“single salary” schedules commonly used in U.S. public school districts compensate teachers
according to tightly structured rules that typically reward only teacher experience and education
credentials; traits among those without consistent links to teacher quality.

    Critics of this status quo argue that such rigid and misaligned compensation systems cannot
adequately attract and retain a high-quality teacher workforce (see, for example, Johnson and
Papay, 2009; Hanushek, 2007; Murnane and Olsen, 1989). This misalignment is thought to be
especially acute in difficult-to-staff schools where the working conditions are more difficult yet
the compensation, due to the single salary schedule, is often similar to schools with better
working conditions. This dissatisfaction has motivated new efforts to design and implement
programs to assess and reward teacher performance (Johnson and Papay 2009; Cavanagh 2011).
The enthusiasm for such reforms among some policymakers and some practitioners is
underscored by new federal and state initiatives (e.g., the Teacher Incentive Fund, Race to the
Top, state waivers from the federal requirements under the No Child Left Behind Act) that
promote, among other goals, the design and use of measures of teacher performance in
compensation and other personnel decisions. However, these efforts are also extraordinarily
controversial and their ongoing implementation appears to be uneven among school districts
nationwide. For example, several large urban school districts recently terminated their federally
sponsored programs after failing to secure the required buy-in of their teachers’ unions
(Zubrzycki 2012). New York State Commissioner of Education, John King recently imposed a
                                                                                                          !

teacher assessment system on New York City after the New York City Department of Education
and the United Federation of Teachers failed to agree on one, resulting in a loss of $250 million
in state aid (Joseph, 2013). More generally, there appears to be renewed resistance to the use of
teacher evaluations to assess performance, especially for high-stakes financial and dismissal
decisions (McNeil 2013a; Weiss and Long, 2013).

    The heated and ongoing national discussion about reforming teacher evaluation and
compensation arguably has its recent genesis in the seminal policy innovations introduced in the
District of Columbia Public Schools (DCPS) several years ago under then-Chancellor Michelle
Rhee. In the 2009-10 academic year, DCPS introduced IMPACT, a high-stakes teacher
evaluation system designed to drive improvements in teacher quality and student achievement.
IMPACT established several explicit measures of teacher performance and linked the overall
measured performance of individual teachers both to the possibility of large financial incentives
as well as to the threat of dismissal. Specifically, during the first 3 years under this nationally
visible program, teachers rated as “highly effective” (HE) have received substantial increases in
one-time and base compensation while hundreds of teachers rated as ineffective (or minimally
effective for two consecutive years) have been forcibly separated.

    State and local efforts to provide stronger incentives to teachers are by no means new (e.g.,
Murnane and Cohen 1986). A recent body of smaller-scale experimental studies (e.g., Springer et
al. 2010) suggests that short-term financial incentives linked only to the test performance of a
teacher’s students are largely ineffective. However, IMPACT has several design features that
make it distinctive relative to the conventional teacher incentives piloted in prior studies. For
example, IMPACT has created especially high-powered incentives for teachers; most notably, a
dismissal threat for low-performing teachers but also exceptionally large financial rewards for
high-performing teachers. This design feature implies that IMPACT targets differential retention
of low- and high-performing teachers as well as performance-based financial incentives. A
second unique feature of IMPACT is that its incentives are linked to a multi-dimensional
measure of teacher performance (e.g., multiple classroom observations as well as test scores) that
is likely to have more validity than test scores alone (e.g., MET 2013). This targeted
performance measure may also enhance the efficacy of IMPACT’s incentives because it places
some weight on actions teachers control more clearly and directly (e.g., how their classroom
practice relates to defined standards of effective instruction). Third, DCPS provided teachers
                                                                                                          !

                                                                                                       3


with support to assist them in meeting IMPACT’s expectations (e.g., instructional coaches).
Fourth, the incentives created by IMPACT may have stronger credibility for teachers (and better
external validity as a policy) because they are part of an at-scale, real-world program that has
been sustained over several years rather than a small-scale and temporary experimental pilot.

    Unsurprisingly, this dramatic policy innovation in how teachers are evaluated, compensated,
and retained is a source of contention that has captured attention nationally. However, there is
relatively little empirical evidence on how IMPACT has actually influenced its core proximate
outcomes. In this study, we utilize unique longitudinal data on DCPS teachers to examine how
IMPACT relates to two centrally important policy outcomes: the differential retention of high
and low-performing teachers and subsequent teacher performance conditional on having been
retained. In part, we examine this question by presenting descriptive evidence based on the cross-
sectional patterns in teacher retention by their measured performance as well as the time-series
variation in overall teacher performance over the first three years of IMPACT. However, we
complement this evidence with inferences based on the strong incentive contrasts embedded
within IMPACT.

    More specifically, we present evidence from regression-discontinuity (RD) designs that
effectively compare the retention and performance outcomes among teachers whose prior-year
performance scores placed them near the threshold values that separated performance ratings
(and, by implication, the incentives they faced). For example, teachers whose IMPACT score
was 250 to 349 were rated as “Effective” (E) and experienced no unique or immediate
consequences with respect to their pay or their job security. In contrast, teachers with scores just
below this threshold were rated as “Minimally Effective” (ME), notified that they would be
dismissed if they did not become effective within just one year and did not receive a typical base
pay service credit as indicated on the salary schedule. We present evidence that whether a
teacher is just above or below this score threshold can be viewed as conditionally random. This
local variation also implies an unusually sharp incentive contrast (i.e., a dismissal threat) that
might influence teachers’ subsequent retention and performance outcomes.

    Another policy-relevant contrast exists among teachers near the 350-point IMPACT score
threshold that separates “Effective” from “Highly Effective” (HE) teachers. Teachers who
receive an HE rating immediately qualify for bonus pay. However, they also know that, if they


                                                                                                           !

achieve a second consecutive HE, they will receive a sizable and permanent increase in their
base pay (i.e., equivalent to 3 to 5 years of service credit). Such base-pay increases constitute
large, durable incentives that are not immediately available to the teachers who scored just below
this threshold.

    Our RD results indicate that dismissal threats had substantial effects, both increasing the
voluntary attrition of low-performing teachers and improving the performance of the previously
low-performing teachers who remained within DCPS. Furthermore, our RD design also suggests
that financial incentives further improved the performance of high-performing teachers. We
assess and discuss both the internal-validity threats to these RD designs as well as possible
construct-validity concerns related to the performance measures we study. We are also careful to
emphasize the stylized nature of the causal estimands that result from these RD designs. In
particular, it should be noted that the “localness” of these RD estimates implies that they do not
necessarily identify the average treatment effect associated with the introduction of IMPACT.
However, these results do provide reasonably credible evidence on the effects of the types of
novel performance incentives IMPACT introduced. Our study concludes with a discussion of the
relevance of this evidence for the ongoing efforts in many states and districts to design and
implement new systems of teacher evaluation and compensation.


BACKGROUND

Teacher Evaluation

The practice of teacher assessments has evolved rapidly in recent years. Traditionally, local
principals have evaluated the performance of individual teachers using procedures that are fairly
superficial, perfunctory, and relatively unstructured. The usual results of such “drive by”
assessments are simply to classify individual teachers as either satisfactory or unsatisfactory.
These binary designations have typically implied few, if any, direct and meaningful outcomes for
teachers (i.e., for compensation, advancement, or professional development). In fact, under these
less structured approaches, nearly all teachers are usually rated as satisfactory (Weisberg et al.,
2009). However, the policy imperative to more accurately assess the considerable variation in
teacher performance has motivated new innovations in the practice of teacher assessment.



                                                                                                          !
    !
                                                                                                     5


    The intent of these measures is to accurately and reliably differentiate teacher effectiveness
and to provide a basis on which to target a variety of personnel actions (e.g., professional
development, tenure, financial rewards, and dismissals). Researchers continue to make progress
toward improving the validity and reliability of systems of teacher assessments. However, a
growing consensus underscores the importance of a balanced approach based on articulating
clear and objective standards for teaching practice, relying on multiple sources of data, and
employing multiple, carefully trained evaluators (e.g., MET 2013, Goe and Croft 2009, Pianta
and Hamre 2009, Danielson and McGreal 2000). Notably, the final recommendations of the
Measures of Effective Teaching (MET) project, a three-year study that leveraged a random-
assignment design to explore the measurement of effective teaching, provides evidence that
teacher effectiveness is best identified by simultaneously employing measures based on student
achievement gains, rigorous classroom observations, and student surveys (MET 2013).

    The seminal IMPACT teacher-evaluation system, which we describe in more detail below,
is broadly consistent with these emerging best-practice design principles. However, the
evaluation systems currently being implemented in many other school districts appear to remain
as works in progress while public officials continue to grapple with a variety of implementation
challenges (e.g., McNeil, 2013b; Ujifusa, 2013). As a result of this ongoing expansion of more
rigorous teacher-assessment systems, there is as yet little evidence on their ability to improve
teacher performance and student achievement. One exception is Taylor and Tyler (2012) who
present evidence, based on the phase-in of teacher evaluations in Cincinnati schools, that merely
having a rigorous evaluation (i.e., one with largely informal consequences) improves teacher
performance. They find that the students of teachers who have been evaluated improve
achievement by 10 percent of a standard deviation more than students of non-evaluated teachers.



Teacher Incentives

The rigid single-salary schedules, which dictate the compensation received by most public
school teachers, have been nearly universal in U.S. public schools for well over half of a century.
However, throughout this period, there have also been frequent state and local efforts to provide
teachers with “merit pay” incentives of various types (Springer 2009). These initiatives have
included teacher rewards for student performance (e.g., test scores or graduation rates), for

                                                                                                         !
    !
                                                                                                                 6


acquiring skills and certification and for assuming additional professional responsibilities (i.e.,
“career ladders”) as well as differentiated compensation for teachers of high-need subjects and in
hard-to-staff schools. Proponents of teacher incentives argue that they can drive improvements in
student outcomes through multiple channels: (1) by providing financial incentives for teachers to
focus or increase their effort (2) by encouraging the development of stronger teaching skills, (3)
by increasing incentives for high performing teachers to enter or remain in schools subject to the
incentives, and (4) by altering the selection of individuals into teaching towards those who are
more able to benefit from such a reward system.
     However, in general, these incentive programs piloted over the last 50 years have been
modestly sized and short lived. In a classic article, Murnane and Cohen (1986) argue that the
failure of most merit-pay programs for teachers is rooted in a fundamental “evaluation problem.”
That is, they argued that the support for such initiatives quickly erodes because the inherently
“imprecise” nature of effective teaching (e.g., idiosyncratic, multi-dimensional, and
collaborative) renders most types of incentives capricious and demoralizing.1 In contrast, Ballou
(2001) notes that merit pay is used more widely and successfully in private schools, which
suggests that there is nothing unique about educational settings that make incentives infeasible.
He instead attributes the frequent dismantling of teacher incentives to union opposition.
     Despite the prevalence of teacher-compensation reforms, the available empirical evidence
on the effects of teacher incentives has, until quite recently, been thin and methodologically
weak.2 However, several recent district-specific studies have provided carefully identified
evidence the extent to which the productivity of existing teachers increases when they are
provided with financial incentives (i.e., the first margin enumerated above). For example, the
Project on Incentives in Teaching (POINT) was a 3-year study that provided randomly assigned
middle-school mathematics teachers in Nashville individual bonuses of as much as $15,000 if
their students met ambitious performance thresholds (Springer et al. 2010). The availability of
these incentives led to no detectable effects on measured student performance or on measures of
teacher effort and classroom practice.

       However, using data from the Project STAR experiment, Dee and Keys (2004) show that a comparatively
sophisticated system (i.e., Tennessee’s now-defunct program of financial and career-ladder incentives based on
multi-faceted evaluations) does generally target rewards to more effective teachers.

    A second random-assignment study provided New York City teachers with rewards up to
$3,000 for meeting performance targets (Fryer 2013). In this study, treatment schools had
flexibility in designing their incentives and most chose group-based incentives. The impact
estimates from this study suggest that the presence of these incentives did not raise school
performance and may have even lowered it. A third random-assignment trial of group-based
teacher incentives of as much as $6,000 was fielded in a suburban school district in Texas and
found no evidence of effects on student outcomes or teachers’ attitudes and practices (Springer et
al. 2012). A fourth teacher-incentive study set in 9 schools outside of Chicago found no effects
from conventional individual or group-based incentives of as much as $8,000 but substantial
gains in student performance when the incentives were instead framed as a loss rather than a gain
(Fryer et al. 2012). Interestingly, the dismissal threats that exist in IMPACT share this “loss
aversion” feature.
    A fifth study was conducted in 34 Chicago schools that were randomly assigned to when
(but not if) they implemented the Teacher Advancement Program (TAP). Under this program,
teachers were eligible to receive payouts of as much as $6,400 for their contribution to the
achievement-based value added of their students (at the school and school-grade level) and their
performance on a classroom observation rubric. Under TAP, teachers could also earn extra pay
for undertaking the increased responsibilities associated with promotion to a mentoring or master
status. The evidence from this study suggests that random assignment to TAP did not raise
student achievement (Glazerman and Seifullah, 2012). However, the program implementation
did not occur entirely as intended. Teacher payouts were smaller than the originally stated targets
and there were no rewards based on value added because the requisite linked data systems were
inadequate (Glazerman and Seifullah, 2012).

    The prevalence of null findings from these recent, district-specific studies obviously raises
considerable doubt about the promise of teachers’ compensation-based incentives as a lever for
driving improvements in teacher performance. One possible explanation for this body of
evidence is that teachers already tend to be highly motivated agents for whom additional
incentives elicit little behavioral response. Furthermore, it may be that teachers generally lack the
willingness (or, possibly, the capacity) to respond to incentives that are linked narrowly and
exclusively to test scores. We also note that none of these small-scale experiments have been
situated in broad-based strategy for the recruitment, professional development and retention of

                                                                                                        !

effective teachers, especially over the long run. That is, it may be that teacher incentives are
more effective when they are viewed as enduring rather than as a temporary pilot. The efficacy
of teacher incentives may also turn on the simultaneous presence of professional support and
training for teachers. Finally, it could also be that some of the benefits of enduring performance-
based compensation for teachers are due to the differential recruitment and retention of high-
quality teachers rather than improvements in the performance of extant teachers.



The Structure of IMPACT

In the current context, there are several substantive reasons that IMPACT offers a unique
opportunity to examine the effects of a robust package of performance-based teacher incentives.
First, as we describe below, IMPACT introduced exceptionally high-powered incentives (i.e., the
threat of dismissal for low-performing teachers as well as substantially larger financial incentives
for high-performing teachers). Second, these incentives were linked to a multi-faceted measure
of teacher performance consistent with emerging best practices (e.g., clearly articulated
standards, the use of several data sources including several structured classroom observations)
rather than simply to test scores alone. Third, IMPACT also provided teachers with supports
(e.g., instructional coaches) to assist them in meeting their prescribed expectations. Fourth,
IMPACT is not a small-scale, temporary pilot but rather a highly visible at-scale initiative whose
capacity to endure was tested during a contentious mayoral election that coincided with the
program’s first year.

        The basic structure of how teacher performance is measured under IMPACT is relatively
straightforward. Following the conclusion of each academic year (i.e., beginning with AY 2009-
10), individual DCPS teachers are provided with a single score that summarizes their
performance on multiple measures for the academic year (Table 1). The central component of the
overall score for most teachers is based on rigorously scored classroom observations tied to the
district’s Teaching and Learning Framework (TLF). The TLF specifies the criteria by which
DCPS defines effective instruction and structures a scoring rubric. The TLF includes multiple
domains such as leading well-organized, objective-driven lessons, checking for student




                                                                                                          !
    !
                                                                                                                   9


understanding, explaining content clearly, and maximizing instructional time.3 A teacher’s TLF
score is typically based on five formal observations: 3 by an administrator (e.g., a principal or
assistant principal) and 2 by a “master educator” (i.e., an expert practitioner who travels across
multiple schools to conduct TLF observations independently of administrators). Only the
administrator’s first observation is announced in advance.

          A second component of a teacher’s overall score is based exclusively or in part on the test
performance of their students. More specifically, for “Group 1” teachers, these scores include
their calculated “Individual Value Added” (IVA): a teacher’s estimated contribution to the
achievement growth of their students as measured on the DC Comprehensive Assessment
System (CAS) tests and conditional on student and peer traits.4 The “Group 1” teachers for
whom IVA is calculated are only those for whom the available CAS data allow for the estimation
of value added (i.e., only reading and math teachers in grades 4 through 8). The IVA measure is
not defined for the majority of DCPS teachers (i.e., about 83 percent of the general-education
teachers in DCPS). In lieu of an IVA score, these teachers instead receive a Teacher-Assessed
Student-Achievement (TAS) score. At the beginning of each academic year, teachers choose
(and administrators approve) learning goals based on non-CAS assessments. At the end of the
year, administrators rate the teacher’s success in meeting these goals using a rubric that
emphasizes student learning or content mastery.

     All teachers are also assessed by their administrators on a rubric that measures their support
of school initiatives, efforts to promote high expectations, and partnerships with students’
families and school colleagues: the Commitment to the School Community (CSC) measure.
Teachers also received a score based on the their school’s estimated value added on the CAS
tests (SVA). Finally, principals assess each teacher on their “Core Professionalism” (CP). The
rubric for CP rates teachers on the basis of attendance, punctuality, policies and procedures and
respect. Teachers are assumed to be professionals, and, therefore, CP scores can only reduce a

        In IMPACT’s second year, DCPS revised the TLF framework by reducing the number of standards from 13
to 9 and by eliminating some redundancies among these standards. Principal training on the corresponding scoring
rubric was also increased.

        Teacher value-added is converted to a 1-4 scale using a conversion table. In 2009-10 and 2010-11, the mean
teacher value-added was equated to an IVA score of 2.5 with relatively few teachers receiving either a 1.0 or a 4.0.
In 2011-12 the mean teacher value-added score was equated to an IVA score of 3.0 and the relatively more teachers
were assigned to 1 and 4. This had the net effect of increasing average IVA scores by 0.25 in 2011-12. Because of
these adjustments, we avoid any year-to-year comparisons for IMPACT scores or their components. Note this does
not affect the within-year comparisons employed in the RD analysis.

                                                                                                                       !

teacher’s overall IMPACT score. In 2011-12, 12 percent of teachers had their IMPACT scores
reduced and these penalties averaged 19 points.

    The weighted average of these component scores constitutes a teacher’s overall IMPACT
score. For the majority of general-education teachers in DCPS (i.e., those in Group 2), the TLF
observational rubric constitutes 75% of their IMPACT score with TAS, CSC, and SVA scores
constituting the remainder (Table 1). For the smaller number of Group 1 teachers, 50% of their
overall score is based on their estimated IVA and an additional 25% is based on TLF (Table 1).
Each component score ranges from 1 to 4 and the overall score is the weighted sum of these,
multiplied by 100, so that a teacher’s overall score ranges from 100 to 400 prior to possible
deductions for CP violations.

    These summative IMPACT scores determine high-stakes outcomes for teachers. From
2009-10 through 2011-12, IMPACT scores allocated teachers to four performance categories:
Highly Effective (HE) teachers (scores of 350 or higher), Effective (E) teachers (scores from 250
to 349), Minimally Effective (ME) teachers (scores from 175 to 249) and Ineffective (I) teachers
(scores below 175). Figure 1 plots the distribution of IMPACT scores for each year. Those
teachers whose score implied an I rating were immediately dismissed. Teachers with an ME
rating are subject to a dismissal threat: forcible separation if their next rating is not E or HE.
Under “IMPACTplus”, DCPS also provided rewards to high-performing teachers.

    Specifically, from 2009-10 through 2011-12, IMPACTplus provided a one-time bonus to
teachers with HE IMPACT ratings. Table 2 shows that these one-time bonuses could amount to
as much as $25,000. The size of the bonuses varied based on whether the teacher taught in a poor
school (defined to be a school where the percentage of free and reduced price lunch eligible
students was at least 60 percent), whether the teacher was in Group 1 (teachers with value-added
scores), and whether the teacher taught a high-need subject. Interestingly, IMPACTplus also
provides strong financial base-pay incentives for sustaining high performance. In 2009-10
through 2011-12, two consecutive years of HE ratings jumped teachers in schools with at least
60 percent free and reduced price lunch eligible students across 5 years of service credits and the
Masters degree lane in the salary schedule. The reward for teachers in schools with fewer than 60
percent of their students eligible for free and reduced price lunch was 3 years of service and the
Masters degree lane. The exact magnitude of this base-pay increase also depends on where a


                                                                                                          !

teacher is currently situated on the salary schedule. However, these base pay increases can be as
large as $27,000 per year. For most teachers, the present discounted value of this permanent pay
increase can be substantial. For example, consider a novice teacher just entering employment in
DCPS with no prior teaching experience who has a bachelor’s degree and currently works in a
high-poverty school. At a discount rate of 5 percent (and the differential returns to years of
service embedded in the DCPS salary schedule), being twice highly effective implies salary
increases over the next 15 years that are worth $185,259 in current dollars. This is a 29 percent
increase in the current value of total earnings over this period. These design features of IMPACT
illustrate how the performance bands create sharp incentive contrasts for teachers with scores
local to the ME/E threshold (i.e., dismissal threats) and the HE/E threshold (i.e., the possibility of
a large base-pay increase). We discuss below the considerable promise of RD designs that can
credibly identify the effects of these incentive contrasts on teacher retention and performance.



IMPACT DATA
Our analysis is based on teacher-level administrative data on all DCPS teachers and their
students over the first three years of IMPACT (i.e., AY 2009-10 through AY 2011-12). For
purposes of comparability, we limit our analytical sample to general-education teachers (i.e.,
IMPACT Groups 1 and 2) who worked in schools that served students in grades K through 12.5
For each teacher-year observation, we have data on several observed teacher traits such as race,
sex, group status (i.e., IMPACT group 1 or 2), graduate degree, and years of experience (Table
3).6 We also have several variables characterizing the school in which the teacher worked (e.g.,
racial-ethnic composition, school level, and the share of students eligible for free or reduced-
price lunches).

     Our data set also contains other teacher-specific data directly related to IMPACT. These
include a teacher’s IMPACT rating and score as well as their scores on the IMPACT score
components (i.e., TLF, IVA, CSC, TAS, and core professionalism). It should be noted that we

       This excludes special-education schools and other non-standard programs as well as teachers with highly
specialized assignments (i.e., mostly special-education teachers but all those serving only English Language
learners, instructional aides and coaches, teachers of incarcerated youths, etc.).
     6
        We constructed teacher experience through cross-referencing repeated cross-sections of several
administrative sources (e.g., human-resources data, end-of-year snapshots, and position on the salary schedule).
Taken together, these allowed us to develop a more complete and reliable variable.

                                                                                                                        !

observe each teacher’s initial score and rating as well as their final score and rating, which
reflects any repeals or revisions. Such revisions were uncommon, particularly after the first year
of IMPACT. Nonetheless, given the potential endogeneity concerns, our regression-discontinuity
(RD) analysis treats the initial IMPACT score and rating as the relevant “intent to treat” (ITT)
variables (Table 3).

     We also used the administrative data available through DCPS to identify whether a teacher
rated under the IMPACT system remained employed by DCPS through the next academic year
or left for whatever reason (e.g., resignation, retirement, dismissal, or death). This construction
means that the two broad outcomes of interest – retention and teacher performance conditional
on retention – are observed for two cross-sections of DCPS teachers: AY 2010-11 teacher
outcomes as a function of 2009-10 IMPACT ratings and AY 2011-12 teacher outcomes as a
function of 2010-11 IMPACT ratings.

     The descriptive evidence we present is based on these annual cross-sections of teachers.
That is, in each year, we observe approximately 2,630 teachers.7 However, several further
considerations shaped the samples used in our regression-discontinuity (RD) analyses. For
example, for our study of the incentive contrasts that exist at the threshold between minimally
effective (ME) and effective (E) teachers, we limited the sample to teachers whose initial
IMPACT rating placed them in either the ME or E performance bands. This construction allows
us to avoid any complications that might be related to other incentive-relevant thresholds in the
analytical sample.

     An additional complication is that teachers who received a second ME rating based on their
performance during the 2010-11 school year were dismissed automatically under IMPACT.
Therefore, their non-retention in DCPS is simply a mechanical effect of this policy rather than
voluntary teacher attrition in response to IMPACT incentives. To focus our attention on the
choices made by teachers in response to IMPACT’s incentives, our RD analysis excludes those
2010-11 teachers who had been rated minimally effective in the prior academic year.8 Overall,

     !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
     7
        For purposes of our descriptive evidence, we define teacher retention more finely, distinguishing among
teachers who stayed in their school versus transferring as well as whether non-retained teachers left voluntarily (e.g.,
retirement) or were dismissed. Figure 2 omits teachers who transferred within DCPS to non-teaching positions. In
2009-10 and 2010-11, these teachers constituted 1.7 percent of all teachers in the sample.
      8
        Unsurprisingly, if we instead included the teachers who were forcibly dismissed after a 2nd ME rating, the
negative retention effects of an ME rating would appear to be substantially larger.

                                                                                                                           !

                                                                                                     13


this sample construction implies that the RD analysis of the minimally effective threshold is
based on 4,178 teacher-by-year observations (Table 3). That is, we observe 2010-11 retention
and performance outcomes among 2,170 teachers in the ME and E bands during the 2009-10
academic year. And we observe 2011-12 retention and performance outcomes among the 2,008
teachers who were at risk of receiving their first ME rating based on their 2010-11 performance.

    The analytical sample used in our RD analysis of the threshold that separates effective (E)
and highly effective (HE) teachers reflected similar concerns and adjustments. That is, we first
limited the sample to teachers whose initial IMPACT rating placed them in the E or HE
categories. We also focus exclusively on the first cohort of IMPACT teachers (i.e., 2010-11
retention and performance outcomes among the 2,132 teachers rated on their 2009-10
performance). Among the subsequent cohort of teachers, an HE rating conflates the mechanical
consequences for teachers who had been rated HE in the previous year (i.e., they permanently
advance on the salary schedule) with the incentive effects for teachers who received their first
HE rating at this time (i.e., they have an opportunity to advance permanently on the salary
schedule). Our interest is in the latter effect. However, as it turns out, relatively few teachers (n =
100) received their first HE rating based on 2010-11 performance (i.e., the large majority of
those rated HE had an HE rating in the prior year as well). To avoid obscuring the fact that the
identifying variation for the RD analysis of the HE threshold is largely defined for IMPACT’s
first year, we exclude the second year from our analysis. However, including these data leaves
our results qualitatively unchanged.

        Table 3 presents descriptive statistics for these two analytical samples. We see that the
mean teacher retention rate is somewhat lower in the “minimally effective” RD sample (i.e., 84
percent) than in the “highly effective” RD sample (i.e., 88 percent). Unsurprisingly, the “post
treatment” IMPACT scores are, on average, higher for teachers in the HE analysis than in the
ME analysis (i.e., by approximately 10 IMPACT points). However, the other teacher and school-
level traits largely similar across these two samples. Interestingly, the individual value-added
(IVA) scores received by teachers were also similar across the ME and HE analytical samples.

    As noted earlier, these IVA scores were based on how a teacher’s students performed on the
DC Comprehensive Assessment System (CAS) tests. Allegations of cheating on the DC CAS
have received extensive coverage in the press. There are several reasons we believe these


                                                                                                          !

allegations are not empirically relevant for the analysis we present here. First and foremost, these
test-based measures of teacher performance were only relevant for Group 1 teachers under
IMPACT and these teachers constitute less than 20 percent of the analytical samples in our RD
analysis. Furthermore, our results are robust to excluding these teachers from our analysis.
Second, we observe performance separately on all of IMPACT’s subcomponent (i.e., IVA and
TLF, CSC, TAS, and CP) so we can distinguish performance gains related to CAS scores and
those measured in other ways. Third, the most prominent allegations of cheating on the DC CAS
actually pre-date the introduction of IMPACT (Gillum and Bellow, 2011; Brown, 2013). Fourth,
during the IMPACT era, DCPS hired independent test-security firms (i.e., Caveon Test Security;
Alvarez and Marsal) to assess potential violations. They identified critical violations in no more
than a dozen classrooms per year. We have acquired identifiers for the teachers of these
classrooms and we find that excluding this quite small number of teachers from our analysis has
no practical relevance for the magnitudes or statistical significance of the effects we report.


REGRESSION DISCONTINUITY (RD) DESIGNS
Our RD analyses effectively compare outcomes among teachers whose initial IMPACT scores
placed them near the ME/E threshold or near the E/HE threshold. As discussed above, each of
these two thresholds implies a sharp and unique contrast in teacher incentives. Teachers who just
failed to perform at the effective level face a performance-based employment threat that teachers
with effective ratings do not. Furthermore, teachers who performed just well enough to earn a
highly effective rating have an incentive that effective teachers do not (i.e., the opportunity to
earn a permanent increase in base salary).

    Our approach to analyzing these discontinuities in teacher incentives has multiple
components. Initially, our analysis focuses on basic graphical evidence (Lee and Lemieux 2009,
Schochet et al. 2010). Specifically, we present figures that illustrate how a teacher’s final
IMPACT rating as well as future outcomes (i.e., retention and performance) vary with the
“assignment variable” in this design (i.e., their initial IMPACT score). This graphical evidence
provides a compellingly transparent way in which to view this study’s key findings as well as
some ad-hoc guidance relevant to the functional-form considerations for the corresponding
regression-based evidence.


                                                                                                          !
    !
                                                                                                    15


    We estimate the magnitude and statistical significance of these discontinuities through least-
squares specifications that take the following form for outcome Yi associated with teacher i:

                            Yi = αI(Si ≤ 0) + f (Si ) + θX i + ε i                                 (1)
In this specification, Xi represents teacher covariates and εi is a mean-zero random error term. In
our preferred specifications, we also condition on fixed effects unique to each of the roughly 120
                 €
schools in the analytical samples. The variable, Si, is the assignment variable (i.e., the teacher’s
initial IMPACT score) centered on the relevant threshold. Specifically, for our analysis of the
effect of ME status on teacher outcomes, we centered teacher’s initial IMPACT scores on 249 so
that Si ≤ 0 implies an “intent-to-treat” (ITT) as an ME teacher. That is, the parameter, α,
identifies the “jump” in outcomes for teachers initially rated at or below the ME threshold and
conditional on a smooth function of the assignment variable, f(Si). Our regression-based
estimates for the E/HE threshold are similarly structured. However, in those specifications, we
centered the initial IMPACT score on 350 and instead estimated the discontinuity that occurs
where I(Si ≥ 0). This approach identifies the jump in outcomes for teachers whose initial
IMPACT score implied an intent-to-treat as a highly effective teacher.

        Our RD analysis also reflects several other considerations and ancillary robustness
checks that have been recommended in recent reviews of RD designs (Lee and Lemieux 2009,
Schochet et al. 2010). For example, one key consideration involves the manner in which the
regression specification controls for the underlying effects associated with the assignment
variable (i.e., f(Si)). In most of the specifications we present, we assume a linear relationship but
allow this to vary above and below the relevant thresholds. Both the graphical evidence and the
information criteria from alternative specifications affirm this approach. Nonetheless, we also
discuss the results of specifications that condition on higher-order polynomials of the assignment
variable. Furthermore, our appendix also presents the results from nonparametric “local linear
regressions,” which are based on the subset of observations in increasingly tight bandwidths
around each threshold.

        The internal validity of the RD results we present turns on the assumption that whether a
teacher was initially assigned above or below a given threshold is conditionally random. One
potential threat to this key assumption concerns the possible manipulation of the assignment
variable. That is, if some teachers were able to have their initial scores adjusted so that they were

                                                                                                         !

                                                                                                    16


systematically able to adjust their initial rating, the RD design outlined here would not provide
valid causal inferences. To be clear, the fact that teachers may exert effort to improve their
IMPACT scores is not confounding per se (Lee and Lemiuex 2009). Rather, manipulation would
instead invalidate the RD design if teachers with unobserved and outcome-relevant traits were
systematically able to manipulate their initial rating (i.e., whether their score was above a
threshold).

        Our institutional knowledge of how initial IMPACT scores were generated (and
aggregated) strongly suggests that such manipulation did not occur. However, we also present
statistical evidence that speaks to these concerns. For example, we briefly discuss in our
appendix the evidence from density tests (McCrary 2008), which fail to reject the null hypothesis
that the distribution of observations is smoothly distributed around each threshold. That is, there
is no evidence of the frequency of observations clustering on one side of a threshold (which
would have suggested manipulation). Our appendix also presents evidence from auxiliary RD
regressions that examine the balance of observed teacher traits around each threshold. In the
presence of non-random sorting around the threshold, we might expect some teacher traits to be
clustered on one side of the threshold. Our appendix also presents one additional robustness
check based estimating the effects of “placebo” RDs along with the actual threshold relevant
under IMPACT. Under the maintained assumptions of the RD design, we would expect the
effects of IMPACT’s incentive to be concentrated at the 249 and 350-point thresholds that
implied a rating change and not at other thresholds which have no practical relevance. In our
results section, we also discuss potential confounds that are unique to this setting (e.g., non-
random teacher mobility and rating biases for threatened teachers).

        This evidence generally affirms the causal warrant of the RD results we present (i.e.,
particularly for the effects we find on the ME/E threshold). However, in our final discussion of
these RD results, we underscore several important external-validity caveats. Arguably, the most
important of these concerns the “localness” of the RD estimands. The RD designs used here
identify the effects of IMPACT’s strong incentive contrasts for the teachers near these
thresholds. These local inferences provide an important proof of concept for the role that teacher
incentives can play. However, they do not necessarily correspond to an average treatment effect
(ATE) of IMPACT. In contrast, issues related to whether teachers were “compliers” with their
original intent-to-treat status under IMPACT have less empirical relevance. For the key effects
                                                                                                         !

we report, there is little to no “fuzziness” in the relationship between teachers’ initial IMPACT
rating and their final ratings.



RESULTS

Descriptive Evidence

Relative to typical teacher assessments systems, IMPACT creates substantial differentiation in its
teacher ratings. Figure 1 shows the distribution of IMPACT scores for AY 2009-10 through AY
2011-12. In AY 2011-12, 16 percent of teachers earned a Highly Effective rating while 15
percent of teachers are rated Ineffective or Minimally Effective. Between 2009-10 and 2011-12
mean IMPACT scores improved by 10 points or about 20 percent of a teacher-level standard
deviation. The improvement in teacher performance is suggestive that IMPACT may have had
some of its intended effects. It is also possible that these improvements may have simply resulted
from other changes in DCPS that coincided with IMPACT.

     Figure 2 describes differential retention of teachers during 2010-11 and 2011-12. This
pattern is also consistent with IMPACT shaping a higher-performing workforce. On average, 3.8
percent of all teachers were dismissed as a result of being rated Ineffective once or twice
Minimally Effective.9 In addition to these mechanical dismissals, IMPACT may encourage some
low-performing teachers who otherwise would have remained to voluntarily exit DCPS. Thirty
percent of first-time Minimally Effective teachers voluntarily exit DCPS while only 13 percent
of teachers who are Effective or Highly Effective do so. As might be expected, Minimally
Effective teachers closest to the Effective threshold are more likely to remain in DCPS than
those furthest from it. Only 28 percent of first-time Minimally Effective teachers whose
IMPACT scores are within 25 points of the Effective threshold (IMPACT scores of 225-249)
voluntary exit DCPS, while 39 percent of those within 25 points of the Ineffective threshold
(IMPACT scores of 175-199) voluntarily exit. These descriptive outcomes are consistent with a
restructuring of the teaching workforce that is implied by the incentives embedded in IMPACT.
Less effective teachers under a threat of dismissal are more likely to voluntarily leave than
teachers not subject to this threat, and those furthest from the threshold even more likely.

      We observe five teachers (.06 percent of all teachers) rated Ineffective who remained due to the appeals
process and eight whose official designation identifies a different form of exit.

                                                                                                                      !

However, other theories of behavior are also consistent with these outcomes. For example, we
know from other school districts that less effective early-career teachers are more likely to exit
than more effective novice teachers (Boyd et al, 2011; Murnane, 1984; Hanushek et al., 2005;
Goldhaber et al. 2007). We also know from the DCPS data that IMPACT scores for teachers in
their first two years of teaching average 17 points less than those with three or more years of
experience. Such considerations raise doubts about how to interpret the cross-sectional and time-
series evidence from IMPACT. Are we observing the effects of IMPACT incentives or merely
observing behavior that would have occurred in the absence of IMPACT? We explore this issue
more rigorously employing the RD analysis below.


Assignment to Treatment

The logic of a univariate RD design turns in part on the evidence that small changes in an
assignment variable lead to large and discontinuous changes in treatment status. With regard to
IMPACT, this occurs to the extent that the initial IMPACT scores received by teachers strongly
and discontinuously influence their final IMPACT status (and the corresponding incentives they
face). In Figure 3, we illustrate these “first-stage” relationships for the discontinuities we study.
These figures are based on organizing DCPS teachers into 5-point bins based on their initial
IMPACT scores (e.g., 245-249, 250-254, etc.) and identifying the share of teachers within these
bins with a final status as an ME or HE teacher.
    Panel (a) of Figure 3 illustrates this relationship for the first year of IMPACT and ME status.
For teachers with initial scores in the effective range (i.e., 250 or higher), the probability of being
rated as an ME teacher was zero. However, for teachers with initial IMPACT scores in the ME
range, the probability of a final ME rating for AY 2009-10 jumps dramatically to approximately
80 percent. Notably, this relationship reflects some fuzziness: an initial ME rating did not
perfectly predict a final ME rating. This is due to the fact that some teachers (i.e., 85 out of the
436) were able to appeal successfully their initial IMPACT rating as an ME teacher in
IMPACT’s first year. Because our research design leverages the variation in incentives
generated by initial scores, this fuzziness is not an internal-validity threat. However, it does
suggest the possibility of an external-validity caveat: the resulting causal estimands may only be
defined for teachers who “complied” with their initial assignment.


                                                                                                            !

    This consideration is not relevant for the remaining discontinuities where the relationship
between initial scores and teachers’ final ratings is “sharp” or virtually so. For example, based on
their AY 2010-11 performance, 303 teachers in the analytical sample were initially assigned an
ME rating. As panel (b) in Figure 3 indicates virtually of these teachers (i.e., all but 3) retained
this status. This contrast across the first two years of IMPACT suggests the District was more
flexible in the consideration of appeals of ME status during IMPACT’s first year.
    However, this flexibility did not extend to HE ratings. Panel (c) in Figure 3 demonstrates
that, in IMPACT’s first year, there is fully sharp first-stage relationship between initial IMPACT
scores and HE status. That is, no teacher in the HE analytical sample changed the IMPACT
rating implied by an initial score. In appendix Table 1, we present the parametric estimates of all
the first-stage effects presented in Figure 3. The corresponding standard errors illustrate the
precision of these effects and suggest the statistical power of these RD designs to identify
reduced-form effects on the outcomes of interest.


Graphical Evidence
We begin presenting this study’s core findings in an unrestrictive and visual manner that closely
parallels the first-stage evidence discussed above. That is, Figures 4 and 5 present the conditional
means for the next-year teacher outcomes (i.e., retention and performance) as a function of each
teacher’s initial IMPACT score in the prior year. This approach allows us to view how the
outcomes of interest vary with the underlying variable that generates strongly discontinuous
changes in teacher incentives.
    Panel (a) in Figure 4 focuses on teacher retention in AY 2010-11 as a function of their initial
AY 2009-10 IMPACT score. This figure illustrates a noticeable drop (i.e., of roughly 5
percentage points) in teacher retention at the threshold that separated minimally effective and
effective teachers. This finding suggests that teachers facing a dismissal threat under IMPACT
were noticeably more likely to leave voluntarily. The mean retention rate among the teachers in
these 5-point bins becomes noisier among the lowest-performing teachers. However, this reflects
in part that there are fewer teachers in the bins that are in the far left of the performance
distribution.
    Panel (b) of Figure 4 illustrates the retention effects for teachers near the ME threshold in
IMPACT’s second year. That is, this figure indicates how the probability a DCPS teacher was

                                                                                                            !

retained in AY 2011-12 relates to the initial IMPACT score they received based on their AY
2010-11 performance. It should be noted that teachers were notified of these scores during the
summer of 2011. This was the second summer during which teachers who had been rated as
ineffective were dismissed and the first time that teachers with two consecutive ME ratings were
dismissed. Panel (b) indicates that teachers receiving their first ME rating at this time were
significantly less likely to return to DCPS for the subsequent academic year. That is, at the
threshold where initial IMPACT scores imply an ME rating, we see teacher retention drop by
more than 10 percentage points.
    Panel (c) of Figure 4 examines the 2010-11 retention probabilities for teachers whose initial
IMPACT scores for 2009-10 placed them proximate to the HE/E threshold. Interestingly,
retention during this period was noticeably higher among the higher-performing teachers (i.e.,
near the HE/E threshold, teacher retention was roughly 90 percent). However, this figure
suggests that, for teachers just at or above the HE threshold (i.e., those with an opportunity to
earn a base-pay increase), retention was higher by approximately 3 percentage points. This
pattern is consistent with the hypothesis that, among higher-performing teachers, the opportunity
to earn performance-based financial rewards increased retention.
    In Figure 5, we turn to presenting the performance effects of these incentive contrasts for
teachers who remained within DCPS. For example, panel (a) of Figure 5 illustrates how the
2010-11 IMPACT scores of teachers relates to their initial 2009-10 IMPACT scores. This figure
suggests that, in IMPACT’s first year, the dismissal threat implied by an ME rating did not
induce detectable changes in teacher performance. Panel (b) shows the performance effects of
IMPACT’s dismissal threats for the second year of IMPACT. That is, panel (b) illustrates how
2011-12 teacher performance varied with the incentive contrasts generated by their initial 2010-
11 performance scores. Notably, these outcomes are measured after the summer of 2011 when
DCPS, for the first time, dismissed teachers with consecutive ME ratings.
    Interestingly, panel (b) suggests a sizable jump in 2011-12 teacher performance (i.e., in
excess of 10 points) among those teachers whose initial IMPACT scores placed them under the
newly credible dismissal threat implied by an ME rating. This evidence is consistent with the
hypothesis that previously low-performing teachers, who remained in DCPS, despite the
dismissal threat they faced, undertook steps to meaningfully improve their performance.
However, to some extent, the results in panel (b) could indicate that those teachers who had

                                                                                                         !
    !
                                                                                                      21


private information about their effectiveness (i.e., that their measured performance would
improve even if they behaved no differently) were more likely to stay as DCPS teachers. We
suspect that teachers are unlikely to have the sort of information that would allow for this
positive selection. Regardless, as a policy matter, this distinction (whether these results reflect
teacher improvements or the positive selection of higher-quality teachers) is not particularly
relevant.
    Panel (c) presents evidence on whether 2010-11 teacher performance increased for teachers
who were initially rated at or above the HE threshold based on their 2009-10 performance. These
teachers have a powerful financial incentive to continue to perform well because a second
consecutive HE rating would imply a permanent increase in base salary. Panel (c) of Figure 5
suggests that there was a noticeable jump in teacher performance (i.e., roughly 10 percentage
points) for those who faced these positive financial incentives.


Parametric Results – Retention and Performance
The graphical results discussed above suggest that the dismissal threat implied by an ME rating
led to the voluntary attrition of low-performing teachers and improvements in the performance of
those who remained (i.e., at least in IMPACT’s second year when the dismissal threat implied by
ME ratings had established credibility). There is also suggestive evidence that the financial
incentives implied by having once been rated HE led to improvements in teacher performance
(but not retention). This visual evidence is appealing for several reasons (e.g., its face validity
and lack of modeling assumptions). However, it does not allow us to explicitly estimate these
effects, to quantify their statistical uncertainty, or to flexibly explore their robustness.
    In Table 4, we present the RD estimates, which correspond to Figures 4 and 5 and allow for
these extensions. The left panel of Table 4 presents the reduced-form RD estimates where
teacher retention is the dependent variable. The first cell in the first row suggests that teachers
whose initial IMPACT scores placed them just below the effective threshold were 9 percentage
points less likely to be retained. Conditioning on teacher and school fixed effects reduces this
estimate to 7.3 percentage points but it remains statistically significant. However, the subsequent
two rows indicate that these effects were concentrated in the incentives generated by IMPACT’s
second year.



                                                                                                           !

                                                                                                                     22


     More specifically, the RD estimates indicate that, in IMPACT’s first year (i.e., AY 2009-
10), an ME rating reduced teacher retention by a statistically insignificant 3 to 6 percentage
points. However, among teachers who received their first ME rating in IMPACT’s second year
(i.e., AY 2010-11), these retention effects were two to three times larger. That is, an ME rating
implied that teacher retention fell by a statistically significant 11 to 13 percentage points. These
estimates are quite stable across specifications that introduce teacher controls and school-level
fixed effects.10 One way to frame the magnitude of these effects is to note that just above the ME
threshold, roughly 20 percent of teachers did not return to DCPS in the subsequent year. An ME
rating that increases this attrition by 11 percentage points implies an increase in teacher attrition
of more than 50 percent.
     This evidence implies that, in IMPACT’s second year (i.e., when the policy was more
clearly credible), the dismissal threat implied by an ME rating reduced teacher retention
dramatically. Similarly, the bottom left panel suggests that the positive financial incentives
implied by an HE rating increased teacher retention by roughly 3 percentage points. However,
these smaller estimates are not statistically distinguishable from zero.
     In the right panel of Table 4, we present the reduced-form RD estimates from specifications
where teacher performance as measured by their IMPACT score in the next year is the dependent
variable. It is worth underscoring here a point made earlier. At least for ME teachers in
IMPACT’s second year, the incentives created by IMPACT influenced whether a teacher was
observed in this analytical sample (i.e., whether they would have an IMPACT score in the year t
+ 1). However, in the presence of this selection effect, these RD estimates have particular
relevance because they indicate whether the teachers who chose to remain in DCPS performed at
a higher level. The full-sample results in Table 4 suggest that an ME rating had positive but
statistically insignificant effects on IMPACT scores.
     However, the subsequent two rows illustrate that these RD results mask the considerable
heterogeneity that existed across IMPACT’s first two years. An ME rating in IMPACT’s first
year had small and statistically insignificant effects on subsequent teacher performance.
However, in IMPACT’s second year, teachers who received ME ratings and chose to remain in

     !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
     10
        Specifications that also condition on quadratic and cubic polynomials also suggest that ME status reduces
teacher retention. However, both the information criteria based on these specifications (and the graphical evidence)
privilege specifications that allow for linear effects of the assignment variable that are allowed to differ on either
side of the threshold.

                                                                                                                          !

DCPS improved their performance in AY 2011-12 by a large and statistically significant amount
(i.e., roughly 12.6 IMPACT points in the specification that conditions on school fixed effects).
To put these RD estimates in perspective, it should be noted that the teacher-level standard
deviation of 2011-12 IMPACT scores among the full sample of group 1 and group 2 teachers is
roughly 46. So, these estimates imply an effect size of 0.27 SD (i.e., 12.6/46). The bottom right
panel of Table 4 presents estimates based on the HE/E threshold. These estimates similarly
indicate that base-pay financial incentives available to teachers on the HE side of the threshold
improved subsequent teacher performance by at least 10.9 points (i.e., an effect size of roughly
0.24).
    Because these estimates are based largely on observations of teacher effectiveness at the
teacher level, they do not have a conventional interpretation with respect to standard deviations
in student-level achievement. However, we can place the magnitudes of these estimates into
further perspective in two other ways. One is to note that, for 2011-12 teachers who performed
near the bottom of the effective range, a gain of 12.6 IMPACT points implies an increase of
approximately 5 percentile points (i.e., from the 10th to the 15th percentile) in the distribution of
teacher performance. Similarly, for 2011-12 teachers at the top of the effective band, a 10.9-point
gain is consistent with a 7-percentile increase (i.e., from the 78th to the 85th percentile). A second
way to frame these performance gains is to benchmark them against the improvements in
performance that are consistently observed during teachers’ first three years in the classroom.
These gains to experience are typically about 0.07 of a standard deviation of student achievement
(Atteberry et al., 2013; Clotfelter et al., 2006; Rivkin et al., 2005). Using a similar approach, we
estimate that the typical teacher who entered DCPS in 2009-10 with no prior teaching experience
improves by 24 IMPACT score points over the first three years of teaching. A gain of 12.6
IMPACT points for teachers at the ME threshold is 52 percent of this three-year gain; the 10.9
gains for teachers at the HE threshold is 41 percent.


Internal and Construct Validity
The RD results presented here suggest that the dismissal threats implied by an ME rating had
meaningful effects: inducing voluntary attrition among low-performing teachers and
improvements in the subsequent performance of those teachers who decided to remain. We also
find evidence that, for high-performing teachers, a stronger financial incentive did not induce

                                                                                                             !

detectable changes in retention but did meaningfully improve subsequent teacher performance.
Because these RD inferences are identified by small changes in teachers’ initial IMPACT scores
(in our preferred specifications, among teachers within the same schools), they have a credible
causal warrant. However, as suggested earlier, we explore the robustness of these causal
inferences through several types of evidence that are presented in an appendix. Density tests
(Figure A1) suggest that these initial scores were not systematically manipulated (i.e., they do
not cluster on either side of the threshold). Similarly, teacher covariates are generally balanced
around the thresholds (Table A2). Furthermore, the point estimates associated with the ME
threshold are robust as the sample is reduced to increasingly tight bandwidths around that
threshold (Table A3). Furthermore, “placebo” RD estimates indicate that retention and
performance effects are not found at other thresholds, which did not create incentive contrasts
(Table A5).
    The one notable exception to the robustness of these findings concerns the performance
effects at the HE/E threshold. In models that limit the sample to tighter bandwidths around this
threshold (i.e., roughly one third of the full sample), the magnitude of this effect is smaller and
statistically insignificant, though still sizable and positive (Table A4). The smaller effect
associated with this tighter bandwidth could reflect the fact that the “control” teachers (i.e., those
just below the HE threshold) also experienced quite strong incentives because they had been very
close to earning a substantial one-time bonus (as well as the opportunity for a permanent pay
increase). Some agnosticism is also suggested because the smaller point estimates also have
considerably more statistical uncertainty. Specifically, their 95-percent confidence intervals
include the point estimates based on the full sample. Regardless, this finding suggests there is
somewhat less certainty about the performance effects at this threshold.
    An entirely separate and important set of possible confounds concerns the construct validity
of the performance outcomes measured by IMPACT. In particular, there are several theoretically
reasonable ways in which the performance effects found here could reflect some type of
manipulation or reporting biases rather than true gains in teacher performance. For example, in
both RD samples, roughly 8 to 9 percent of the teachers we observe with IMPACT scores in
period t+1 earned them in a different position (i.e., almost exclusively by teaching in a different
school and, in a few cases, through a non-teaching position with IMPACT scores). This teacher
mobility could conceivably complicate the performance results presented in Table 4. That is, the

                                                                                                           !
    !
                                                                                                      25


teachers facing stronger incentives under IMPACT may have been more likely to seek out
different (and possibly more advantageous) assignments, thus inflating their measured
performance.
    We examined this question directly by estimating auxiliary RD equations in which teacher
mobility to a different IMPACT-rated position is the dependent variable. For both the ME and
HE thresholds, we could not reject the null hypothesis that IMPACT ratings did not influence
teacher mobility. An alternative form of possibly confounding teacher mobility would be
movement across Group 1 and Group 2 teaching assignments within their original school.
However, auxiliary RD estimates similarly indicate that IMPACT incentives did not have
statistically significant effects on teachers’ group status in the next year.
    Another way in which our core RD results could conceivably be misleading involves
whether teachers with strong IMPACT incentives received biased reports from their raters. For
example, principals are likely to have been aware when one of their teachers faced a dismissal
threat due to a prior ME rating or the possibility of a base-salary gains due to a prior HE rating.
This awareness may have positively influenced how teachers were rated based on classroom
observations (i.e., TLF), on their support for school initiatives (i.e., CSC), on their teacher-
assessed student achievement data (i.e., TAS), and on their core professionalism (i.e., CP). In
Table 5, we present evidence that speaks to these concerns by reporting the RD estimates
separately for both the ME and HE thresholds and for each of the IMPACT component scores.
The estimates for the full IMPACT scores are also reported again here for reference.
    Interestingly, Table 5 indicates that the performance gains observed among teachers with
ME ratings from AY 2010-11 are partly due to large improvements in the test performance of
students (i.e., the IVA measure). Because raters do not influence these scores, this heterogeneity
suggests a limited role for non-random reporting bias with respect to the ME results. However,
the RD estimates in Table 5 also indicate that teachers facing dismissal threats saw weakly
significant improvements in their principal-reported core professionalism (e.g., reduced
absenteeism) and in their rated classroom performance (i.e., TLF scores). Interestingly, when we
estimate the TLF scores separately for those reported by principals and those reported by
external raters (i.e., the master educators), the point estimates are almost identical, though less
precise. To the extent we believe principals would have a stronger propensity towards reporting
biases than district-based raters, this also suggests a limited role for reporting biases.

                                                                                                           !
    !
                                                                                                                  26


Furthermore, if principals facilitated biased reports for threatened teachers, we might also expect
these gains to be observed in higher CSC and TAS scores (but do not).11
     The RD estimates in the far right column of Table 5 indicate that the performance gains
attributable to HE status were concentrated among TLF, CSC, and TAS scores and not IVA
scores. Because each of these effected IMPACT components reflects raters’ discretion, the HE
results may be more likely to reflect reporting biases. However, at least two observations suggest
otherwise. First, if raters were using their discretion to support HE teachers in securing base-pay
increases, it is not clear why there were not also statistically significant changes in the CP scores.
The absence of effects is not merely due to the lack of CP score penalties in the HE sample. Over
five percent of the teachers with an initial HE rating in this sample received CP score penalties.
Second, RD estimates indicate that HE status led to similarly sized and statistically significant
increases in TLF scores when estimated separately by whether the principal or the district-
associated master educator was the rater. We would not expect this similarity if reporting biases
existed and were stronger among principals than among district-affiliated raters.


CONCLUSIONS AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS

A comparatively strong consensus exists around the notion that teachers have dramatic and long-
term effects on the educational and economic outcomes of their students and that there is
considerable variance in teacher quality under the current, largely static systems of teacher
evaluation and compensation. However, recent studies of teacher-incentive pilots have provided
largely discouraging evidence on whether aligning new incentives with singular, test-based
measures of teacher performance can improve educational outcomes. This study presents new
evidence based on IMPACT, the District of Columbia’s controversial teacher evaluation and
compensation system that is unique in providing, among other things, exceptionally high-
powered, individually-targeted incentives linked to performance as measured by multiple sources
of data (rather than test scores alone). In this study, we present both descriptive evidence on how
IMPACT influences teacher retention and performance as well as regression-discontinuity (RD)
evidence leveraging the strong incentive contrasts that exist for teachers whose performance
placed them near the thresholds for IMPACT’s performance bands. Overall, this evidence

       These null results are not due to ceiling effects in the CSC and TAS ratings. At least 80 percent of the
teachers rated as ME in 2011 had CSC and TAS ratings of 3.5 or lower.

                                                                                                                       !

suggests that IMPACT improved the effectiveness of the DCPS teacher workforce, both through
the differential attrition of low-performing teachers and performance gains among those teachers
who remained. In particular, the RD estimates provide evidence that the types of incentives that
IMPACT created influenced both teacher retention and performance.

    Another potentially compelling way to situate these findings more broadly is to contrast
them with other carefully identified empirical evidence on alternative policies and practices
designed to influence teacher retention and performance. However, we know of relatively few
other studies that address this topic with compelling research designs. There is some evidence
suggesting that practices seeking to promote positive selection into the teaching workforce raise
teacher performance. For example, Glazerman, Meyer, and Decker (2006) find that random
assignment to a “Teach for America” (TFA) teacher increases student performance by 3
percentile points in math (but has no detectable effects on reading scores). Clotfelter et al. (2008)
also find that a bonus for teachers of high-need subjects in high-poverty schools reduced teacher
turnover. However, this bonus had no targeting based on teacher performance. There is also
some evidence (Glazerman et al. 2010) that a comprehensive induction program providing two
years of intensive supports to beginning teachers (e.g., mentoring, classroom observation and
feedback) can improve teacher performance, at least by their third year (but has no detectable
effects on teacher retention). A small number of carefully designed studies also suggest that
teacher professional development can be effective, though there are far too few to discern
patterns in the characteristics of successful programs (Yoon et al. 2007). Clearly, there is much
more to be learned about the recruitment, training, development, and retention of higher-
performing teachers. Nonetheless, in this context, IMPACT appears to be somewhat unique as an
initiative that combined multi-faceted measurement of teacher performance in the field with
high-powered incentives differentially targeting the lowest and highest-performing teachers.

    Several caveats regarding this study’s results are worth underscoring. First and most
obviously, because this study’s RD estimates leverage the treatment contrasts only for those
teachers proximate to performance-band thresholds (and all of whom were subject to IMPACT),
they do not necessarily correspond to IMPACT’s general effect. Instead, the RD results provide
local inferences about the types of incentives that IMPACT created. Additionally, we found
some evidence that the performance effects for teachers facing dismissal threats were uniquely
high for (but not limited to) the smaller number of teachers whose initial scores placed them
                                                                                                         !

                                                                                                    28


within just a few points of an effective rating. These threatened teachers are likely to be
particularly confident that their subsequent efforts to improve their professional practice would
allow them to avoid the consequences of not achieving an effective rating. Interestingly, this
treatment heterogeneity dovetails with the conclusions from a larger literature on the design of
effective incentive systems in suggesting the critical importance of individuals viewing their
targeted tasks as “effort responsive” (e.g., Camerer and Hogarth 1999). The suggested
implications of this for systems of performance-based teacher compensation are worth stressing:
the performance of teachers should be more responsive to the incentives they face when they
have the knowledge and support to understand how their effort can clearly map into the stated
goals. The design of IMPACT appears to reflect these concerns in that the expectations of
teachers were clearly articulated and communicated and teaching support to meet these
expectations (e.g., instructional coaches) was available.

    A notable external-validity caveat is that the workforce dynamics due to IMPACT may be
relatively unique to urban areas like DC where the effective supply of qualified teachers is
comparatively high. A closely related issue is that the contrasts leveraged in this study are among
all observed teachers in IMPACT’s first three years, which may obscure concerns related to the
possible general-equilibrium effects associated with the labor supply of teachers. For example, a
simulation study by Rothstein (2012) suggests the teacher firing policies are less effective when
they are not accompanied by large salary increases and when performance measurement is
noisier. We note that IMPACT coincided with a new teacher contract that provided quite large
increases in teacher salaries (Turque 2010) and that IMPACT also relies on multiple measures of
teacher effectiveness, which have been shown to be more reliable than single measures (e.g.,
MET 2013). We can also provide some empirical evidence on the dynamics of teacher supply
under IMPACT by comparing the performance of teachers who leave and the new hires who
replace them. Teachers who left DCPS at the end of 2010-11 had mean IMPACT scores of 255
in their last year, while newly hired teachers for AY 2011-12 averaged 281 in their first year, a
difference of about half a standard deviation.

    Overall, the evidence presented in this study indicates high-powered incentives linked to
multiple indicators of teacher performance can substantially improve the measured performance
of the teaching workforce. Nonetheless, implementing such high-stakes teacher-evaluation
systems will continue to be fraught with controversy because of the difficult trade-offs they
                                                                                                         !

necessarily imply. Any teacher-evaluation system will make some number of objectionable
errors in how teachers are rated and in the corresponding consequences they face. Districts may
be able to reduce these errors through more sophisticated systems of teacher assessment (e.g.,
higher-frequency observations with multiple, carefully trained raters) but, in so doing, they will
face both implementation challenges and possibly considerable direct financial costs.
Policymakers must ultimately weigh these costs against the substantive and long-term
educational and economic benefits such systems can create for successive cohorts of students
both through avoiding the career-long retention of the lowest-performing teachers and through
broad increases in teacher performance.

                    Table 2 - Summary of IMPACTplus Bonus and Base Pay Increases

Bonus Pay eligibility                      Teachers rated as Highly Effective
Bonus pay for teachers in higher-poverty   $10,000, plus $10,000 for teachers in Group 1, plus $5,000 for
schools                                    teachers in a high-need subject.
Bonus pay for teachers in lower-poverty    $5,000, plus $5,000 for teachers in Group 1, plus $2,500 for
schools                                    teachers in high-need subject.

Base Pay increase eligibility              Teachers rated as Highly Effective for a 2nd consecutive year
Base pay increase for teachers in higher- Masters’ band + 5-year service credit
poverty schools
Base pay increase for teachers in lower- Masters’ band + 3 year service credit
poverty schools
NOTES: A higher-poverty school is defined as those where the percent of students eligible for free or
reduced-price lunches is 60% or higher. High-need subjects include special education, bilingual education
and ESL as well as secondary math and science. The "Masters' band" implies that the teacher is
compensated as if having a master's degree. The exact value of a teacher's base-pay increase following two
consecutive HE ratings depends on both their years of experience and their education level. These increases
are generally at least $6,000 per year. However, salary gain could exceed $20,000 per year for teachers
without graduate degrees working in high-poverty schools.

                                                  Appendix
    The three panels in Figure A1 illustrate the densities of teacher observations with respect to
    RD thresholds in each of the three analytical samples (i.e., HE teachers based on AY 2009-10
    performance and ME teachers based on AY 2009-10 and 2010-11 performance). Each of
    these illustrates the lack of a statistically significant difference in the distribution of
    observations at these thresholds. More specifically, hypothesis tests (McCrary 2008) confirm
    that, in each case, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the discontinuity at these
    thresholds is zero. The absolute values of these test statistics is not larger than 1.17.

    Table A1 presents the first-stage RD estimates for each sample and across different
    specifications. For the HE inferences, the RD design is “sharp” (i.e., the discontinuity in
    teacher’s initial IMPACT scores perfectly predicts their final status). In the first-year of
    IMPACT, several successful appeals meant that the relationship between initial IMPACT
    scores and ME status was somewhat “fuzzy”. In IMPACT’s second year, the ME first-stage
    was only modestly fuzzy because there were so few successful appeals of initial IMPACT
    scores (i.e., only 3 teachers).

    Table A2 presents evidence on the balance of teacher covariates around the RD thresholds.
    Specifically, this table reports the estimates from 39 individual RD regressions (i.e., 13 for
    each sample) where a teacher trait is the dependent variable. The prevalence of null results
    indicates that these teacher traits are similar above and below the RD thresholds that created
    such strong incentive contrasts for DCPS teachers. The results based on the HE sample
    indicate a statistically significant imbalance of teacher’s race around the HE threshold.
    However, these results could be viewed as a multiple-comparison artifact (i.e., two
    statistically significant effects out of 39 inferences). Furthermore, these teacher-race
    variables are not statistically significant in the IMPACT-score specifications (i.e., Table 4),
    which implies that this imbalance does not constitute a credible internal-validity threat.

    Tables A3 and A4 present the core RD results for the ME and HE samples, both for the full-
    sample and for samples of teachers whose initial IMPACT scores placed them within
    increasingly tight bandwidths around the relevant thresholds (i.e., 70 points, 60 points, …, 20
    points). The RD point estimates of the retention effects of these IMPACT incentives remain
    quite similar as the sample shrinks. However, in the case of the ME results, these point
    estimates become statistically insignificant as the shrinking sample sizes imply larger
    standard errors. The estimated performance effects of an ME threat shrink somewhat (and
    become statistically insignificant) when we limit the observations to teachers whose initial
    scores placed them within 40 or 50 points of the ME threshold. However, these estimated
    effects become somewhat larger and have weak statistical significance when the sample is
    further limited to teachers within 20 or 30 points of the ME/E threshold.

    A procedure recently developed by Imbens and Kalyaranaman (2012) constructs RD
    estimates using a bandwidth chosen to balance the precision loss and unbiasedness gains of
    smaller samples. When applied to these data, the IK procedure suggests a quite narrow
    bandwidth based only on the n=122 observations within 9 points of the ME threshold (only
    56 of these teachers had initial scores in the ME range). The estimated performance gain
    implied by this narrow bandwidth is quite large (46.9 points) and statistically significant.

                                                                                                      !

    Graphically, the unique performance gains for the small set of teachers close to the ME
    threshold can be seen in panel (b) of Figure 5 (i.e., the 5-point bin just to the left of the
    threshold) suggests a strong performance gain. In the conclusion, we note this treatment
    heterogeneity and its implications for program design in this context. However, we should
    also note that, when these 122 observations are excluded (i.e., a “donut hole” RD approach),
    an ME threat still implies a 10-point performance gain.

    Table A4 suggests less robustness to the performance gains associated with the HE threshold.
    For example, when the estimation sample is limited to the n=566 observations within 20
    points of the HE threshold, the estimated performance gains associated with HE incentives
    falls by more than half to 4.3 IMPACT points. However, because this sample reduction
    implies a loss of precision, it is also true that the 95% confidence interval on this point
    estimate includes the point estimate based on the full sample.

    Table A5 presents the results from four separate RD specifications that condition both on the
    actual thresholds that created contrasts in IMPACT incentives and on several false or
    “placebo” thresholds. In the case of the ME results, we see that the estimated retention and
    performance effects are larger and more precisely estimated at the threshold with real-world
    relevance and not at the placebo thresholds. These ad-hoc specification checks (i.e.,
    estimated effects concentrated where they should be and not where they should not) affirm
    the causal warrant of this RD design. However, it should be noted that, in the case of the HE
    results, this evidence is less dispositive. The far right column of Table A5 indicates that the
    estimated performance gains are at their largest for teachers at the actual HE threshold.
    However, in this saturated specification, this positive point estimate is noticeably smaller and
    falls short of statistical significance.
