                  Occupation, Race, Unemployment and Crime
                             In a Dynamic System


                                 ABSTRACT


        this paper, the relationship between unemployment and property
       In

crime is investigated in the context of dynamic system by using quarterly
time series data for the United States during the period of 1973 (I) —
1981 (iv)

       The results of Granger's causality tests indicate that unemployment
by occupation (white and blue collars) is significantly associated with
robbery, which is the most serious property crime. Unemployment by
race (white, black, and Hispanic) also supports the above finding. In
general, the linkage between   unemployment rate and property crime seems
to become stronger as the degree of seriousness of crime increases.
The findings of the dynamic system show that blue collar, Hispanic, and
black unemployment rates have persistently positive effects on robbery.
Therefore, these above findings suggest that any attempt to reduce
property    crime through alleviation of unemployment would most efficiently
be   directed towards specific categories of the labor force.

       In the 1960s, economists1 attempted for the first time
to explain property crime2 as the outcome of economic behavior
on the part of the individual. Being a rational economic agent,
the criminal is in a position to evaluate relative prices reflecting

costs and benefits of various legal and illegal activities and,

thus, to choose an optimum utility—maximizing "basket." Since
then, economic incentives and disincentives have been emphasized
as policy tools in fighting crime as opposed to rehabilitation
which is the main concern of other social scientists.

       In the last two decades, a considerable amount of theoretical

analysis and empirical investigation has been done on the relationship

between unemployment and crime. A review of the literature can
be found in Freeman (1982), Long and Witte (1981), and Thompson
et al. (1981) .    The main focus of those studies has been to explore

the effects of employment opportunities on property crime, even
though other socio—economic variables were included in an attempt to

ensure proper model specification.
       The unemployment has the expected impact on property crime
more or less consistently across all time—series studies though
the consensus is weaker with respect to the findings of cross—

sectional studies (Freeman 1982) .        A careful evaluation of these
                                 —2—


studies reveals that, despite the high plausibility of the claim

that unemployment may be the key factor behind property-related
criminal activity, only a moderate link between unemployment and

property crime exists.4 A major methodological problem of these
approaches has been the use of a static rather than a dynamic model.

The advantage of the latter is that it may show not only the correlation

but also the duration of lagged effects of unemployment on property

crime.

         In this paper, dynamic time—series techniques developed by
Granger (1969) and Sims (1980) are employed. Because of high
expected collinearity between time and some economic variables, and

limited degrees of freedom, the unemployment rate is adopted as
the only explanatory variable in addition to the lagged dependent

variable. The following relationships are investigated in this
study: First, total unemployment and property crime (total and each

kind of property crime separately) ; second, unemployment rates by
occupation (white and blue collars) and different kinds of property

crime; and third, race—specific unemployment rates (white, black,
Hispanic) and various categories of property crime. The period of
analysis extends from the first quarter of 1973 to the fourth quarter
of 1981. The relative crime rates for the United States used in

this paper are the ones released in the 1982 uniform Crime Reports

of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.5 Data on unemployment rates

are collected from unpublished records of the Bureau of Labor

Statistics.

in the Granger's causality test and the dynamic representation

of a system. Section II reports the empirical results. Finally,

I. STATISTICAL TECHNIQUES OF CAUSALITY TEST AND DYNAMIC SYSTEM

Granger (1969) defines causality between two stationary stochastic

time series, U(t) and X(t) ,              within   a set of information in the
universe, as follows: A time series U causes another time series X
if the current value of X is more accurately predicted by using

the information which includes at least the own—past series of X
and the past series of U, than by using the information which
excludes the past series of U.6

           By using a logarithmic specification, we estimate the following
linear model:




          =    +          (s)X.(t-s)
                                           +        Eb.(s)U.(t-s)

                   4
               +
                   Dk           + d T,                (1)




          -'   1                    -A'
where a3, ai b1 ckt and d are least—square estimates;
x. represents proprety crime while U represents unemployment rate;
   are quarterly dumy variables; and T is a linear time trend.
In order to identify the Granger's causality from U to X

in equation (1) ,         the   null hypothesis is that the set of parameters

  (s) ,    s=l,. .. ,n,    should be zero if there is no Granger's causality

from U1 to
                                      —5—



           With respect to dynamic relationships between            and

in equation (1) ,   the    estimated coefficients on successive lags

include complicated cross—equation feedback and, therefore,
the summing of distributed lagged coefficients, e.g., the sum of

b.(t—s), s=J.,...,n, is quite misleading (Sins 1980). As suggested,
 J
                                                                                8
we estimate the moving average representation (MAR) of the system.
           Let t(t) represent the best linear forecast of Z(t) based

on its past series Z(t—s) ,       s>      0, where Z(t) is an q x 1 vector

stationary stochastic time series. Then, the innovation in ZR)
is defined as follows:


                                          -S.
                    v(t)    =   ZR)   —   ZR),            (2)



where V(t) is serially uncorrelated and is also a linear combination

of current and past values of ZR) for all t. Then, Z(t) can be
expressed asa linear combination of current and past innovations

V(t—s) ,    s> 0.   However, if components of V are contemporaneously

correlated, it is not possible topartition the variance of Z into
components accounted for by each innovation. Therefore,
an orthogonalizing transformation to V is required to obtain

the identity matrix M(t) = T          V(t) ,    where T is a lower triangular
matrix with zero elements above the diagonal, and which makes

the covariance matrix 14(t) the identity matrix. The final equation

to estimate is as follows:
                                   —6—



        Z(t) =       F(s)T M(t-s).              .   (3)


The components of the matrix function F(s)T1 represent
the k+1 step—ahead forecast z, accounted for by the innovation

in      (Eckstein et al. 1981) .    Then, a particular i—th equation
of Z(t) is expressed as follows:



        zi =           f.(s)   M.(t-s),             (4)



where      is the i—th equation's components of F(s)T1 for
j=1,... ,q; and M's are the normalized innovations in variables

in the system. In particular, the sum of             from stO to s=k

for the j—th component represents the part of error variance
in the k=l step-ahead forecast of Z.., accounted for by

the innovation in       at s=O (Eckstein et al. 1981) .         Consequently,
the proportion of k quarters ahead forecast error variance in

due to typical random shocks of one standard deviation in
the innovation Z. is expressed as follows 9;

II. EMPIRICAL RESULTS

11—1. Granger's Causality Tests

Granger's causality tests for property crimes and unemployment
rates are performed using quarterly time series data for the United

States during the period of 1973(I) —   l9Sl(IV).   The F—statistics

of the results of four lag distributions in a logarithmic
specification are reported in Tables 1 through 3.

       Summarizing the empirical evidence, the following observations
emerge. First, our results largely support the significance of
the lag distributions of each property crime in the determination

of its own behavior. Second, total unemployment is shown to

Granger—cause total property crime and robbery, burglary and
motor vehicle theft in particular, at various significance levels.

Third, white collar and blue collar unemployment are both significant

in affecting robbery whereas Granger's causality could not be
detected with respect to other types of property crime with
the exception of motor vehicle theft where the impact of blue

collar unemployment appears stronger. Fourth, unemployment by
race—specific group is significant in Granger—causing robbery
leaving other property crimes unaffected. Fifth, black and
Hispanic unemployment seem to exert a stronger influence on

robbery than white unemployment. And, sixth, black unemployment
is the only type of unemployment significantly shown to

Granger—cause burglary besides robbery.
                              —8—



       The general picture emerging out of these results seems

to indicate that Granger's causality between unemployment and
property crime becomes stronger as the degree of seriousness of
the crime increases and as the incidence of unemployment

discriminates against blue collar, and non—white groups.

11—2. Dynamic Relationships between Robbery and Unemployment

In the Granger's causality tests, we concluded that serious
property crimes are most likely to be related to unemplyment,

while the relationship between unemployment and less serious
property crimes appears rather weak. Therefore, in this section,
only robbery, being the most serious property crime, has been

investigated in its relationship to unemployment categorized

by occupation and race.
       Responses of robbery to positive random shocks of one

standard deviation in the innovation in blue collar unemployment

are shown in chart 4 — A.   The innovation in blue collar has

persistently positive effects on the robbery variable at all

quarters except the third quarter (k3) .   As the chart indicates,

an increase in blue collar unemployment does not increase robbery

much during the first year (k=l through 4). However, the effects

of blue collar unemployment on robbery become stronger during
the second year. On the contrary, the responses of robbery to
typical random shocks in the innovation in white collar unemployment

are not positive at all quarters except the second, third, and
fourth quarters, shown in chart 4 — B.
       The charts in Table 5 present the responses of robbery to
Hispanic, black, and white unemployments. In chart 5 — A,

the innovation in Hispanic unemployment generates positive effects
                                      — 12 —




on the robbery variable. The peak of robbery is reached in

the middle of the first year. The responses of robbery to
black unemployment follow the similar pattern to those described

for Hispanic unemployment (chart 5 —           B).   Again, the innovation

in white unemployment does not show positive effects on

the robbery variable (chart 5 — C).
          Table 6 reports the results of dynamic relationships
between property crime and total unemployment rate, which show
the percentage of error variance of the dependent variable

(total and each property crime) accounted for by the innovation

in total unemployment rate (TU).
          In Table 6 -      1, the total property crime (TPC) in the United
States has 37 percent of its variance accounted for by total
unemployment rate in the first quarter, 50 percent in the fourth

quarter, and 60 percent in the seventh quarter. As more future
quarters are forecasted, the variance of total property crime

tends to be explained more by the total unemployment rate.
The results.for each property crime treated separately in Tables

6 —   2   through 6 -   S   reveal the same pattern as explained for

the total property crime in Table 6 — 1.             Therefore, the results

of Table 6 indicate that the total unemployment rate is a strong

determinant of the fluctuations of property crime in the long run.
                                — 13 —




       To summarize, there exist dynamic relationships between

property crime and unemployment rate. Above all, blue collar,
Hispanic, and black unemployment rates show significantly positive

effects on robbery. On the other hand, white collar and white
unemployment rates do not show positive effects on robbery.

Thus, the average overall unemployment rate hides the existing
differences with respect to the impact of unemployment suffered

by specific groups on property crime and robbery in particular.
One might argue that it is not unemployment per se which causes
property crime to increase, but rather the prolonged structural

unemployment that hits blue collar, Hispanic, and black workers

in general. However, persistently high unemployment rates for
these groups may weaken the legitimacy of legal earning activities
and consequently push these people towards economic crime.
On the other hand, the duration and frequency of unemployment

among white collar and white workers are small in general and,

therefore, these people are less likely to get involved in
economic criminal activities.

III.   SUMMARY

The purpose of this study has been first to investigate

the relationship between the property crime rate and the
unemployment rate in the United States, and then to find

dynamic correlations which might exist between these variables.

        The results of Granger's causality tests indicate that

unemployment by occupation (white and blue collars) is

significantly associated with robbery. Unemployment by race
(white, black, and Hispanic) also supports the above finding.
In general, the linkage between unemployment rate and property

crime seems to become stronger as the degree of seriousness

of cirme increases. The findings of the dynamic system show

that blue, Hispanic, and black unemployment rates have significantly

positive effects on serious property crimes, i.e., robbery.
        As a concluding remark, unemployment rates are important
for the determination of property crime. It is unemployment
in specific groups in the society which is crime-related.
Therefore, any attempt to reduce crime through alleviation of

unemployment     would most efficiently be directed towards specific categories
of the labor force (blue, black, and Hispanic workers).

       'Here one should mention the pioneering work of Ehrlich (1973,
 1974) and the path—breaking innovations in economic analysis
of Becker (1968) .

       2Property crime is a general term referring to robbery,
burglary, larceny, and motor vehicle theft.
         3
        For example, Ehrlich (1973) uses the following variables:
a) Economic variables
   i. legal and illegal income opportunities.
   ii. expected cost of punishment.
b) Demographic variables
   i. percentage of males aged 14—24 in the population.
   ii. percentage of nonwhites in the population.
   iii. percentage of population in Standard Metropolitan
        Statistical Areas (SMSA5)

       4flowever, Phillips, Votey, and Maxwell (1972) found
relatively large R—squares in their equations. Therefpre,
they concluded that changing labor market opportunities are
sufficient to explain increasing crime rates in the United States.

       5The relative crime rate is obtained by setting the crime
rate in the first quarter of 1972 equal to 100 as a base in
the 1982 Uniform Crime Reports.

       6"Causality" in Granger's model means "linear causality
between variables within a given set of information in a universe."
See Granger (1969), p.430. Blinder (1982) states that T'Granger—
causation has nothing to do with causation in the usual sense...
It means that X adds to the ability to predict Y, no more and
no less Cpp.15—16)."

       7The assumptions of the linearity between X(t) and Uk),
and the set of information consisting of X(t) and UCt) would
give spurious results.of the Granger's causality tests,, if
there is a third variable which is causally and linearly
related with X(t) and Uk) but being not included in the set of
information.

1980) and Eckstein et al. (1981).
