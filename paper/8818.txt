                                            ABSTRACT

       Nations generally measure their economic performance using the yardstick of national output and
income. It is not widely recognized, however, that conventional measures of national income and output
exclude the value of improvements in the health status of the population. The present study develops a
methodology and presents preliminary estimates of how standard economic measures would change if
they adequately reflected improvements in health status. The study first discusses the theory of the
measurement of national income, examines some of the shortcomings of traditional concepts, and
proposes a new concept called "health income" that can be used to incorporate improvements in health
status. The study next discusses how the proposed measure fits into existing theories for measuring and
valuing consumption and health status. The study applies the new concepts to data for the United States
over the twentieth century and concludes that accounting for improvements in the health status would
substantially increase the estimated improvement in economic welfare for the U.S. over the twentieth
century.

I. Introduction



        Nations generally measure their economic performance using the

yardstick of national output and income. It is not widely recognized, however,

that conventional approaches do a poor job of capturing improvements in the

health of the population in our gross domestic product or incomes per capita.

How would standard economic measures change if they adequately reflected

improvements in the health status of the population as well as other goods and

services? This is the question addressed in the present study.



        The first section discusses the theory of the measurement of national

income, examines some of the shortcomings of traditional concepts, and

proposes a new concept that can be used to incorporate improvements in

health status. In the second section, we discuss how the proposed measure fits

into existing theories of consumption and valuation. The third section applies

the concepts to the United States over the twentieth century.



     At the end, we conclude that accounting for improvements in the health

status of the population would make a substantial difference to our measures

of economic welfare over the twentieth century in the United States.



II. Including Health Status in Measures National Income



     Current Approaches to Measuring the Contribution of Health in the

     National Accounts



     While the GDP and the rest of the National Income and Product

Accounts (NIPA) may seem to be arcane concepts, they are truly among the

great inventions of the twentieth century. Much as a satellite in space can

survey the weather across an entire continent, so can the GDP give an overall

picture of the state of the economy. Since their first construction by Simon

Kuznets, who won the Nobel prize in Economics for his contributions to

national income accounting, enormous strides have been taken in developing

and improving indexes of economic welfare. Starting with rudimentary


                                      -2-
measures of national income and output, nations now have a wide range of

indexes that not only include conventional concepts but also disaggregate

these for industries and regions, use improved techniques for aggregation, and

display a wealth of detail.



      Nevertheless, since the beginning, there have been concerns that the

accounts are incomplete and misleading because they omit most nonmarket

activity. To meet this criticism, private scholars as well as official statistical

agencies have begun extending the national accounts to include several non-

market sectors, including national resources, the environment, transportation,

leisure time, and unpaid work.2



      One question that has been virtually ignored in attempts to extend the

national accounts is the need to account adequately for improvements in

human health. It is little understood outside the priesthood of national

accountants that there is no serious attempt to measure the “real output” of the

health-care industry. The techniques used to measure the price and quantity of




2 See Eisner [1989]. A recent review of environmental and other aspects of nonmarket
accounting is contained in National Research Council [1999].


                                           -3-
health care are highly defective, and there are no attempts to account for

improvements in the length of life into current measures of living standards.



      It might be argued that including health status is some radical, far-out,

and woolly-headed attempt to incorporate intangible, non-economic, and

sociological measures into our social accounts. This argument is wrong, for

health-care expenditures are already included in measures of national income

and output. Indeed they are a growing fraction of GDP – the fraction of

personal consumption expenditures devoted to medical care rose from 5.1

percent in 1959 to 15.3 percent in 1998. What is radical is not the inclusion of

health care but the notion advanced here that we should make a serious

attempt to measure the output of the health care sector and to value this output

correctly.



      Both common sense and recent economic studies suggest that there is

little connection between medical spending and the measured economic value

of health-status improvements. At a common-sense level, the lack of

connection comes because “real” medical-care spending in fact measures

spending on inputs rather than the results in health outcomes. The current

approach is to measure health output primarily by the number of physician-


                                       -4-
visits, the number of hospital-days, and similar measures rather than the actual

delivery of services or changes in health status. It will come as a surprise to

most non-economists that improvements that come from new products, such

as the discovery of antibiotics or the substitution of drugs for invasive surgery,

are completely omitted in current measures of real output.



        Attempts to measure improvements in the health status of the

population — including everything from vaccinations, microsurgery, and new

drugs to airbags, exercise, and anti-cigarettes advertizing — pose a new and

difficult challenge to measuring national income. Recently, economists have

begun providing better outcome-oriented estimates of the prices and outputs

in this sector. One of the most striking findings comes from a study by Cutler

et al., who estimated that a true price index for the treatment of heart attacks

would rise about 5.5 percent per year more slowly than the corresponding

component of the CPI.3 Similar results were found in studies of treatment for

glaucoma by Shapiro and Wilcox and for cataract surgery by Shapiro, Shapiro,

and Wilcox.4

                                           -5-
        Given the likelihood that we are dramatically mismeasuring, and almost

certainly underestimating, the contribution of improvements in health care to

economic welfare, this raises the question of how to proceed to obtain better

estimates. One approach would be to continue the approach just described of

constructing better measures of output and prices to reflect the (literal) decline

in the cost of living. This approach was adopted by the Boskin Commission

and is the thrust of much current research on health economics.5



        Another quite different approach, which is used in the present study, is

to obtain direct measures of health status, weight them with appropriate

prices, and then estimate the value of improvements in health status. This

approach treats medical care as an instrumental input and subtracts it from

consumption expenditures. We would instead adjust real income to reflect the

value of the improvement of health status. This approach is actually much

simpler than “fixing” price and output indexes because measures of health

status are generally much better than data on the impacts of particular

technologies on health status. We will see that following this path has radical

impacts on our measures of real income and output.

        Alternative Measures of National Income



        Before proposing alternative concepts, it will be useful to describe

different approaches to measuring national income. The concepts of social

income and national income go back centuries. They are largely based on the

analogous definitions of individual income with appropriate adjustments for

aggregation and national boundaries. We can distinguish two fundamentally

different approaches to measuring income – one based on production and one

based on utility. (Utility in this context means preferences, not usefulness.) The

former is the basis of modern national-income accounting while the latter is

more appropriate when considering sustainable income and the contribution

of improvement in health status.



        Production-based measures (Hicksian Income)




5   See Advisory Commission [1996] and Murray and Lopez [1996].


                                          -7-
         The modern treatment of social income dates from the writings of J. R.

Hicks. When economists and accountants measure national income, they have

almost universally rely upon the Hicksian definition. The discussion of social

income in Value and Capital states, “The purpose of income calculations in

practical affairs is to give people an indication of the amount which they can

consume without impoverishing themselves.”6 Hicks then goes on to provide

his first definition of social income:



         Income No. 1 is thus the maximum amount which can be spent during a

         period if there is to be an expectation of maintaining intact the capital

         value of prospective returns...; it equals Consumption plus Capital

         accumulation.7



This definition is what is called “Hicksian income” – the maximum amount

that can be consumed while leaving capital intact. In practice, this means that

income equals consumption plus a generalized measure of capital

accumulation.


  6   Hicks [1939], p. 172.




                                          -8-
      The Hicksian concept is the standard definition of net national or

domestic product used in the national-income accounts of virtually all nations

today, where consumption and investment are limited to those legal goods and

services that pass through the market place. It is production-based in the sense

that it attempts to measure the rate of production at a given time. Such

measures are not concerned with the health status of the population or

whether people are enjoying that production for a longer period of time.



      Utility-based measures (Fisherian income)



      While standard concepts of income are useful tools for measuring

current production, it is difficult to extract any welfare significance from them.

The shortcoming of the traditional approach is clear when we consider

situations where technologies are improving or where people are living longer.

An economy in which people have a per capita income of $20,000 with lives

that are nasty, brutish, and short would be ranked as equivalent to one with

the same per capita income and lives that are healthy, civilized, and long. In


  7Hicks [1939], p. 173, 178, emphasis added. This discussion ignores the subtlety of Hicks'
 discussion of price changes, interest rate effects, the difference between ex ante and ex


                                           -9-
the context of health, the key point is that the same annual income with a long

and healthy live should be ranked as a higher living standard than that income

with a short and diseased live. Including health status in income is particularly

important when a large and growing fraction of our economy is devoted to

health care.



      An alternative approach is to define income as utility-equivalent

consumption.8 I have called this “Fisherian income” after Irving Fisher, who

defined income as the flow of consumption that could be harvested from the

nation’s capital stock.9 Under this approach, income is defined as the level of

consumption that would give the equivalent level of utility from consumption

and other determinants of utility in different situations. This definition has

been used to define the level of “sustainable income” in situations where there

is a tug-of-war between resource exhaustion and technological change.10 In

cases where lifetimes are fixed, this is equivalent to defining income as the

consumption equivalent of current assets and current and future technologies.


 post capital, and a number of other factors.

8 This approach is used in an analogous manner in the theory of measuring the cost of
living.

9 See Nordhaus [1994, 1995] for a discussion.

10 See Nordhaus [1994].


                                           - 10 -
      For concreteness, call this “utility national income” and define it as

follows:



      Definition. Utility national income is the maximum amount that a nation

      can consume while ensuring that members of all future generations can

      have lifetime utility that is at least as high as that of the current

      generation.



      If life expectancy in unchanging, income is the maximum real

consumption annuity that a nation can spend out of its resource endowment.

The major difference in analyzing living standards with variable lifetimes is to

recognize that people are better off when they live longer, and that this fact

should be reflected in measures of their incomes and living standards. This

approach measures the increased income from longer life expectancies by the

consumption-equivalent of the utility or value of the health or longevity

improvements.

      III. Integrating Health Status into Income Measures



      Consumption and income are traditionally measured as flows of goods

and services (or utilities) during a given period of time. Changes in an

individual’s health status (while alive) pose no terribly deep issues of

measurement, for we can treat these as new or improved “goods and services”

which can be appropriately priced and included in the consumption basket.



      Treatment of shortening or lengthening life, by contrast, poses

qualitatively different problems of measurement. I begin this section by

considering a simple life-cycle model of consumption in which there are

tradeoffs between life and consumption. I then show how this approach might

be used to construct a framework for measuring income.



      A. A Life-Cycle Model with Variable Lifetime



      We want to examine the gain in “real income” from improved health and

life expectancy. We do this in the context of the life-cycle model of




                                      - 12 -
consumption. An individual is assumed to value consumption and health

according to a lifetime utility function:11




                           4
(1)    V[ct ; 2, D, :t] = I u(ct) e -D(t-2) S[:t] dt
                          2



Where V[ct ; 2, D, :t] is the value at time t of the consumption stream now and

in the future faced by an individual of age 2; u(ct) is the stream of

instantaneous utility or felicity of consumption; D is the pure rate of individual

time preference; S[:t] is the set of survival probabilities; and :t is the set of

mortality rates. The key assumption here is that utility is a function of the

expected value of consumption weighted by the probability of survival. As we

will see, the utility function has a natural semi-cardinal interpretation as the

value of life extension.




11 An early treatment of this issue is contained in Shepard and Zeckhauser [1984]. A
detailed treatment of the value of life with extensions is contained in Rosen in Tolley et al.
[1994].


                                             - 13 -
      We begin with a simple and tractable assumption about mortality to

show the basic relationships; when developing the empirical estimates in later

sections we will use more realistic life tables. Consider the simple case where

the survival function is exponential. Equation (1) then becomes:



                          4
(2)   V[ct ; 2, D, :t] = I u(ct) e -(D+:)( t-2) dt
                         2




      We assume that each individual has a given endowment of expected

labor income and can buy zero-cost real annuities that have any desired

trajectory. We can further simplify for computational purposes (to be relaxed

later) by assuming that the real interest rate faced by the individual is equal to

the mortality adjusted rate of time preference, (D+:). Given these assumptions,

the individual will choose a consumption annuity that yields constant

consumption during the individual's lifetime, c t = c*. Integrating (2) yields a

particularly simple outcome:



(3)   V[ct ; 2, D, :] = u(c*) / (D+:).




                                             - 14 -
Equation (3) shows that the total utility value of consumption is the utility of

the flow of constant consumption discounted by a discount rate that equals the

sum of the force of impatience and the force of mortality.



      An individual will often face a tradeoff between “health and wealth.”

What would be the tradeoff given by (3)? At age 2, changes in consumption

and health yield:



            dV/dc* = u'(c*)/(D+:)

(4)   {


            dV/d: = - u(c*)/(D+:)2



Hence the relative value of consumption and mortality is:



(5)   dc*/d: = -u(c*)/[u'(c*)(D+:)]



      We make two normalizations that will simplify the discussion without

loss of generality. First, we simplify by selected a goods-metric utility function.

This gives us a metric in which utility is measured in terms of goods at the


                                       - 15 -
equilibrium, which implies that u'(c*) = 1. In other words, utility is defined so

that one unit of utility is one extra unit of the good. Second, we chose the units

so that zero is the “death-indifference level of existence.” That is, when the

utility of consumption is u(c) = 0, the individual is indifferent between life and

death. This implies that there is zero utility after death.

      Given these assumption, (5) reduces to:



(6)   dc*/d: = -u(c*)/(D+:)



or without discounting



(7)   dc*/d: = -Tu(c*)



where T is life expectancy (T = 1/:).        The interpretation here is that a

uniform change in mortality rates at every age will produce a welfare change

equal to the number of years of life (T) times the goods value of life, given by

u(c*) – recall that the utility of years after death is normalized at u = 0.



      The major difficulty in applying this approach is determining the goods

value of life. There have been many studies of this, which are reviewed below.



                                        - 16 -
An example is as follows: Most studies of life value examine the tradeoff

between current risk and current income, say at age K = 40. Consider a decline

in the mortality rate of Î:(2) for one period. Then the survival rate is higher by

eÎ:(2) at the end of the period, K+1. Discounted utility evaluated at age 2 > K

is then



(8)   V(2) = eÎ:(2) u(c*)/(D+:)

      Hence, using this simple mortality assumption, the tradeoff between

current risk and current consumption is approximately:



(9)   dc/d:(2) = u(c*).



Now the decline of Î:(2) leads to a change in life expectancy of approximately

ÎT=Î:/:. The value of this change is



      dV/dT = dV/d:(2) d:(2) /dT - u(c*):/(D+:)



So the tradeoff between life expectancy and consumption is approximately:



(10) dc/dT = u(c*) :



                                      - 17 -
      Note that this approach indicates that it is not generally correct to adjust

for changes in health status by calculating lifetime consumption, which would

be c*T in the present example. This approach is only correct when u(c) = 1. Our

numerical estimates below indicate that this approach will generally

undervalue improvements in life expectancy.




      B. Valuation of Life



      Measuring utility income with health improvement requires finding

appropriate “prices” to use to value health status. There is a voluminous

literature on the value of fatalities prevented.12 It is generally accepted that the

“willingness to pay” to reduce risk is the appropriate approach for valuing risk

reductions. Studies of this fall into three general categories: labor market

studies, which examine the risk-wage tradeoff; consumer purchase decisions

(such as for smoke detectors), which examine the price-risk tradeoff; and




                                       - 18 -
contingent valuation studies, which attempt to determine preferences from a

systematic examination of individual’s stated preferences.



      The most weight is generally put on labor market studies because these

reflect actual behavior, because labor force decisions are repeated, and because

there are dozens of studies from different periods, countries, occupations, and

samples. It is important to note that the tradeoff examined is a current risk-

current income (dc/d:) choice between current occupational hazards and

current wages. From these tradeoffs (which involve comparing income per

year against mortality risk per year) we derive an implicit dollar cost per unit

mortality risk. Because the risks are relatively small (around between

1/100,000 per year to 50/100,000 per year), the interpretation is the marginal

valuation of risk reduction or increase.



      Not surprisingly, there is great variation in the implicit price of risk (or

price of a statistical life). The serious estimates from a recent survey range from

$0.6 million to $13.5 million per fatality prevented. The U.S. Environmental

Protection Agency use the relatively high figure of $4.8 million per fatality


12 See Viscusi [1993] for a comprehensive review of the economics literature. The
monumental study edited by Murray and Lopez [1996] is a particularly useful analysis of



                                          - 19 -
prevented in its cost-benefit study of the value of clear air.13 Tolley et al.

recommend a value of $2.0 million per fatality prevented for use in health-care

decisions.14 In this study, I settle on $3.0 million per fatality prevented as a

reasonable choice, but the figures are easily modified to reflect different

assumptions.



       In our analysis above, we calculated the increment to sustainable

consumption of an additional life-year, LY [see equation (10)]. There is some

confusion but little solid evidence on how to measure the value of an added

life-year. Most studies derive LY values from the studies of the value of

reduced mortality described above.

       We can sketch the methodology as follows. In terms of the model used

above, almost all estimates concern the value of reductions in current mortality

[dc(2)/d:(2)]. For concreteness, we assume the following:



(11) dV/d:(2) = $3 H 10 6                  (in 1990 incomes and prices)




the issue in the context of health care.

13 This was based on the survey by Unsworth, Neumann, and Browne [1992].

14 See Tolley et al. [1994].


                                             - 20 -
To convert this to the value of a life-year requires further assumptions. Many

of the studies underlying the estimate in (11) concern labor market decisions of

working men, for which we can use :(40) - 0.025 yr -1 for those age 40. To

convert these into value per life-year requires assuming a discount rate, which

we alternatively take to be 0 and 3 percent per year. Using these values, we

obtain



                      $1,828 per LY @ D = 0

(12) dc*/dI *d:(40) = {



                      $6,757 per LY @ D = 0.03




These are the annuity or flow equivalents of the present value of an increase in

a LY. That is, they reflect the increase in the constant consumption necessary to

compensate for a current loss of a life-year. Taking the present value of the

consumption annuity yields a capital value [dV/dLY] of $75,000 per LY at a

discount rate of 0 and $162,000 per LY at a discount rate of 3 percent per year.

Tolley et al. [1994] recommend a central present value of $100,000 per LY from

their studies, which is broadly consistent with these numbers and analysis.



                                      - 21 -
      In the estimates presented below, we use actual survival functions rather

than the theoretical ones analyzed above. Using 1990 life tables, we obtain the

following estimates:

                       $2,600 per LY at D = 0

(12') dc*/dI *d:= {



                       $7,600 per LY at D = 0.03



These estimates using actual life tables in (12') are quire close to the values for

the simplified model given in (12), which motivates using that model. (The

capital values associated with these numbers are given at the bottom of Table

2.)



      C. Measuring Income with Variable Lifetimes



      Next turn to the issue of measuring income or consumption. For this

purpose, we take the utility-based measure of income. It will be helpful to start

with the case of utility-based income with fixed and certain lifetime. In this

approach income is the maximum sustainable consumption consistent with a



                                        - 22 -
given expected value of labor earnings and an exogenously given interest rate.

Under the assumption of no bequests, note that income is also equal to

sustainable consumption, where the latter is defined as the maximum constant

real consumption annuity.



       More precisely, assume that the consumption discount rate is a constant,

r. Once we know the entire path of consumption, given by C(s) for s > t, we can

easily calculate utility income at time t, denoted by C (t), as follows:




        4                       4
(13)   I C (t)exp[-r(s-t)]ds = I C(s)exp[-r(s-t)]ds
       t                       t




or equivalently




                      4
(14)     C (t) = r [ I C(s)exp[-r(s-t)]ds ]
                     t




                                         - 23 -
Note that C (t) measures the constant consumption annuity available at time t.

Equation (14) shows that measures of utility income or sustainable income are

inherently a wealth-like measure as was emphasized by Irving Fisher and Paul

Samuelson.15



      The utility definition of income is a natural springboard for considering

the measurement of income with varying lifetimes. Begin by extending the

definition of income and consumption to uncertain, variable, and endogenous

lifetimes. To begin with, consider the traditional definition of income. For

example, say that in lifetime situation “Short” individuals consume 100 units

per year each and live for 50 years while in situation “Long” individuals

consume 100 units per year and live for 60 years. Under the standard flow

definition of consumption, there would be no difference in economic welfare

or living standards between Short and Long. This is clearly defective to the

extent that people prefer to live longer.




15 Irving Fisher's discussion dates from 1910 -14 and is contained in Fisher [1997]. Paul
Samuelson's approach is contained in Samuelson [1961].


                                            - 24 -
      An alternative and preferable approach is to convert the combination of

consumption and the survival function into the equivalent utility with a

benchmark survival function and consumption. Take the Short lifetime

situation as the benchmark. Using the example of the last paragraph, we ask

what consumption annuity using the life expectancy of situation Short would

give individuals the same utility as the consumption and life expectancy of

situation Long. An individual might consider situation Long (with a constant

consumption of 100 and a lifetime of 60 years) to be equivalent to, or have

equivalent utility with, a constant consumption annuity of 110 units per year

with the life expectancy of situation Short. We would then say that (using

situation Short as the benchmark) the income in situation Long was 110

compared to that of 100 in situation Short.



      Using the notation of the last section, define S = Short and L = Long.

Then let V[ctS ; 2, D, :tS] be the utility of consumption stream ctS and age-

specific mortality rate :tS while V[ctL ; 2, D, :tL] is the utility of consumption

stream ctL and age-specific mortality rate :tL. We define income c*(L, :S) as the

constant consumption stream that would go with mortality rates in Short

which yields the equivalent utility as the consumption stream and mortality

rates in situation Long. That is, V[c*(L, :S); 2, D,:tS] = V[ctL ; 2, D, :tL].



                                         - 25 -
      We then compare incomes in different situations by estimating the

constant equivalent consumption annuity with a benchmark mortality

function. Say we use mortality rates from situation S as the benchmark. We can

then compare situations S and L by comparing c*(S, :S) and c*(L, :S), such that

V[c*(S, :S); 2, D, :tS] = V[ctS ; 2, D, :tS] and c*(L, :S) such that V[c*(L, :S); 2, D,

:tS] = V[ctL ; 2, D, :tL]. There will be the usual index-number problems involved

in these comparisons because the definitions will differ whether we use the

mortality rates of situation S or L. It is to my knowledge an open question

whether the usual index-number theorems apply here, but I see no reason why

they should not.



      Because this tangle of algebra is somewhat forbidding, it will be useful to

summarize the major points. Traditional income accounting looks at the flows

of consumption and income in measuring living standards – consumption of

food, purchases of electricity and apparel, airline travel, and so forth. These

measures do not consider the length of life or the quality of the population’s

health. The alternative proposed here corrects for mortality and morbidity by

asking in effect how much consumption the individual would be willing to

pay to trade off consumption for health. If, for example, an individual would



                                          - 26 -
pay two percent of consumption each year to gain an additional life-year, then

we use that number to say that an additional life-year is equivalent to a two

percent increase in annual income. In the estimates below, we use this

technique only to adjust for changes in life expectancy, although they could

also be used to adjust for changes in morbidity.



IV. The Impact of Improved Life Expectancy on Economic Welfare

      in the U.S., 1900- 1995

      A. Previous Studies



      The literature on estimating the economic value of improved health is

surprisingly sparse. Dan Usher considered the issue as part of a more general

study of the adequacy of conventional national output measures, but his

approach was highly stylized and was written before the surge of detailed

estimates of the value of life.16 A number of indexes incorporate life

expectancy, particularly the United Nations Development Program’s Human

Development Index (HDI).17 The technique for incorporating health in the HDI

is, however, completely arbitrary. Economic historians have begun to compile



16 See Usher [1973] and 1980].

17 See UNDP [1997] for a discussion and the numbers.


                                         - 27 -
systematic indicators on various health-related measures, such as height and

the body-mass index, and these tend to move with other measures of health

status, but it is difficult to put a price tag on these indexes.18 Important

additions to the literature are studies by David Cutler and Elizabeth

Richardson, which is discussed below, and the contribution of Kevin Murphy

and Robert Topel, presented at this conference.19



      B. Methods



      We now implement the ideas in earlier sections for the United States. The

calculations here estimate the value of the health component of utility income,

or the value of improvements in health status, which we call “health income.”

Table 1 shows illustrative data on major health risk in different regions from

the study of the global burden of disease by Murray and Lopez [1996]. This

table gives a rough idea of what economic development means in terms of

health status.




18 A useful review of the economic-history literature is contained in Costa and Steckel
[1995].

19 See Cutler and Richardson [1997] and Murphy and Topel [1999].


                                           - 28 -
      The fundamental data for the United States are shown in Figures 1

through 4. Figure 1 shows per capita consumption for the U.S. from 1900 to

1995. The data are from the Commerce Department for the period 1929-95 and

from various private scholars for 1900-29. The Commerce Department figures

are in chained indexes converted to 1990 price levels. Earlier estimates are in

constant prices.



      Figure 2 shows the survival rates for three years, 1900 1950, and 1995.

The most dramatic change came in the early part of this century — the

probability of surviving the first year rose from 87 percent in 1900 to 96 percent

in 1950. Figure 3 shows life expectancy at different ages. Gains in life

expectancy have been substantial throughout the entire century. Figure 4

shows the change in life expectancy at different ages over the last four decades.



      One preliminary question concerns a parallel between health

improvements and the slowdown in conventionally measured productivity. Is

the famous “productivity slowdown” found in conventional economic

measures mirrored in the health statistics? Figure 5 shows gains in life

expectancy at birth along with conventionally measured growth in labor

productivity for the decade ending in the year indicated by the point. “Health



                                      - 29 -
productivity growth” (measured as the change in life expectancy) rose until

1975 and then declined gradually since then. The trends in health and non-

health productivity appear to move quite differently.



      To calculate the value of improved health status, we use the approach

outlined above. We use two different approaches — the mortality approach and

the life-years approach. Under the mortality approach, shown for the simple

model in equation (7), the value of improved health status is calculated by

taking the change in the population weighted mortality rate times the

estimated value of lower mortality. Under the life-years approach, shown in

the simple model in equation (10), the economic value of improved health is

equal to the increase in life expectancy times the value of an additional life-

year. In both cases, the estimates are weighted by the share of the population

that is experiencing the lower mortality or greater life expectancy.



      C. Simple calculations



      It may be helpful to work through a simple example to illustrate the

methodology. For the period 1975 through 1995, the population-weighted

average decline in the mortality rate was 2249 per year per million persons.



                                       - 30 -
Taking the hedonic estimate of the value of fatalities prevented of $2.66 million

(which adjusts the $3 million in 1990 for movements in average consumption),

this decline in mortality would have a value of $5,980 per person over this

period. The average per capita consumption over this period was $14,700.

Hence the economic value of improvements of living standards due to reduced

mortality is estimated as 40 percent of consumption over this period, or about

2 percent per year. Table 2 shows this calculation using actual 1950 population

weights, and the growth is 1.8 percent per year.



     The estimate using the life-years method is somewhat more complicated.

Because improvements in mortality extend life expectancy in the future

(particularly in the case of reduced infant mortality), we must consider the

impact of discounting on valuation. The approach taken for this simple

example is to calculate the value of a life-year on the assumption that the

increase in the life-year takes place through a uniform reduction in mortality.

This allows us to use the valuation of mortality discussed above to estimate the

value of an additional life year. For example, in 1990, a uniform reduction in

mortality of 0.001 per year would lead to an increase in population-weighted

life expectancy of 1.16 years. Over the period 1975-1995, the increase in

population-weighted life expectancy was 2.1 years. The value of an additional



                                      - 31 -
undiscounted life-year is, according to the calculations presented above, equal

to $2,600 [see equation (12')]. Therefore the gain in health income over these

two decades was $2,600 H 2.1 life-years = $5,400. This is the equivalent of 1.6

percent per year in conventional consumption units. This is the close to the

estimate shown by the actual calculations in Table 2.



     D. Actual calculations



     The central results of this paper, showing calculations on the economic

contribution of health and non-health consumption, are shown in Table 2 and

in Figure 6. For these estimates, we use only changes in life expectancy and

omit any changes in morbidity (we discuss this question below). These

estimates differ from the simple calculations in the last section because they

use actual survival rates and population distributions rather than the

simplified ones assumed above.



     The major result that comes through using all techniques is that the value

of improvements in life expectancy improvements is about as large as the

value of all other consumption goods and services put together. For example,

over the two decades from 1975 to 1995, conventionally measured per capita



                                      - 32 -
consumption grew at an average rate of 2.0 percent per year. Over this period,

the annual average improvements in life expectancy had an economic value

between 1.6 and 2.0 percent of consumption.20 Over the entire period from

1900 to 1995, the value of improved health or health income grew at between

2.2 and 3.0 percent of consumption whereas consumption grew at a rate of

about 2.1 percent of consumption. Health income grew somewhat more slowly

than other consumption during the second half of this century while it

exceeded the value of the growth in consumption during the first half of the

20th century.



      The two techniques (the life-year approach and the mortality approach)

give approximately the same results. This is not surprising, for they are

calibrated to yield the same value of life lengthening for uniform mortality rate

changes. The mortality approach gives slightly larger numbers because of the

distribution of mortality changes.




20 Because there is no natural denominator for measuring improvements in health care, we
use the same denominator for calculating growth as we do for consumption. That is, the
growth in the value of health is calculated as )YHt/ct-1 whereas the growth in consumption
is calculated as )ct /ct-1 , where )YHt is the change in the per capita value of health income
and ct is the flow of consumption of goods and services during the previous period. This
allows us to compare the relative importance of consumption and improvements in health
status, whereas there is no obvious way to measure the value of the level of health status
(YHt).


                                            - 33 -
      How do expenditures on health improvements compare with

improvements in health income? This is a difficult question because spending

to improve health status pervades our market and non-market activities. Table

3 provides illustrative estimates of the magnitudes. To begin with, the bottom

three rows of Table 3 show the increase in non-health consumption and in

health income over the 1980-90 period. This shows again that the size of the

gains from health and non-health consumption are approximately the same.



      Market expenditures on conventional health care are reasonably well

tabulated. They were in 1990 about one-quarter of non-health personal

consumption expenditures. Many important items are excluded from these

figures. Two exclusions, shown in Table 3, are pollution abatement and

expenditures on sewage and sanitation. In addition, there may be substantial

non-market costs, primarily in time use. Our time-use studies are particularly

inadequate, but existing estimates indicate that the value non-market time

devoted to health is but a small fraction of market costs.



      The last column of Table 3 compares the increases in expenditures with

the increases in health income and non-health consumption for the period



                                      - 34 -
1980-90. These show that the increase in health income (from mortality alone)

is approximately the same size as the increase in non-health consumption. The

increase in expenditure on health care was approximately one-half the increase

in mortality-based health income. It seems likely, however, that a substantial

part of the expenditures (such as that on dental, psychiatric, vision-related, and

nursing home) was life-quality-enhancing rather than life-year-extending.

Suppose that half of the per capita of increased expenditures, or $600, was life-

extending; this would be a good investment for the increase in health income

of between $2,300 and $3,100 per capita over the 1980-90 period.



      E. Qualifications



      How robust are the estimates provided here? The underlying mortality

data are among the most reliable of our social statistics. The most fragile part

of the estimates concerns life and mortality valuation, as discussed above. One

assumption on which there is little evidence is that the premium on reduced

mortality is a constant fraction of per capita consumption over the entire

period. More precisely, we assume that the value of a reduction in the

mortality rate of 0.001 per year is $3 thousand in 1990 prices and we scale that

value over time to the ratio of the given year's per capita consumption to 1990



                                      - 35 -
per capita consumption. There are no comprehensive studies of the mortality

premium over time, although movements in the wage of risky occupations

(such as coal mining) are consistent with this assumption. I suspect, however,

that the premium has risen over time. This would be consistent with the rising

share of health care expenditures in total consumption. If the premium were

indeed increasing over time, then the contribution of health to economic

welfare would be relatively smaller in the earlier period and relatively larger in

the later period.



      A few other assumptions are of some significance but will not affect the

major results. One important issue is whether people should be weighted the

same at every age. Many health-care professionals and some survey evidence

suggest that the value of a life-year is higher in the middle of the life span

(between 20 and 40 years) than at either end.21 Most surveys indicate, for

example, that infant mortality would receive a lower weight than adult

mortality. Figure 7 shows an alternative set of weights proposed by Murray

which differ by age. Figures 8 and 9 show the trend and changes in weighted

and unweighted life expectancy for different discount rates. The weighted

series show virtually identical growth as the equally weighted series over the




                                       - 36 -
period 1900-50 but have slower growth in income in the 1950-95 period. In the

latter period, the growth in health income is between 10 and 20 percent slower

with differential age weights, primarily because the Murray weights put a

lower value on the increases in life expectancy of older people. Under this

alternative valuation approach, the contribution of improved longevity would

be slightly less than that shown in Table 2.



      Another major omission from this study is the value of reduced

morbidity. The data on morbidity is both more difficult to obtain and more

difficult to value. Recent studies indicate that including morbidity might add

another 5 percent or so to the value of health improvements estimates here.22



      V. Discussion and Conclusion



      This paper contributes to a new view of the economics of health. This

new view is that improvements in health status have been a major contributor

to economic welfare over the twentieth century. To a first approximation, the

economic value of increases in longevity in the last hundred years is about as



21 A particularly interesting discussion is contained in Murray and Lopez [1996].

22 See Cutler and Richardson [1997], discussed below.


                                           - 37 -
large as the value of measured growth in non-health goods and services. A

closer look shows that “health income” probably contributed somewhat more

than non-health goods and services in the first half of the 20th century and

marginally less than non-health goods and services since 1950. The medical

revolution over the last century appears to qualify, at least from an economic

point of view, for Samuel Johnson’s accolade as “the greatest benefit to

mankind.”



     The first question one should ask is whether this finding is plausible.

One way of considering the question is to consider the health equivalent of the

Sears-catalogue question:



            Consider the improvements to both health and non-health

     technologies over the last half century (say from 1948 to 1998). Health

     technologies include a variety of changes such as the Salk polio vaccine,

     new pharmaceuticals, joint replacement, improved sanitation, improved

     automobile safety, smoke-free workplaces, etc. Over this period, life

     expectancy at birth increased from a little above 68 year to a little less

     than 76 years. Non-health technologies were also wide-ranging and

     include the jet plane, television, superhighways, VCRs, and computers



                                      - 38 -
      (although the economic benefits of these are probably understated in

      measured consumption growth).

            Now consider the following choice. You must forgo either the

      health improvements over the last half-century or the non-health

      improvements. That is, you must choose either (a) 1948 health conditions

      and 1998 non-health living standards or (b) 1998 health conditions and

      1948 non-health living standards. Which would you choose?

If you would either choose (b) or find it a difficult choice, then you would

basically agree with the results of this paper. An informal poll finds most

people who either choose (b) or have great difficulty choosing, with older

people almost always opting for (b).



      A recent study by Cutler and Richardson, which examines the

improvements in “health capital” in the U.S., are consistent with the new view

put forth above.23 Health capital is the present value of the utility of health

status. Cutler and Richardson use both a years of life (YOL) approach and a

quality adjusted years of life (QALY) approach. Their estimates are only for the

years 1970, 1980, and 1990 and they present results only for persons of age 0

and 65. We can make a crude conversion of the Cutler-Richardson estimates to




                                       - 39 -
conform to our income estimates by annuitizing their health capital over the

expected lifetimes and then taking the changes in the income from health

capital as the increase in health income. Table 4 shows the comparison. Two

points should be drawn from this table. First, the overall estimates are

reasonably comparable. The estimates from Cutler and Richardson bracket the

estimates from the present study. One of the most surprising results of Cutler-

Richardson, not explained in the paper, is that moving from life-years to

QALYs does not change the results significantly. One possible reason for this

result is that improvements in the quality of life from lower morbidity are

offset by a higher average age (and therefore higher average morbidity) of the

population.



      There are many questions left open by the present findings. One

important point is that we cannot at this stage attribute the growth in health

income to particular investments or expenditures. Such a task, which would

apply the techniques of growth accounting to health improvements, is

especially challenging.24 It is also necessary if we are to understand not only




23 See Cutler and Richardson [1997].

24One of the most comprehensive studies of growth accounting is Denison [1961].


                                         - 40 -
the historical sources of improved health but also those investments that may

best contribute to future improvements.



      Another particularly important question is the extent to which

improvements arise from improved basic knowledge (such as the germ theory

of disease, the discovery of antibiotics, or the DNA revolution ) or investments

in improved health capital and infrastructure (such as larger investments in

health education or improvements in emergency response services). A second

issue, particularly relevant for the contribution of basic knowledge, is the

extent to which improvements in knowledge were domestically generated or

imported. It seems likely, for example, that most of the major medical

discoveries in the first part of the period covered here arose in Europe, while

America was increasingly the source of increases in medical knowledge in the

last few decades.25 To the extent that improvements in health income are due

to imported technologies, this emphasizes one of the gains from trade that is

largely overlooked in traditional measures of the economic impacts of

international trade.




25A non-technical history is contained in Porter [1997].


                                            - 41 -
      The new view of health economics should shape the way we think about

health policy. In the early 1990s, the general hysteria about rising health costs

led many to believe that the health-care system was wasteful, out of control,

and should be reined in. This view was particularly prevalent in the business

community, which saw rising health costs as a threat to national

competitiveness. The general atmosphere was colored by the substantial rise in

(measured) relative medical-care prices. Over the period from 1975 to 1995, the

CPI for medical care rose 64 percent faster than CPI for all goods and services.

In the face of rising prices and growing budgets, a natural response was to try

to control spending and limit services.



      If the results of this and other related papers are confirmed, then the role

of the health-care system should be rethought. Over the last half century,

economic welfare from health care expenditures appears to have contributed

as much to economic welfare as the rest of consumption expenditures. It is an

intriguing thought to contemplate that the social productivity of health-care

spending might be many times that of other spending. If this is anywhere near

the case, it would suggest that the image of a stupendously wasteful health-

care system is far off the mark.




                                      - 42 -
      Of course, as Table 3 suggests, health is more than doctors and hospitals.

It encompasses other parts of national output, such as pollution control and

highway safety spending, and reflects individual lifestyles, such as decisions

about smoking, drinking, driving, drugs, and exercise. Moreover, medical

knowledge is a global public good which is increased by efforts in many

countries. Because we cannot tally the totality of costs on health care, we

cannot say for sure whether we are getting 2 or 4 or 10 times the return on

health dollars that we are on non-health dollars. And it is surely the case that

health-care expenditures are often misallocated and wasteful. However,

notwithstanding the complexity and bureaucracy, improvements in health

status in the U.S. have yielded prodigious increases in economic welfare. It is

sobering to reflect that, were the author of this paper to have experienced the

1900 life table, the odds are long that this paper would have been written from

beyond the grave.

                                       Note: Bars show the increase in either conventionally measured per capita
                                       consumption and in per capita “health income” for the period. In each case, the
                                       denominator used in calculating the growth rate is the level of conventionally
                                       measured per capita consumption. The figures are averages of for five-year periods.
                                       The two right bars use the mortality approach and the life-years approach to valuing
                                       increases in longevity.
