                                           ABSTRACT

This paper outlines a tractable cost-benefit analysis of the buffer stock financial services provided
by international reserves and applies it to 8 of the largest Emerging Markets (BRICS, Indonesia,
Mexico, Turkey) during 2000-2019. The efficient management of international reserves generates
sizable benefits for countries characterized by hard-currency external debt. These benefits
increase with the volatility of the real exchange rates and sovereign spreads. While the first-best
policy calls for prudential regulations, counter-cyclical management of hoarding reserves in good
times and selling them in bad times provides buffers stock financial services adding up to about
3% of GDP during our sample period.

1. Introduction

    Successful buffer stock management of international reserves (henceforth IR) provides significant

financial services. The availability of IR mitigates financial fragility associated with balance sheet exposure

to maturing foreign debt, a role highlighted by Rodrik (2006), Aizenman and Lee (2007), and Jeanne and

Rancière (2011). The more recent research provides refined mechanisms explaining the evolution of IR use.

Bocola and Lorenzoni (2017) investigated the fiscal signaling role of IR in stabilizing exposure to multiple

equilibria. Bianchi, Hatchondo, and Martinez (2018) focused on the intertemporal arbitrage managed by the

central banks in countries where the private sector does not internalize the social costs of growing balance

sheet exposure to hard currency debt, and the central bank provides optimal hedging of the exposure to roll-

over risks. Alfaro and Kanczuk (2019) studied the impact of growing external local currency borrowing

induced by the post-GFC low-interest rates, explaining the simultaneous issuance of domestic debt by

emerging markets, while accumulating reserves that act as a hedge against external shocks.

    Against this background, our paper describes empirically a tractable framework accounting for the

intertemporal aspect of IR management, focusing on the transfer of purchasing power from times of relative

plenty to stormy, leaner times. We decompose the opportunity costs of managing the stock of international

reserves over time into two terms: a flow measure, corresponding to buying and selling international

reserves, plus the carrying cost of the stock. This decomposition allows us to quantify the welfare costs and

benefits of an active flow policy of hoarding international reserves in good times and selling IR in bad

times.

    Specifically, we consider an economy with a traded and non-traded sector, a balance sheet exposure of

hard currency debt, and a volatile real exchange rate. As noted by Rodrik (2006), the net effect of short-term

borrowing matched by a dollar increase of reserves is that the economy has borrowed short term abroad,

while accumulating a lower-yielding asset. In these circumstances, the sovereign spread between the private

sector cost of short-term borrowing abroad and the yield on international reserves measures the opportunity

cost of reserves in terms of foreign currency. This opportunity cost is measured in terms of the domestic

                                                     2
purchasing power, obtained by multiplying the dollar opportunity cost with the real exchange rate (i.e., the

local currency cost of a dollar deflated by the domestic price level). Conversely, the marginal benefit

associated with selling one reserve dollar is the sovereign spread times the real exchange rate. It follows that

international reserve accumulation, though itself costly, is in practice a store of tax revenue denominated in

hard currency, to be used in bad times to serve external hard currency debt, while the domestic debt may be

less costly to serve via inflation tax, financial repression, and other means [Aizenman and Marion (2004)].

    Section 2 presents data and preliminary analysis using Russia as a case study, together with evidence

from other emerging markets (BRICS, Indonesia, Mexico, Turkey). Section 3 follows with a comparative

analysis of the eight emerging-market countries and supplements with two counterfactual-analysis studies of

China and Russia. Section 4 provides concluding remarks.



2. Flow and stock IR management policies – definitions and measurement

with a case study of Russia

    We provide supporting evidence that bad times are associated with greater use of the international

reserves to serve external debt. The government is concerned with the cost of sovereign debts, recognizing

the impact of systemically important borrowers (i.e., large banks, state, and prime borrowers). Our analysis

studies the benefits of IR buffer stock management in the context of the volatile real exchange rate, where

the sovereign spreads may be affected by hoarding international reserves.

    Focusing first on Russia, we start by illustrating the cumulative benefits of an active buffer stock policy

for a prime commodity-exporting country. Our data include international reserves, nominal exchange rates,

real exchange rates, sovereign bond yields, external debt, imports, and the monetary base. We use quarterly

data from 2000Q1 to 2019Q1, extracted via the Eikon API from Thomson Reuters database of statistical

reports of national agencies and international financial organizations. Appendix Figure A1 provides the time

profile of macroeconomic series in our sample. For a commodity country, stronger terms of trade, higher

dollar prices of oil in the case of Russia, go hands-in-hands with rising foreign-currency oil revenue,

                                                     3
appreciating Ruble, and falling sovereign credit spreads, while the reverse applies at times of weaker terms

of trade. This finding is in line with Algieri (2013), showing that the Russian real exchange rate

determination depends on the fluctuation of oil prices and IR management. Qian and Steiner (2017) show

that effective IR management increases the share of long-term in total external debt and reinforces financial

stability. Bhattacharya, Mann, and Nkusu (2019) confirm empirically the importance of terms of trade

volatility in accounting for the demand of IR by emerging markets economies.

2.1 The net present value of financial buffer stock services

     The starting point of our analysis is Rodrik’s (2006) public finance evaluation of the opportunity costs

of international reserves (IR) in terms of sovereign spreads. Specifically, the spread between the yield on

liquid reserve assets and the external cost of funds—a difference of several percentage points in normal

times—represents the social cost of self-insurance. To illustrate, consider the case where Russian IR are

held in the dollar, Russia’s sovereign borrowing cost at time 𝑡 is 𝑖𝑅𝑈,𝑡 , and the interest rate on U.S. Treasury

of the same maturity is 𝑖𝑡∗ . Denoting Russian dollar international reserves at time t by 𝐼𝑅𝑅𝑈,𝑡 , the flow costs

of Russian IR is the spread times the stock of international reserves, 𝐼𝑅𝑅𝑈,𝑡 (𝑖𝑅𝑈,𝑡 − 𝑖𝑡∗ ).

     Denoting the ruble cost of a dollar at time t by 𝐸𝑅𝑈,𝑡 , Russian CPI at time 𝑡 by 𝐶𝑃𝐼𝑅𝑈,𝑡 , and the social

discount factor by 𝜌, the net present value (n.p.v.) of Russian’s IR opportunity cost held between the period

𝑡1 and 𝑡2 , denoted by 𝛤(𝐼𝑅𝑅𝑈;𝑡1 ...𝑡2 ), is:

                                                       𝑡        1                        𝐸
     (1)                      𝛤(𝐼𝑅𝑅𝑈;𝑡1 ...𝑡2 ) = − ∑𝑡21 [ (1+𝜌)𝑡 𝐼𝑅𝑅𝑈,𝑡 (𝑖𝑅𝑈,𝑡 − 𝑖𝑡∗ ) 𝐶𝑃𝐼𝑅𝑈,𝑡 ]
                                                                                             𝑅𝑈,𝑡


     The minus sign stands for cost, and the net present valuation is done in terms of Russian purchasing

power discounted to time 𝑡1 . The opportunity cost is proportionate to the sovereign spreads during the

period, weighted by the reserves evaluated in domestic purchasing power.

     To gain further insight into the degree to which international reserves provide an efficient country

cyclical buffer, we transform 𝛤(𝐼𝑅𝑅𝑈;𝑡1 ...𝑡2 ) into the sum of two terms: the NPV of the opportunity cost of

the stock (cumulative), 𝐼𝑅, and the NPV of the opportunity cost of the flow adjustments, 𝛥𝐼𝑅𝑅𝑈,𝑡 :

 Henceforth, we denote the second term by 𝛷(𝐼𝑅𝑅𝑈;𝑡1 ,...,𝑡2 );

                                                                                       𝑅𝑈,𝑡                                          𝑅𝑈,𝑡


        The value of 𝛷 measures Central Bank’s countercyclical efficiency of trading IR. The benefits

 associated with Central Bank’s foreign exchange “leaning against the wind” policy are higher if the bank

 buys IR in times of plenty (i.e., high oil price, low sovereign spreads, and strong Ruble), and sells IR in

 rainy days (i.e., low oil price, high sovereign spreads, and weak Ruble). The cumulated gain reported in (3)

 depends also on the volatility of the sovereign spreads, and the volatility of the real exchange rate during

 the sample period. Other things being equal, higher 𝛷(𝐼𝑅𝑅𝑈;𝑡1 ,...,𝑡2 ) is associated with a higher quality of IR

 management of a central bank during a commodity cycle. In the empirical applications of these equations,

 we recognize that countries hold their IR in a basket that includes the dollar as well as other currencies. As

 we do not have information on the varying currency composition for each country, we assume that their

                                                                   5
basket equals the average composition reported by the IMF. Specifically, we evaluate the international

reserves by the sovereign spread on key currencies (US dollar, Euro, Japanese Yen, British pound) using

the weights provide by the IMF for the ‘average country’ (see Appendix Figure A2 for the time profile of

international interest rates, including US, Euro, Japan, and the UK). The weights applied to foreign interest

rates and exchange rates are based on the currency composition of IR, shown in Appendix Figure A3.

    Our estimates of IR financial buffer stock services may misstate both the real opportunity cost when

purchasing IR in good times and the amount of benefit when selling IR in stormy days. According to the

theory of precautionary IR, hoarding adequate IR reduces the likelihood of external debt crises and a bad

equilibrium in the presence of balance sheet exposure; that is, country risk is lower when a country hoards

adequate IR. Lower country risk leads to lower sovereign spread, hence lower real opportunity cost

calculated according to equation (2). Thus, equation (2) understates the true real opportunity cost of hoarding

IR. Moreover, selling IR to defend against the financial crisis makes the adverse impact of crisis less

severe. Had a country got no IR to defend itself, the sovereign spread would be higher, and the exchange

rate would depreciate further during a financial crisis, both of which bias down the social benefits provided

by IR buffer stock role calculated by equation (2). Section 3 address this potential bias in detail.

2.2. An application for Russia and emerging markets: BRICS+3

     Subject to the availability of quarterly data, the estimation sample starts as follows: Brazil: 2006Q1,

China: 2002Q2, India: 2002Q1, Indonesia: 2003Q2, Mexico: 2003Q1, Russia: 2001Q3, Turkey: 2000Q2,

South Africa: 2000Q2. We report in Figure 1 the cumulated buffer services of IR (𝛷(𝐼𝑅𝑅𝑈,𝑡 )) and the n.p.v.

buffer services of IR (𝛤(𝐼𝑅𝑅𝑈,𝑡 )) scaled by the average IR holdings (𝑀(𝐼𝑅𝑅𝑈,𝑡 )), where a discount factor 𝜌

is a 2 percent real interest rate. The top panel reports the cumulated social benefit of IR interventions,

                                                                                                   𝛷(𝐼𝑅        )
where buying reserves is a cost; selling is a benefit (equation (3): 𝛷(𝐼𝑅𝑅𝑈,𝑡 ) on the left axis; 𝑀(𝐼𝑅 𝑅𝑈,𝑡)) on the
                                                                                                        𝑅𝑈,𝑡

(equation (1): 𝛤(𝐼𝑅𝑅𝑈,𝑡 ) on the left axis; 𝑀(𝐼𝑅 𝑅𝑈,𝑡)) on the right axis). For the case of Russia, Figure 1.1 top

panel indicates that during 2002-2019, the Russian central bank interventions added to the benefit of about

2 percent of the average IR (discounted to 2002), shifting purchasing power from good times (when Russia

hoarded IR) to bad times (when Russia sold IR to service and pay some of its terms debt). Figure 1.1

bottom panel indicates that the total cost for Russia during that period was about 5 percent of its average IR

position.

    For cross-country comparison, we report the flow buffer services of IR (𝜙(𝐼𝑅𝐿𝐶𝑈,𝑡 )) scaled by GDP

(𝑌𝑅𝐿𝐶𝑈,𝑡 ); 𝐿𝐶𝑈 denotes the local currency unit adjusted by the weighted real exchange rates (equation (2)).

Figure 2.1 illustrates the case study of Russia; Figures 2.2-2.8 provide the measures for other emerging

markets in the BRICS+3 group. The top panel plots the flow costs and benefits of IR buffer services of

Russia from 2001 to 2019, defined by equation (2) (𝜙(𝐼𝑅𝑅𝑈,𝑡 ), dotted line, left axis), and the flow costs and

                                         𝜙(𝐼𝑅𝑅𝑈,𝑡 )
benefits scaled by Russia's real GDP (             , solid line, right axis). The middle panel traces the real
                                          𝑌𝑅𝑅𝑈,𝑡

                 𝐸
exchange rate (𝐶𝑃𝐼𝑅𝑈,𝑡 , solid line, left axis in log scale; higher values correspond to a weaker Russia's real
                     𝑅𝑈,𝑡


exchange rate), and the sovereign credit spreads (𝑖𝑅𝑈,𝑡 − 𝑖𝑡∗, dotted line, right axis). The bottom panel

provides the quarterly percentage change of IR (𝛥𝐼𝑅𝑅𝑈,𝑡 , dotted line, left axis), and the oil price

(USD/barrel, solid line, right axis).

    The price of oil increased in the early 2000s from about 30 USD/barrel to 140 USD/barrel before the

global financial crisis. During that period, the Ruble appreciated, and the Central Bank of the Russian

Federation increased its international reserves rapidly, reaching more than 600 billion USD. The flow

(opportunity) cost of this IR accumulation, traced in the top panel of Figure 2.1, was well below 1/3 percent

of the GDP during most of this period. In contrast, during the worst part of the Global Financial Crisis

when the Ruble was sharply depreciating, and Russia's sovereign credit spreads were rapidly increasing,

the central bank sold more than 200 billion USD of Russia's IR, providing the Russian economy significant

flow benefits of hoarding IR close to 1.5 percent of the GDP. Similar patterns applied from the early 2010s,

a time of renewed rising oil prices, until the sharp drop in 2015. These charts show a remarkable coherence

of the Russian intervention with the logic of buffer management – selling IR at times of rising sovereign


                                                        7
spreads, funding thereby the reduction of foreign-currency external debt by IR that the central bank

accumulated in times of plenty (i.e., rising oil prices, appreciating ruble, and declining sovereign spreads).

    To put this discussion in the proper perspective, note that the overall successful buffer policy of Russia

during 2000-2019 is a second-best policy. The first-best policy may include macroprudential regulations

and possibly external-borrowing taxes to scale down the balance sheet exposure of Russia by raising the

costs of borrowing in good times. Proper application of these policies may reduce the need for large

hoarding to support the bailouts of systemic borrowers in bad times (Rodrik (2006)). Such a first-best policy

also reduces the exposure to the moral hazard associated with bailing out borrowers in bad times. Political

economy considerations suggest that the Russian central bank, operating with limited ability to impose

macroprudential regulations on powerful insiders, may be credited for saving Russia from a much costlier

exposure to sudden stops of the 1998 Russian crisis variety.2

3. Comparative Analysis

    For our comparative analysis, we test the association between IR financial buffer stock services and its

components for Russia and Mexico, having sufficiently long data series covering two decades. We use the

vector autoregression (VAR) methodology to estimate the impact of reserve accumulation, sovereign

spreads, and real exchange rates on the IR financial buffer services during the period from 2000 to 2019.

Notably, the feedback among our key variables violates the assumption of exogeneity. For example,

currency appreciation and declining sovereign spreads may encourage reserve accumulation. A favorable

history of IR financial buffer services may lower over time spreads and may induce more hoarding of

reserves. The VAR methodology may deal with some of these concerns by tracing the responses of IR

financial buffer services to its components and the responses of its components to IR financial buffer

services.

    Specifically, we consider the following system of equations for IR financial buffer stock services

(𝑓𝑏𝑠), the real exchange rate (𝑟𝑒𝑟), sovereign spreads (𝑠𝑝𝑟), and IR hoarding (𝑖𝑟ℎ):




                                                    8

Dickey-Fuller tests reject the null hypothesis that these series have unit roots (non-stationary). Since we

used quarterly data, we include a maximum of 4 lags. Using AIC criteria to select the optimal number of

lags, we found that 1 lag was appropriate in this sample.

To assess the interactions between the series, we obtained the variance decompositions. The moving-

average representations of the above system of equations express 𝑓𝑏𝑠𝑡 , 𝑖𝑟ℎ𝑡 , 𝑠𝑝𝑟𝑡 , 𝑟𝑒𝑟𝑡 as dependent on the

current and past values of 𝑒1𝑡 , 𝑒2𝑡 , 𝑒3𝑡 , 𝑒4𝑡 sequences:

         (5)           𝑓𝑏𝑠𝑡 = 𝑎0 + ∑𝑇𝑗=1[ (𝑎1𝑗 𝑒1𝑡−𝑗 + 𝑎2𝑗 𝑒2𝑡−𝑗 + 𝑎3𝑗 𝑒3𝑡−𝑗 + 𝑎4𝑗 𝑒4𝑡−𝑗 )] + 𝑒1𝑡

                      𝑟𝑒𝑟𝑡 = 𝑏0 + ∑[ (𝑏1𝑗 𝑒1𝑡−𝑗 + 𝑏2𝑗 𝑒2𝑡−𝑗 + 𝑏3𝑗 𝑒3𝑡−𝑗 + 𝑏4𝑗 𝑒4𝑡−𝑗 )] + 𝑒2𝑡
                                       𝑗=1

      where 𝑎0 , 𝑏0 , 𝑐0 , 𝑑0 are vectors containing constants; and 𝑎.𝑗 , 𝑏.𝑗 , 𝑐.𝑗 , 𝑑.𝑗 are parameters. We use the

attributable to each type of innovation. We apply the orthogonalized innovations obtained from a Choleski

decomposition; the order of the variables in the factorization had qualitative effects on the results,

depending on the contemporaneous correlations among 𝑒1𝑡 , 𝑒2𝑡 , 𝑒3𝑡 , 𝑒4𝑡 .

    The variance decompositions for an 8-quarter forecasting horizon are in Table 1. Each time series

explains most of its past values; 𝑓𝑏𝑠𝑡 explains over 95.4 percent of its forecast error variances, 𝑠𝑝𝑟𝑡 59.2

percent, 𝑟𝑒𝑟𝑡 42.2 percent, and 𝑖𝑟ℎ𝑡 28.9 percent. Notably, IR buffer stock services (𝑓𝑏𝑠𝑡 ) explain 38.8

percent for Russia's sovereign spread (𝑠𝑝𝑟𝑡 ), 32.4 percent of the forecast error variance of Russia's real

exchange rate (𝑟𝑒𝑟𝑡 ), and 66.5 percent for Russia's IR hoarding (𝑖𝑟ℎ𝑡 ). Note, however, that the

contemporaneous correlation among 𝑒1𝑡 , 𝑒2𝑡 , 𝑒3𝑡 , 𝑒4𝑡 were about 0.5 across the pairs of residuals.

    To support the order of the variables in the factorization above, shown in Table 2, we apply Granger

causality tests. We find that the effects of IR hoarding on IR buffer stock services are significant at the

0.0965 level, and the effects of real exchange rate on IR buffer stock services are significant at the 0.0137

level. In contrast, the effects of IR buffer stock services on the real exchange rate and IR hoarding are not

statistically significant at conventional 0.1000 levels. For Russia, our tests, therefore, suggest that causality

goes from IR hoarding to real exchange rate, sovereign spread, and IR buffer stock services. Thus,

causality is unidirectional. Note, however, that the causality tests for IR buffer stock services to GDP are

more conclusive than the tests for IR buffer stock services to M2; more on the normalization by M2 and

internal drainage of IR below). Overall, this finding helps address the concern that an endogeneity in

equations (1) – (3) might cause a misestimation in the IR buffer stock services.

3.1 Benefits of IR buffer stock services and dependence on commodity

exports

    Do interactions of IR buffer stock services, real exchange rates, sovereign spreads, and IR hoarding

vary with country dependence on commodity exports? Considering the size of commodity exports/GDP

and commodities/exports (UNCTAD), Brazil, Indonesia, Russia, and South Africa stand out as commodity

exporters in this sample. The share of commodities in total exports is Brazil 63%, Indonesia 58%, Russia
                                                     10
74%, South Africa 55%, compared to China 8%, India 42% (of which 37% was refined petroleum of

mostly imported crude oil), Mexico 19%, and Turkey 23%. We estimated the variance decomposition for

Russia and Mexico, as both have a sufficiently long time series for the tests. Figure 3 summarizes the

findings. Despite the much lower commodity exposure of Mexico relative to Russia, they share similar

variance decomposition - IR buffer stock services explain more than 60 percent of the forecast error

variance in IR hoarding of Russia and Mexico.

    De facto exchange rate management is probably relevant to these findings. According to the IMF

classification, except China, all other countries in our sample are under a floating exchange rate regime.

Referring to the Granger causality tests in Table 2.1, the effects Russia's IR hoarding on the real exchange

rate is significant at the 0.0667 level, while the effects of Russia's real exchange rate on IR buffer stock

services and sovereign spreads are significant at the 0.0137 and 0.0234, respectively. For Russia, the tests

suggest a unidirectional causality. In contrast, the direction of causality is inconclusive in the case of

Mexico. These findings portray a different picture of the financial benefits of IR buffer stock services for

commodity and non-commodity exporters. Our measure of IR buffer stock services captures mostly the

precautionary motives for the commodity exporters, while other motives (e.g., mercantilist) are

confounders in the IR hoarding of non-commodity exporters and might contribute to underestimation of the

IR buffer stock services. These country-specific differences highlight the benefits of combining our

framework with a country case study and policy attributes.


  We also use OLS estimation to examine the associations. Tables 3.1-3.3 account for the importance of
the reserve accumulation, sovereign spreads and real exchanges in explaining the time variation of the total
net present value of the costs of the IR over time per dollar reserves. The results indicates the following
patterns in our sample:

IR flow services (percent of GDP): On average, countries with the largest flow benefits are Brazil, followed
by India, and Turkey. Real exchange rate (E/CPI) explains more than half of the IR flow services.

IR cumulated flow services (percent of IR): On average, countries with the largest cumulated benefits are
Turkey, followed by Indonesia, and South Africa. Real exchange rate (E/CPI) and sovereign spreads
explain most of the IR cumulated services.
                                                     11
IR cumulated flow services + opportunity costs (percent of IR): On average, countries with the largest
cumulated benefits are Turkey, followed by Indonesia, and South Africa. Real exchange rate (E/CPI) and
sovereign spreads explain most of the IR cumulated services. Note that IR opportunity costs are much
greater than the cumulated flow services.

Commodity exporters and reserve-hoarding benefits:

   The financial services of reserve hoarding also vary with country dependence on commodity exports.
Table 4 reports the coefficient estimates of real exchange rates across our measures of buffer-stocks IR
services along with commodity exports/GDP and commodities/exports. Brazil, Indonesia, Russia, and
South Africa evidently stand out as commodity exporters in this sample.

   For the group of commodity exporters, the coefficient estimates of real exchange rate (E/CPI) for Russia
are largely supportive that the real depreciation increases the IR financial services. For Brazil, Indonesia,
and South Africa, we find the opposite: the coefficient estimates of real exchange rate are negative,
suggesting that the real depreciation lowers the IR services; the results for Brazil are mixed, depending on
our IR service measures.

   For the group of non-commodity exporters, our estimates for China and India consistently show that real
exchange rate depreciation increases the IR financial services. We do not find such supportive evidence for
Mexico and Turkey.



3.2 Internal and external drainage of IR

     Thus far, we measured IR buffer stock services relative to GDP. Obstfeld et al. (2010) pointed out that

the internal drain (e.g., capital flight from domestic M2) is an important factor affecting the holding of IR

in developing countries. If part of IR is used to deal with the flight of M2, 𝑖𝑅𝑈;𝑡 in equation (1) and other

equations is replaced by the weighted average, 𝑤𝑥𝑑 ∗ 𝑖𝑅𝑈;𝑡
                                                      𝑒𝑥𝑡           𝑖𝑛𝑡
                                                           + 𝑤𝑀2 ∗ 𝑖𝑅𝑈;𝑡 , where 𝑤𝑥𝑑 and 𝑤𝑀2 are,

respectively, the relative weight that IR is used for insurance against external debt crisis and internal drain

of M2 (i.e., bank run); 𝑖𝑅𝑈;𝑡
                         𝑒𝑥𝑡
                              is the interest rate of hard currency liabilities and 𝑖𝑅𝑈;𝑡
                                                                                     𝑖𝑛𝑡
                                                                                          is the interest rate of

domestic currency liabilities.

     Considering that we do not have adequate disaggregated interest rate data on both the hard currency

and domestic currency liabilities for countries in the sample, we added in Table 2 the variance
                                                       12
decomposition of IR buffer stock services relative to M2 in Figure 3, and the corresponding Granger

causality tests. The effects of Russia's IR hoarding on the real exchange rate is significant at the 0.0667

level, while the effects of Russia's real exchange rate on IR buffer stock services and sovereign spreads are

significant at the 0.0003 and 0.0234, respectively. While our findings are consistent across the denominators

(i.e., GDP, M2), more analysis on the external and internal drainage of IR deserves further investigation

and is left for future research. Future extensions may also integrate the concepts of international reserves

and foreign currency liquidity as outlined in IMF (2013), highlighting the distinction across foreign

currency resources (IR and other foreign currency assets) and foreign currency drains (predetermined

foreign currency liabilities and financial derivative positions, and contingent drains from undrawn credit

lines).

3.3 IR hoarding and the counterfactuals

     Our measure of the cost and benefit of IR hoarding hinges on the real exchange rate and sovereign

spread. However, if the spread is fair compensation for default risk, and in the absence of frictions

associated with costly enforcement of contracts and other frictions, we may consider it not a cost. In a

model with excess returns, Bianchi et al. (AER 2018) show that optimal IR policy is determined also by the

effect of IR on spreads. In addition to the variance decomposition of IR hoarding, sovereign spread, and

real exchange rate presented above, Figure 4 and Table 5 provide a counterfactual analysis of the size of

China's reserves and real exchange rates. China's reserves accumulation accelerated from less than 20

percent of GDP in the 2000s, reached almost 50 percent of GDP in early 2010 and had since decelerated.

The counterfactual analysis focused on the causal effect of this IR policy intervention on a time series of

China's real exchange rate. Given the China's real exchange rate (henceforth RER) time series and a set of

control RER time series (Brazil, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Russian, Turkey, and South Africa), we follow

Brodersen et al. (2015), constructing a Bayesian structural time-series model to predict the counterfactual,

i.e., how China's RER would have evolved after the 2010 China's IR intervention if the intervention had

never occurred.

                                                    13
    As the counterfactual analysis is a non-experimental approach to causal inference, the assumption is

that there is a set control time series (RER of other EMs) that were themselves not affected by China's IR

intervention. If the RER of Brazil and other EMs were affected by China's IR policy of 2010, this analysis

might misestimate the true effect. The counterfactual analysis also assumes that the relationship between

China's RER (treated) and other EMs' RER (controlled) time series during the pre-treatment period is stable

throughout the post-treatment period. Subject to specific priors, the analysis performs posterior inference

on the counterfactual and returns a China's counterfactual RER. To estimate a causal effect, we used the

observations of 2002Q2-2009Q4 for training the model (pre-intervention period) and the observations of

the 2010Q1-2019Q1 period for computing a counterfactual prediction (post-intervention period). We then

examined China's real exchange rate series and counterfactuals based on the Bayesian structural time-series

models, comparing the actual data and a counterfactual prediction for the post-treatment period. We also

estimated the difference between observed China's RER data and counterfactual China's RER predictions;

the pointwise causal effect, as estimated by the model. The counterfactual prediction suggested that the

deceleration of reserve hoarding policy resulted in the appreciation of the Chinese real exchange rate close

to 20 percent in the decade that followed. This evidence was supportive that China's IR intervention had a

causal effect on China's RER. Because our controls (other EMs' RER series) might be affected by China's

intervention, the analysis depended on whether this assumption is justified.

4. Concluding Remarks

   Our analysis focused on the recent international reserves management of emerging-market economies.

The sample period covers 2000-2019, including the commodity cycles of 2002-2007, and the oil-price rise

and the drop of 2014, events that significantly impacted terms of trade of emerging markets. We provided a

tractable analysis of the costs and benefits of the precautionary management of reserves, aiming at reducing

the expected costs of serving external debt at times of volatile commodity terms of trade and heightened

real exchange rate volatility. The exposure to commodity cycles is not unique to the emerging markets, yet




                                                   14
emerging markets tend with limited financial development tend to rely more on active international

reserves management.3

    Issues left future study include the rollover risks and liquidity needs of financial institutions, the

availability of swap lines among the central banks, active hedging of commodity risk via options by central

banks, prudential regulations and active management of assets and liabilities aiming at reducing

mismatches in maturity, interest rate, foreign exchange risks, and optimal exchange rate policy.

prospect of extreme foreign exchange movements that may induce financial instability.

Table 2. Granger causality tests of Russia's IR financial buffer stock services

This table reports Granger causality tests of all possible combinations of the time series with a maximum of 4 lags (quarters). The rows are the response variable, and the columns
are the predictors. The values in the table are the p-values, of which lesser than the significance level (0.05) implies the null hypothesis that the coefficients of the corresponding
past values are zero, that is, the 𝑥 (predictor, in columns) does not cause (does not improve the forecasting performance of) 𝑦 (response, in rows) can be rejected. The IR financial
buffer stock services are based on equation (2); a flow measure, % of GDP, and % of M2.

Table 5. Causal Impact of IR on REER: China and Russia
We study two IR policy changes: China’s 2010Q2 and Russian’s 2014Q2. The estimated average causal effect of China's IR 2010Q2 policy intervention
treatment was 19 (an appreciation): the actual (average) value is 116 and the predicted (average) value is 98. The 90 percent posterior interval of the
average effect is [15, 23]; See also Figure 4.1. The estimated average causal effect of Russia's IR 2014Q2 policy intervention treatment was -17 (a
depreciation): the actual (average) value is 83 and the predicted (average) value is 100. The 90 percent posterior interval of the average effect is [-24,
-7]; See also Figure 4.2.
