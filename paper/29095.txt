                                          ABSTRACT

Upon assuming power for the first time in 1935, the Norwegian Labour Party delivered on its
promise of a major schooling reform. The reform raised minimum instruction time in less
developed rural areas and boosted the resources available to rural schools, reducing class size and
increasing teacher salaries. We document that cohorts more intensively affected by the reform
significantly increased their education and experienced higher labor income. Our main result is
that the schooling reform also substantially increased support for the Norwegian Labour Party in
subsequent elections. This additional support persisted for several decades and was pivotal in
maintaining support for the social democratic coalition in Norway. These results are not driven by
the direct impact of education and are not explained by higher turnout, or greater attention or
resources from the Labour Party targeted towards the municipalities most affected by the reform.
Rather, our evidence suggests that cohorts that benefited from the schooling reform, and their
parents, rewarded the party for delivering a major reform that was beneficial to them.

1     Introduction
Workers or Labour parties, later referred to as Social Democratic Parties, rose to power in Scandi-
navia in the 1930s and proceeded to build new institutions based on macroeconomic management,
collective bargaining, fiscal redistribution, and social programs such as publicly-provided univer-
sal education, social security and national health care. Similar institutions were adopted in the UK
starting in 1942 and in much of the rest of Europe after World War II.
     These institutions were a sharp break from what prevailed before. In contrast to what is some-
times claimed, politics in Scandinavian societies were dominated by parties representing large
businesses or landowners and their economies were rural and highly unequal (Atkinson and Sø-
gaard 2016; Bengtsson 2019; Aaberge et al. 2020). For example, the pre-tax Gini coefficient in
Norway was 0.57 in 1930--much higher than today's very high unequal Latin American societies.
After the 1930s, however, Social Democratic Parties dominated Scandinavian countries and re-
shaped their economies. The political power of large businesses and landowners waned, and as
a result of various redistributive policies and the active role of labor unions in wage setting, in-
equality started diminishing rapidly. For example, the pre-tax Gini coefficient in Norway went
from 0.57 to 0.25 by 1970 (Aaberge et al. 2020). In addition, social mobility increased substantially
for cohorts born after the 1930s in Sweden and Norway (Björklund et al. 2009; Pekkarinen et al.
2017).
     From our 21st-century vantage point, the adoption and implementation of such radical re-
forms may appear surprising. How did these new parties, with fairly radical reform agendas,
come to such prominence and received widespread electoral support? There is little research and
certainly no consensus on this question, despite its importance, especially today when many com-
mentators are calling for institutional reform throughout the Western and emerging world (e.g.
Esping-Andersen et al. 2002; Rajan 2019; Stiglitz 2019).
     In this paper, we investigate this question in the Norwegian context. The Norwegian Labour
Party rose to power in 1935, under the leadership of Johan Nygaardsvold and with the support
of the Agrarian Party. It remained in government for most of the subsequent five decades.1 The
formation of the first Labour government was preceded by the party's clear break from its earlier
revolutionary Marxist ideology and a new strategy building on a strong commitment to parlia-
mentary democracy, a message of unity between rural and urban areas and a willingness to seek
compromises with other parties and with employer organizations. A central pillar of the Labour
Party's economic agenda was a major school reform--the reform of primary schools was listed in
its program as the third priority, after democratic rights and equal justice. At the time, Norwe-
gian education was highly decentralized and unequal, with rural areas having short school years
    1 The
        Nygaardsvold's cabinet of 1935 was in fact Norway's second Labour government, with the first attempt--
Hornsrud's cabinet in 1928--lasting only two weeks, without passing any legislation. During the German occupation
in 1940­45, Nygaardsvold's cabinet acted as an exile government based in London.


                                                       1
and limited school resources. The Labour Party promised to harmonize education and to increase
school quality and instruction time in rural areas. As its first major reform, the new government
launched an ambitious education reform, the Folk School Law of 1936, which increased funding
and resources, reduced class-size, expanded minimum instruction time and raised teacher salaries
for rural schools.2
    Although sometimes overlooked in the historical work on the Scandinavian labor movement,
education was a key pillar of social democratic agenda not just in Norway. The aim of the move-
ment was to achieve greater social equality, and education was seen as an important tool for alter-
ing the distribution of opportunities (Rothstein 1998). It was envisaged that the initial conditions
for individuals would be made more equal with the help of state intervention in education or, as
formulated by Lewin (1967), "the coercive power of the state". In Sweden, for example, leading
social democrats such as Tage Erlander, Olof Palme and Alva Myrdal were deeply involved in the
planning and implementation of education policy. Indeed, Myrdal saw the education policy as
"the primary strategic instrument for abolishing class barriers" (Rothstein 1998).
    We find that the 1936 education reform in Norway had distinct economic and political effects.
We first show that years of education increased among the birth cohorts of boys living in areas
most affected by the reform exactly at the time when the reform started to affect these cohorts.
Importantly, the reform did not alter years of mandatory education nor the provision of non-
mandatory education. Thus these results likely reflect better preparedness for further education.
We also estimate a positive effect on earnings in later life. For women, we do not find a statis-
tically significant effect on post-mandatory education but--consistent with improved quality of
primary education having direct labor market returns--there is a strong impact on their later in-
come. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the reform may have had major intergenerational
effects, although many of these estimates are not statistically significant due to our research de-
sign's relatively low statistical power for intergenerational analysis.
    Our main focus is not the effects of the reform on education or earnings, but on Norwegian
institutions and politics. We show that the reform was critical for the support for the Labour
Party in subsequent elections in rural and less-developed parts of Norway. Before the reform, the
Labour Party had less support in rural municipalities than urban areas. After 1936, however, its
vote share increased substantially in the more affected rural municipalities. These effects persisted
for at least two decades and are robust to controlling for region and pre-reform industry structure
and average income. A back-of-an-envelope calculation suggests that the increase in the vote share
of the Labour Party in rural areas would have been 1.4­4.6 percentage points lower in 1945 if the
reform had not taken place. The increase in rural support--a total of 3.9 percentage points--was
critical for the party, since in the meantime it lost 3.8 percentage points of its support in the cities.
  2 The  other Nordic (Denmark, Sweden plus Finland) countries initiated and established similar school reforms for
the rural and urban areas following the Norwegian reform (Mediås 2004).



                                                        2
As a consequence, the traditionally higher support the Labour Party enjoyed in cities disappeared
and the party has since been equally popular in rural and urban areas.
    In the last part of this paper, we examine the mechanisms behind the impact of the reform
on the Labour Party's electoral success. We show that it is not because of a "direct education
effect"--whereby the educated are more likely to be Labour Party supporters. In fact, during this
period, highly-educated Norwegians were more likely to vote for the more conservative parties.
In addition, the electoral effect is largest in the first elections held after the reform, when most of
the individuals directly affected by the reform were not yet eligible to vote. We also show that
the Labour Party did not increase its electoral success because of increased political participation
in the form of higher turnout (which was already very high in Norway at this time) or because it
devoted greater attention or resources to the municipalities most affected by the reform.
    Rather, we argue our results are explained by the fact that the 1936 education reform was a
major promise of the Labour Party and a central pillar of its program for helping the less advan-
taged parts of the country. The party delivered on its promise of major educational reform, and
voters rewarded it with lasting electoral support--especially by broadening the social democratic
coalition with the addition of previously-more conservative rural voters.
    We provide four pieces of evidence consistent with this interpretation. First, we find that the
electoral effect is largely driven by municipalities that had not been previously exposed to Labour
rule at local level, indicating a switch from conservative to Labour politics in places that bene-
fited from the education reform. Second, using individual-level survey data collected from 1957
parliamentary elections, we find that voters who themselves had experienced increased schooling
and improved school quality were much more likely to support the Labour Party. Third, rural
Norwegians with children born into the cohorts who had benefited from the 1936 school reform
were also much more likely to support the Labour Party than individuals with somewhat older
children (so that it was not just those receiving the education, but their entire family becoming
more pro-Labour). Fourth, in the same survey more than 90% of the respondents agreed that the
Norwegian Labour Party had been willing and able to implement its agenda and those directly
affected, and their parents, were particularly likely to hold this view.
    Our methodology does not distinguish whether voters updated their beliefs about the com-
petency of the Labour Party or felt indebted to the Labour Party.3 Nevertheless, the evidence is
fairly clear that both inhabitants who benefited from the school reform and their parents were
   3 Greater support for a party that has kept its promises and delivered public goods is consistent with several mech-

anisms. In addition to a change in beliefs about the "type" of the party, it could be because of standard retrospective
voting (e.g., Ferejohn 1986; Persson et al. 2000) or because voters feel reciprocal altruism towards the party. Each of
these mechanisms can be seen in functioning democracies but have also been at times associated with clientelistic or
populist policies (e.g., Acemoglu et al. (2013) on the belief channel, Caprettini et al. (2021) on retrospective voting,
and Finan and Schechter (2012) on reciprocal altruism). We suspect that the reason why the school reform in Norway
contributed to the formation of a social democratic coalition, rather than any type of clientelistic political dynamics, is
both because of the broad-based nature of the policy in question and the efforts of the Labour Party to build a diverse
coalition in support of its agenda.

much more likely to vote for the Norwegian Labour Party than other rural residents and thus
provided the popular support for the Social Democratic institutions in Norway.
   This paper is related to a number of literatures. First, there is by now a large number of papers
in labor economics evaluating the effects of various schooling reforms, ranging from compulsory
schooling and child labor laws to school building programs (e.g., Acemoglu and Angrist, 2000,
Duflo, 2001, Black et al., 2005, Meghir and Palme, 2005, Oreopoulos, 2006, Pekkarinen et al., 2009;
see Oreopoulos and Salvanes, 2011, for a review). To the best of our knowledge, none of these
works investigate the political implications of these reforms.
   Second and more directly, we contribute to the literature on the origins of social democracy
in Scandinavia and Europe. Classic works in this area, such as Korpi (1983), Esping-Andersen
(1990), Baldwin (1990) and Rothstein (1998), emphasize the role of labor unions and workers,
though the central contribution of the coalition with agrarian interests has also received attention
(e.g., Gourevitch 1986; Berman 2006). These emphases are different from but complementary to
ours, since many of these authors also recognize the importance of the public services provided
by the Social Democratic parties.
   Third, our paper relates to the literature on successful political reforms. In the context of demo-
cratic reforms, Acemoglu and Robinson (2006, 2012) emphasize the role of collective action by
politically excluded groups to force a transition away from non-democratic regimes, but also the
importance of fiscal redistribution, limited inequality and broad coalitions in order to ensure the
consolidation of new democratic regimes. Fearon (2011) and Bidner and François (2013) explore
the role of political accountability, bolstered by electoral institutions and collective action by cit-
izens. Brender and Drazen (2007) explore the role of fiscal policies to reduce the fragility of new
democracies. Giavazzi and Tabellini (2005) empirically investigate whether economic or politi-
cal reforms come first in cross-country data. There is less systematic work on major institutional
reforms within democratic political systems. Fernandez and Rodrik (1991) and Strulovici (2010)
propose theoretical arguments for why economic reforms in democratic societies will be delayed
or blocked, and the literature on special interest politics, e.g., Grossman and Helpman (2001), also
offers various reasons for inefficient reforms. We are not aware of theoretical or empirical work in
economics or political science that investigates the impact of major school reforms on the political
equilibrium. Consistent with this result, recent work by Acemoglu et al. (2021) finds that cohorts
that have lived longer under democracy, especially when a democracy is economically successful
and delivers public goods, tend to support democratic institutions and oppose non-democratic
rule.
   Fourth, many scholars have argued that education may increase support for democracy or
certain types of institutions (e.g., Verba and Almond 1963; Lipset 1959). More recently, Glaeser
et al. (2007) claim to find support for this hypothesis, though more systematic analysis in Ace-
moglu et al. (2005, 2008) show no impact of education or income on democracy, and points out


                                                  4
the problems in their empirical study. Milligan et al. (2004) show that educated individuals are
more likely to vote, but as pointed out in Friedman et al. (2016), this does not necessarily mean
more pro-democracy behavior in general. These authors show that disadvantaged Kenyans who
received more education because of schooling reform may have actually increased their support
for political violence. Our work is very different from this literature, however, since we are not
claiming that education effects support for democracy or social democracy, but that education re-
forms, which were the main electoral promise of the Labour Party before their 1936 victory, made
Norwegians more trusting and supportive of this party and their social democratic agenda.
      The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we provide the institutional
background for Norway in the 1930s, outline the state of education and describe the Norwegian
Labour Party's policy platform and the schooling reform it implemented upon assuming power in
1935. Section 3 describes our data sources, while Section 4 outlines our empirical approach. Our
main results are presented in Section 5. Section 6 explores the mechanisms behind the growth in
the support for Labour Party in areas and among cohorts benefiting from the schooling reform.
Section 7 concludes, while the Appendix contains additional empirical results.


2     Norway's Labour Movement and Educational Policy
The roots of the Scandinavian welfare state models can be traced back to the policies of centre-
left governments that rose to power in between the world wars.4 Several liberal governments
introduced major labor laws, covering workers in the developing manufacturing sector from 1900
until the end of the First World War. However, these laws did not enact universal policies, which
became to be a defining characteristic of the Nordic welfare states (Bull 1959; Bjørnson 2001).
      Social democrats formed durable governments during the 1930s, typically in coalition with
parties representing rural voters. The policies of these governments laid the foundations of the
welfare institutions that the same political forces continued to build after the WWII. These poli-
cies included establishment of old age and disability pension, sickness leave, and unemployment
insurance as well as large public investments in health and education. Norway followed this trend
in 1935 when the Norwegian Labour Party formed a government with the support of the Agrarian
Party.


2.1     Norway in the 1930s

Unlike what is sometimes claimed, the Nordic welfare states are not rooted in some underlying
structural equality and consensus that predates the modern welfare state institutions. Quite the
contrary, before the 1930s Norway, like all the Nordic countries, was a highly unequal country with
    4 The
        Finnish welfare state, though ultimately ending up similar to the Scandinavian model, followed a different
path owing to the disruptive effects of the 1918 civil war; see Meriläinen et al. (2020).


                                                        5
high levels of industrial conflict (Moene and Wallerstein 2006). In 1930, the Gini index in Norway
was higher than the current Anglo-Saxon levels at 0.57 and the top 10 % share of the national
income was similar to the contemporaneous level in the United States at 0.44 (Aaberge et al. 2020).
The regional inequalities were also striking, especially along rural-urban axis. According to Falk
and Tovmo (2000), the gap in income per capita between the poorest municipality and the richest
city was 1 to 18 in 1930.
      Although rapid structural change had already started by this point, almost 30% of the labor
force still worked in agriculture, and 45% of the population lived in urban areas. The Norwegian
economy had been severely impacted by the postwar recession in Europe in the early 1920s, and
did not reach sustained recovery before it was hit again by the Great Depression in 1930. Due to the
combination of deflationary policies and external shocks, the GDP per capita grew only by 2.3%
between 1919 and 1930 whereas the rest of the Scandinavian countries experienced solid growth,
ranging from 23.5% in Sweden to 28.3% in Denmark during the same period. The poor growth
performance was reflected in high unemployment rate which never dropped below 9­10% during
the 1920s and reached 33% in 1933. Norwegian labor markets were also affected by high levels of
industrial conflict. According to Moene and Wallerstein (2006), the number of working days lost
due to strikes and lockouts in 1931 alone was three times larger than than the total amount of days
lost during the 25-year period between 1945 and 1970.


2.2     The Norwegian Labour Party

The development of the Norwegian labor movement followed the same broad pattern as simi-
lar parties in Northern Europe, and in particular in other Scandinavian countries, although there
are also some distinct characteristics (Bull 1959; Esping-Andersen 1985; Sejersted 2011). The Nor-
wegian Labour Party was founded in 1887 and entered the parliament in 1904. Its early history
was characterized by internal conflicts between the revolutionary and reformist factions. Until
the 1930s, the party programs had a clear Marxist tone and an ambivalent attitude towards parlia-
mentary democracy. Unlike the other Scandinavian Labour parties, Norwegian Labour Party was
also a member of the Soviet led Comintern until the early 1920s.5
      Following the poor performance in the 1930 election, the Norwegian Labour Party changed its
strategy and adopted a reformist agenda following the example of its sister parties in Denmark,
Germany, and Sweden (Bull 1959; Esping-Andersen 1985). This shift was also motivated by the
purges in the Soviet Union, the economic crisis which had severely affected the workers in in-
dustrial, logging and fishing industries, and the threat of fascism which was gaining support in
   5 Thereasons for the radicalization of the Social Democracy in Norway--contrasting with the experiences in Den-
mark and Sweden--are not well understood. One hypothesis is that it is rooted in the age composition of the industrial
workforce in Norway, where the relatively late industrialization, taking off only between 1905 and 1910, meant that
workers were much younger and perhaps more willing to support radical politics (Dahl 1971).

Norway (led by the now infamous Vidkun Quisling).
      The new strategy was built on three pillars. First, together with the main trade union, the
Labour Party established a more cooperative approach towards the employer organizations and
managed to compel the employer organizations to recognize the National Confederation of Work-
ers (LO) as a negotiating partner.6 The party also shifted its economic policy by adopting a Keyne-
sian program of stabilization policy following an influential pamphlet "a 3-year plan for Norway"
(En norsk 3-års plan) by Ole Colbjørnsen and Axel Sømme. Second, the Labour Party moved from
its earlier focus on industrial workers to a message of unity between rural and urban areas as well
as owners of small business and part of the educated middle-class such as teachers and public sec-
tor workers (see Appendix Figure A1 for an illustration of this change between the 1930 and 1933
election campaigns). Third, the party made a clear break with revolutionary Marxist ideology and
fully committed to advance its reformist agenda through parliamentary democracy and alliances
with other parties.
      These changes made the Norwegian Labour Party more appealing to moderate voters and
more acceptable as a coalition partner for centerist parties. In the 1933 election, the party increased
its vote share from 31% to 40%, the highest share it had ever gained. Although the electioral succes
did not immediately lead to the formation of a Labour government, the minority government led
by the Liberal Party collapsed in 1935, when the Agrarian Party withdrew its support and agreed
to support the Labour minority government with Johan Nygaarsdvold as its prime minister.
      The 1935 Labour government started a long period of social democratic rule. As show in Fig-
ure 1, the Labour Party held power for most of the following 45 years apart from the German
occupation in 1940­1945 (when the Labour government was in exile in London) and short periods
of center-right governments in the 1960s and 1970s. During this long period, the Labour Party
implemented an ambitious program for developing the welfare state that included the introduc-
tion of universal national social security, health care system, and, later, day care and family leave
polices.


2.3     Primary education in Norway before 1935

The Norwegian legislation on primary schools dates back to the 18th century. The first Law of
Primary education for the Kingdom of Denmark-Norway was introduced in 1739. Education was
the responsibility of the church until 1840s, when regional federalism was introduced and the
responsibility of organizing primary education was delegated to municipalities. In 1861, the focus
of primary schooling was changed from preparing children for confirmation at the age of 15 to
  6 This agreement was made just before the formation of the Labour government in 1935. It resembled the Saltsjøbad
agreement of 1938 in Sweden and the agreements established already around the turn of the century in Denmark.
The new national rules for wage negotiations were also signed by the National Confederation of Employers (NAF)
and the National Confederation Workers. After WWII, the government also started to take an active part in the wage
negotiations as a third party.

Note: This figure reports the vote shares of the Norwegian Labour Party in parliamentary elections and the share of
seats the party held in the parliament. The gray areas present the periods, when the Labour party was in government,
and the red area the period that the Labour government spent in exile in London following the Nazi occupation. The
change in the link between vote and seat shares in 1921 is due to a move to a proportional representation. The drop in
the vote share in 1921­1924 is due to the temporary split of the party into the Social Democratic Party of Norway and
Norwegian Labour Party, see Cox et al. (2019) for details.


preparing children in general including algebra in addition to reading and writing.
    Because the demand for primary education was understood to be lower in the rural areas
and in fishing communities--sectors that were also exempt from the child labor laws--the law
on primary schools stipulated shorter school years for rural than for urban areas, in particular,
with lower minimum and maximum number of school weeks in rural parts. Even though the
school weeks included slightly more hours in rural areas, the restrictions on the number of weeks
implied that rural primary school students received substantially less instruction time than their
urban counterparts. As shown in Figure 2, the requirement in 1928 was that rural schools had
to provide just 3,096 hours of education over seven years of mandatory education, whereas the
corresponding figure was 4,912 hours in urban areas. In addition, the content of education varied
widely across municipalities as the law on primary schools did not establish guidelines about the
number of hours allocated to different subjects.
    The differences in instruction time between rural and urban areas were considered a problem
from early on. The law was revised in 1915, when the minimum number of weeks of instruction
time in the last four primary school grades was increased to 14 weeks.7 However, the differences

and 40%, respectively

in the standards and the quantity of primary school education were exacerbated during the eco-
nomic crises in the 1920s. As education was mostly locally funded, variation in the local economic
conditions meant that the municipal authorities' ability to invest in primary education began to
diverge. In 1935, urban areas provided 211 days of primary education, on average, while the
average in rural areas was only 89.


2.4                   Education policy in the Labour Party programs

Although often overlooked in the historical work on the Nordic labor movement, education pol-
icy was regarded as a key component in the political model for social change by the early social
democrats. The aim of the movement was to achieve greater social equality, for which education
was going to be a critical tool as it would alter the distribution of opportunities (Rothstein 1998).
The initial conditions for individuals would be made more equal with the help of state interven-
tion in education or, as formulated by Lewin (1967): "the coercive power of the state". The primacy
of educational policy was reflected in the fact that, in the Swedish case, many of the leading social
democratic politicians and strategists, such as Tage Erlander, Olof Palme, and Alva Myrdal, were
deeply involved in the planning and implementation of education policy from early on. Indeed,
Myrdal saw the education policy as "the primary strategic instrument for abolishing class barriers"
(Rothstein 1998).
                 The importance of the education reform is very clear in the party programs of the Norwegian


                                                                 9
Labour Party. Already the very first program from 1885 called for "free and general education in
state schools". These demands became more specific over time and clear emphasis was put on
equal opportunities for children in different parts of Norway. Already in 1903, the party called
for general primary school "for all children in the society", for "increase in the minimum hours of
instruction", and that "the country side primary schools should be brought to the same level as
the town primary schools". By 1930s, the urgency of the education reform was so clear that the
1936 program listed it as the third objective after democratic rights and equal justice. According
to the program "primary schools should be turned into a general comprehensive school that pre-
pares children for further education." The party called for the central government to take over the
financing of the schools and repeated the demand for the equal quality of primary schools and
increased instruction time across the country.


2.5    The 1936 Folk School Law for Rural Areas

The Norwegian Labour Party's conviction that the country's education system was unequal and
ill-suited for the demands of a rapidly changing economy shaped its reform priorities. To address
the foundational problem of lack of equal access to primary education of sufficiently high quality,
the new Labour government passed the new law on primary schools in rural areas as one of its
first major pieces of legislation in 1936. This reform was the first step in a program that aimed at
establishing a general comprehensive primary school which would prepare children for further
education (Rust 1989).8
      The new law on primary schools increased the minimum instruction time in rural areas to 16
weeks for the first three years of primary education and 18 weeks for the the subsequent four
years. In addition to these changes, the law decreased the maximum class size from 35 to 30. The
funding from the central government was increased to cover a larger share of the base salaries
of teachers and provided funding to pay teachers age and region related bonuses.9 The state
also took over other responsibilities that were previously carried out by the municipalities, such
a school buildings, books and inventories, as well as housing for the teachers. Furthermore, a
new national curriculum was introduced ("Normalplanen for Folkeskolen" from 1939) with a focus
on skills rather than religious education and a ban on physical punishment. The new curriculum
reduced the regional variation in the content of education (Rust 1989).10
      The reform was a compromise, and the Labour Party decided not to advance some of its long-
term goals like removing religious education from schools. Nevertheless, the goals of the 1936
reform were ambitious, considering the state of primary schools in rural municipalities in the
  8 Establishing  a comprehensive school had been suggested by several "school commissions" from early-1900s on-
wards, but never gained enough support in the Parliament. Even as late as in 1934 extensions of increased hours in
rural schools was voted down with support from conservatives as well as the agrarian party.
   9 The law increased the share of central government funding from 45% of minimum teacher salary to 50%.
  10 See also Chapter 5 of "Lov om folkeskolen på landet", 1936.

mid-1930s. Only 4% of the rural municipalities were providing more than 16 weeks of instruction
in lower classes of primary schools in 1935. The percentage of municipalities fulfilling the criteria
of the new law in higher grades was similarly small at 4%, and a mere 2% of the municipalities
met the new requirements in all primary school grades. Thus, the new legislation forced a vast
majority of rural municipalities to increase instruction time. The requirement on the maximum
class size was also binding for most municipalities, with only 40% of municipalities meeting the
requirements of the old law that there should be a maximum of 35 students per teacher. Just 22%
had classes smaller than the new requirement of 30 students per teacher.
      The law was passed swiftly and and came into force from the school year starting in August
1936. Municipalities were allowed to use five years to implement it fully. Hence, children born
in 1935, and consequently starting school in August 1942, are the first cohort for whom the new
regime was fully implemented.


3     Data
We created our main data set by linking together newly digitalized archival data on the roll out of
the 1936 primary school reform, individual-level population-wide information on human capital
and income, and municipality-level data on election results and pre-reform characteristics. In
order to explore mechanisms, we also use survey data from 1957 on political preferences and data
on candidate characteristics in national elections from Fiva and Smith (2017). We next describe
each of these data sources in more detail.


3.1    Schools

We create our treatment variable, discussed in detail in the next section, using municipality-level
information on the provision of primary education, which we collected from Norwegian archives
and digitized. These data originate from county-level primary school directors, who were obliged
to send a report every year to Statistics Norway. The information content of the data varies by
year, but we can form a time-series for each municipality on the average weeks of school by grade
from the 1920s onwards. For some years, we also observe the within-municipality distribution
of children by weeks of education, the extent to which several grades were taught in the same
class, the gender composition, education and compensation of the teachers, and the type of school
buildings available.11

3.2     Human capital and income

We link the municipality-level measures of primary education to individual-level data using infor-
mation on individuals' municipality of birth. Our individual-level data contain population-wide
information about educational attainment, earnings, demographics, and family links. In addition,
we observe information from military records for a subsample of men.
      We conduct separate analyses for two groups. The "first-generation" consists of individuals
born in rural Norwegian municipalities in 1917­1940. Second, we define the "second-generation"
as the children of the first-generation (regardless of their own place of birth), and restrict the
analysis to those born in 1947­1976. We do not impose any further sample restrictions, although
some individuals with missing information naturally drop out of our sample.
      We use completed years of education as our primary measure for human capital. This infor-
mation is drawn from the 1960 and 1970 population censuses and Statistics Norway's educational
database and is thus available for the full population. For men serving the mandatory military ser-
vice after 1969, we also observe IQ scores. Roughly 95% of Norwegian men in the relevant birth
cohorts took arithmetics, vocabulary, and Raven Progressive Matrix tests at the age of 18­20 at the
draft board meeting for mandatory military service (see Sundet et al. 2004, for details). We use the
composite score of these three tests as our second human capital measure. In addition, we observe
annual income form 1969 onwards as recorded in the pension register. This income measure in-
cludes labor earnings, taxable sick benefits, unemployment benefits, parental leave payments and
pensions. We construct proxies for lifetime income using average income over ages 50­64 for the
first-generation and average income over ages 30­34 for the second-generation.
      Table 1 presents sample averages by treatment intensity (as defined in the next section) for our
main estimation sample. On average, the first generation men have 9.0 and women 8.4 years of
education and almost half of them did not continue their education after leaving primary school.
Men's average annual income at ages 50­64 is 180,000 Norwegian kronas (in 1998 prices) cor-
responding to about $21,000 (in 2020 prices). For women, the corresponding figures are 80,000
kronas or $9,000. There is a clear, although relatively mild, gradient by treatment intensity with
those born in poorer (and thus more intensely treated) municipalities having somewhat less edu-
cation and lower income than those born in municipalities less affected by the reform. As shown
in the lower panel, the second-generation has more education and higher incomes than the first-
generation, and part of the differences along the treatment intensity distribution are still present.

munist Party, (iii) the Agrarian party, (iv) the Liberal Party, (v) the Conservative Party, and (vi)
others.12
      In some of our specifications, we control for income per capita in the municipality (collected
from the tax records) and the share of the workforce in agriculture as recorded in the 1910 and
1930 Censuses. These data are drawn from the Municipality Data Base of the Norwegian Center
for Research Data as well.


3.4     Survey data

We use individual-level data from a 1957 covering the Parliament election--the first election poll
conducted Norway (Rokkan et al. 1958). These surveys collect information on individual charac-
teristics (age, gender, geographic location, family structure, educational), voting and a number of
attitudinal questions. The survey also included questions on the respondents' children and thus
we can identify individuals whose children were likely affected by the 1936 Folk School reform.
  12 The "others" category includes fringe parties in the Norwegian context, such as Christian Democrats, National

Socialists, and from the 1970s onwards a left-wing Maoist Party.

4     Empirical Approach
We follow an identification strategy similar to those used in Card (1992) and Acemoglu and John-
son (2007). This approach builds on the notion that the reform mattered more for municipalities
that were further away from the new (national) standards and for the birth cohorts that spent a
larger share of their primary education under the new regime. We next discuss how we measure
this treatment intensity and how we use it to estimate the impacts of the reform.


4.1     Treatment measures

Our identifying variation arises from two sources. First, the reform's impact varied across mu-
nicipalities because of cross-municipality differences in primary education provision before the
reform. In particular, the reform had greater "bite" in municipalities that were far away from the
post-reform requirements. In contrast, it had little impact on municipalities that already met or
exceeded the new requirements. We measure this distance to the post-reform minimum require-
ments using information on instruction time just before the reform was passed. Specifically, we
observe the share of children by instruction time brackets separately for grades 1­3 and 4­7 for
each municipality in 1935 and summarize this information with a municipality-level index:

                                  3 b sbj max (16 - b, 0) + 4 b Sbj max (18 - b, 0)
                           Zj =                                                     ,                               (1)
                                                          28

where sbj are the shares of children in grades 1­3 who received b weeks of education in munic-
ipality j in 1935, and Sbj are similar shares for grades 4­7. The nominator captures the average
additional weeks of instruction a municipality would have to offer in order to meet the new re-
quirements.13 The denominator is a scaling factor corresponding to the cumulative change in
minimum requirements induced by the reform (28 weeks over seven years of education). Thus,
Zj takes the value of one for a municipality at the pre-reform minimum in 1935 and zero for a
municipality that already exceeded the new requirements before the reform.
      The second source of identifying variation occurs between birth cohorts within a municipality.
Those born before 1923 had left primary education by the beginning of the implementation period
in 1936 and thus were not exposed to the reform. On the other hand, everyone born after 1935
started school after the implementation period and went through their entire primary education
under the new requirements. Among the 1923­1935 birth cohorts, the treatment intensity depends
on the year of birth, the year the municipality implemented the reform, the "bite" the reform (Zj ),
  13 For example, think of a municipality, where half of the children in grades 1­3 got 12 weeks of education and the

other half got 14 weeks of education in 1935. Let's further assume that all 4­7th graders received 18 weeks of education
in 1935 in this municipality. Recall that the reform mandated that instruction time needed to be at least 16 weeks per
year for grades 1­3 and to 18 weeks per year for grades 4­7. Thus the reform induced 3 × [0.5 × (16 - 12) + 0.5 × (16 -
14)] = 9 weeks of additional education for an average child living in this municipality.

and the extent to which the municipality complied with the new requirements.14
    We combine these sources of variation as a municipality­birth cohort level measure

                                                    Zjc =                         c Zj                                                         (2)

where c is the share of years birth cohort c studied under the new requirements. We do not
know when each municipality implemented the reform. Thus, as a baseline, we assume that all
municipalities fully implemented the reform in 1938, and set c = 0 for everyone born in or before
1924, c = 1 for everyone born in or after 1931, and c = (c - 1924)/7 for those born between
1925 and 1930. We show that the results are robust to assuming other implementation years.
    Having defined the treatment intensity measures, we next examine their geographical distri-
bution and association with pre-reform municipality characteristics. Panel (a) of Figure 3 shows
that municipalities in the northern (less economically developed) parts of Norway tended to be
  14 For example, consider a municipality that followed the pre-reform minimum requirements before the reform and

fully implemented the new requirements in 1938. In this case, children born in 1925 had started first grade at the age
of 7 in 1932 and attended only their final (seventh) grade under the new requirements in 1938. Those born in 1926
attended school for two years after the reform, those born in 1927 for three years and so forth. Finally, everyone born
in or after 1931 received the full treatment.


                                                                                 15
further away from the post-reform minimums, and hence more affected by the reform, than those
located further to the south. However, there is also variation across the whole of Norway and
sometimes large differences between neighboring municipalities. Nevertheless, as the reform was
designed to improve education in more deprived areas, treatment intensity is naturally associated
with pre-reform municipality characteristics. Panel (b) of Figure 3 illustrates these differences by
plotting municipalities' average income and share of labor force working in agriculture and fish-
ing in 1930 by deciles of Zj . It shows that municipalities that were providing the minimum (or
less) pre-reform instruction time in 1935 (Zj  1) were substantially poorer and had a much larger
share of the labor force working in the primary sector. These differences motivate the differences-
in-differences approaches we next discuss.


4.2     Specifications

We start our analysis by asking how the reform affected human capital and income of the directly
affected individuals and estimate event-study regressions of the form:

                                      yicj = Zj  c + X j0 c + µc + µ j +    icj                                  (3)

where yicj is the outcome of interest for individual i born in year c in municipality j.15 On the
right-hand-side, Zj is the pre-reform distance from the new requirements (see equation (1)), X j0 is
a vector of municipality characteristics measured before the reform, µc is a vector of year of birth
fixed effects, and µ j is a vector of municipality of birth fixed effects.16 The parameters of interest
are  c , which measure the extent to which the outcome grows differentially between birth cohort
c and birth cohort 1923­24 (the omitted category) across municipalities that were differentially
affected by the reform.
      We report estimates from several specifications that differ in terms of what is included in the
vector X j0 . The specifications are motivated by the correlation between treatment intensity and
pre-reform geographical location, income and industrial structure discussed above. While the
municipality fixed effects capture all time-invariant differences between municipalities, it is con-
ceivable that poorer or less industrialized municipalities would have evolved differently than the
more prosperous ones even in the absence of the reform. Hence, we examine alternative specifi-
cations allowing for differential trends by geographical location, average income and industrial
structure.
      The advantage of the event-study specification is that it allows us to examine whether the
timing of the possible changes is consistent with the timing of the reform. It also provides a
  15 We do not include a subscript for calendar year here because our individual-level measures consist of education,

income and cognitive ability test scores, all recorded at a fixed age.
  16 Note that using municipality of birth and not municipality of residence helps reducing a potential bias due to

mobility across municipalities.


                                                         16
falsification exercise for the parallel pre-trends assumption required for a causal interpretation of
 c . However, this flexibility comes with the cost of a large number of parameters. In order to
efficiently summarize the results from the event-studies, we also estimate a more parsimonious
version where we estimate a single parameter specifying the effect of all post-reform years:


                                yicj =  Zjc + X j0 c + µc + µ j +      icj ,                       (4)

where Zjc is the municipality­birth cohort level measure of treatment intensity (see equation (2))
and other variable are as in the previous specification.
   We analyze the impacts on electoral outcomes using a similar approach. However, here, we
cannot utilize variation across birth cohorts, because electoral outcomes are available only at the
municipality­year level. Thus, we start with event-study specifications of the form:

                                 y ptj = Zj  t + X j0 t + µt + µ j +   ptj                         (5)

where y ptj is the vote share of party p in year t at municipality j, and Zj and X j0 are the same
treatment intensity measure and pre-reform observable characteristics as above. The parameters
of interest,  t , now measure the extent to which the vote share of a party increased faster between
the 1933 elections and elections in year t in municipalities more affected by the reform.
   In order to increase statistical power and to summarize the estimates into a single number, we
also report estimates from a standard differences-in-differences specification:

                         y ptj = (1[t  1945] × Zj ) + X j0 t + µt + µ j +      ptj                 (6)

where 1[t  1945] is an indicator variable taking the value one for post-war years and zero for
pre-war years, while other variables are as above.
   We interpret all our estimates as the intention-to-treat effect of the reform. We note that our
measure of treatment intensity Zj is constructed using data on instruction time. An alternative
approach would be to define the treatment as instruction time and use Zcj as and instrumental
variable for it. We do not use this strategy because we believe the exclusion restriction necessary
for such an IV approach is not valid. This exclusion restriction would require that the effects of the
reform worked entirely via changes in instruction time, whereas, as is common with other educa-
tion reforms, the Norwegian reform affected several dimensions of educational inputs at the same
time (see Section 2.5). Appendix Figure A2 illustrates this point by plotting average instruction
time and student-teacher ratio as functions of treatment intensity in years 1930, 1935, 1938 and
1940-1944. It shows that the pre-reform values of all inputs were highly correlated with our treat-
ment intensity variable, but this correlation clearly declines after the reform was implemented in
1938, implying that the main dimensions of the reform were correlated with each other.

5      Results
This section presents our main results. We start by examining the impact of the reform on human
capital and long-term income of the individuals who were directly affected by it. This analysis is
motivated by the 1936 reform's primary objective of harmonizing the standards of primary edu-
cation across municipalities. Hence, if the reform was successful in increasing resources allocated
to primary education in the municipalities most affected by it, we would expect an increase in
years of education and in earnings. We find that this is, indeed, the case. We then show that
the reform may have had an intergenerational effect also on human capital and earnings on the
children of those directly affected, although these estimates are much less precise in some spec-
ifications. Finally, we present our core results showing that the reform increased the vote share
of the Norwegian Labour Party in municipalities that were more affected by the reform. These
effects are present both in the short and in the long run and indicate that the reform played an
important role in closing the rural-urban gap in the support for the Norwegian Labour Party. We
return to the potential mechanisms behind these effects in the next section.


5.1         Direct impact on human capital and income

Figure 4 reports the baseline event-study estimates for the effect of the reform on years of educa-
tion. Importantly, the reform did not change mandatory years of education and hence it affected
years of education only through the likelihood of continuing in post-primary education. We find
no indication of pre-trends. Specifically, there is no association between changes in years of educa-
tion and treatment intensity among the birth cohorts that left primary education before the reform
was implemented. In line with the aims of the reform, men's years of education start to increase
faster in municipalities that were more affected precisely at the time the reform was launched.
Reassuringly, the impact is smallest for the cohorts that already had completed most of their pri-
mary education and largest for the birth cohorts whose entire primary education took place after
the reform. Furthermore, the estimates level off at around the birth cohorts who were the first to
be fully exposed to the reform and thus went through similar primary education as the later birth
cohorts.
      In short, the pattern presented in Figure 4 suggests that increasing the length of the school
year and allocating more resources to primary education had a positive effect on post-mandatory
education among men. The estimates for women are qualitatively similar, but smaller and less
consistently significant at conventional levels.
      Table 2, first row, summarizes the effects on education using our second specification (equa-
tion 4). The baseline estimates suggest that full exposure to the reform increased post-mandatory
education of men by 0.47 years corresponding to a 5% increase from the baseline of 9.0 years.17
    17 By   full exposure we mean Zjc = 1, i.e., being born after 1931 in a municipality that provided only the pre-reform

For women, the point estimate suggest a 0.16 years or a 2% increase from the baseline of 8.2 years.
Columns (2) and (6) report results from specifications that allow differential linear trends for each
of Norway's 20 regions and hence control for overall regional convergence that may have been
correlated with the reform. The estimates are now 0.26 years for men and 0.09 for women and
remain statistically significant. In the rest of the table, we allow for differential linear trends by
1930 average taxable income, changes in average taxable income between 1915 and 1930, and the
industrial structure of the municipality 1930 (see the table note for details). Appendix Figure A3
presents the corresponding event-study estimates using the same control variables. The most de-
manding specification allowing for differential trends by region, income and industry suggest that
full exposure to the reform increased the post-mandatory education of men by 0.33 years (p-value
<0.001) and that of women by 0.084 years (p-value 0.084).
    The remaining of Table 2 repeats the analysis using average log income at ages 50­64 as an
outcome variable. The estimates are statistically and economically significant, but sensitive to
controlling for differential trends by region or 1930 municipality characteristics. This sensitivity
suggests that average incomes in areas more affected by the reform converged towards incomes
of other regions not just due to the effects of the reform on education. Most likely, there would
have been some amount of convergence even without the reform, and as a result, we also see a
small pre-trend among men in the baseline specification (Appendix Figure A4). Thus, the baseline
estimates for men's income are likely to be biased upwards. However, the estimates are relatively
stable in specifications allowing for differential trends by region and either income or industrial
structure (or both). These most demanding specification suggests that a full exposure to the reform
increased long-term income of men by 3.9 log points (p-value 0.053) and that of women by 6.7 log
points (p-value 0.013). Thus, we conclude that the reform's impact was likely to increase long-term
income, although this evidence is somewhat less conclusive than in the case of years of education.
The results for women also suggest that improved primary education was valuable in the labor
market even when it did not increase the likelihood of further education.


5.2     Intergenerational effects

In line with the Norwegian Labour Party's objective of improving overall social mobility, we find
evidence that the schooling reform also increased the educational attainment of the children of
cohorts directly impacted by the reform.
      Figure 5 presents event-study estimates for the second-generation. Specifically, we estimate
equation (3) using data on the outcomes of children whose fathers were directly affected by the
reform. The right-hand-side variables still refer to the municipality and birth cohort of person's
father. As with our first-generation results, we use years of education as the primary measure
minimum weeks of education in 1935 (see equation 4).

of human capital. For second-generation men, we additionally have cognitive test (IQ) scores
taken as part of the mandatory military service. The results using this IQ index present a similar,
although noisier, pattern, indicating a positive effect on the second-generation.
     The results show that, reassuringly, human capital of the children whose fathers are too old
to have been directly affected by the reform evolve similarly across municipalities. In contrast,
for birth cohorts whose fathers were affected by the reform, we see a gradual increase in human
capital. This effect levels off around the first birth cohorts fully exposed to the reform, which is the
pattern we should expect given that the impact of the reform is uniform from this cohort onwards.
The results for men and women are very similar for the second-generation, and if anything, a bit
stronger for women. The results on IQ for the second-generation men also corroborate this picture.
     Table 3 reports the corresponding differences-in-differences estimates. The baseline estimates
suggest that pushing father's municipality of birth from the pre- to the post-reform minimum re-
quirements increased their sons' years of education by about 0.21 years corresponding to a 2%
increase from the baseline of 12.3. Similar to the first-generation results, conditioning for linear
trends by father's birth municipality's region, pre-reform income or pre-reform industrial struc-
ture somewhat reduces point estimates, which now vary between 0.07­0.15 years and mostly lose
statistical significance. Interestingly, the results for IQ test scores are less sensitive to specification.

The point estimates vary between 0.06­0.11 standard deviations and all estimates are significant
at the 10% level.
    In contrast to the education and IQ results, we do not have precise results for income. In this
case, income is measured for individuals when they are between 30 and 34, which may not give
us enough power to distinguish between differential experience effects and income implications
of greater education. In any case, the results are not statistically distinguishable from zero (our
findings are very similar when we use treatment intensity at mother's birth year and municipality
to measure treatment intensity; see Appendix Table A1).
    Interestingly, in contrast to the first-generation results, the effects are stronger for women than
for men. While the estimates for the years of education of daughters is similar to those for sons,
the estimates for their log income are large and statistically significant. The point estimates vary
between 4.1 and 7.2 log points and only become larger when we allow for differential trends.
    Overall, we interpret these findings showing that the 1936 school reform, consistent with the
Labour Party's objectives, impacted social mobility and educational opportunities more broadly
within Norwegian society, and we can detect effects on second-generation Norwegians from the
impacted municipalities. Nevertheless, the results are not precise enough to identify income ef-
fects for men on these cohorts.

observable characteristics that vary across specifications (all background characteristics are entered in the form of quin-
tile dummies and are interacted with year fixed effects). The estimates measure the extent to which the vote share of a
party increased faster between the 1933 elections and elections in year t in municipalities more affected by the reform.
Appendix Figure A5 reports similar estimates for the other major parties.


5.3     Elections

Our results so far suggest that the reform created important economic benefits. We now turn to
our main focus, the reform's political effects. We focus on the Norwegian Labour Party's success
in national (parliamentary) elections during the period when the Norwegian welfare state was
buildt and consolidated. We also discuss how the reform affected the electoral success of other
political parties.
      Figure 6 present our event-study estimates for Labour Party's vote share in the national elec-
tions. We use 1933 as the reference category and report estimates without control variables and
those allowing for differential trends by larger regions, pre-reform income quintiles, and pre-
reform industrial structure of the municipality. We do not find any clear pre-reform trends. In
contrast, though in line with our expectations, the vote share of the Norwegian Labour Party in-
creased substantially faster between 1933 and 1945 in municipalities that were more affected by
the reform. Depending on the specification, the point estimates suggest that the Labour Party's
vote share increased between 5.5 and 10.5 percentage points more in municipalities that were at
the pre-reform minimum in comparison to municipalities that met the post-reform requirements
already in 1935. These estimates imply a large relative effect given that the Labour Party's base-
line vote share in municipalities most affected by the reform (defined as Zj  1) was 37 percent

in 1933. While the estimates are slightly smaller for later elections, all specifications yield large,
positive, and statistically significant estimates for every election until 1965.
    The first row of Table 4 summarizes the effects for Labour Party's vote share using standard
differences-in-differences regressions (equation (6)). The point estimates for the Labour Party vary
between 4.4 and 7.0 percentage points in municipalities that were fully exposed to the reform.
These gains appear to arise primarily from losses of the Liberal Party. The estimates also suggest
that Labour gained votes from the Conservatives and Communists, even if these effects are not as
robustly significant as those for the Liberal Party. We do not find any consistent pattern for the
Agrarian Party.
    In order to put these results into a context, we ask what they imply for the overall vote share
of the Labour party in the rural areas. A simple back-of-an-envelope calculation suggests that the
Labour Party's rural vote share grew by 1.4­4.6 percentage points between 1933 and 1945 due to
the reform.18 For comparison, Figure 7 shows that the support for the Labour Party increased
and caught up with the vote share in urban areas precisely after the school reform was enacted.
 18 We conduct this calculation by multiplying the event-study estimates for 1945 with the "bite" of the reform for

municipality's, Zj , and then calculate population weighted averages of the implied effect over all rural municipalities.

Note: This figure reports the vote shares of the Norwegian Labour Party in parliamentary elections separately for rural
and urban areas. For rural areas, we also report vote shares separately for municipalities that had below and above
median (Zj = 0.38) treatment intensities.


Specifically, between 1933 and 1945, the party gained 3.9 percentage points in rural areas, while
it lost 3.8 percentage points of its support in the cities. As a consequence, the traditionally higher
support the Labour Party enjoyed in cities disappeared and the party has hence been equally
popular in rural and urban areas. Within rural areas, this increase in support for the Labour Party
entirely came from municipalities that were more affected by the reform.
     Overall, our results indicate that the major educational reform, promised and swiftly imple-
mented in 1936 by the Norwegian Labour Party, had a significant impact on the political landscape
of the country, raising the support for the party in the rural municipalities where it had a greater
impact.


6        Mechanisms
In this section, we discuss potential mechanisms for the political effects of the 1936 education
reform. We first reject two possible channels: (i) education directly increasing support for the
Norwegian Labour Party, and (ii) the reform affecting voter turnout or the supply of local candi-
dates. We then present two pieces of evidence supporting the interpretation that the reform led
voters to adjust their perceptions about the Labour Party. Specifically, we show that the impact
on Labour Party vote share is substantially larger in municipalities that had no previous experi-
ence on their rule at local level. Furthermore, we find that rural residents who attended primary
schools after the reform harmonized resources and the length of the school year in rural areas--as

well as their parents--were more likely to report voting Labour and to agree that the party had
effectively implemented its program in the 1957 electoral survey.


6.1              Education and political preferences

We start with the hypothesis that the improved education induced by the reform directly increased
support for the Norwegian Labour Party (for example, because the more educated are more likely
to support social democratic parties). Our results do not find any support for this hypothesis.
First, it is inconsistent with the fact that the largest effects on the Labour Party vote takes place
in 1945, when the oldest cohort affected by the reform was only 22 years old, meaning that the
majority of the electorate had not been directly affected by the reform.
          Second and more directly, educational attainment and support for the Norwegian Labour
Party were negatively correlated during the period we examine. Panel (a) of Figure 8 shows this
association in 1957 when Norway's first post-electoral surveys was conducted. Among voters
who had only primary education, 56% responded that they had voted for Labour. This share de-
creases monotonically with years of education to only 14% among those with 12 or more years of
education. Conditioning on self-reported income yields almost identical results. In fact, the more
educated were substantially more likely to vote for the Conservative Party (panel (b)). Given this
negative correlation, and the timing of the effects, it thus seems very unlikely that the electoral
results would be driven by the effects of the reform on educational attainment.


                                                                        26
6.2     Political participation

We next ask whether the reform's impact might be working through the increased political par-
ticipation in affected municipalities. There are three channels of political participation that might
be at work. The first is a turnout effect among the population, while the other two would be via
the election strategies of the Labour Party, which may decide to field more candidates in these
municipalities or allocate more of its resources to such municipalities. We do not find support for
any of these channels.
      Figure 9 panel (a) presents event-study estimates for municipality-level turnout in national
elections. The baseline estimates are large and significant for both the pre- and the post-period,
reflecting other pre-existing differences across municipalities. Once we condition on the same
pre-reform characteristics we used in our analysis in the previous section (any combinations of
region, industry composition and municipality income), we do not find any indication on the
reform affecting turnout.
      The remaining panels of Figure 9 examine whether the reform affected the composition of
candidates. Panel (b) explores the possibility that the share of Labour candidates in the affected
municipalities increased (this might result because of the party's strategy, the willingness of in-
dividuals in these areas to run for office as Labour candidates, or a discouragement on potential
candidates from other parties). In any case, our event-study estimates, using data from Fiva and
Smith (2017) on candidates running in parliamentary elections between 1927 and 1965, provide
no support for this hypothesis. All of our estimates are indistinguishable from zero in this case.
      Finally, panel (c) explores the possibility that the Labour Party might have strategically allo-
cated more candidates to heavily-affected municipalities at the expense of other areas, thus show-
ing up as an increase in the share of candidates in the affected municipalities within the Labour
Party's candidates. Once again, we do not find any evidence for such an impact.
      Overall, we conclude that our estimated political effects are not working through participation
channels.


6.3     Local Labour rule

We now explore another potential mechanism behind our political results, by investigating whether
the effects of the schooling reform were differential depending on recent experience of (local)
Labour rule in the municipality. Specifically, we exploit the fact that more than a quarter of rural
municipalities were governed by the Labour Party at the time of the reform. Not surprisingly,
residents of municipalities where the Labour Party held local power were more likely to vote for
Labour in national elections throughout our period (Appendix Figure A6). In addition, between
the 1936 and 1945 national elections, support for Labour increased substantially in municipalities
that were not governed by a mayor from the party, while the opposite happened in places that

were already under local Labor rule at the time the party assumed national power.19
    The event-study estimates reported in Figure 10 show that the effects of the 1936 school reform
are significantly larger in non-Labour municipalities. We construct the figure by first estimating

                                y ptj = Zj  t + Wj t + ( Zj × Wj )t + X j0 t + µt + µ j +               ptj                                  (7)

where y ptj is the vote share of the Labour party in the national elections in year t at municipality j,
Wj is an indicator variable taking value one if the local mayor in 1934 was from the Labour Party
and zero otherwise, and Zj and X j0 are the same pre-reform distance and pre-reform observable
characteristics as in our baseline analysis. Panel (a) of Figure 10 reports estimates for ^ , which
captures the effect of the schooling reform on municipalities that did not have Labour local gov-
ernment. Similarly, panel (b) of Figure 10 reports estimates for ^+  ^, corresponding to the effect
of schooling reform on municipalities that had a Labour mayor in 1934.
  19 We define local Labour rule using data on the political affiliation of the mayor after the 1934 local elections. While

some geographical clustering is evident (Appendix Figure A6), there are municipalities under Labour control in all
parts of the country. Municipalities in both groups are also present over the entire support of the treatment intensity
distribution (Appendix Figure A7).



                                                                          29
      The most plausible interpretation for the relative increase in Labour vote share in areas that
did not have a mayor from the party relates to a (quasi-)learning channel: rural municipalities
that previously did not vote for a Labour mayor appear to have updated more positively from the
party's successful implementation of its national reform agenda.20


6.4       Support for the Labour Party among the directly-affected and their parents

We finally examine whether those directly benefiting from the schooling reform and/or their par-
ents were more likely to support Labour using individual-level data from the 1957 election survey
(the first such survey conducted in Norway). Figure 11, panel (a), shows the distribution of votes
for four groups defined by respondent's age and type of residential municipality. We set the age
threshold to 35 years, because the younger birth cohorts attended primary school during and after
the implementation of the reform.
      Unfortunately, this survey does not include information on municipality of residence and thus
we cannot compute treatment intensity at the individual level in this data set. Nevertheless, as a
crude proxy, we use information on whether a municipality had low or high population density
in 1957 to approximate who were likely to live in affected areas. This cut roughly divides the data
into urban and rural areas, with the latter having, on average, greater intensity of treatment, as we
have seen so far
      The survey data show that among older cohorts, those living in urban areas were 14 percentage
points more likely to support the Labour Party than those living in rural areas. Remarkably, the
gap is reversed for younger cohorts among whom the Labour Party has a 5 percentage point
higher support in rural than in urban areas. This comparison could be interpreted as a differences-
in-differences estimate, where (part of) the younger rural birth cohorts were directly affected by
the reform, while the other groups were not. Naturally, this is a less fine-grained comparison than
the ones we presented in Section 5 and should be interpreted with greater caution (for one, there
might be greater attenuation, and for another, other differential trends between rural and urban
areas might confound this strategy). Nevertheless, Appendix Table A4 shows estimates using this
strategy that are statistically significant (with the exception of the reduction of Labour support in
urban areas across birth cohorts) and also confirms that the results are robust to controlling for
region fixed effects.
  20 In  Appendix Figure A9 and Appendix Table A3, we show that these results are robust to using information on the
affiliation of municipalities' mayors in 1928 instead or in addition to 1934. (The records for the 1931 local elections are
not available.) In addition, Appendix Figure A8 reports estimates for  from a series of cross-sectional regressions of
the form
                                   y jt =  +  Zj + X j0  +  [l y jl + l y2      jl ] + jt

where the lagged dependent variables are from years 1927, 1930 and 1933. The estimates are similar as those reported
in Figure 10 though somewhat smaller.

Note: This figure shows the distribution of answers to the question "Which party did you vote?" in the 1957 election
survey. Category "Conservative" includes both the Conservative Party and the Christian Democratic Party. Categories
"Unanswered" and "Did not vote" are omitted. The numbers inside the bars are percentage shares within each age­
residence municipality.


    The survey additionally contains information on the respondent's children, and we can con-
duct a similar analysis for respondents whose children were affected by the reform. Specifically,
we split the sample between those who had children younger than 25 years old in 1957 and the
rest.21 Panel (b) of Figure 11 presents the raw averages. It shows a 17 percentage point rural-urban
gap in support for the Labour Party among voters who either had no children or whose children
were too old to have been directly affected by the reform. By contrast, the rural-urban difference
is very small among voters who had children young enough to be affected by the reform. The im-
plied differences-in-differences estimates in columns (3) and (4) of Appendix Table A4 document
that these gaps are statistically significant and robust to controlling for region fixed effects.
    These results suggest that this less fine-grained differences-in-differences strategy still captures
the relevant source of variation and motivates us to look at other variables that are available in the
1957 survey using the same strategy.
    Most importantly, the 1957 election survey contains questions concerning the reasons behind
respondents' voting decisions. In Figure 12, we present the answers to the question: "Would you
say that the Labour Party has shown the will and ability to implement this program in the years it has had
government power?". Once again, we split the sample by respondent's (or her children's) age and
  21 Age categories used in the survey do not allow us to use the same age categories for the affected respondents and

the children of respondents. The category "Younger than 25 years old" is the closest we can get to the affected children
in this survey.

rural-urban status.
    Figure 12 shows that 90% or more of respondents in all groups felt that the Norwegian Labour
Party had been willing and able to implement its agenda. Respondents who were not affected
by the reform had very similar opinions on the implementation of the party program both in
rural and urban areas. Tellingly, however, rural respondents who were either young enough to
have been directly affected or who had children young enough to have been impacted were 8
percentage points more likely to strongly agree with this statement than respondents in the same
categories living in urban areas. This difference seems to reflect movement from the category "Yes,
with reservations" to "Yes, absolutely". A similar pattern is present in panel (b) of Figure 12, where
we split the sample by the age of respondents' children. Nevertheless, these results should be
interpreted with greater caution, since the implied differences-in-differences estimates reported in
columns (5)-(8) of Appendix Table A4 are not statistically significant.
    Overall, we cautiously interpret these results as being consistent with the hypothesis that a
major contributor to the shift in the support towards the Norwegian Labour Party was driven by
directly-affected individuals and their children, who rewarded the party for having delivered on
its major campaign promise and improved schooling significantly.

7   Conclusions
The 19th and early 20th centuries witnessed major challenges to the then-prevailing "capitalist sys-
tems". While some of these challenges were strongly influenced by Marxist/socialist ideas and
attempted to overthrow the existing system, others took a decidedly reformist approach, working
through democratic process and seeking power in order to implement fundamental reform within
the broader institutional structure of their countries. This reformist approach is most closely iden-
tified with the social democratic parties in Scandinavia, which were initially influenced by the
same socialist ideas but then broke away from the Marxist tradition. Starting with Sweden in
1932, social democratic (labor or worker) parties in these countries came to power and imple-
mented sweeping reforms. The key social democratic policy and institutional reforms included
the strengthening of trade unions; the development of a corporatist model of wage setting with
negotiations between trade unions, employers and the government; active macroeconomic man-
agement; progressive taxation; national health care systems; social security; various other social
programs; and also centrally, greater investment in publicly-provided education.
    The Norwegian Labour Party, which assumed power in 1935, provides an ideal case study
for understanding how the social democratic system came to be formed, in part because it cam-
paigned with the promise to undertake a major schooling reform. As soon as it was in power, it
implemented its promised reform, which harmonized the school year, raising minimum instruc-
tion time in economically less developed rural areas and boosting the resources available to rural
schools.
    We document that cohorts that were more intensively treated by this school reform--because
of their location and age at the time of reform--significantly increased their education. There is
also evidence that their subsequent labor income rose as well, though these estimates are some-
times less precise because of other confounding trends favoring rural areas.
    More importantly, we find that residents of municipalities that benefited from the 1936 school-
ing reform became much more likely to vote for the Labour Party. Perhaps even more strikingly,
the additional support for this party persisted for several decades.
    Our evidence suggests that these results are not mediated by the direct effects of education
(in fact, more educated individuals were less likely to support the Labour Party at the time). Nor
are they explained by greater participation or greater attention from the Labour Party towards
these municipalities. Rather, our evidence suggests that cohorts that benefited from the schooling
reform, as well as their parents, rewarded the party for having kept its promise and for delivering
a major reform.
    Several economists and commentators are presently calling for major institutional reforms in
Western nations (e.g. Esping-Andersen et al. 2002; Rajan 2019; Stiglitz 2019). A key question is
whether the Norwegian experience in the 1930s is relevant for the current context and whether a



                                                 33
credible promise and later delivery of major reforms could be the basis of a broad coalition that
supports these reforms and the parties that implement them. While we have no direct answer to
this question, we believe that a systematic analysis of the interplay between economic and social
reforms and the formation of different political coalitions is an interesting area for future research.

Note: The change in the rhetoric of the Norwegian Labour Party as illustrated by election posters. Both are designed
by the same artist, Erling Nielsen. The 1930 campaign focused on urban industrial workers and the poster design is
heavily influenced by Soviet art. The 1933 campaign led with a message of unity and the poster includes references also
to fishing and agriculture with slogans "Cities and the countryside, hand in hand" and "The whole people in work".

Note: This figure reports estimates for y ptj = Zj  t + X j0 t + µt + µ j +         ptj , where y ptj   is the vote share of part p in year t
at municipality j, Zj is our treatment intensity measure and X j0 is a vector of pre-reform observable characteristics that
vary between specifications (see figure legend). The estimates measure the extent to which the vote share of a party
increased faster between the 1933 elections and elections in year t in municipalities more affected by the reform.

( post × Wj ) + ( post × Zj × Wj ) + X j0 t + µt + µ j +   ptj ,   where y jt is the Labour Party's vote share
in municipality j in year t, Zjc is treatment intensity, Wj is an indicator for the municipality having
experienced Labour rule prior to the reform (see panel labels for definitions), X j0 is a vector of munic-
ipality's pre-war characteristics, and µt and µ j are year and municipality fixed-effects, respectively.
For each regression, we report estimates for ^ and   ^.

Note: This table reports results from differences-in-differences estimates using the 1957 election survey from specifica-
tion yi =  +  Ai +  Ri + ( Ai × Ri ) +      ptj ,   where yi is an outcome variable, Ai is an indicator for being potentially
affected by the reform, Ri is an indicator for living in a low density (rural) area. In columns (1)­(4), the outcome is
an indicator variable for person i voting the Norwegian Labour Party. In columns (5)­(8), the outcome is an indicator
for replying "Yes, absolutely" to the question "Would you say that the Labor Party has shown the will and ability to
implement this program in the years it has had government power?" In columns (1) and (2), Ai is one for individuals,
who were 35 years old or younger in 1957 and zero for other respondents. In columns, (3) and (4), Ai takes value one if
the respondents youngest child is 25 or younger and zero otherwise. In columns (2) and (4), we control for respondent's
region of residence.
