Governance, Risk Management, and Risk-Taking in Banks

                                               ABSTRACT

This paper examines how governance and risk management affect risk-taking in banks. It distinguishes
between good risks, which are risks that have an ex ante private reward for the bank on a stand-alone
basis, and bad risks, which do not have such a reward. A well-governed bank takes the amount of risk
that maximizes shareholder wealth subject to constraints imposed by laws and regulators. In general,
this involves eliminating or mitigating all bad risks to the extent that it is cost effective to do so. The
role of risk management in such a bank is not to reduce the bank’s total risk per se. It is to identify
and measure the risks the bank is taking, aggregate these risks in a measure of the bank’s total risk,
enable the bank to eliminate, mitigate and avoid bad risks, and ensure that its risk level is consistent
with its risk appetite. Organizing the risk management function so that it plays that role is challenging
because there are limitations in measuring risk and because, while more detailed rules can prevent
destructive risk-taking, they also limit the flexibility of an institution in taking advantage of opportunities
that increase firm value. Limitations of risk measurement and the decentralized nature of risk-taking
imply that setting appropriate incentives for risk-takers and promoting an appropriate risk culture are
essential to the success of risk management in performing its function.

1. Introduction

    The Oxford Dictionary defines risk as a situation that involves exposure to danger. It also states that

the word comes from the Italian word risco, which means danger. We call risks that are only danger bad

risks. Banks – and any firm for that matter – also have opportunities to take risks that have an ex ante

reward on a stand-alone basis. We call such risks good risks.1 One might be tempted to conclude that

good risk management reduces the exposure to danger. However, such a view of risk management ignores

that banks cannot succeed without taking risks that are ex ante profitable. Consequently, taking actions

that reduce risk can be costly for shareholders when lower risk means avoiding valuable investments and

activities that have higher risk. Therefore, from the perspective of shareholders, better risk management

cannot mean risk management that is more effective at reducing risk in general since reducing risk in

general would mean not taking valuable projects. If good risk management does not mean low risk, then

what does it mean? How is it implemented? What are its limitations? What can be done to make it more

effective? In this article, I provide a framework to understand the role, the organization, and the

limitations of risk management in banks when it is designed from the perspective of increasing the value

of the bank for its shareholders.

    In corporate finance, the well-known Modigliani-Miller theorem of leverage irrelevance implies that

the value of a firm does not depend on its leverage. For the theorem to hold, markets have to be

frictionless, so that there cannot be transaction costs of any kind. As has been stressed by modern banking

research, there are no reasons for banks to exist if the conditions of the Modigliani-Miller theorem of

leverage irrelevance hold. With the Modigliani-Miller theorem, a bank has the same value if it is mostly

financed by debt or mostly financed by equity. Hence, the value of a bank is the same irrespective of its

risk of default or distress if the Modigliani-Miller theorem of leverage irrelevance applies to banks. It

follows that if the conditions for the Modigliani-Miller theorem apply, a bank has no reason to manage its

risk of default or its risk of financial distress (e.g., Stulz (2003)).


1
 For a related useful taxonomy, see Kaplan and Mikes (2012). They distinguish between preventable, strategic, and
external risks and show that the role of risk management differs across these types of risk.

                                                         1
    When the Modigliani-Miller theorem of leverage irrelevance does not apply, the most compelling

argument for managing risk is that adverse outcomes can lead to financial distress and financial distress is

costly (Smith and Stulz (1985)). When a firm is distressed, it loses its ability to implement its strategy

effectively and finds it more difficult and expensive to conduct its business. As a result, the value of a

firm’s equity is reduced by the present value of future costs of financial distress. When a firm manages

risk so that it reduces the present value of these future costs of distress while incurring costs in doing so

that are lower than the amount by which this present value is reduced, firm value is increased for

shareholders. Banks differ from firms in general because they create value for shareholders through their

liabilities as well. Banks produce liquid claims and the value of a bank depends on its success at

producing such claims. For instance, the value of a bank depends on its deposit franchise. A bank’s

ability to issue claims that are valued because of their liquidity depends on its risk, so that risk

management is intrinsic to the business model of banks in a way that it is not for non-financial firms

(DeAngelo and Stulz (2014)).

    Since an increase in risk can enable a bank to invest in assets and projects that are valuable but can

also lead to a loss in value because of an adverse impact on its risk of financial distress and its ability to

create value through liabilities, there is an optimal amount of risk for a bank from the perspective of its

shareholders. A well-governed bank will have processes in place to identify this optimal amount of risk

and make sure that its risk does not differ too much from this optimal amount. Theoretically, the bank’s

problem is simple: it should take any project that increases its value, taking into account the costs

associated with the impact of the project on the bank’s total risk. Practically, the bank’s problem is

difficult because risk-taking decisions are made all the time throughout the bank and each decision affects

its probability of financial distress to some degree. As a result, risk-taking decisions cannot be evaluated

in isolation but must be assessed in terms of their impact on the overall risk of the bank.

    In principle, if there is an optimal level of risk for a bank, the cost of taking on a new risk that

increases the bank’s total risk should be traded off against the potential gain from taking the risk.

However, ignoring hedges, it would never make sense for a bank to take a risk that destroys value as a

                                                      2
stand-alone risk. We call such risks bad risks. They correspond only to danger. An example is a trader

who writes underpriced deep-out-of-the-money puts because he believes that if the puts are exercised he

will not receive a bonus anyway, while if they are not exercised, his bonus will be higher. Such a

purchase is a negative net present value project for shareholders as a stand-alone project since the firm

sells an asset for less than it is worth. Writing an overpriced put would be a positive net present value

project on a stand-alone basis. Hence, such a risk would be a good risk. However, writing this option

creates risk for the bank that may or may not be worth it given its total risk and the costs associated with

its total risk. With our examples, both the bad risk and the good risk increase the bank’s total risk. While

it is clear that taking the bad risk makes no sense for the bank, whether it makes sense for it to take the

good risk cannot be evaluated by considering the good risk on a stand-alone basis. This is because taking

the good risk increases the total risk of the bank.

    When risk-taking is decentralized, the tradeoff between how a project’s risk contributes to the bank’s

risk and its expected return cannot be made in real-time for most risk-taking actions. Instead, a short-cut

is needed, which is to focus on risk separately and manage the overall amount of risk of the bank.

Focusing separately on risk has the potential to destroy value if not done well when it leads the bank to

reject projects that are valuable for the institution despite their risk.

    There are two fundamentally different ways that risk management can destroy value for a bank. First,

risk management can fail to ensure that the bank has the right amount of risk. This failure can come about

for a number of different reasons. In particular, risk management can fail to uncover bad risks that should

be eliminated, it can mismeasure good risks, and it can fail in its task to measure the firm’s total risk.

Second, risk management can be inappropriately inflexible, so that increases in risk are prevented even

when taking on more risk would be valuable to the institution. When risk management becomes too

inflexible, it destroys value as the institution no longer has the ability to invest in valuable opportunities

when they become available and it also becomes less effective in making sure that the firm has the right

amount of risk. The reason is straightforward: as risk managers become policemen, they are viewed

within an institution as an obstacle rather than as partners in creating value. Striking the right balance

                                                         3
between helping the firm take risks efficiently and ensuring that employees within the firm do not take

risks that destroy value is a critical challenge for risk management in any bank.

    In the remainder of this paper, I first discuss the determinants of a firm’s optimal risk level. In Section

3, I examine the role of governance and risk management in helping a bank achieve its optimal risk level.

I then turn to an analysis of the determinants of the organization of risk management. I assess the tools

used by risk management to ensure that the firm does not take on an excessive amount of risk in Section

5. In Section 6, I show that the limitations of the tools used by risk management create an important role

for incentives and for a firm’s culture. Section 6 presents my conclusions.



2. Determining the risk appetite

    In a market economy, there are compelling reasons for corporations to be run to maximize

shareholder wealth. These reasons apply to banks as well. However, no corporation maximizes

shareholder wealth in a vacuum. In particular, corporations are constrained in their actions by laws and

regulations. Laws and regulations play a special role with banks because bank failures and/or weaknesses

can have damaging effects on the financial system and the economy. If a bank is managed to maximize

shareholder wealth, it will choose a level of risk consistent with that objective. A bank with too much risk

could not conduct its business even if regulators allowed it to do so. Such a bank will find it hard to fund

itself. While deposit insurance guarantees depositors against losses, it does not guarantee that they have

continuous access to their deposits. Further, many short-term liabilities of banks are not insured. To the

extent that safe and liquid deposits are a source of value for banks, too much risk will limit a bank’s

ability to supply safe and liquid deposits and hence will adversely affect the value of the bank. Some

borrowers may have no reason to care if the bank they borrow from is too risky, but others will.

Borrowers that rely on their relationship with the bank could see that relationship jeopardized or lost if the

bank becomes distressed or fails.2 They might therefore seek to borrow elsewhere rather than deal with a


2
 See, for instance, Poloncheck, Slovin, and Sushka (1993) for evidence that corporate borrowers are affected
adversely when their relationship bank becomes distressed.

                                                         4
risky bank. If the bank is in the derivatives business, counterparties will be leery to deal with it if it is too

risky. The bank might also find it difficult or expensive to hire employees because potential employees

will be reluctant to make bank-specific investments in human capital if the bank is too fragile.

    Other reasons could be listed for why a bank that is too risky is worth less. At the same time,

however, a bank that has no risk whatsoever might not be worth much either. Of course, if a bank could

find valuable projects such that it could capture the value of these projects without having to bear their

risks and could perfectly hedge all those risks, such a bank could have considerable value and might not

be able to increase its value by taking risks. In practice, however, banks cannot eliminate all risks through

hedging and diversification. Hence, they have to take some risks to create wealth for their shareholders.

    There are many ways to define risk. Shareholders who hold diversified portfolios have no reason to

care about the volatility of the return of a stock in their portfolio on a stand-alone basis. They only care

about the volatility of their portfolio. If a stock’s volatility increases so that their portfolio becomes more

volatile, they can change their asset allocation. Hence, the risk that shareholders care about when they

consider a bank is risk that makes the bank worth less than it would otherwise be worth. For risk to affect

shareholder wealth, it has to affect future cash flows or the rate at which these cash flows are discounted.

The possibility of unexpectedly low cash flows in the future that would make the bank distressed will

reduce the value of the bank now because the market will adjust its value for the possibility that it will

incur distress costs. These costs arise because the bank is no longer able to execute its strategy. Hence, the

loss to shareholders is the loss that arises when the bank cannot implement its strategy. Viewed from this

perspective, the risk that has to be managed to maximize shareholder wealth is the risk of financial

distress.

     For now, I will assume that the risk of financial distress is appropriately captured by the bank’s credit

rating if it has one. Given the previous discussion, the optimal rating of a bank is generally not the highest

rating, the AAA rating, but some other rating. This is because, typically, achieving an AAA rating

requires the bank to give up too many valuable risky projects. Suppose that a specific bank’s value is

highest with an A rating. An A rating essentially corresponds to a very low probability of default. From

                                                       5
1981 to 2011, the annual average default rate for A-rated credits is 0.08% according to Standard &

Poor’s.3 Hence, by targeting a specific probability of default, the bank achieves its desired level of risk.

For that institution, a higher rating than A will necessarily limit its activities so that it would have to give

up projects. A lower rating than A might make it impossible for the bank to keep engaging in value-

creating activities.

      A bank with more of a deposit franchise and with more relationship lending is likely to prefer a

higher rating than an institution that is engaged in more transactional activities. Similarly, a bank that

enters in long-term derivatives contracts might find a higher rating more valuable than one that does not.

Consequently, the rating that maximizes the value of the bank differs across banks. Figure 1 shows the

relation between ratings and bank value for two different banks. In both cases, the relation between

ratings and bank value is concave, so that there is a maximum value. However, in the case of Bank Safe,

firm value falls steeply if the bank is riskier than its target rating and increases only moderately as it

increases its risk towards the target rating. Bank Risky has a substantially different relation between its

value and its rating. Its target rating is BBB and its value increases substantially as it increases its risk

towards its target and falls sharply if it exceeds it. For both banks, having too much risk is extremely

costly in terms of their value. However, for one bank having too little risk has little cost while for the

other it has a large cost.

      The relation between bank value and risk presented for Bank Safe and Bank Risky in Figure 1 is

sharply different from the relation that would prevail if the Modigliani-Miller leverage irrelevance

theorem applied to banks. In the Modigliani-Miller case, bank value would be the same irrespective of its

risk of default or of financial distress. In other words, the bank could achieve exactly the same value if its

rating were AAA or CCC. The reason for this is straightforward. If the Modigliani-Miller leverage

irrelevance theorem applies, the firm can always alter its leverage at zero cost and hence achieve a

specific rating through changes in leverage – for instance, by issuing equity and investing the proceeds in

                                                       6
fairly priced risk-free securities. Since changing leverage has no impact on value when the Modigliani-

Miller leverage irrelevance theorem applies, it follows that there is no relation between bank value and

risk of default in that world.

    If the Modigliani-Miller leverage irrelevance theorem applies, decision-making in a bank can be

decentralized as long as new projects do not have an adverse impact on existing projects. If new projects

do not affect the value of existing projects, it is optimal for the bank to take all projects that create value

on a stand-alone basis. However, if there is an optimal level of risk for the bank as a whole, a new project

necessarily has an impact on the other projects because it changes the aggregate level of risk of the bank

and hence changes its value through its impact on the risk of the bank. Consequently, fully decentralized

decision-making cannot be optimal when the Modigliani-Miller leverage irrelevance theorem does not

apply and there is an optimal level of risk for a bank.

    With the approach presented so far, bank value is highest if it achieves a specific target rating that

depends on characteristics of the bank such as its strategy and business model. In practice, not all banks

are rated. I focused on a rating as a measure of risk because it is intuitive. However, a rating corresponds

to a probability of default, so that a bank that does not have a rating can still figure out the probability of

default that is optimal. Obviously, banks might choose to tailor their risk in a more complex way. They

might want to specify how they are affected by specific shocks. For instance, a bank might choose to set a

level of risk such that it can survive a major recession with only a one-notch downgrade. An obvious

difficulty with multiple constraints on a bank’s risk is that these constraints might be inconsistent and

their impact on bank value might be hard to assess. At the same time, however, multiple constraints can

be advantageous in that they could make it more likely that a bank will be well positioned following

adverse shocks.

    A bank’s risk appetite is the result of an assessment of how taking on more risk affects the

opportunities that the bank can capitalize on. This assessment can change as the bank’s opportunities

change. Consequently, a bank’s risk appetite cannot be inflexible. At the same time, however, the risk

appetite is not determined in such a precise way that a small shift in opportunities will affect it.

                                                       7
    Banks differ from other firms because their failure can have systemic effects. If a producer of widgets

fails, as long as there are other producers of widgets, the impact on society will be extremely limited and

will be immaterial for most of society. The same is not true if a large bank or a group of smaller banks

fail. While limiting the systemic risk a bank creates is important for society, there is no a priori reason

that a bank that has less systemic risk is worth more for its shareholders. It follows that a bank that

maximizes its value for its shareholders may have an amount of systemic risk that is excessive from the

perspective of society.

    Because of the role of banks and the consequences of bank failures, regulators impose restrictions on

a bank’s ability to take risks on the asset side and they require banks to satisfy minimal capital

requirements. As a result, a bank’s systemic risk is reduced. It also means that a bank chooses its level of

risk subject to constraints. However, these constraints do not change the bottom line, which is that there is

an optimal level of risk for a bank and that optimal level of risk differs across banks depending on the

nature of their business. Because the optimal level of risk differs across banks, the costs to shareholders of

constraints imposed by regulators are not equal across banks. For instance, Boyson, Fahlenbrach and

Stulz (2014) show that banks with high franchise value have incentives to choose low-risk strategies, so

that for such banks capital requirements are unlikely to be constraining.



3. Governance and risk taking

    In Section 2, I presented a risk appetite framework from the perspective of the bank’s shareholders.

Good governance means that the shareholders get the most benefit from their ownership of the firm

(Shleifer and Vishny (1998)). With banks, regulation is a constraint that shareholders have to satisfy.

Given the constraint, shareholders still want to maximize their wealth, and hence a well-governed bank

should have mechanisms in place so that the level of risk chosen by management maximizes shareholder

wealth subject to the constraints imposed by regulation. In this section, I address key tradeoffs that must

be made when designing a firm’s risk governance. This section is not meant to address general

governance issues in banking as there already exist excellent reviews (Mehran, Morrison, and Shapiro

                                                      8
(2011), Mehran and Mollineaux (2012), and de Haan and Vlahu (2013)) and the topic goes beyond the

risk issues I am focused on.

    In the framework of Section 2, there is, for each bank, a level of risk such that the value of the bank is

maximized for shareholders. This level of risk is not zero. Good governance should ensure that the firm

chooses that level of risk. This means making sure that the firm has processes in place so that it can

measure its risk, understand how firm value is related to risk, and maintain the right level of risk.

    An obvious concern for shareholders is that management might do a poor job in managing the firm’s

risk or might have incentives to take risks that are not in the interest of the shareholders. To alleviate this

concern, the board has to ensure that the firm has the capability to measure and manage risk so that it has

the right level of risk given its risk appetite and has to ensure that it uses this capability effectively so that

it actually takes the right level of risk. This means that the banks should have a risk management

organization in place capable of making sure that it has the right level of risk. I discuss risk management

organizational issues in the next section.

    An important governance issue is that the board of the company has to have enough expertise to

assess management’s efforts in measuring and managing risks. Understanding whether a firm takes the

right risks is a rather complex and technical task. Even if the board has the proper expertise, it may be

difficult for the board to develop such an understanding. While boards require an external assessment of

firms’ accounting, they do not typically require such an assessment of what is effectively a firm’s risk

accounting (though auditors may comment on various aspects of risk management). It would seem that

risk audits might be valuable tools in helping the board reach the proper level of comfort that

management is managing a bank’s risk properly.

    An important implication of this view of good risk governance is that good risk governance does not

mean less risk. In fact, it could well be that management left to itself would choose for the bank to have

too little risk compared to what is best for the shareholders. Good governance means that the bank has the

right amount of risk for its shareholders. This right amount of risk may not be the amount that is

appropriate from the perspective of the society as a whole because shareholders may not have the proper

                                                        9
incentives to take into account the externalities created by the bank’s risk taking. Because the optimal

amount of risk from the perspective of the shareholders need not be the optimal amount for society, it

would be wrong to believe that somehow better governance makes banks safer. It can make them more

valuable but also riskier.

    To make the issues clearer, consider the situation where it is optimal for shareholders to increase the

risk of a bank. This greater risk may make the bank more fragile but also more valuable. If an adverse

realization of the increased risk the bank took leads it to become distressed, this can have an adverse

impact on other banks that are counterparties of the bank. For instance, a default by the bank could mean

that other banks make losses on unsecured obligations from the defaulting bank. As these other banks

make losses, they become financially weaker banks weaker and hence potentially endanger the stability of

the financial system. A bank maximizing shareholder wealth will take into account the potential impact of

its actions on the financial system to the extent that they affect its value. This means that the bank is likely

to take too much risk from the perspective of society because it will ignore the impact on society of the

risk it takes beyond what is reflected in its value. For instance, the fact that a failure of the bank could

lead counterparties of its counterparties to fail will be a cost of failure that has little impact on the value of

the bank but may have considerable impact on the safety of the financial system. Hence, to make sure that

banks take properly account of the impact of their actions on the financial system, constraints have to be

put on the actions they can take and/or taxes have to be imposed on actions that are costly to the financial

system.

    Existing empirical research does not seem to support the proposition that better governance in banks

leads to less risk. The credit crisis provides a natural experiment of whether good governance leads to less

risk. If this proposition were correct, we would expect better governed banks to be less affected by the

crisis since they would have been less exposed to risks that manifested themselves during the crisis

assuming these risks were properly measured ahead of the crisis. Alternatively, it could be that the risks

were not or could not be properly assessed before the crisis. In any case, there is no evidence suggesting

that better governed banks performed better during the crisis.

                                                       10
    Specifically, research examines four dimensions of governance. First, evidence shows that banks with

boards that were more shareholder friendly performed worse than other banks, not better (see Beltratti and

Stulz (2012) and Erkens et al. (2012)). Second, the governance literature emphasizes that more stock

ownership by top management leads to better alignment of incentives between management and the

shareholders. However, existing evidence shows that banks where management had more of a stake

performed worse during the crisis, not better (see Fahlenbrach and Stulz (2011)). Third, there is a

considerable literature that focuses on CEO’s ability to entrench themselves so that they can pursue their

own objectives rather than maximize shareholder wealth. Such entrenched CEOs are likely to take less

risk than shareholders would like them to because they could lose their job if the bank they lead

experiences distress. Ferreira, Kershaw, Krichmaier, and Schuster (2013) show that managers of banks

that were more entrenched were less likely to be bailed out during the crisis. Relatedly, Chen, Hong, and

Scheinkman (2010) show that institutional investors had a preference for banks that were taking more risk

before the crisis. Finally, there is no evidence that banks whose board had more financial expertise

performed better (see Minton, Taillard, and Williamson (2014)). All this evidence, at the very least,

implies that better governance did not lead banks to perform better during the crisis. Of course, the

implication is not that better governance is bad for shareholders; rather, the correct implication is that

better governance does not mean less risk. Better governance meant taking risks that would have been

rewarding for shareholders had there not been the crisis. Because the occurrence of a crisis like the one

we lived through, if it was contemplated at all, was viewed as an exceedingly low probability event, the

evidence supports the view that shareholders considered that taking these risks was worthwhile for them

ex ante.



4. The organization of risk management

    In this section, I discuss the tradeoffs which affect how risk management should be organized in a

bank. Consider a bank where employees throughout the organization can take risks. Suppose that the top

management could know exactly what the bank’s risk is at each point in time and suppose further that it

                                                   11
could instantly hedge risk at zero cost. In this case, risk management would be straightforward. Having

determined its risk appetite, the bank could control its risk through hedging by top management. As long

as risk-takers in the bank only took projects that create value regardless of their risk, top management

would have no reason to monitor the risk in the sense of assessing risk decisions made by employees. All

that the bank would have to do is measure the risk taken within the bank and control it through hedging.

    Real world banks cannot control risk this way for at least three important reasons:



    1) Risk measurement technology limitations: While real-time risk measures exist for a number of

        activities within banks, such measures do not exist for banks as a whole. Further, risk

        measurement is imperfect and can be quite imprecise. Finally, risk measurement can be affected

        by behavioral biases. For instance, over-optimism and groupthink can lead important issues to be

        ignored or underappreciated (Greenbaum (2014)).

    2) Hedging limitations: Even if a bank had a highly precise measure of its overall risk, it does not

        follow that it could safely manage its overall risk through hedging by top management. Some

        risks cannot be hedged and hedges may not work out as planned.

    3) Risk-taker incentives limitations: Risk-takers do not take only risks that increase the value of the

        bank. Some risk takers turn out to be rogue traders. More importantly, however, risk-takers often

        are rewarded in ways that give them incentives to take risks that are not as valuable to the bank as

        they are to them. It is even possible that they can gain from taking risks that destroy value for the

        bank. This problem is made worse by the limitations in risk measurement tools.



    These three limitations mean that risk has to be monitored and managed throughout the organization.

Risk managers play a critical role in measuring, monitoring, and managing risk. Yet, despite their name,

risk managers mostly do not manage risk. They mostly measure it, monitor it, and help those who manage

risk. To see this more concretely, consider the interactions between the head of a trading desk at a bank

and the risk managers. The head of the trading desk will be constantly changing the risk taken by the desk

                                                     12
as a function of opportunities available to the desk and constraints placed on the desk by risk management

and senior management. The head of the trading desk will be managing the risk of the desk. However, he

will face constraints that are imposed on his risk-taking. Risk management will monitor the risk of the

desk and make sure that the risk of the desk is within the limits set by risk management. The top risk

manager in a company is the CEO, not the CRO.

    The risk-taking framework presented in Section 2 helps understand the type of risk management an

organization should select to maximize shareholder wealth. If the relation between bank value and risk is

close to flat, risk management cannot create much value by making sure that the bank’s aggregate risk is

at its optimal level. In contrast, if too much risk results in a sharp drop in bank value, risk management

that keeps the bank away from having too much risk creates a lot of value in that the bank would be worth

much less if the market did not have confidence in the bank’s ability to manage risk. It therefore follows

that the extent of a bank’s investment in risk management depends on how its value is related to its risk.

The size of the investment in risk management is an investment decision like any other for a bank.

Therefore, it has to compare costs and benefits. Excessive investment in risk management can destroy

value just as much as insufficient investment in risk management can.

    The risk-taking framework also helps in assessing how independent the risk management function

should be. One often-held view is that risk management is the equivalent of the audit function, but for

risk. The audit function in a firm is independent. From this perspective, the risk management function

should be independent as well. Unfortunately, this view is problematic on two grounds. First, auditors

who follow the rules cannot be an obstacle to the profitability of the firm. Their job is to make sure the

profits are real. They only have a verification function. They cannot tell the firm not to take on a project.

The same is not true for risk managers. Risk managers do not have only a verification function. They are

involved when employees contemplate an action to help assess its risk and when the action will lead to

limits being breached. Risk managers can prevent employees from taking actions that could increase firm

value. Further, risk managers can help employees increase firm value by devising strategies that are less

risky but not less profitable. Hence, it is important for risk managers to be able to help and support risk

                                                     13
takers when appropriate. Second, if risk managers are viewed as the risk police, they face obstacles in

gathering information and understanding strategies. They are likely to be kept out of the information flow

that is critical in assessing risk. They may not learn about model weaknesses and new risks until it is too

late.

    The right degree of independence for risk managers cannot be achieved by formal rules alone. The

reporting line of a risk manager may be completely separate from the business line whose risk he is

monitoring. Yet, the risk manager might have the ambition to move into that business line. In that case,

formal independence may not lead to the desired independence (see Landier, Sraer, and Thesmar (2009)).

A risk manager might be partly evaluated by the business line that he monitors, but this incomplete

independence can have very different implications depending on the culture of the institution. In an

institution that has a weak commitment by business lines to manage risk effectively, this incomplete

independence can be a way for business lines to retaliate against the risk manager if he is uncooperative

and can lead to a situation where the business line can take risks that it should not. In an institution with a

strong commitment to manage risk effectively, such incomplete independence can help in setting

incentives so that risk management collaborates with business units to enable them to achieve their goals

within existing risk limits.

    There exists a small but growing literature that attempts to relate characteristics of a firm’s risk

governance or risk organization to risk outcomes and firm performance. This literature faces three

important challenges. First, there is only limited data available about how the risk function is organized in

firms. Second, the risk framework I have discussed implies that characteristics of the risk function are

partly determined by the risk appetite of the firm. Hence, a characteristic of the risk function might be

associated with low risk not because having this characteristic reduces risk but because it is optimal for

the firm to have low risk when it displays such a characteristic. For instance, given a risk target, better

risk management means that the firm will be less likely to miss the target materially. If missing the target

is more costly for firms with a low target, better risk management will spuriously appear to be associated



                                                      14
with low risk. Third, at the firm level, poor ex post performance can be consistent with very good risk

management.

    Risk management targets the level of risk. However, as long as a bank takes risks, there is some

chance, albeit small, that a bad outcome could take place. Hence, the occurrence of a bad outcome is not

evidence of excessive risk taking or bad management. It could be simply the realization of an extremely

low probability event that was fully contemplated by the bank when it chose its strategy.

    The literature on risk governance has focused on two distinct characteristics of risk governance. First,

this literature has examined attributes of the board and its functioning. In particular, the literature studies

whether the board has a risk committee, how often that risk committee meets, and whether the risk

committee has members who have expertise on financial or risk issues. Lingel and Sheedy (2012)

construct a measure of the quality of board oversight of risk whose value depends on the fraction of

experienced directors on the risk committee board and how frequently the risk committee meets. The

authors consider two measures of risk. Both measures are stock-based. One measure is stock return

volatility and the other is the worst weekly return. Using a sample of the 60 largest publicly listed banks

from 2004 to 2010, the authors show that better board oversight or risk in a given year using these

measures is associated with lower risk the following year. Second, the literature looks at the status of the

CRO. Lingel and Sheedy (2012) also investigate the role of CRO status. Their measure of CRO status

increases if the CRO is a top executive and increases if the CRO is among the top five executives who are

most highly paid. The authors find that banks with CROs of higher status have less risk. The authors find

no evidence that banks with better risk management according to their proxies performed better during

the crisis.

    Other studies explore the relation between risk and similar variables. A variable that other studies

have used is the CRO centrality variable. This variable is the ratio of the compensation of the CRO to the

compensation of the CEO. Authors find that CRO centrality is associated with lower implied volatility

ahead of the crisis (Kashyap (2010)) and better loan performance (Keys et al. (2009)). Another variable is

whether the CRO reports to the board. Aebi, Sabato, and Schmid (2012) find that banks where the CRO

                                                      15
reports to the board rather than the CEO performed better during the crisis. Ellul and Yerramilli (2014)

combine a number of risk governance attributes in an index. They show that the banks in the U.S. that had

higher values for that index had higher returns during the crisis. Further, they find that bank holding

companies with a higher value of the index have less tail risk measured by the average return on the five

worst daily stock returns during a year.

    The studies investigate how risk management affects tail risk and stock returns. Risk management

does not target these measures. The relation between metrics that risk management focuses on and these

measures does not appear straightforward. Therefore, one would want to know through which channels

risk management affects the performance of the firm and stock tail risk measures as an understanding of

these channels would give comfort that the relations documented in these studies are not spurious. An

interesting paper by Berg (2014) provides some evidence on this issue. He shows that, in a bank where

loan officers are rewarded according to loan volume, having risk management monitor loan decisions

reduces the probability of default of loans in the bank’s loan portfolio.

    Another issue with these studies is that a financial institution could have good risk governance

because it wants low risk and that it is costly for that institution to have too much risk. Hence, the

institution has low risk because it wants to and it sets up its risk management organization to ensure that it

will have low risk. Viewed from this perspective, the empirical evidence shows that a financial institution

that wants to have low risk can achieve low risk. Just paying a CRO a higher salary relative to the CEO

will not ensure that a financial institution has low risk.



5. Tools and challenges in achieving the optimal level of risk

    If all the risks of a firm could be captured by a reliable value-at-risk (VaR) measure, the risk

framework presented in Section 2 could be implemented in a straightforward way conceptually. I show

this in the first part of this section. I then turn to the limitations of using VaR to manage firm-wide risk.




                                                       16
5.A. Using VaR to target risk

    The risk framework of Section 2 implies that a firm wants to target the probability of making a loss

that could put it in financial distress or in default. In other words, it wants the probability of a loss that

exceeds a threshold amount to be its target probability. Hence, if the firm wants its probability of default

within a year to be 0.06%, it wants the loss that has only a 0.06% probability of being exceeded to be the

largest loss the firm could incur without being forced into default. A loss that is exceeded only with a

probability p over one year is the value-at-risk over one year at the probability level p. It follows that the

risk framework leads directly to the use of value-at-risk (VaR) as a firm-wide risk measure (Nocco and

Stulz (2006)). The use of VaR is ubiquitous in risk management, which gives rise to a constant debate

about the merits of VaR. However, despite its weaknesses, VaR is the right risk measure in a wide range

of circumstances.

    Consider a bank that has chosen a risk appetite that implies that its probability of failure is 0.06%

over one year. This means that the bank is expected to fail less than once in a thousand years. Suppose

that the bank has $100 billion of assets and $10 billion of equity. If all the risks the bank faces could be

measured through a bank-wide VaR, the bank should have an equity cushion such that there is a 0.06%

probability that it will make a loss that would be larger than its equity cushion. If this bank has a bank-

wide VaR of $15 billion, it has taken too much risk given its risk appetite because its probability of

default is higher than 0.06%. Hence, this bank should either reduce the risk of its assets or raise additional

equity.

    Within a bank, a VaR can be estimated for any risk-taking unit (see, for instance, Litterman (1996)).

For instance, a VaR can be estimated for the book of a trader as well as for the unit that the trader belongs

to. Starting from the smallest units for which VaR is estimated, the VaRs can be aggregated so that the

bank-wide VaR is a function of the VaRs of these units as well as of the correlations in risks across these

units. Further, using the VaRs of the smallest units and the correlations, it is possible to assess how each

unit contributes to the risk of the bank. For instance, a bank could estimate how much of the risk of the

bank as measured by VaR is accounted for by a specific trader.

                                                     17
    The fact that the bank-wide VaR results from the aggregation of VaRs of units of the bank means that

risk management can target the bank’s VaR by setting limits on the VaRs of units of the bank. With such

an approach, if all units are within their limits, the VaR of the bank should not exceed the VaR that

corresponds to its risk appetite.



5.B. Setting limits

    The risk framework provides guidelines in how VaR limits should be set. First, the firm’s risk

appetite specifies the firm-level VaR limit. Second, within the firm, VaR limits should depend on the

profitability of the risk-taking unit in relation to its VaR. Ideally, the marginal unit of risk should have the

same expected profit across all risk-taking units of a bank. It would make little sense for a bank to allow a

unit to take up large amounts of risk if that unit cannot use that risk to create value for the bank. Because

profit opportunities change, it follows that limits cannot be unchangeable. When profit opportunities

appear for a sector of the bank, it makes sense for limits to be adjusted. However, if the bank’s risk

appetite has not changed, VaR limits cannot be increased in one sector of the bank without being

decreased elsewhere. Of course, if profit opportunities change for the bank as a whole, so that the

expected return from risk-taking increases, it can be optimal for the bank to change its risk appetite and,

as a consequence, its firm-wide VaR limit as well.

    With the risk framework of Section 2, a bank targets its probability of default over a year. To properly

target this probability of default, it has to make sure that its risk does not depart from its target over the

year. This means that it must monitor and set limits at a higher frequency during the year. For instance,

the bank can monitor and control the risk of trading activities in liquid markets using a one-day VaR.

Within the year, the bank can change limits in response to unexpected losses. This flexibility means that it

has the ability to take more risks if it expects that it can adjust its risk easily.

    An obvious problem with setting limits is that the bank’s units might not make full use of their ability

to take risk. Consider a unit with a daily VaR limit of $10 million. If that unit can alter its VaR through

trades quickly and at low cost, it will operate close to its limit as long as it has opportunities to trade.

                                                         18
However, if a unit cannot alter its VaR quickly and at low cost, it will want to keep some risk capacity in

reserve so that it can take advantage of opportunities if circumstances change. Hence, in such a setting,

many units might want to keep some capacity to take risks, so that if the bank reaches its probability of

default target once all units are at their limit, it will be constantly operating at a lower probability of

default.

    An important issue in setting limits is the determination of the level of aggregation for which limits

are set. In practice, the issue is often described as the issue of selecting the level of granularity of limits.

Consider the case where the limit is set for a department which trades in mortgage-backed securities.

More granular limits would be limits at the trader level. Even more granular limits would be for maturity

bins at the trader level. More granular limits make it much harder and sometimes impossible for risk-

taking units to accumulate large unmonitored pockets of risk. However, more granular limits also make it

much harder for risk-taking units to take advantage aggressively of good opportunities without

negotiating a relaxation of limits. As limits become less granular, the discretion of the risk-taking units

increases. More discretion makes it easier for these units to take advantage of opportunities quickly, but it

also makes it easier for them to end up with large losses.



5.C. The limits of risk measurement

    There are obvious difficulties in measuring risk at the firm level. First, aggregating VaR measures to

obtain a firm-wide risk VaR measure is fraught with problems. Second, VaR does not capture all risks.

Third, VaR has substantial model risk. I assess these issues in turn.

    To organize the analysis, I keep using the risk framework of Section 2. Hence, the bank targets a

probability of default. The firm defaults or fails if it makes a loss large enough that it exhausts its equity

buffer. Hence, to properly target a probability of default, the firm has to measure correctly the risk of a

loss that exceeds the size of the equity buffer. This means that all risks that could lead to losses have to be

modeled. If the firm targets a probability of default of 0.06% but models only some of the risks, it will



                                                      19
have a higher probability of default if its equity buffer corresponds to the VaR obtained from the modeled

risks.

    A typical approach for a bank is to divide risks into market, credit, and operational risks. Basel II

introduced that division and requires banks to hold capital for each of these types of risk. Unfortunately, a

firm-wide VaR that is obtained by aggregating market, credit, and operational risks will typically not

reflect all risks. Such an approach misses business risks if these risks are not modeled as part of

operational risk. For many banks, non-interest income is a large component of revenue. This income is

variable and it tends to be low when the bank makes losses on loans. Such income has to be modeled

when assessing the amount of equity necessary to support the targeted probability of default. Second,

credit VaRs do not necessarily model the risk arising from unexpected changes in interest rates and

unexpected changes in credit spreads. More generally, interest rate risks in the banking book and interest

rate risks arising from liabilities are typically not included in firm-wide VaRs.

    Banks’ firm-wide measurement apparatus is focused on risks arising from the asset side. In practice,

banks can fail because their funding vanishes (see, e.g., Duffie (2010)). Before the crisis, funding

liquidity risk was often not even part of risk management in banks but instead was the focus of the

treasury department. Now, funding liquidity risk is an issue that is given more attention by risk

management. However, it is still not the case that funding risk is integrated in the firm-wide VaR analysis.

A shock to funding can force the bank to sell assets at a loss. Further, shocks to funding are more likely to

happen in periods when markets for securities are themselves less liquid, so that selling assets quickly

will be costly as they are sold at a discount.

    If a bank divides risks between market, credit, and operational risks, it has to aggregate these risks to

obtain a firm-wide measure of risk (see Rosenberg and Schuermann (2006)). This aggregation requires

estimates of the correlations between these types of risks. It turns out that aggregate risk is very sensitive

to these estimates. To see this, suppose that a bank has VaRs of $1 for each risk. If the correlations are 1

among the risks, the bank-wide VaR is $3. If the correlations are 0, the bank-wide VaR falls to $1.73.

Unfortunately, data to estimate such correlations is sparse. Yet, these correlation estimates make an

                                                     20
enormous difference in the amount of equity that is required to target a given default probability.

Mistakes in correlation estimates could lead a bank to have too little capital and to have a risk of default

much larger than its targeted risk of default.

    Another important problem in aggregating risk is that different types of risk have different statistical

distributions. While market risk has generally a fat-tailed symmetric distribution but can often be well-

approximated by the normal distribution, the distributions for credit risk and for operational risk are both

fat-tailed and highly skewed. Risks that are normally distributed can be added up in a straightforward way

because the sum of normally distributed variables is a normally distributed variable. However, it is not

straightforward to add risks that follow different distributions. One approach that the literature has

focused on is the use of copulas. Implementing this approach in practice has proven challenging,

especially in the context of yearly frequencies where there is only limited data available for estimation.

    A VaR is a forecast. When it is estimated for the firm as a whole, it is a forecast for the firm as a

whole. The way that one can assess whether a VaR is properly estimated is by examining the VaR

exceedances (e.g., Christoffersen (2011)). If a bank estimates a one-day VaR at the 5% level for its

trading book, it expects the VaR to be exceeded roughly 13 times in a year. If the VaR is exceeded fewer

than 13 times, it is a potential indication that the bank’s VaR estimates are biased upwards. Alternatively,

if the VaR is exceeded more than 13 times, it could be that the VaR is biased downwards or that random

variation was such that the unbiased VaR was exceeded more than 13 times. Statistical tests have been

developed that can be used to assess whether a VaR is biased given sampling variation. The problem with

a VaR estimated at the 0.06% probability level is that there cannot be a sufficient history to assess reliably

whether the VaR is unbiased. The fact that a 0.06% VaR is not exceeded over a period of five years tells

us almost nothing. Consequently, risk measures used to assess the appropriate size of a capital buffer

cannot be back-tested satisfactorily. The only way to assess whether such risk measures are reliable is to

assess the process that is used to produce them. However, such an approach does not resolve the key issue

that the VaR is extremely sensitive to assumptions made about the extreme tail of the distribution of the



                                                     21
value of the bank. These assumptions cannot be tested robustly in the way that assumptions for a 5% daily

VaR can be tested.

    No discussion of risk management can be complete without addressing the issue of risks that are not

known – the famous black swans of Nassim Taleb or the “unknown unknowns” of Donald Rumsfeld.

These rare risks are not relevant for VaR when it is estimated at probability levels that are not extremely

low. Hence, they do not create a bias in such VaR forecasts. However, the role of these risks becomes

much more consequential when assessing an annual VaR at extremely low probability levels, such as the

0.06% level. The losses corresponding to such a VaR are caused by extremely rare events, so that one’s

understanding of what such rare events could be becomes important. A focus on historical data and the

use of established statistical techniques cannot by itself be sufficient to estimate a VaR at the 0.06% level

because the historical data generally encompasses a period that is too short to develop an accurate

representation of extreme losses that have an annual probability of less than 0.06% of occurring.

    A 0.06% VaR is one that should be exceeded less than one year in a thousand. In other words, the

bank that targets a 0.06% probability of default should be able to survive just about any crisis. This

suggests another approach to investigating whether the VaR is correctly estimated. Since the bank should

survive almost all crises, a simple way to assess whether the bank’s targeting of the probability of default

is done correctly is to simulate what the performance of the bank would be if historical crises were to

repeat. This approach amounts to performing stress tests. If such tests show that the bank would be unable

to survive past crises, it is likely that its VaR is biased. More generally, however, stress tests can help

understand the risks that a bank is exposed to and whether it has enough equity to withstand adverse

realizations of these risks.



6. Incentives, culture, and risk management

    Risk measurement is never perfect. Even if it were, there would still be the problem that firm value

does not depend on risk alone. Risk management that is structured so that it rigidly keeps a bank’s risk

below some pre-specified level and does so through a large set of inflexible limits may well succeed in

                                                     22
controlling risk, but in the process it may prevent the institution from creating wealth for its shareholders.

In a bank, risk management is part of the production technology. If risk management works well, the

institution creates more value as it can issue more liquid claims and as it has more capacity to take

profitable risks.

    An unfortunate tendency among some board members and regulators is to think of the risk

management function as a compliance function in the same way that auditing is a compliance function.

Assuredly, there is an important compliance element to risk management. If a limit is set for a specific

risk, the risk function must monitor that the limit is respected and has to understand why it is exceeded if

it is. However, auditors are never in a position to conclude that departures from GAAP can create

shareholder wealth. In contrast, risk managers have to know when limit exceedances should be allowed

and when a business line should be forced to respect a limit. Risk managers also have to determine or help

determine when limits have to be changed and when it is appropriate for the institution to adjust its risk

appetite.

    Banks always face tradeoffs between risk and expected return. To complicate matters, risk and

expected return are measured imperfectly. If the costs to an institution from having more risk than optimal

are extremely high, that institution may benefit from having a risk management organization that operates

as a police department that enforces rules. In this case, it would also make sense for the organization to

account for limitations in risk measurement by imposing a substantial risk buffer – i.e, set a limit for the

risk measure that is lower than the objective to account for the fact that the risk measure might understate

risk. However, typically, this is not the situation that an institution faces. In general, an institution can

lose a lot from not being able to take advantage of opportunities that might be precluded by an inflexible

risk organization. Further, difficulties in assessing risk mean that a risk management organization might

make incorrect risk assessments without having a dialogue with business units. Unfortunately, such a

dialogue is often impossible if the risk management function is viewed as a compliance unit rather than an

essential part of the firm that seeks to implement policies that increase firm value.



                                                     23
    Hall, Mikes, and Millo (2013) and Mikes, Hall, and Millo (2013) conducted a clinical study of two

banks, which they denote as Saxon Bank and Anglo Bank. Their study shows vividly the issues that have

to do with the positioning of risk management within the organization. In Saxon Bank, risk managers

succeeded in being part of the important decisions. They helped shape them and could make sure that risk

considerations would be taken into account. In contrast, in Anglo Bank, risk management was divided

into a group more focused on formal measures and a group more focused on intuition and interpersonal

relationships. The group more focused on formal measures became dominant, but risk management failed

in that it had no influence on the main decisions of the bank. Importantly, using the formal measures of

the role of risk management used in the literature discussed earlier, it is not clear that these two banks

could be distinguished, yet risk management played a fundamentally distinct role in the two. This

indicates that new measures for the role of risk management are needed.

    If everybody in an organization is focused on making sure that the institution takes risks that increase

firm value and not risks that decrease it, risk management becomes a resource in making this possible.

Lines of business cannot know by themselves the extent to which the risks they take increase firm value

because the amount of risk the bank can take at a given point in time depends on other risks taken by

other lines of business. Hence, risk management has to bring in the risk-taking decisions the perspective

of the firm as a whole to make sure that the firm itself does not have a suboptimal amount of risk. By

bringing in the perspective of the firm as a whole, risk managers face potential conflicts with managers

who are concerned about their unit only. Hence, for risk management to work well, it has to be that

executives within the firm have reasons to care about the firm as a whole. This requires incentives that

reward them if they create value for the firm as a whole and makes them bear adverse consequences from

taking risks that destroy value.

    Setting correct incentives for risk-taking is complex. However, as Rajan (2006) discusses, poor

incentives can impose large costs both on shareholders and on society at large. Many banks have

developed a bank-wide mechanism that can properly assess the cost of taking specific risks. Such a

mechanism is called risk capital (see, e.g., Matten (2000)). For a bank, risk capital is the amount of capital

                                                     24
the bank requires to support the risks it takes so that as a whole its level of risk meets its risk appetite. As

a unit of the bank takes a risk, the bank can keep its aggregate level of risk by acquiring more equity

capital to support its risk taking. This greater equity capital has a cost. This cost should be taken into

account when taking the risk. Taking into account this equity capital cost may mean that it is no longer

worthwhile to take the risk. If a bank does not force executives to take into account the cost of their risk-

taking for the bank as a whole, all the burden of limiting risk will be borne by risk management. Such an

approach is problematic for at least two reasons. First, it means that risk limits end up running the lines of

business as the lines of business have no reason to internalize the cost of risk. Second, when risk is

managed mostly through limits, the risk capacity of the bank is used less efficiently – risk-bearing

capacity becomes allocated more through rationing rather than through the price mechanism.

    Incentives should be set right, but incentives have limits. It is not possible to set up an incentive plan

that is so precisely calibrated that it leads executives to take the right actions in every situation.

Executives have to deal with situations that nobody contemplated. Employment contracts are by their

very nature incomplete. A further issue is that not all risks can be quantified or defined. As a bank focuses

on specific risks that it quantifies and can account for in employee reviews and incentive plans, there is an

incentive for employees to take risks that are not quantified and monitored.

    Because of the limits of risk management and incentives, the ability of a firm to manage risk properly

depends on its corporate culture as well. There is a large organizational behavior literature on corporate

culture and a smaller one in economics (for a recent review, see Bouwman (2013)). Within a corporation,

culture is the set of shared beliefs and norms that tells people how to act when there are no formal rules.

An often-used definition of corporate culture from the organizational behavior literature is that an

organization’s culture is “a system of shared values (that define what is important) and norms that define

appropriate attitudes and behaviors for organizational members (how to feel and behave).” (O’Reilly and

Chatman (1996)). An important aspect of corporate culture is that it is the result of learning over time.

This aspect of culture is emphasized by the following definition of culture: “Culture is what a group

learns over a period of time as that group solves its problems of survival in an external environment and

                                                      25
its problems of internal integration.” (Schein (1990)). As a result, a culture is hard to change. It also has to

be transmitted to new hires. It may leave with key employees. Hence, a firm’s culture is not permanent.

    Within the economics literature, culture is a mechanism that makes the corporation more efficient

because it simplifies communication and facilitates decisions. From this perspective, having a strong

culture has important fixed costs but it decreases marginal cost (Hermalin (2001)). The organizational

behavior literature is more focused on characterizing a firm’s culture, so that it has various typologies of

corporate cultures. With this approach, different organizations have different cultures and an organization

may not necessarily have the culture that maximizes shareholder wealth or ensures the success of the

organization. For instance, Cartwright and Cooper (1993) distinguish between a role-oriented culture,

which is very bureaucratic and centralized, a task/achievement-oriented culture, which emphasizes team

work and execution, a power-oriented culture, which is highly centralized and focuses on respect of

authority, and finally a person/support-oriented culture, which is egalitarian and nurtures personal growth.

    There is limited empirical work on the relation between culture and corporate outcomes. A reason for

this limited empirical work is that it is difficult to measure the dimensions of culture. As one author put it

more than twenty years ago, “Organization culture is a complex phenomenon, and we should not rush to

measure things until we understand better what we are measuring.” (Schein (1990)). Two recent studies

have used data from companies that conduct surveys of employees at companies to provide information

on how attractive these companies are as a place of work. Guiso, Sapienza, and Zingales (2013) show that

companies where managers are viewed as trustworthy and ethical have higher valuations and higher

profitability. Popadak (2013) finds that improvements in shareholder governance change a firm’s culture,

in that it becomes more results-oriented but less customer-oriented and employee integrity falls. In that

study, shareholders gain initially from the better governance, but these gains are partly offset over time

because of the change in the culture of the firm.

    The literature on culture does not focus on risk-taking or, for that matter, on the issues that are unique

to the financial industry. An exception is Fahlenbrach, Prilmeier, and Stulz (2012). They do not use a

direct measure of culture. Instead, they show that latent characteristics of banks, which could be explained

                                                      26
by culture, are helpful to understand how crises affect banks. Specifically, they show that the performance

of a bank in the crisis of 1998 helps understand the performance of the bank in the recent crisis. This

effect is of the same magnitude in helping to understand bank performance as bank leverage.

    Firms in the financial industry differ from other firms in the extent to which employees typically

make decisions regarding risk. A loan officer who can decide whether a loan is granted makes a decision

to take a risk. She may have information about that risk that nobody else has in the organization. Nobody

may ever know whether the decision was right from the perspective of the firm for a number of reasons.

First, it may not be possible for the loan officer to communicate credibly information that she had.

Second, the loan officer may have incentives to grant loans that she knows should not be granted. Third,

loan outcomes are of limited use since expected defaults are not zero. A solution for the bank is to

minimize the discretion of the loan officer by relying on statistical models for the decision. However,

such a solution can be costly as it reduces flexibility and eliminates the use of soft information that can be

valuable. A bank’s culture can constrain loan officer discretion in a way that leads to better outcomes for

the bank. A bank with an underwriting culture that is highly focused on the interests of the bank will

make it harder for a loan officer to deviate from the social norms within the bank as employees who are in

contact with the loan officer might be able to assess when the officer deviates from the bank’s norms in a

way that neither risk managers nor executives could.

    Another example where a corporate culture can make risk management more effective is with respect

to acceptable interactions with risk managers. If the social norm is for traders to be confrontational when

questioned, it is much harder for risk managers to assess correctly the risk of positions and how to

mitigate this risk. In this case, the energy of risk managers has to be devoted to fighting with traders and

figuring out what they might be hiding.

    A final example involves how employees use information about risk that they discover through

routine interactions. Consider a situation where an executive observes a trader on a desk that he is not

responsible for take a position that can’t be expected to be profitable for the firm but might be very

valuable to the trader if it pays off. For some reason, the supervisor of the trader either does not

                                                     27
understand the position or does not care. The position breaches no limits, so that risk management has not

investigated it. Depending on the firm’s culture, the executive could act very differently. In some firms,

he would say nothing. In other firms, he would start a dialogue with the supervisor or the trader. In the

latter firms, one would expect risk taking to be more likely to increase value.

    As far as I know, only Sorensen (2002) has examined implications of corporate culture for risk

outcomes. Sorensen predicts that a strong culture, by which he means strong agreement within a firm on

shared values and norms, leads to more consistency. In other words, culture is a control mechanism. With

a stronger control mechanism, there should be less variability in outcomes. His study examines the

volatility of unexpected performance on measures of culture strength. He finds a strong negative relation

between the volatility of unexpected performance and culture strength. Unfortunately, his sample has no

firms from the financial industry.



7. Conclusion

    The success of banks and the health of the financial system depend critically on how they take risks.

A bank’s ability to measure and manage risks creates value for shareholders. There is no simple recipe

that enables a bank to measure and manage risks better. For risk-taking to maximize shareholder wealth, a

bank has to have the right risk management but also the right governance, the right incentives, and the

right culture. An organization of risk management that is optimal for one bank may be suboptimal for

another. Ultimately, the success of risk management in performing its functions depends on the corporate

environment and its ability to shape that environment. However, while better risk management should

lead to better risk taking, there is no reason for a bank with good risk management to have low risk.
