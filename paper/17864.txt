                                              ABSTRACT

A recent literature has introduced heterogeneous firms into models of international trade. This literature
has adopted the convention of treating individual firms as points on a continuum. While the continuum
offers many advantages this convenience comes at some cost: (1) Shocks to individual firms can never
have an aggregate effect. (2) It is hard to reconcile the small (sometimes zero) number of firms engaged
in selling from one country to another with a continuum. (3) For such models to deliver finite solutions
for aggregates, such as the price index, requires restrictions on parameter values that may not hold
in the data. We show how a standard heterogeneous-firm trade model can be amended to allow for
only an integer number of firms. The model overcomes the deficiencies of the continuum model enumerated
above. Taking the model to aggregate data on bilateral trade in manufactures among 92 countries and
to firm-level export data for a much narrower sample shows that it accounts for both the large share
of a small number of firms in sales around the world and for zeros in bilateral trade data while maintaining
the good fit of the standard gravity equation among country pairs with thick trade volumes. Randomness
at the firm level adds substantially to aggregate variability.

1         Introduction

The field of international trade has advanced in the past decade through a healthy exchange

between new observations on firms in export markets and new theories that have introduced

producer heterogeneity into trade models. As a result, we now have general equilibrium

theories of trade that are consistent with various dimensions of both the aggregate and the

firm-level data. Furthermore, we have a much better sense of the magnitudes of key parameters

underlying these theories.1

        This flurry of activity at the firm level has left the core aggregate relationships between

trade, factor costs, and welfare largely untouched, however. While we now have much better

micro foundations for aggregate trade models, their predictions are much like those of the Arm-

ington model, for years a workhorse of quantitative international trade. Arkolakis, Costinot,

and Rodríguez-Clare (2010) emphasize this (lack of) implication of the recent literature for

aggregate trade.

        We argue that a primary reason why models of heterogeneous producers deliver so little

in the way of modification of how we think about aggregates is the device, initiated in the

trade literature by Dornbusch, Fischer, and Samuelson (1977), of treating the set of products

as a continuum. The heterogeneous firm literature embraced this approach, applying it to

individual producers.

        Treating individual producers as points on a continuum has a number of extremely con-

venient implications that the field (including work by authors of this paper) has exploited

relentlessly. For one thing, since each producer has measure zero, it has no eﬀect on aggre-

gates. Invoking the law of large numbers, we are free to model what goes on at the aggregate

level as driven by the parameters (which may be small in number) governing the distribu-

tions of the outcomes aﬀecting individual units, but not on the realizations of those outcomes

themselves. With the right distributional assumptions about the processes underlying the

outcomes of individual firms, one can readily integrate over them to get simple and familiar

aggregate relationships. The continuum thus provides a wall of separation between smooth

aggregate relationships and potentially jagged heterogeneity underneath, allowing us to deal

with each realm in isolation.

   Of course, the number of producers or products is not literally a continuum. But are

they so numerous that treating them as a continuum is an innocuous simplification? For

many purposes it undoubtedly is. But there are questions for which the continuum can lead

us astray. For one thing, some individual producers may indeed loom so large that their

own individual fates have implications for the economy as a whole. For another, under the

continuum assumption, anything that can happen (within the support of what is modeled as

possible), will happen. An implication, for example, is that if we observe no exports from one

country to another, as we often do, then exporting was impossible, not that it just so happened

that no firm found exporting worthwhile. A third limitation is that obtaining well-behaved

integrals across the continuum requires restrictions on distributional parameters that prevent

the size distribution of firms from becoming too skewed. The skewness observed in the data

is uncomfortably close to the limits imposed by these parameter restrictions.

   Here we explore the implications of having only a finite number (sometimes zero) of firms

exporting. We develop a variant of a standard model of firm participation in exporting in



                                              2
which the number of firms is an integer. The model confronts each of the issues above: (i)

Under parameter values consistent with the data, randomness in the situations of individual

firms translates into substantial randomness in such aggregates as the price index. (ii) The

model predicts zero trade flows, with a frequency similar to what we see in the data, simply

because no firm happened to be eﬃcient enough, not because it was impossible for any firm

whatever its luck of the draw. (iii) Our finite-firm model can handily deal with parameter

values consistent with any degree of skewness in the firm-size distribution.

   We use our model to perform a series of quantitative exercises. We first derive the model’s

implication for the specification of a gravity equation. Estimating this equation with aggre-

gate bilateral trade and production data delivers estimates of the parameters governing the

probability of a firm from each source entering each destination. We then take the model to

firm-level data to learn about the cost of entry in diﬀerent markets (and the other remaining

parameters). With a fully parameterized version of the model in hand we conduct two exper-

iments. The first addresses the zeros issue. A simulation of 10 percent lower trade barriers

worldwide introduces 206 new bilateral trading relationships (although the amount of trade

involved is tiny). The second gets to the heart of the law of large numbers question. We find

that resampling repeatedly the eﬃciencies of individual firms around the world generates a

variance (of percentage deviations) in the manufacturing price index for the United States of

14 and for Denmark of 24, far from the zero implied by a continuum model.

   Our paper deals with a particular situation in which an aggregate relationship (here a

bilateral trade flow) is the outcome of decisions by heterogeneous individual agents (here

of firms about whether and how much to export to a destination). But the issues it raises



                                              3
apply to any aggregate variable (e.g., consumption or investment) whose magnitude is the

summation of what a diverse set of individuals choose to do, which may include nothing.

    The paper proceeds as follows. We begin with a review of related literature followed by

an overview of some key features of the trade data. Next, we introduce our finite-firm model

which underlies the estimation approach that follows. We then confront the model with the

data introduced in the previous section.




2     Related Literature

Our paper relates closely to another literature that has emphasized the importance of indi-

vidual firms in aggregate models. Gabaix (2011) uses such a structure to explain aggregate

fluctuations due to shocks to very large firms in the economy. This analysis is extended to

international trade by Canals, Gabaix, Vilarrubia, and Weinstein (2007) and di Giovanni

and Levchenko (2009), again highlighting the role of very large firms in generating aggregate

fluctuations.

    The literature on zeros in the bilateral trade data includes Eaton and Tamura (1994), San-

tos Silva and Tenreyro (2006), Armenter and Koren (2008), Helpman, Melitz, and Rubinstein

(2008), Martin and Pham (2008), and Baldwin and Harrigan (2009). Our underlying model

of trade relates closely to Helpman, Melitz, and Rubinstein (2008), but instead of obtaining

zeros by truncating a continuous Pareto distribution of eﬃciencies from above, zeros arise in

our model because, as in reality, the number of firms is finite. Like us, Armenter and Koren

(2008) assume a finite number of firms, stressing, as we do, the importance of the sparsity of

the trade data in explaining zeros. Theirs, however, is a purely probabilistic rather than an


                                              4
economic model.2

        Our work also touches on Balistreri, Hillberry, and Rutherford (2011). That paper dis-

cusses both estimation and general equilibrium simulation of a heterogeneous firm model

similar to the one we consider here. It does not, however, draw out the implications of a finite

number of firms, which is our main contribution.




3         The Data

We use macro and micro data on bilateral trade in manufactures among 92 countries. The

macro data are aggregate bilateral trade flows (in U.S. Dollars) of manufactures  from

source country  to destination country  in 1992, from Feenstra, Lipsey, and Bowen (1997).

The micro data are firm-level exports to destination  for four exporting countries . The

eﬀorts of many researchers, exploiting customs records, are making such data more widely

available. We were generously provided micro data for exports from Brazil, France, Denmark,

and Uruguay.3 The micro data allow us to measure the number  of firms from  selling

in  as well as mean sales per firm   when  is reported as positive.4 In merging the
    2
        Mariscal (2010) shows that the Armenter and Koren approach also goes a long way in explaining multi-

national expansion patterns.
    3
        The French data for manufacturing firms in 1992 are from Eaton, Kortum, and Kramarz (2011). The

Danish data for all exporting firms in 1993 are from Pedersen (2009). The Brazilian data for manufactured

exports in 1992 are from Arkolakis and Muendler (2010). The Uruguayan data for 1992 and 1993 were compiled

by Raul Sampognaro. (Figure 1, below, includes only the 1992 data for Uruguay.).
    4
        We cannot always tell in the micro export data if the lack of any reported exporter to a particular

destination means zero exports there or that the particular destination was not in the dataset. Hence our

approach, which exploits the micro data only when   0, leaves the interpretation open.



                                                       5
data, we chose our 92 countries for the macro-level analysis in order to have observations at

the firm level from at least two of our four sources.

       Table 1 lists our 92 countries and each country’s exports of manufactures to and imports

of manufactures from the other 91. The last two columns display the number of destinations

for each country’s exports and the number of sources for its imports (each out of a maximum

of 91). Not surprisingly, a country trades with a greater number of others when it trades more

in total. Nonetheless, the number of zero trade links is large, making up over one-third of the

8372 bilateral observations.

       The average number of positive bilateral trade flows per country, either as an exporter or

as an importer, is 59.6. The variance of the number of export destinations, however, is 652.5

while the variance of the number of import sources is only 283.6. As discussed below, our

analysis provides an explanation for the large deviation between the variances.

       For country pairs for which   0, Figure 1 plots  against  on log scales, with

source countries labeled by the first letter of the country name. The data cluster around a

positively-sloped line, with no apparent diﬀerences across the four source countries.5

       Where exporting does occur, how important are very large firms? Using detailed data on

French firms in 1986, we order exporters according to their total exports.6 Table 2 reports
   5
       The regression slope is 071 (standard error 017), slightly higher than the 065 Eaton, Kortum, and

Kramarz (EKK, 2011) found for French firms in 1986. Allowing for source-specific intercepts (which diﬀer

significantly from a common intercept), we cannot reject the hypothesis of a common slope of 062 (standard

error of 003).
   6
       The sample consists of 34,035 French exporters, described in EKK (2011). We consider exports to the

112 destinations reported in that paper. Canals, Gabaix, Vilarrubia, and Weinstein (2007) report results for

Japanese exporters very similar to those in Table 2 for France.

the contribution to total French exports of the top 10, 100, 1000, and 10,000 largest French

exporters. The 100 largest exporters account for nearly half of total exports, nearly half of

which is due to just the top 10 exporters. These same firms are the main contributors to

French exports to individual destinations as well. For example, Table 2 shows that the top

100 French exporters account for more than half of French exports both to the United States

and to Denmark. While the United States and Denmark are typical, the last column of the

table shows that these statistics do vary quite a bit from country to country.




4     A Finite-Firm Model of Trade

Our framework relates closely to work on trade with heterogeneous firms in Melitz (2003),

Chaney (2008), and Eaton, Kortum, and Kramarz (EKK, 2011). The key diﬀerence is that we

treat the range of potential technologies for these firms not as a continuum but as an integer.

While some results from the existing work survive, others do not. We show the diﬃculties

introduced by dropping the continuum and an approach to overcoming them. To highlight the

similarities and diﬀerences, we report established results from the continuum case in parallel

with our finite-firm variant.



4.1    Technology

As in the recent literature (but also close to the basic Ricardian model of international trade),

our basic unit of analysis is a technology for producing a unique good. We represent technology




                                               7
by the quantity  of output produced by a unit of labor.7 We refer to  as the eﬃciency

of the technology. We call the owner of this technology a firm, even though, in equilibrium,

many of these “firms” will be inactive.

       A standard building block in modeling firm heterogeneity is the Pareto distribution of firm

eﬃciency. We follow this tradition in assuming that, for any given firm, conditional on its

eﬃciency exceeding some threshold   0 its eﬃciency is the realization of a random variable

 drawn from a Pareto distribution with parameter   0 so that:


                                          Pr[  | ≥ ] = ()−                                            (1)


The Pareto distribution has a number of properties that make it analytically very tractable.8

Moreover, for reasons that have been discussed by Simon and Bonini (1958), Gabaix (1999),

and Luttmer (2011), the relevant data (e.g., firm size distributions) often exhibit Pareto

properties, at least in the upper tail.
   7
       A higher  can mean: (1) more of a product, (2) the same amount of a better product, or (3) any

combination of the first two that renders the output of the good produced by a worker more valuable. For

the results here the diﬀerent interpretations have isomorphic implications. Here “labor” can be interpreted

to mean an arbitrary bundle of factors and the “wage” the price of that bundle, common across all goods .

Eaton and Kortum (2002) and EKK (2011) make the input bundle a Cobb-Douglas combination of labor and

intermediates, an extension we do not pursue here.
   8
       To list a few of them: (i) Integrating across functions weighted by the Pareto distribution often yields sim-

ple closed-form solutions. Hence, for example, if a continuum of firms are charging prices that are distributed

Pareto, under standard assumptions about preferences, a closed-form solution for the price index emerges. (ii)

Trunctating the Pareto distribution from below yields a Pareto distribution with the same shape parameter

. Hence, as is the case here, if entry is subject to an endogenous cutoﬀ, the distribution of the technologies

that make the cut remains Pareto. (iii) A Pareto random variable taken to a power is also Pareto. Hence, if

individual prices have a Pareto distribution, with a constant elasticity of demand, so do sales.

4.1.1       Continuum Case


With a continuum of firms, the measure of firms with eﬃciency greater than  is thus pro-

portional to  −  Hence we can write the measure of firms in country  with eﬃciency  ≥ 

as:

                                                    () =   −                                                         (2)

where   0 is a parameter reflecting the overall measure of firms in country 


4.1.2       Finite-Firm Case


We propose an alternative in which, instead, each country  has access to an integer number

of technologies, with the number having eﬃciency  ≥  the realization of a Poisson random

variable with parameter  () =   − (instead of a measure  ()).9 It will be useful to rank
                                                                       (1)      (2)       (3)               ()
these technologies according to their eﬃciency, i.e.,                                               .10
   9
       In either specification the level of  may reflect a history of innovation, as discussed in Eaton and Kortum

(2010, Chapter 4). Furthermore,  can be set arbitrarily close to zero. For the finite-firm case, for example,

consider taking  draws from the Pareto distribution (1), where  is distributed Poisson with parameter

  − . The number of draws for which    is distributed Poisson with parameter   − as we assume above.

The largest , call it  (1)  is distributed:


                                             Pr[ (1) ≤ ] = exp(−  − )


the type II extreme value (Fréchet) distribution. Letting  approach zero, as we will throughout this paper,

this distribution is defined over all positive values of .
  10
       In the Ricardian model of Eaton and Kortum (2002), all technologies in this sequence would be used to
                                                                                    (1)
produce the same good , so that if country  produces good  it uses  , with all the rest irrelevant. The
                                                                                                    (2)
same is true of production in Bernard, Eaton, Jensen, and Kortum (2003), although                       can be relevant in

determining the price of good . In each of these models, as in Dornbusch, Fischer, and Samuelson (1977),



                                                           9
4.2        Costs

We introduce impediments to trade in a standard way: Selling a unit of a good to market 

from source  requires exporting  ≥ 1 units, where we set  = 1 for all  It also requires

hiring a fixed number  workers in market , which we allow to vary by  but, for simplicity,

keep independent of 11

       Denote the wage in country  as   Then a potential producer from country  with eﬃciency

 can sell in country  at a unit cost:

                                                         
                                                =           
                                                         


4.2.1       Continuum Case


Under the continuum specification (2), the measure of firms from country  that can sell in

country  at unit cost  ≤  is:

                                                           
                                                () = Φ  



where:

                                            Φ =  (  )−                                          (3)
the space of goods is  ∈ [0 1] In our finite-firm model here, as in models of monopolistic competition, each

by the number of firms that are active in country .
  11
       As we discuss below, the data that we have handle a cost that is common across sources with relative

equanimity, but balk at the imposition of an entry cost that is common across destinations. Since assuming a

cost that is the same for all entrants in a market yields some simplification, we take that route here. Chaney

(2008) and EKK (2011) show how to relax it.

assumption that demand derives from an aggregator with a constant elasticity of substitution

   Under these assumptions a firm selling in market  with a unit cost  charging a price 

makes a profit in that market, gross of the entry cost  =   , of:

4.3.1    Continuum Case


In the case of a continuum of firms, each firm, no matter how eﬃcient, has no eﬀect on the

overall price index   It therefore sets a price  () to maximize (6) taking  as given, so

chooses the standard Dixit-Stiglitz markup:

   Variable profit is decreasing in unit cost  Hence firms will enter market  up to the point

at which their unit cost implies zero profit (net of the fixed entry cost), at a cost threshold 

and cutoﬀ:

   Without the restriction (9), however, the price index and cutoﬀ are undefined. The reason

is that technological heterogeneity and the elasticity of substitution are so large that buyers

achieve zero cost by squeezing all their spending into the lower tail of the cost distribution.

Hence it is standard in models with a continuum of goods to impose a restriction like (9).

Note that the restriction (9) prevents this parameter from falling to one or below. Hence

the model cannot predict a highly skewed sales distribution without wandering into forbidden

territory.


4.3.2       Finite-Firm Case


With only an integer number of firms the restriction (9) is not needed as at no point do we

integrate over the distribution of prices. Solving for the equilibrium is less straightforward,

however. In the continuum model an individual firm (being of measure zero) naturally takes

aggregate spending   the wage   and the price index  as given in deciding what price

to charge and whether or not to enter.

       Not to introduce too many complications at once, we continue to assume that firms take

       The sales of a firm with cost  ≤  is

while the distribution of costs for such firms is
                                                                               µ        ¶

Combining these results, using (7), yields (10). The expected sales of a firm in market  is:

expenditure  and the wage  as given, but incorporate the eﬀect of their decisions on the

       We treat equilibrium in any market as determined in two stages.

       In stage two the number of firms  entering into each market is given. The firms present

in each market engage in Bertrand competition there. This competition establishes a price

associated with each unit cost  denoted  ()14 Gross profit in market  of a firm with

unit cost  is:

where now the price index is:

                                         =1

  13
       A huge benefit of treating  and  as unaﬀected by firms’ entry and price decisions is that we can

analyze equilibrium in each market separately. Otherwise, a pricing or entry decision in any market would

aﬀect sales and wages in every country of the world, making the equilibrium very hard to compute. Various

assumptions can justify our treatment of  and  as exogenous to the entry decision, all of them inelegant.

One is that wages are determined by trade in a diﬀerent sector. A second that profits are all spent on output

from a diﬀerent sector. We can then set  =   where  is the labor force in country  and  is

the Cobb-Douglas share of manufactures in workers’ spending. The first assumption has a tradition in this

literature, having been one of the cases considered in Eaton and Kortum (2002), and it appears in Chaney

(2008) and Melitz and Ottaviano (2008). We believe the second is original to us. We hope that future research

will explore the implications of more attractive assumptions, but don’t expect results to diﬀer much from those

here.

       In fact the price chosen by each firm in Bertrand equilibrium in market  depends on the unit costs of

all firms present there. We list only the firm’s own unit cost  as an argument of  since two firms which

happened to have the same  (a probability zero event) would charge the same price  ()

The following (unsurprising) result, which we call profit monotonicity, is useful in nailing down

       An outline of the proof is as follows. The first thing to note is that in any Bertrand equilibrium


                                          Π+1
                                              ((+1) ) ≤ Π+1
                                                                (() )

                                                   ()
The reason is that the firm with unit cost             could always earn a higher profit than the firm with cost
 (+1)
         simply by charging the same price as that firm (hence selling the same quantity at a lower cost).
                                                                                (+1)
The second is to show that removing the firm with unit cost                           raises the profit of all remaining firms.

Consider the profit of the ’th firm as a function of the price of each entrant (not necessarily its equilibrium
                                  ³                   ´

price arbitrarily. That the profit of all remaining firms rises follows from the fact that both

for 0 6=  The first inequality implies that a higher price on the part of a rival raises profit and the second

that a higher price by a rival raises the price charged by any other firm. Hence a higher price from the firm

                                                                16
       In the first stage firms decide whether or not to enter each market. To avoid uninteresting

multiple equilibria we assume that they make their entry decisions sequentially, starting with
                                                (1)                                                (2)
the firm with the lowest unit cost   followed by the firm with unit cost   etc.16 Each

firm when making its decision to enter anticipates perfectly what its profit would be in the

subsequent second-stage Bertrand equilibrium.

       An immediate implication of profit monotonicity (12) is that the two conditions:


                                                 Π   ( )

and:

                                              Π
                                               

                                                      (( +1) )   

                                                                                                         (+1 )
determine  . Firms will enter up to the point at which the firm with unit cost                                 would

not be able to cover its entry cost.17

       We have now completed the statement of the finite-firm model. With a finite number
                   (+1)
with unit cost           causes every other firm to raise its price, which raises the profit of all remaining firms,
                                                ()              (+1)
including that of the firm with unit cost  . Letting                 rise without bound:


                                              Π+1
                                                  (() ) ≤ Π   ()
                                                                ( )



Combining these two profit inequalities delivers the profit monotonicity result (12).
  16
       With a discrete number of firms a possible outcome is entry by one or more less eﬃcient firms blocking a

more eﬃcient one from entering. With a continuum of firms this possibility does not arise as no firm has any

eﬀect on the aggregate outcome.
  17
       To avoid the outcome  = 0 (in which case we could not have taken  as given) we assume  ≥  .

A possible outcome is  = 1, in which case the monopolist charges a price approaching infinity, supplies a
                                                                (1)
quantity approaching 0, and obtains gross profit of Π1 ( ) =  . In sections below we fit the model to data

and simulate entry. Not surprisingly, with realistic parameter values the monopoly outcome never comes close

to happening.

The total number of firms from  entering  is thus:

       We conclude with three implications of the discrete model important for the quantitative

analysis that follows.


   1. The probability   that a firm selling in country  is from country  is independent of
                                            ()                                                     ()
         its rank  or its unit cost  in market , and hence of its sales there,  .


   2. Since the number of firms  from  selling in  is determined by a finite number of

         Bernoulli trials, zero is a possibility.


   3. Unlike the continuum model, we need no restrictions on  and  other than   0 and

           1

       Note that the definition of the price index ensures that the sales of each entrant sum to total spending:

5     Quantification

Our goal is to see if our finite-firm model can capture patterns of trade at both the aggregate

and the firm level. We proceed in five steps which culminate in a fully-parameterized version

of the finite-firm model:


    1. We specify a gravity equation consistent with our firm-level model, which we estimate

       using data on bilateral trade in manufactures. This step gives us estimates of the market

       entry probability   given in (5).


    2. We use firm-level data to extract an estimate of mean sales per firm   in each market 

       from which we can estimate total entry  =     Our estimates of   and  allow

       us to calculate the probability of zero exports from each source  to each destination 


    3. We construct cost draws which allow us to simulate a whole matrix of entry by firms

       from each source  in each destination .


    4. We use these cost draws to calculate the Bertrand equilibrium in each destination. This

       calculation yields the sales distribution of firms across markets.


    5. We infer entry costs   which completes the parameterization.


    At the completion of the fifth step we will be fully armed to perform the counterfactuals

of the subsequent section.




                                                19
5.1    The Gravity Equation

The gravity equation has a long and successful history of capturing empirically how much one

country sells to another. A standard formulation is:

                                                            
                                                =
                                                            

where  is production in the exporting country  and  is the distance from  to  While

there has been much progress in deriving such an equation (suitably modified) from theories

of trade, an important remaining issue in taking this equation to data is the specification of

the error term.

   Our finite-firm model implies that randomness can emerge from two sources. First, given

the provenance of firms that have entered a market, firms from some source might have drawn

particularly low ’s, and thus sell more. Second, given the expectation   that a firm in  is

from  firms from  might have had particularly lucky rolls of the die, so have a larger than

expected presence in 

   To capture these two sources of error divide each side of (15) by total expenditure on

manufactures (absorption) in market  and take the expectations of each side to get:

                                                           =1

The first implication of our model enumerated above, that the probability of a firm being
                                    ()
from  is independent of  and  , allows us to write this expression as:
                                     ∙   ¸          "        #
                                                  X   ()
                                                         
                                          =                
                                                   =1
                                                          


Since the remaining summation is over all firms selling in  it is identically 1 (and hence its


                                                      20

the expectation of country ’s market share in  is the probability that any particular firm in

 is from 

      We can use equations (3), (4), and (5) to connect   to our model, and write it as a

multinomial logit function:
                           ∙  ¸
                                      exp (ln  −  ln  −  ln  )
                               =  = P                                                     (17)

Equation (17) is the basis of our gravity estimation, with   measured by actual trade

shares. We parameterize the right-hand side of (17) as follows. We set:


                                             = ln  −  ln  


capturing source-specific determinants of trade as a fixed eﬀect. We use geographical measures

to capture the costs of exporting from  to  Specifically, for  6=  we set:

                                                       0
                                     − ln  =  +   + ln   


Here  is a destination fixed eﬀect capturing diﬀerences in openness to imports and 

a vector of observables potentially raising trade costs (in our case the log of distance and

indicators for lack of a common border, lack of a common language, lack of a common legal

origin, lack of a common colonizer, and lack of colonial ties).19 Since these indicators are

unlikely to reflect all aspects of trade costs, we also introduce an unobservable component of

trade costs   (with   = 1 since  = 1).
 19
      These variables are from Head, Mayer, and Ries (2010), available on the CEPII web site.

       We now have an additional source of randomness. The connection between observables

and   is itself random.20

       To obtain an expression suitable for estimation we define:
                                         ½                  0
                                             exp( +  +  )                  6= 
                                  =                                                   
                                                   exp( )                       =

and:
                                                        
                                                 Λ = P  
                                                          

We can then write:
                                                          
                                                  = P                                               (18)

To apply a standard estimation procedure we need   to have the property that:
                                                      ∙        ¯ ¸
                                                      ¯¯
                                    [ |Λ] =  P            ¯ Λ = Λ                                 (19)
                                                       


where conditioning on the observables Λ means that the   are treated as random variables.

Thus, constructing Λ from the true parameters and observables delivers an unbiased predic-

tor of   21
  20
       An analogy is the likelihood of a 3 from a roll of a die with unknown bias. There is randomness not only

due to multinomial sampling but also due to the uncertainty of the bias. Our error term   introduces such

bias. We will assume that the distribution of   is such that there is no ex-ante bias.
  21
       One way to construct   that satisfy (19) is based on the gamma distribution. Recall that a random

variable  is distributed Gamma( ) (with mean  and variance 2 ) if its distribution is:

                                                              Z    
                                                  1
                                     Pr[ ≤ ] =                         −1 exp(−)
                                                 Γ()          0


where:
                                                      Z   ∞
                                             Γ() =           −1 exp(−)
                                                      0

      Putting these sources of error together, the moment conditions we use for our estimation

These conditions are nonlinear in the parameters that we need to estimate. However, since the

Λ sum to one across all sources  (for any ), the parameters can be estimated quite easily

by multinomial pseudo-maximum likelihood (PML), as described in Gouriéroux, Monfort,

and Trognon (1984). We apply this estimator to our data on bilateral trade  between 92

       The results appear in the last column of Table 3 showing the coeﬃcients 

variables. In line with most gravity equations specified in a more conventional form, the

coeﬃcient on the log of distance is estimated to be near minus one.23 All of the other geography

variables have the expected negative eﬀect on trade as well. For comparison, the first two

columns of the table show estimates of the same parameters obtained by approaches that have

been used in earlier work.24 Focussing on the coeﬃcient of log distance, our results are in

between what you get by running a regression in logs (dropping observations with zero trade

flows) and what is delivered by Poisson PML.25

       In the continuum model of Eaton and Kortum (2002), instead of (16), we would have:

                                                    
                                                        = 
                                                    

(without the expectation). In that case we can write (18) as:

                                                      
                                                    = P         

Eaton and Kortum could normalize by   without violating Jensen’s inequality to obtain the specifica-

tion:
                                                      
                                                      =     
                                                     

If   0 for all country pairs (as it was in Eaton and Kortum’s OECD sample) this equation could be

estimated by OLS after taking logarithms of both sides. Closer to our approach here, and also tackling the

zeros problem, is the Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood approach taken by Santos Silva and Tenreyro (2006).
  23
       Chaney (2011) provides a theoretical explanation for this regularity.
  24
       The first column follows Eaton and Kortum (2002), in which the dependent variable is ln(  ).

While this approach can be estimated using OLS, it requires dropping observations with zero trade. The

middle column follows Santos Silva and Tenreyro (2006), applying Poisson PML, with the dependent variable

 . Neither of these other approaches is fully consistent with our finite-firm model.
  25
       One explanation for the diﬀerent results is that the three estimation approaches apply very diﬀerent

they predict a positive trade flow even when none is observed in the data.



5.2     Mean Sales per Firm

Since we assume the cost of entry  does not vary with the source country , our model

implies that, in expectation, mean sales in a destination should be the same for all :


                                               [  ] = [  ]


We can exploit this restriction to estimate mean sales   of firms in a market using our limited

firm-level data. To do so we pool our data on sales across our four source countries (Brazil,

Denmark, France, and Uruguay). As described above, we restrict ourselves to destinations for
penalties to deviations between model and data for large and small trade flows. By taking logs, the approach

in the first column treats proportional deviations as equally likely across all observations. At the other extreme,

Poisson PML applies a much greater penalty to a given proportional deviation in a large trade flow than in a

small one (since a proportional deviation from the mean becomes less likely for a Poisson distributed random

variable as the mean is increased). Our current approach is in between. Our dependent variable normalizes

bilateral trade flows by the importers’ total absorption, thus eliminating diﬀerent penalties for proportional

deviations across large and small trade flows, to the extent that they vary with the size of the destination. Yet

our approach is more like Poisson PML in that that proportional deviations from a large exporting country

are much less likely than for a small exporter.

which we have data from at least two sources.26 Our estimate of mean sales is simply:

African Republic to $1.6 million in the United States, with an elasticity with respect total

       We drop the home-country observations (when available), since the universe of firms selling in the home

market is typically measured very diﬀerently. The customs data tell us the number of exporters and their sales

in a foreign market. The total number of active firms in a country is more diﬃcult to tie down since many

may not be counted. Since there are so few exporters from Uruguay, we merge the data for that country in

1992 and 1993.
  27
       To gauge the plausibility of our restriction that  =  , we examine whether mean sales   of our four

source countries (which are diverse in economic size and development) diﬀer among each other in a systematic

way. We run a weighted OLS regression of the unbalanced panel   on a full set of destination country eﬀects
                                               b )2 , correct for the fact that the observations are averages
and source country eﬀects. (The weights,  ( 


over diﬀerent numbers of firms, and destination countries diﬀer in mean sales.) Table 5 reports the source-

specific intercepts (relative to France, which is normalized to zero). The estimates imply modest variation

across sources, with Brazil’s mean sales about $70,000 higher than France while Denmark’s and Uruguay’s are

about $25,000 lower. While we can easily reject the joint hypothesis of equal mean sales by source, the small

magnitude of the deviations suggests we will not do great violence to the data by simply ignoring them.
  28
       The slope in Figure 1 implied that exports per firm rise with a country’s total exports with an elasticity

of 029. As is known from the gravity literature, total exports increase with destination expenditures with an

elasticity close to one, so the two results are very much in line.

which we evaluate at  =               b 29 Figure 2a reports a histogram with the

predicted probability of zero trade along the horizontal axis and the frequency of observations

with that predicted probability on the vertical axis, for all country pairs in which  = 0

(Figure 2b reports the corresponding histogram for pairs in which   0). While we predict

a low probability of zero trade when there is in fact trade (Figure 2b), we sometimes also

predict a low probability of zero trade even when there is no trade (Figure 2a). Including

trade cost shocks helps a little in reducing the errors in Figure 2a.

         We can also use equation (21) to simulate the number of export destinations and import

sources for each country (the actual values are shown in the last two columns of Table 1).30
   29
         We can also incorporate   ’s along the lines proposed in footnote 16 as follows. Our assumptions there

imply that the vector of   ’s for each destination  are distributed Dirichlet(Λ1  2  Λ2 2   Λ 2 ). The

corresponding marginal distribution for any source  is distributed Beta(Λ 2  (1 − Λ ) 2 ) The probability

         A simulation proceeds as follows, letting  denote the left hand side of (21). Draw  independently for


                                                                27
The simulated average number of unidirectional trade links per country is 70.5 (out of a

maximum of 91), somewhat overpredicting the actual number. The simulations also fit the

fact that the variance is higher across export destinations (1077) than across import sources

(48.6), although this diﬀerence is substantially magnified relative to the data. Figures 3a and

3b provides a more detailed comparison of the simulations and the data, plotting each against

a country’s expenditure on manufactures (a convenient measure of country size). While the

model captures the basic pattern that trade links rise with country size, for small countries it

typically undershoots the number of export destinations and overshoots the number of import

sources.

    Why is our model able to predict that zeros are so much more variable across exporters

than across importers? A reason is that a country’s success in penetrating a market as an

exporter depends on the eﬃciency of its most eﬃcient firm, generating enormous correlation

across foreign markets in entry. Thus two countries with the same geography and size would

likely be very similar in terms of their ability to attract entry from other countries. But the

two countries would diﬀer enormously in their ability to penetrate foreign markets if the lead

firm in one was much more eﬃcient than the lead firm in the other. The much greater variance

in exporter zeros is thus consistent with the finite-firm model.

5.3    Simulating Unit Costs

An advantage of formulating the model in terms of an ordering of eﬃciencies and unit costs

is that we can exploit properties of order statistics to simulate these objects. In particular,
                                                                                         (1)
our model implies that the most eﬃcient firm from each source  has an eﬃciency              drawn

from the type II extreme value (Fréchet) distribution

                                                 (1)               −
                                           Pr[       ≤ ] = −  

                   (1)         (1)
It follows that        =         is distributed exponential, free of any parameters:
                                         h      i
                                           (1)
                                       Pr  ≤  = 1 − − 


We can proceed up the ordered eﬃciencies, defining
                                                        ³     ´−

for any   1. In EK (2010) we show that the spacings in this sequence also have an

exponential distribution:
                                     h               i
                                       (+1)    ()
                                   Pr      −  ≤  = 1 − − 

                                     ()
For each source  we construct           for  up to a large number  which exceeds how many we

ever need (32 million). The resulting normalized ordered costs (inversely related to eﬃciency)

for each source  are simply a random walk of length  with unit exponential increments and

an initial value drawn from a unit exponential.
                                                                                  ()
   We use these normalized ordered costs to construct ordered unit costs  of delivery to

country  by firms from , invoking (22), (5), and (3):

       In any particular destination  we can combine all the  from each source  and for all

 and then order them once again (without regard to source) to form:

                                                                       

(Note that this ordering is invariant to Φ ) These ordered costs are the basis for calculating

the Bertrand equilibrium in the next section. The source country  of any firm is irrelevant for
                                                                                            ()
calculating the Bertrand equilibrium. We nevertheless keep track of the source  for each

firm in order to calculate who sells where.



5.4        Simulating Sales

We can focus on a particular destination  since the same routine applies to each market

and our assumptions shut down any interactions between them. For a fixed  , all that is
                                                                           ()
relevant for calculating the equilibrium in market  are the  ’s and a value of  We start

with  = 298 from EKK (2011). In the continuum case our values of  and  would imply

that sales are distributed Pareto with parameter ( − 1) = 246. We also try  = 564 and

 = 709 In the continuum model the implied parameters for the sales distribution would

be 1.05 (with infinite variance) and 0.8 (with infinite mean and variance), respectively. Note

that for this last value the continuum model would explode.

results. Consider first the results with  = 298, taken from EKK (2011). In that case we

do not come close to capturing the substantial contribution (shown in Table 2) of the largest

French exporters. On the other hand, increasing  to 7.09 goes too far, with the top 100 firms

accounting for over 80 percent of French exports. The simulations with  = 564 (and hence

( − 1) = 105) match the data in Table 2 most closely. The last three columns of Table

across simulation runs, but in all cases the middle value of  delivers results that are closest

to the data.33

       We have considered a very course grid of parameter values. We leave it to future work to carry out a more

formal estimation procedure.

       We plot these values against mean sales across countries in Figures 5a. The relationship is

tight, with an elasticity close to one. Recall that in the continuum model the elasticity would

be exactly one. Figure 5b plots the entry costs against total absorption of manufactures. The

relationship is more noisy, with an elasticity of 0.29.

       We are now fully equipped to look at the implications of various changes in the environ-

ment. In particular, knowing the entry costs, we can ask how such changes would aﬀect the

number of firms active in diﬀerent markets.

With values for  we can combine our simulation of unit costs and simulation of sales from

the previous section (which were conditional on the number of entrants  ) to simulate a new

global equilibrium in which entry into each market is endogenous. We continue to use the 

       We do simulations of two types. One type examines the eﬀect of changes in exogenous

parameters, such as those governing trade costs  and competitiveness  . We do these

simulations using the same normalized cost draws  () as in the analysis above. We hold the
  ()
 ’s fixed in conducting these counterfactuals in order to isolate the role of the parameters

under consideration from changes introduced by a resampling of technology.

       Another type focusses on the sensitivity of aggregate outcomes to the technology draws of

the individual firms.34 A major part of our analysis seeks to understand the sensitivity of the

       In attempting to simulate the continuum model with a (computationally necessary) finite set of draws,

sampling error would be a nuisance that the researcher would want to minimize by sampling to the extent

allowed by her hardware and patience. In our finite-firm model sampling “error” is an integral part of the

6.1        Globalization

We begin by considering the consequence of a 10 percent decline in trade costs between

countries. This experiment is similar to one carried out in EKK (2011) using a continuum

model. In that experiment, some individual firms entered export markets and others were

driven out of their home market. In our experiment here, with a finite-firm model, entire

countries may enter new export markets. This counterfactual experiment illustrates the first

type of simulation described above, in which technology draws are held fixed as we consider

the equilibrium implications of a change in the model parameters.

       For each country pair  6=  we set the counterfactual trade cost to 0 =  11.35 The

draw.

       This change is equivalent to adding a constant  ln(11) = 0464 to each of the parameters  that appear

in the gravity equation estimated above.

evaluate the resulting counterfactual trade flows  .

   World exports rise by 43 percent due to lower trade costs, in line with results in EKK

(2011). While nearly all of this increased trade occurs within pairs of countries that were

already trading (99.9984 percent to be exact), there are still perceptible changes along the

extensive margin. Overall, 206 new trade flows emerge between country pairs for which one

had not previously exported to the other. Among countries in the lowest size quartile (mea-

sured by absorption of manufactures), the average number of export destinations increases

by nearly 12 percent, but sales in these new markets account for less than 0.2 percent of the

increase in the value of their exports.



6.2    Granularity

Our second simulation evaluates the importance for aggregate outcomes of the luck of the

technology draw at the level of individual firms. We look at variation in the manufacturing

price level at the country level and at the role of the largest global firms. This experiment

illustrates the second type of simulation in which parameters are held constant but technologies

of all potentially active firms are redrawn repeatedly, with aggregate equilibrium outcomes

recalculated for each draw.

We present the ln 0 for each simulation relative to its the mean across all 200 simulations.

   Figure 6 shows the results for two values of , the United States and Denmark. Each

point on the scatter represents the percentage deviation (log diﬀerence) of the price level for

the United States and Denmark for one of the 200 simulations. The variance for Denmark

is 24.4 compared with 14.4 for the United States. While it is notably smaller for the larger

country it remains substantial even in the largest destination. By plotting the results for both

countries in the same figure we capture the extent to which the model generates outcomes that

move together across countries due to international trade. The results do point to positive

covariation (correlation of 0.48).

   In some cases the same firm is the top firm in both the United States and Denmark, in

which case Figure 6 indicates its origin with a 3-letter abbreviation. For example, along the

northwest frontier of the scatter, the top firm in both the United States and Denmark is often

a US firm. Not surprisingly, in these cases the United States has a low price level, while

Denmark’s is not so low. On the east-by-southeast frontier of the scatter, the largest firm in

each country is often European, leading to a lower price level in Denmark than in the United

States. In one case the top firm is from Guatemala and in another Vietnam, demonstrating

the possibility of extreme outcomes in this model. For the vast majority of the observations,

the top firm in Denmark is diﬀerent than the top firm in the United States. For the United

States, a U.S. firm is at the top in 180 simulations while Denmark’s top firm is Danish in 105

simulations.

7     Conclusion

We have amended a standard heterogeneous-firm model of exporting by keeping the number

of firms finite. Our quantification of the model suggests that it can fit a number of features

of the data quite well.

    Finiteness introduces both richness and complexity. To focus on its specific contribution we

have kept our model simple in other dimensions. For one thing, we have introduced only one

dimension of firm heterogeneity, underlying eﬃciency. For another, we have not incorporated

endogenous entry costs as in Arkolakis (2010).

    As a consequence the model makes some obviously false predictions. By stripping out

additional dimensions of heterogeneity, firms from the same source will enter markets according

to a strict hierarchy (a firm will always sell in an easy to enter market if it sells in a more

diﬃcult market) and multiple firms from the same source selling in common destinations

will always rank the same in terms of relative sales in each destination. By ignoring the

endogeneity of entry costs, the model cannot account for systematic deviations from Zipf’s

law among small exporters.

    EKK (2011) show how introducing heterogeneity to a firm’s cost of entry and to its demand

in each market, and adopting Arkolakis’ formulation of endogenous entry costs, can break these

rigid predictions. With these embellishments the standard Melitz model can replicate multiple

features of the data very well (although, of course, it fails to explain how zeros can arise in the

trade data). Introducing additional sources of firm heterogeneity and endogenous entry costs

into the model developed here should serve the same purpose in loosening up this rigidity. In

addition, we conjecture that introducing these features would also improve the model’s ability


                                                37
to predict zeros among very small source countries. These additions pose modeling challenges

which we hope that future research will overcome.

   The domain of macroeconomics has been the study of aggregate relationships while indus-

trial organization has focussed on the interaction of individual firms. Our exploratory analysis

here, in building a bridge (or perhaps just a tightrope) connecting their two domains, provides
