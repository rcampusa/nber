                                          ABSTRACT

We analyze a new management survey for around 1,000 firms and 10,000 employees across two
large provinces in China. The unique aspect of this survey is it collected management data from
the CEO, a random sample of senior managers and workers. We document four main results.
First, management scores, much like productivity, have a wide spread with a long left-tail of
poorly managed firms. This distribution of management scores is similar for CEOs, senior
managers and workers management, and appears broadly reasonably compared to US scores for
similar questions. Moreover, for all groups these scores correlate with firm performance,
suggesting all employees within the firm are (at least partly) aware of the their firms’ managerial
abilities. Second, the scores across the groups are significantly cross-correlated, but far from
completely. This suggests that while different levels of the firm have similar views on the firms’
management capabilities, they do not fully agree. Third, we find that the CEO’s management
scores are the most predictive of firm performance, followed by the senior managers and then the
workers. Hence, CEOs do appear to know best about their firms management strengths and
weaknesses. Fourth, within-firm management score dispersion is negatively correlated with
investment and R&D intensity, suggesting long-run planning is linked with greater consistency in
management across levels in firms.

1     Introduction

Recently there has been a surge of interests in management within economics (Roberts, 2018),
building on a long-history of work in the field (e.g. Walker (1887)). This work has been heavily
built on management surveys across tens of thousands of firms across dozens of countries. However,
one limitation of this work is the focus on senior managers in providing managerial feedback in
these surveys. But as is well known in the sociological literature there is often a wide spread of
opinions between workers and CEOs within the same firm so that maybe workers’ evaluation of
their firms management can provide a valuable counterpart to their managers views (Ukko et al.,
2007). Moreover, is managerial disagreement an important factor in shaping firm performance?
Modern management practices have a heavy focus on standardization, which suggests alignment
of management evaluations across the firm should be associated with superior performance. On
the other hand more disagreement may highlight greater independence of workers’ views, which is
potentially associated with better firm performance.
The challenge of addressing these questions has always been how to get survey responses from
representative samples of workers? Approaching firms and asking for a random sample of workers
is not a realistic approach to eliciting random workers responses, since managers are unlikely to truly
randomly select workers. Indeed, Enterprise Surveys (2018) by the World Bank long attempted to
elicit survey responses from random samples of workers but gave up because managers typically
referred workers with more favorable views on the firm.
This paper exploits a unique survey in China that collects data from up to 11 respondees per
firm. In particular, it samples the CEO, a set of up to 3 randomly selected senior managers1 ,
and up to 7 randomly selected workers. The survey is run by a consortium of Chinese research
institutes overseen by the Quality Control Institute in Wuhan University. This institute has close
connections with the Quality Ministry in Beijing which provides mandatory quality licenses to all
Chinese manufacturing firms. With the support of the Quality Ministry and the Institute’s alumni
the survey team is able to achieve not only an 86% survey response rate, but also obtain the
employment registry at the firm in advance of these surveys so they can randomly select workers to
interview. Hence, this survey is the first management survey that collects information from three
groups - the CEO, a truly randomly sampled set of senior managers and workers. Furthermore, it
achieves this alongside an extremely high response rate of 86%, and extremely high quality survey
data collected by teams of 300 enumerators that visit firms to ensure high quality responses.2 Thus,
in summary, this is a unique survey in terms of coverage and quality.
The paper reports four key findings. First, management scores, much like productivity, have a wide
spread with a long left-tail of poorly managed firms. This distribution of management scores is
   1
     Senior managers are defined by the firm itself. Generally in small sized firms, senior managers are those in charge
of general a↵airs of the firm, sometimes, the boss can also serve as the senior manager if there are so few senior
managers. In large sized firms, senior managers are at least department directors.
   2
     Given the oversight of the Quality Control Institute it is perhaps not surprising that the survey is extremely
carefully executed. See, for example, http://www.whu.edu.cn/en/info/1031/1104.htm

similar for CEOs, senior managers and workers, and appears broadly reasonably compared to US
scores for similar questions. Moreover, for all groups these scores correlate with firm performance,
suggesting all employees within the firm are (at least partly) aware of the their firms’ manage-
rial abilities. Second, the scores across the groups are significantly cross-correlated, but far from
completely. This suggests that while di↵erent levels of the firm have similar views on the firms man-
agement capabilities, they do not fully agree. Third, we find that the CEO’s management scores
are the most predictive of firm performance, followed by the senior managers and then the workers.
Hence, CEOs do appear to know best about their firms management strengths and weaknesses.
Finally, the management scores from di↵erent people of a firm allows us to test how disagreement
among them (measured by the within-firm management score dispersion) a↵ects firm performance.
We find the dispersion of management score is negatively correlated with investment and R&D
intensity, suggesting some degree of consistency of management practices within the firm is helpful
for long-run investment.

The paper is structured with a data description in section 2, a summary of the key results in section
3 and concluding thoughts in section 4.



2     Data

The China Employer-Employee Survey (CEES) is a new longitudinal study of manufacturing firms
and workers in China. The CEES was initiated in 2014 by Hong Cheng at Wuhan University, Yang
Du at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, Hongbin Li at Stanford University (then Tsinghua
University), and Albert Park at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. The four
founders are also principal investigators (PIs) of the CEES project. The project is administered
by the China Enterprise Survey and Data Center (CESDC)3 at Wuhan University headed by Hong
Cheng and Hongbin Li.

Because China is the world’s second largest economy and often called “the world’s factory”,
economists and policy makers around the world have a keen interest in better understanding the
determinants of firm performance in China. To date, the lack of high-quality, in-depth data on
firms and workers has prevented systematic study of important issues facing China’s manufactur-
ers. Existing firm datasets have limited information or/and fail to acquire a representative sample
of firms and workers. The CEES project seeks to provide a new data source that can overcome
these limitations. The missions of CEES are to conduct the world’s most comprehensive employer-
employee survey of China, to create a longitudinal dataset that tracks changes in the situation of
    3
      CESDC was under Wuhan University Institute of Quality and Development Strategy (WHU-IQDS), which was
co-founded in 2007 by Wuhan University and the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and
Quarantine of China (AQSIQ), the supreme regulatory agency for both internationally traded and domestically sold
products in China. Hong Cheng is the founding Dean of WHU-IQDS. The Institute provides training for AQSIQ
officials at all administrative levels, and has alumni in more than half of all prefectural cities and counties in China.
Over 100, 000 government officials and entrepreneurs in 18 provinces have attended lectures of IQDS.

both employers and employees, and to create a high-quality dataset that can provide a platform
for evidence-based studies of the Chinese economy by economists and policy-makers worldwide.


2.1   Surveyed Provinces

CEES began in 2015 with a survey of firms and workers in China’s most important industrial
province, Guangdong, located on China’s coast near Hong Kong. To capture di↵erences with
China’s rising central region, a second province, Hubei, was added in 2016. The firms and workers
surveyed in Guangdong in 2015 were followed up in 2016, with new workers added to the employee
sample.

In 2015, Guangdong accounted for more manufacturing firms (0.3 million) and manufacturing
workers (9.3 million) than any province in China. The sampled districts account for 90% of gross
industrial output and 86 of employment in Guangdong’s manufacturing sector. Hubei Province has
the highest manufacturing output per capita, and employed 3.4 million manufacturing workers in
2015. The CEES surveyed districts accounting for 90% of employment in Hubei’s manufacturing
sector. In 2017, Guangdong ranks first among all Chinese provinces for GDP, export volume, and
manufacturing employment according to China Statistical Yearbook (table A4), whereas Hubei
ranks 7th in GDP, 16th in export volume, and 7th in manufacturing employment. In 2018, CEES
plans to expand to include three more provinces in regions throughout the country, including
Liaoning in the Northeast, Sichuan in the West, and Jiangsu in the East.


2.2   Stratified Sampling

Firm lists from the 3rd National Economic Census conducted in early 2014 were used as a sam-
pling frame. Sampling was conducted in two stages, each using probability proportionate-to-size
sampling, with size defined as manufacturing employment. Thus, the firm sample is representative
in terms of employment size in China. In the first stage, 20 county-level districts were randomly
sampled in each province, with probabilities proportionate to manufacturing employment in each
district. In the second stage, 50 firms were sampled in each district as a target sample, again with
probabilities proportionate to employment in each firm. Enumerators then visited the 50 firms
in sequence, and attempt to survey the first 36 eligible firms (have production activities in the
sampled district).

Employees are also randomly selected with stratification. We first asked the firm to provide a list
of all employees enrolled at the end of the previous year, with middle and high level managers
separately listed. We then randomly selected 10 employees (besides the CEO) in each firm (6        9
for smaller firms), among which 3 (2 for smaller firms) are middle and senior managers. If selected
employees cannot participate (e.g., not working on site during the survey period), they were replaced
with the closest name on the list of workers, until the targeted number of sampled employees is
reached.

                                                 4
2.3    Response Rates and Sample Sizes

In total, we collected data from 573 firms in Guangdong in 2015, and 1, 122 firms from two provinces
(Guangdong and Hubei) in 2016 (Table A1), with high response rates in both years. Among 696
firms that are eligible to be surveyed in Guangdong in 2015, the response rate in the firm baseline
survey was 82% (or 573 firms) in Guangdong in 2015. Out of the firms surveyed in 2015 in
Guangdong, 85% (or 487 firms) were successfully followed up in 2016.4 In 2016, attempts were
made to survey some firms from the original target sample that did not participate in the 2015.
This e↵ort led to an additional 50 firms participating in the survey, yielding a total sample of 537
firms in Guangdong in 2016. In 2016, we started our survey in Hubei, and successfully collected
data from 585 out of 703 targeted firms, with a response rate of 83%. Combining the samples in
both provinces, 84% of the firms were successfully interviewed in 2016.

The baseline surveys included 4, 838 workers in Guangdong in 2015 and 4, 114 workers in Hubei
in 2016 (Table A1). In both provinces, about 90% of initially sampled workers participated. In
2016, 53% of the workers surveyed in Guangdong in 2015 were successfully re-interviewed; the
relatively low follow-up rate reflected firm attrition and high worker turnover rates. Based on the
turnover rate in each firm, a sample of new workers were added to the Guangdong worker sample,
in addition to replacement samples of workers from the replacement firm sample (50 firms added
to our Guangdong sample in 2016).

As we sampled from the Third Economic Census conducted in 2013, CEES sample is representative
of the census. In Table A2, we list a few attributes of manufacturing firms in the two sampled
provinces for three datasets, the Third Economic Census, the Statistical Yearbook, and CEES. For
the average number workers per firm, CEES (weighted) average is 62, which is close to that from
the census.5 For the level of asset and ownership distributions the CEES also closely resembles the
census.


2.4    Questionnaire Design

The firm and worker questionnaires were designed by the four Principal Investigators, the interna-
tional advisers, together with a team of over 30 researchers. The 2016 firm questionnaire includes
seven modules and 1, 030 variables, covering basic situation (including firm accounting data), firm
head characteristics, management, production, sales, innovation, quality control, and human re-
sources. The employee questionnaire includes five modules and 443 variables, covering personal
background, current job, work history, social insurance, and personality traits. In 2016, CEES
   4
     Of the 15% attrition, 10% was due to refusal and 5% was due to exit or relocation.
   5
     In contrast, the reported number from the yearbook is a much larger 307. This is because the yearbook (as well
as many recent studies such as Hsieh and Klenow (2009)) uses the sample from the Annual Survey of Industrial Firms
(ASIF) conducted by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), which only include firms with annual sales above 20
million RMB and State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs). As a result the ASIF only covers 56 thousand firms, which is
less than 10% of all firms in the two provinces.



                                                        5
questionnaires included a management module, which came from the World Management Survey,
itself based on Bloom and Van Reenen (2007) and Bloom et al. (2018). As noted above, a key
innovation is that CEES asks both the CEO and a random sample of employees about the firm’s
management practices. In 2018, CEES plans to asks both the CEO and randomly selected employ-
ees about firm’s business expectations, based on Bloom et al. (2017), which are extremely helpful
for understanding firm investment plans and actual investment (e.g. Gennaioli, Ma and Shleifer,
2016).


2.5      Implementation and Quality Control

The survey was implemented by CESDC with a team of over 300 enumerators, mainly sta↵s and
graduate students from Wuhan University. Each of the two rounds of the survey was completed in
three weeks in the summer (June-July) of 2015 and 2016.

CEES has established a series of protocols to ensure high academic value and survey quality. First,
local government officials issued endorsements encouraging local officials and enterprise managers to
participate in CEES. In return the CEES research team has provided local governments and firms
with analytical reports based on pooled - and hence anonymized - survey data from each region.
Second, the survey team was extensively trained with one week of initial training and ongoing
training throughout the survey process. This was critical for ensuring standardization across the
survey teams. Third, the CEES has established a management system for questionnaire design,
data collection, data cleaning, and conducts strict quality checks at every stage of data collection
and entry. For example, every enumerator was asked to install the specialized cellphone app which
enables online real-time monitoring of the progress of the surveys. Finally, an Advisory Committee
was established to help provide advice on survey design and execution.6


2.6      Summary Statistics of the Sample

In this paper, we use a sub-sample of CEES in 2016 that report the management scores. We
summarize some basic characteristics (unweighted) of this sub-sample of 906 firms in Table 1. On
average, a firm in this sample has 959 workers and is about 12 years old. About half (48%) of the
firms export and 14% are state-owned enterprises. Out of the 906 firms, 6,692 managers and workers
report management scores. They are 36 years old on average, and have high school education.

3     Results

3.1   Management Scores

The management scores obtained from the CEES are generally comparable to those from the US or
from di↵erent surveys in China. We start by showing in Figure 1 the distribution of management
scores across the firms in China, pooling all interviews from all employees. We see a familiar
wide distribution with a long-left tail, much like productivity distributions for China (e.g. Hsieh
and Klenow, 2009) or management and productivity distributions for the US (e.g. Syverson 2004,
Bloom et al. 2018). In particular, the mean and variance of this distribution is 0.58 and 0.13
which compare reasonably to the US values of 0.64 and 0.15, suggesting Chinese scores evaluated
on a similar basis are significantly lower but with a similar (possibly slightly compressed) spread.
Indeed, this also matches up with the results from Bloom, Sadun and Van Reenen (2017) in the
World Management Survey, which, using a di↵erent telephone survey management scoring tool,
also finds a higher and more dispersed US score than China.

Moreover, the distributions of scores for di↵erent types of workers and for di↵erent management
practices are similar. In Figure 2 we plot the scores across the three main groups of practices -
monitoring, targets and incentives - and for the CEO, workers and managers respectively. It is
clear that, firstly, these three groups have incredibly similar distributions. There is some variation
- in particular workers have slightly lower scores on monitoring and targets, while managers appear
to have higher scores on incentives - but broadly speaking these line up closely (at least much more
closely than any of the co-authors anticipated in advance).

Although the the CEO scores are highly correlated with those of managers and workers, they are far
less than being perfectly correlated. In Figure 3 we examine the correlation between the individual
scores of managers (y-axis) and that of the CEO (x-axis) for every firm-respondent pair in the
left panel, and for the workers (y-axis) and CEO (x-axis) in the right panel. Because there were
typically 8 respondents per firm (1 for the CEO, 2 for the managers and 5 for the workers) there are
on average 2 data points per firm in the left panel and 5 in the right panel. What these two figures
show is that, firstly, the multiple scores per firm are highly correlated: 0.267 (p-value of 0.000) for
CEOs and managers and 0.237 (p-value 0.000) for CEOs and workers. Given the extensive noise
in these surveys (for example, for repeat surveys in the US data we estimate a signal:noise ratio
of 1:1) these correlations are high. However, they are still far from the value of 0.5 that would
be implied by, for example, 50% noise in each response, so that there appears to also be some
substantial variation between respondents.


3.2   Management and Performance

To evaluate the di↵erent informational content of the di↵erent response levels, in Table 2 we regress
in columns (1) to (3) labor productivity (log valued added per employee) on the scores for the CEO,

                                                  7
manager and worker respectively. In all cases we include a set of province fixed e↵ects to account
for any systematic di↵erence between Hubei and Guangdong province. Since there are multiple
managers and workers responding per firm we also need to allow for di↵erent responses while
keeping the sample sizes constant across the three columns. So we bootstrap these estimations 200
times, with in each bootstrap we take the CEOs score and randomly draw one managers score and
one workers score, reporting the mean coefficient and its standard error.

Regression results reported in Table 2 show that management scores of all three types of employees
are highly correlated with firm performance, and that of CEO seems to be most informative about
performance. As we can see in columns (1) to (3) all three groups provide highly significant
management scores, although the point estimate on the CEO’s score is slightly larger. In columns
(4) to (6) we report results for another performance measure - employment growth - and again find
the CEO and managers responses are significant and very similar at the point estimate (that of the
manager is slightly higher than CEO: 0.051 vs 0.050). Finally, in columns (7) to (9) we examine
log(profit/sales) and see for this outcome the CEO’s score is the most informative.

A horse race of management scores between di↵erent types of workers further shows that CEO
scores are the most important. In the first three columns of Table 3 we re-run these regressions
but include all three scores at the same time. We find across the columns that generally the CEO
scores is the most informative (in all but the first column), the managers score is the second most
informative, and the workers the least informative (in all but the fourth column). In columns (4)
and (5), we also examine two more outcome variables including log(capital/employee) as a measure
of capital intensity, and log(R&D/employee) as a measure of innovative intensity. Again, the CEO
management score is the most important predictor for the capital intensity and R&D intensity
measures. Hence, the evidence suggests CEOs management scores are potentially better predictors
of firm performance than (a randomly chosen) manager or worker.

In Figures 4 and 5 we investigate this another way by breaking the CEO, manager and workers
scores into deciles and plotting two basic performance measures - labor productivity and profit/sales
- against the bins. Below these figures we also report the raw correlations. What we can see for
these outcomes is that the CEOs scores are the most correlated - the CEO bars slope upwards the
most steeply and have the highest correlation coefficient - followed by the managers and then the
workers. In appendix figures A1 to A4 we show that the CEO score is also more informative about
a range of other indicators, including sales per employee (A1), firm size (A2), employees education
(A3) and R&D per employee (A4).

One follow-up question is whether managers or workers average scores are more informative than
the CEO? That is, while the CEO can provide the singularly most informative management score,
potentially groups of managers or workers can be more informative - a “wisdom of crowds” type
hypothesis. In fact, we find this is usually not the case, as the correlations averaging across all
respondents is typically no higher than for the CEO alone. For example, as shown by Figure 4, the
correlation between value added per employee and CEO is 0.144, which is only slightly smaller than


                                                 8
its correlation with the average scores of the whole group (0.161 if equally weighted per employee;
0.160 if equally weighted at the group level). For the profit rate measure, the correlation with CEO
is even larger than that with the whole group (0.108 vs. 0.061 or 0.084). Another minor point
is that when we give more weight to non-CEO employees, i.e., from equal weight each group to
equal weight per employee, the correlations tend to decline, suggesting non-CEO employees are less
informative than CEOs.

Hence, in summary, the CEO management scores do seem the most correlated with a wide range of
firm performance outcomes. In that sense CEOs do seem to “know better” about the management
practices in their firm that are most predictive of firm performance.


3.3   Management Disagreement and Performance

Another natural question given our range of scores within the firm is whether disagreement over
management scores is correlated with better or worse firm performance. On one hand disagreement
might be a sign of a badly run firm, suggesting weak internal information sharing or employee
disengagement. On the other hand more disagreement may also highlight greater independence
of employee views, potentially associated with improved firm performance. So to investigate this
empirically we develop two measures of management score disagreement. The first one measures
the average absolute deviation of each employee’s overall score from the firm mean:

                                       D1i = |mij      m̄   ij | ,                                  (1)

where mij denotes the management score of employee i in firm j, and m̄         ij   denotes the average
management score from all other employees excluding employee i in firm j. The second one is a
similar concept, but executed in terms of the question level (rather than overall average management
score) deviation from the rest of the firm. In particular, for each firm we measure employees’
individual question score deviation from the firm mean averaged across all questions:

                                             16
                                           1 X
                                   D2i =       |mijk        m̄       ijk | ,                        (2)
                                           16
                                             k=1

where mijk denotes the management score of question k from employee i in firm j, and m̄             ijk
denotes the average management score for question k from all other employees excluding employee
i in firm j. In appendix figures A5 and A6 we show the distributions of the two dispersion measures.

Generally speaking, disagreement is not correlated with standard performance measures. In Table
4 we see that the first dispersion measure is negatively correlated with labor productivity (column
(1)) but not significantly so. In columns (2) and (3) we see positive relationships with growth and
profits, but again these are not significant. In columns (4) and (5) we see a significant negative
correlation between disagreement and capital intensity and R&D intensity. In table 5 we run a
similar analysis using the second measure of management disagreement and see similar results -

                                                   9
a lower capital and R&D intensity but no other significant relationship. Together, these results
are somewhat surprising and hard to interpret. Our interpretation is that disagreement in the
management score does not seem to have a strong correlation with performance overall, but does
seem to suggest lower long-run investment in tangible and intangible capital. We hope to extend
this analysis with the much larger sample from the 2018 survey wave.

However, disagreement seems to reduce the positive correlation between performance and man-
agement. In Tables 6 and 7, we include in the performance regressions the interaction term of
management scores with the disagreement measures. Note that the interacting terms are nega-
tive in all cases and are significant at least at the 5% level in most cases, suggesting that the
management-performance relationship is significantly weaker in firms with more management dis-
agreement. This means that greater disagreement indicates a weaker signal value of management to
performance, perhaps because the firms management practices are harder to evaluate, or perhaps
because disagreement indicates a higher level of measurement error in the survey responses in the
firm.



4       Conclusions

We analyze a new management survey for around 1,000 firms across two large provinces in China.
The unique aspect of this survey is it collected management data from the CEO, senior managers
and a random sample of workers. We find four main results. First, management scores, much
like productivity, have a wide spread with a long left-tail of poorly managed firms. This distri-
bution of management scores is similar for CEOs, senior managers and workers management, and
appears broadly reasonably compared to US scores for similar questions. Moreover, for all groups
these scores correlate with firm performance, suggesting all employees within the firm are (at least
partly) aware of the their firms’ managerial abilities. Second, the scores across the groups are sig-
nificantly cross-correlated, but far from completely. This suggests that while di↵erent levels of the
firm have similar views on the firms management capabilities, they do not fully agree. Third, we
find that the CEO’s management scores are the most predictive of firm performance, followed by
the senior managers and then the workers. Hence, CEOs do appear to know best about their firms
management strengths and weaknesses. Finally, disagreement between employees over management
practices is negatively correlated with investment in R&D and physical capital, potentially indicat-
ing a less long-run focus of the firm. This survey highlights the importance of eliciting management
evaluations from all employees across the firm, rather than just the CEO or senior management.

Notes: Summary statistics from CEES data are unweighted. The management score is the unweighted average of the
score for each of the 16 questions, where each question is first normalized to be on a 0-1 scale. The sample in all columns
is all CEES firms in 2016 with at least 11 non-missing responses to management questions and from firms with positive
value added, at least 20 employees, and positive capital. For the few cases where establishment characteristics had missing
values, we replaced these with the means in the sample, so to keep a constant sample size. P(n) is the value at the
n-th percentile, e.g. p(50) is the median value. The education levels are defined as 1 “no school”, 2 “primary school”, 3
“secondary school”, 4 “high school”, 5 “technical/vocational”, 6 “junior college/diploma”, 7 “undergrad/bachelor”, 8 “master”,
9 “graduate/phd”. The employee positions are defined as 0 “CEO”, 1 “Middle and senior manager”, 2 “Other administrative
staﬀ (other oﬃce staﬀ included)”, 3 “Technician or design personnel”, 4 “Sales personnel”, 5 “Front-line worker”, 6 “Other
staﬀ”.

Notes: The management score is unweighted average of the score for each of the 16 questions, where each question is first normalized to be on a 0-1 scale.
The sample is all 2016 CEES surveyors with at least 11 non-missing responses to management questions and from firms with positive value added, at least
20 employees, and positive capital. We further categorize surveyors into CEOs, managers and workers. Managers include all middle and senior managers.
Workers include administrative and office staff, technician or design personnel, sales personnel, front-line workers, and other staff.

The sample is all 2016 CEES surveyors with at least 11 non-missing responses to management questions and from firms with positive value added, at least 20
employees, and positive capital. The management deciles are calculated using the scores for CEOs, managers and workers separately. We report the
correlation between firms’ value added per employee and above and individual management scores of CEO, manager and worker respectively, as well as the
average management scores at firm level, where we either weigh the employees within a firm equally or weigh the average management scores from CEO,
managers and workers within a firm equally.

Notes: Calculations from CEES data are weighted using both the firm size weight in a county (the probability of a firm being in a sample
is proportional to its employment size) and the employment weight within a firm in 2013. Statistical Yearbook tabulations are based on
The Annual Survey of Industrial Firms (ASIF) conducted by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) with SOEs and other firms having
sales revenue exceeding 20 million RMB (USD 308,000). The Third National Economic Census (carried out in 2013) tabulations are from
The Statistical Bulletin for the Third National Economic Census. Industries are classified according to the two-digit code of The Industrial
Classification for National Economic Activities (GB/4754-2011), and we combine them into larger groups.

Notes: The management score is the unweighted average of the score for each of the 16 questions, where each question is
first normalized to be on a 0-1 scale. The sample in all columns is all CEES employees in 2016 with at least 11 non-missing
responses to management questions and age 18-65. In this sample, we categorize employees into manager (middle and
senior manager) and worker (other administrative staﬀ (other oﬃce staﬀ included), technician or design personnel, sales
personnel, front-line worker, other staﬀ). Average no. in each firm represents the average number of individuals across
firms in each group. Average management score is the average management score of individuals in each group. Typical
job title represents the most common job title in each group.

employees, and positive capital. The management deciles are calculated using the scores for CEOs, managers and workers separately. We report the correlation
between firms’ sales per employee and above and individual management scores of CEO, manager and worker respectively, as well as the average
management scores at firm level, where we either weigh the employees within a firm equally or weigh the average management scores from CEO, managers
and workers within a firm equally.

Notes: The management score is unweighted average of the score for each of the 16 questions, where each question is first normalized to be on a 0-1 scale.
The sample is all 2016 CEES surveyors with at least 11 non-missing responses to management questions and from firms with positive value added, at least 20
employees, and positive capital. The management deciles are calculated using the scores for CEOs, managers and workers separately. We report the
correlation between firms’ share of employees with college degree and above and individual management scores of CEO, manager and worker respectively, as
well as the average management scores at firm level, where we either weigh the employees within a firm equally or weigh the average management scores from
CEO, managers and workers within a firm equally.

B 2016 CEES Management Questions and Scores
Management Scores: To calculate the management score from each survey respondent, we
first normalize the response to each question to be on a 0-1 scale. For each question, 0 is the
lowest score representing the least structured management practice, and 1 is the highest score
representing the most structured management practice. For example, when asking “...how long
would the supervisors be fired if he/she couldn’t pass his performance appraisal?”, the response
“Within six months” is assigned 1 and the response “Rarely dismiss people” is assigned 0. If a
question has three categories, the “in between” category is assigned the value 0.5. Similarly, if
there are four categories, the “in between” categories are assigned 1/3 and 2/3 and so on. For
“Single choice” questions, we assign the corresponding item’s score for each question. For
“Multiple choice” questions, we assign score of the highest-scoring response selected for each
question. The management score from each respondent is then calculated as the unweighted
average of the normalized scores from those 16 questions. The management score is missing if
there are fewer than 11 non-empty responses out of 16 management items.

There are three common issues with the submitted raw survey responses that require an edit.
First, in the case that if a respondent selects more than one response where a question specifies
“Single choice”, we assign score of the most structured management practice selected by the
respondent. Second, in the case that if a respondent answers at least one question that should
have been skipped based her response to a prior question, the answers provided to questions
that should have been skipped are retained1. Third, in the case that if a respondent properly
follows skip patterns which means the responses to subsequent questions are empty as
prescribed by the skip pattern, we assign scores of the least structured management practice for
the subsequent questions skipped2.




 Although responses to these questions may be inconsistent with the response to the trigger question,
there is no way to determine which responses match the intentions of the respondent. Hence, we treat
inconsistent data as valid and only flag such responses.
 Nullifying the subsequent questions instead of editing them would have two effects. First, it reduces
the survey response rate as respondents who properly followed the skip patterns may have answered
fewer than 11 questions. Second, it upward biases the management score since it is an unweighted
average of the completed questions from each respondent.
Management Questions: The management module in the CEES survey contained 16 questions,
which are separated into three sections: monitoring, targets and incentives. The monitoring
section asked firms about their collection and use of information to monitor and improve the
production process. The targets section asked about the design, integration and realism of
production targets. Finally, the incentives section asked about non-managerial and managerial
bonus, production and reassignment/dismissal practices.

We use the same set of questions for both the firm and worker surveys. Below we list the 16
questions on management which are translated from CEES Chinese version..
