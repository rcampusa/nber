         WHAT DOES THE TERM STRUCTURE TELL US ABOUT YUTUKE INFlATION?

                                 Abstract


     This paper examines empirically what the term structure of interest
rates tells us about future inflation. The evidence indicates that the
information in the term structure about the future path of inflation is
quite different at the shortest end of the term structure (maturities six
months or less) than it is for maturities of nine to twelve months. For
maturities of six months or less, in all the sample periods examined ——
February 1964 to December 1986, 1964 to October 1979, November 1979 to
October 1982, November 1982 to December 1986 -— the term structure
provides almost no information about the future path of inflation. On
the other hand at this end of the term structure, the results do indicate
that the term structure of nominal interest rates contain a great deal of
information about the term structure of real interest rates. This
finding is quite important because it suggests that researchers can
examine observable data on the shortest end of the nominal term structure
to provide them with information about the behavior of the real term
structure.

     For maturities of nine and twelve months, the term structure does
appear to contain information about the future path of inflation in the
full sample period and in the sub—periods before October 1982.   At these
longer maturities, however, there does not appear to be much information
in the nominal term structure about the term structure of real interest
rates.

     The evidence in this paper suggests that some caution should be
exercised in using the term structure of interest rates as a guide for
assessing inflationary pressures in the economy, as is currently under
consideration by the Federal Reserve. Although there is apparently
significant information in the term structure about the future path of
inflation for maturities greater than six months, there is no information
about the future path of inflation that can be obtained from the shorter
end of the term structure.

    Much recent research has focused on the information in the term

structure of interest rates. Specifically, this research explores to

what extent the relaticnship between interest rates for different maturi-

ties helps to predict the future movement of short—term interest rates.

Although Shiller,. Campbell and Shoenholtz (1982) and Mankiw and Summers

(1984) have questioned the value of the term structure in predicting

future short-term interest rates, recent evidence in Faina (1984), Fama

and Bliss (1987), Campbell and Shiller (1986), Hardouvelis (1986) and

Mishkin (1988) indicates that the term structure is capable of forecast-

ing future interest rates.

     The information in the term structure can also be examined from a

somewhat different perspective. Fama's (1975) classic study on interest

rates as predictors of inflation suggests that movements in interest

rates primarily reflect fluctuations in expected inflation (the so-called

Fisher effect) rather than changes in real interest rates. Subsequent

work supports this conclusion for the postwar United States except for

the period of the change in Federal Reserve operating procedures from

October 1979 until October 1982.1 This evidence along with the evidence

that the term structure contains information about future interest rate

movements suggests that the term structure might also contain information

about the future path of inflation.

     This paper examines empirically what the term structure of interest

rates tells us about future inflation. This is an important topic

Gibbons (1982) and Huizinga and Mishkin (1986).

because inflation is a major concern of policymakers. Indeed, the Federal

Reserve is currently considering using the slope of the term structure as

a policy guide for assessing inflationary pressures in the economy. The

evidence in this paper bears directly on whether such a Fed strategy

makes sense. This paper will alsp provide evidence on the prevalent view

that a downward sloping yield curve reflects expectations of a falling

rate of inflation, while a steeply upward sloping yield curve indicates

expectations of a rising rate of inflation. The behavior of the term

structure has thus been a central element in debates about whether
                                                                  2
Federal Reserve anti-inflation policy has been credible or not.

     In addition, this paper provides evidence on whether movements in

the term structure of real interest rates (which is not directly observ-

able) are revealed by movements in the term structure of nominal inter-

est rates (which is observable). This is also an important topic because

it will tell researchers whether using stylized facts about the observ-

able nominal term structure provides them with information about the

behavior of the real term structure, which has an important role in

understanding asset pricing and in theories of the business cycle.



                          II. The Basic Methodology


     The empirical analysis in this paper primarily focuses on estimation

of two forecasting equations. The first, which will be referred to as

the "inflation forecasting equation," is a regression of the level of the

rn-period inflation rate (g) on the rn-period interest rate




     2Blancbard (1984).
                                                                                      3

Tests of the statistical significance of the                coefficient and whether

it differs from one provide information about whether the overall level

of interest rates helps predict the overall level of future inflation.

This forecasting equation, which was first studied by Fama (1975), is

estimated in this paper in order to allow a comparison of the results

here with those in previous research.    Estimates of this equation,

however, do not indicate whether the term structure contains information

about the future path of inflation because the -term structure could have

no marginal explanatory power for predicting the path of future inflation

and yet     estimates for many maturities could be statistically

significant.

      The main focus of the paper is, therefore, on estimates of a fore-

casting equation that does tell us whetherthe term structure helps to

predict future inflation. This equation, which will be referred to as

the "inflation change equation," is a regression of the change in the

future rn—period inflation rate from the n-period inflation rate (n -
                                        .m       -   .n
on the slope of the term structure

                        = amn   +            -            + 1m,n


Tests of the statistical significance of the                    coefficient and whether
                                                          m,n
it differs from one reveal how much information there is in the slope of

the term structure about future changes in inflation.

      The regression framework outlined above is quite simple, but we

need to carefully examine the link between nominal nominal interest

rates, real interest rates and expected inflation in order to understand

how to clearly interpret the results. According to the Fisher (1930)
                                                                                    4



equation, expected inflation over rn periods is equal to the rn-period

nominal interest rate minus the rn—period real interest rate:


(3)
                       rn
                            =    .rn
                                          - rrm
where,
                Et =        expectations              at time t,

                       =    the        inflation rate from time t   to   tIm,

                            the        rn-period nominal interest rate at time t.


               rr = thei.e.,-—
                                rn—period (ex—ante) real interest rate at time t
                                     the ex-ante real return on an rn-period bond
                            from t to tim.


The realized inflation rate over the next ! periods can be written as
the expected inflation rate plus the forecast error of inflation:


(4)                    =
                            En ÷
where,
                       =    the        forecast error of inflation =        -

Substituting   in for E7r from equation (3), we obtain,


(5)


      The equation above can be rewritten in the form of the inflation

forecasting equation (1) as follows:


                         +                        +
                fl = Urn


where,
                a = minus                   the mean real rate =



                  in
                 1k    =t       m     —
                                           m
                                           Ut,
                 urr
                  In             in         —in
                                          -rr
                                                                                 5




      If as in Fama (1975), we assume that expectations are rational and

the real interest rate is constant, tften ordinary least squares (OLS)

estimates of the forecasting equation above produce a consistent estimate

of     = 1 and the nominal interest rate adjusted by a constant is the

optimal predictor of the inflation rate.        We see this by first recogniz-

ing that rational expectations implies that the forecast error of infla-

tion, e, is orthogonal to the right-hand-side regressors because under

rational expectations Et& = 0     ——   i.e.,   the forecast error of inflation

must be unforecastable conditional on all available information at time t

which includes i. Constancy of the real rate then makes OLS estimates

consistent because u disappears, leaving an error term for the forecast-

ing equation of e, which is orthogonal to the right—hand-side regressors

under rational expectations and is also a minimum variance error.

       If the real rate is not constant, then the nominal interest rate can

still contain information about the future inflation rate but it is no

longer an optimal predictor because u is no longer equal to zero.

Furthermore, if the nominal interest rate is correlated with the real

rate, then u and hence      is correlated with i and the OLS estimate of

     will have a probability limit different from one. In addition,

correlation of     and i implies that the OLS estimate of         also will

not be a consistent estimate of minus the mean real rate

       The discussion above leads to the following conclusions about tests

on the      coefficient. If the null hypothesis m = 0 is rejected statis-

tically, then nominal interest rates contain significant information

about the level of future inflation. If the null hypothesis m =         I   is

rejected, then the empirical evidence indicates that the real rate of

interest is not constant.

          We can look at tests of the         coefficient in a slightly different

way by subtracting i            from both sides of the forecasting equation (4)

and then multiplying both sides by -1 to obtainthe following ex-post

real rate regression equation:


(6)                  eprr =         +t   -
                                             m'   -




                                i
where,

                     eprr =        -
                                     n, the  ex-post real interest rate on an
                                rn—period bond at time t (i.e., the realized real
                                return from t to t+m.)


Now we see that Bm =        1   implies that the coefficient [1 -          on the
                                                                     Bml

nominal interest rate i equals zero in the ex—post real rate regres-

sion. Since the ex—ante real interest rate is just the conditional

expectation at time t of the ex—post real interest rate, a rejection of

      =   1   (or equivalently,     —    = 0)   in the inflation forecasting

equation indicates that nominal interest rates contain significant

information about ex-ante real interest rates.3 Using similar rea-

soning, a rejection of              = 0 (or equivalently, 1 -       = 1)   means that

the null hypothesis that ex-ante real interest rates move one-for-one

with nominal interest rates can be rejected.

          A natural way to examine the information in the term structure about

future changes in the inflation rate is to subtract equation (5) for the

n-period inflation rate from equation (5) for the rn-period inflation rate

to obtain,

This equation can be rewritten in the form of the inflation change fore-

casting equation (2) as follows,

                       in

                        t

where,

                       a          —n —in
                                  rr -rr,

                        m,n         in.    n      in      n


Since the above forecasting equation has been derived in a similar

fashion to the in-period inflation forecasting equation, the interpreta-

tion' of the                coefficient follows straightforwardly along the lines




                                                                i
outlined for                 If 6m,n is significantly different from zero, then the

"slope" of the term structure ——                   i.e,   i -       ——   contains   significant

information about the change in the future rn—period inflation rate from

the n-period inflation rate. A significant rejection of                               =   0   (or

equivalently, 1 -                   = 1) also indicates a rejection of the null
                             Bm,n
hypothesis that the slope of the term structure of real interest rates

(rr -     rr)   moves one-for-one with the slope of the nominal term struc-

ture (i —
                it).        If         is significantly different from one, then we can

reject the null hypothesis that the slope of the real term structure (rr

-   rr)   remains constant over time. A significant rejection of 3m,n =                             1


(or equivalently, 1 —                      = 0)   also indicates that changes in the slope

of the nominal term structure contains significant information about

changes in the slope of term structure of real interest rates.

                 III. Some Additional Econometric Issues


     Before going on to a discussion of the data and the empirical

results, several additional econometric issues that have important

consequences for hypothesis testing need to be discussed. One important

econometric consideration is that the error term fl will be serially

correlated when in   >I   --   i.e.   ,    when the number of periods for the inter-

est rate and the inflation rate are greater than the observation inter-

val, as occurs in the following empirical analysis. In this overlapping

data case, the forecast error                  is not realized until tim. Thus      is

                                          in    in         m          m
likely to be correlated with                           .        and       will follow an

M(m—1) process. Because of the resulting serial correlation, the

standard errors of the OLS parameter estimates will be incorrect.

Correct standard errors are generated using the method outlined by Hansen

and Hodrick (1980), with a modification due to White (1980) that allows

for conditional heteroscedasticity and a modification suggested by Newey

and West (1985) that insures the variance—covariance matrix is positive—

definite by downweighting the off-diagonal elements.4




     4The formula for the variance—covariance matrix of the parameter
estimates, V, is

                V =   (X'XY'X'QX(X'X)1
where,

                X =   the matrix of explanatory variables, which is TXk
                      (T = the number of observations, k = the number of
                      explanatory variables),
                0 =   the variance—covariance matrix of the residuals

 and the (i,j)th element of the estimated 0 is defined as
                                                                          9




    Because contemporaneous errors in forecasting inflation for differ-

ent horizons may be highly correlated, seemingly unrelated regression

(SIJR) estimates of a system of equations with different horizons may

produce substantial gains in efficiency.5 The SUR standard error es-

timates will again be incorrect because of the serial correlation of the

error terms. The Hansen-Hodricic, Newey—West estimate of the variance—

covariance matrix allowing for conditional heteroscedasticity can be

generalized to apply to a seemingly unrelated regression system of &

equations as follows.6




               w(i,j) =   (i   -
                                   p/(qtl)Iq'q'             for p     q
                      =   0                                 otherwise

where p = Ii -
               ii and q = the order of the MA process, m -
                                                                m
     Note that in constructing the corrected standard errors, u is
assumed to have a NA process of order less than rn—i. If u follows a
higher order MA process then the composite error term     wtll also follow
a higher MA process.    In order to allow for more gradual down—weighting
   the off—diagonal elements of the the 0 matrix and the possibility that
   has a MA process of order greater than rn—i, I also constructed
Newey-West estimates of the variance—covariance matrix where q is re-
placed by 2q in the equation above. The estimated standard errors of the
coefficients typically were quite close to those reported in the tables
and none of the conclusions were affected. The results thus do not
appear to be sensitive to allowance for a higher order NA process for the
error terms or to use of a more gradual down-weighting scheme.

     5The same conditions for the consistency of OLS estimates of
     = I -— the constancy of the real rate differentials, rr -
                                                                 rr -—
apig apply for consistency of the SUR estimates. Cgnstancy of themrealn
rate differentials implies that the error terms      just equals c, - £
Since under rational expectations these forecast errors are uncorrelate
with all information available at time t, which includes m for all m,
constancy of the real rate differentials implies the conddion for
consistency of the SUR estimates, that all of the explanatory variables
in the equations are orthogonal to all the error terms.

     6The variance—covariance matrix, V, is derived as follows.   The StiR
estimation method assumes that the variance—covariance_yatrix of the
residuals is ThI . Using the Choleski decomposition      = P'P, we get

    Now that we have completed our discussion of the econometric de-

                                   IV. The Data


    The empirical analysis makes use of monthly data on inflation rates

and one to twelve-month U.S. Treasury bills for the period February 1964.

to December 1986. The sample starts with February 1964 because this is

the first date that data on all the Treasury bills became available

(twelve-month Treasury bills were not issued until late 1963). Because

six month Treasury bills were first issued in late 1958, tests using one

to six-month Treasury bills can be conducted with sample periods starting

                            = 0                           .


                                                                  otherwise

where p = Ii —
               it and q = the highest order of the MA process for the
error term of any equation in the system. The order of the MA process is
assumed to be the same for all the equations in the system because
otherwise the Newey—West method used here does not insure that the
variance-covariance matrix is positive definite.
     Note that the presence of the 0 matrix in the formula for the
variance—covariance matrix in (8) takes account of serial correlation of
the error terms both within an equation and across equations as well as
for conditional heteroscedasticity in these covariances. Thus even
though SUR estimation only takes account of contemporaneous correlation
of error terms across equations, the variance—covariance matrix above is
corrected for serial correlation both within and across equations as well
as for conditional heteroscedasticity.

in January 1959. The results are very similar to those for sample periods

starting with February 1964 and are reported in the appendix. End of

month T—bill data were obtained from the Center for Research in Security

Prices (CR8?) at the University of Chicago. The one-month bill was

defined to have a maturity of 30.4 days, the three—month bill. 91.25 days,

on up to the twelve month bill with a maturity of 365 days. For each

defined maturity the interest rate was interpolated from the two bills

that were closest to the defined maturity. In effect, this means that

the slope of the term structure is assumed to be constant between these

two bills.8 The interest rates are expressed on a continuously com-

pounded basis at an annual rate in percent as are the inflation rates.

The inflation data is calculated from a CPI series which appropriately

treats housing costs on a rental—equivalence basis throughout the sample

period. For more details on this series see Huizinga and ?lishkin (1984,

1986).

     The timing of the variables is as follows. A January interest rate

observation uses the end of December bill rate data. A January observa-

tion for a one—month inflation rate is calculated from the December and

January CPI data; a three-month inflation rate from the December and

Harch CPI data; and so on.9




     8iama (1984) instead chooses a bill that has a maturity closest to
six months and then keeps on taking the interest rate from this same bill
every month as its maturity shortens in order to get interest rates on
one to six-month bills. In effect, Fain is assuming that the slope of the
term structure is flat around the chosen bill. The differences between
these two procedures is very slight and makes no appreciable difference
to the results.

     9The appropriate dating for the CPI is a particular month is not
clear since price quotations on the component items of the index are
collected at different times during the month. As a result, there is
                                                                          13




                       V. The Empirical Results


     Table 1 contains the estimates of the inflation forecasting equa-

tions for horizons of one, three, six, nine and twelve months. Panel A

contains the results for the full sample period, February 1964 to Decem-

ber 1986, while Panels B, C and D contain the results for three sub-

periods, February 1964 to October 1979, November 1979 to October 1982,

and November 1982 to December 1986. The sample has been split into these

three sub-periods because results in Clarida and Friedman (1984),

Huizinga and Nishkin (1986) and Roley (1986) indicate that the relation-

ship of nominal interest rates and inflation shifted with the monetary

regime changes of October 1979 and October 1982.

     For the full sample period, 3m is significantly different from zero

for all time horizons, indicating that one to twelve month Treasury bill

rates do contain a significant amount of information about future infla-

tion. This finding is especially strong for the pre—October. 1979 sample

period (Panel B) where the t—statistics on the     coefficients range from

9.76 to 11.85. However, after October 1979, the one to twelve month

nominal interest rates contain much less information about future infla-

tion. In the October 1979 to October 1982 period of the Fed's nonborrow-

ed reserves target operating procedure, none of the    coefficients are




some misalignment of the inflation data and the interest rate data which
is collected at the end of the month. In order to see if this misalign-
ment could have an appreciable affect on the results, I also estimated
the regressions in this paper lagging the interest rate data one period
(i.e., for the January observation I used the end of November bill
rate). The results with the lagged interest rate data are very similar
to those found in the text and none of the conclusions of the paper
changes.

significantly different from zero and for about half of the time horizons

they are even negative. Although there is a positive relationship

between inflation and naminal interest rates at all time horizons in the

post-October 1982 period,         is only significant at two time horizons,

one month and three months.

     The t-test of I -   3=0       for the full sample period indicates that

the constancy of the real interest rate can be rejected and that nominal

interest rates do contain information about real interest rates. Howev-

er, I —     is negative at all time horizons in •the pre—October 1979

sample period (Panel B), indicating that real interest rates are nega-

tively correlated with nominal interest rates. In the October 1979 to

October 1982 period, 1 -          flips sign and become strongly positive with
                            3m

t—statistics of 1 —   3=0        ranging from 3.03 to 8.25. Indeed, as the

t—test of     = 0 indicates, we cannot reject the hypothesis that I -
                                                                             3rn

equals one, i.e., that the nominal interest rate moves one-for-one with

the real interest rate. After October 1982, 1 -              remains positive, and
                                                        3m

is significant in four of the five time horizons, but relative to

results for the October 1979 to October 1982 period it is smaller for all

the time horizons.

     As our discussion of the 3        coefficient   estimates indicates, there

seems to be large changes of the          coefficients over the three sub-

periods examined here. Table 2 presents formal tests (Wald tests) of

parameter instability. The tests provide very strong evidence that

is not the same in the three sub-periods. The marginal significance

levels for the tests of shifts in 3        indicate   that the probability of

obtaining that high a value of the test statistic under the null hypothe-

sis that     are   equal in the three sub—periods is always less than 1 in

shifts in both    and B   produce even stronger re'jections of parameter

hovering around i0°.

     The results in Table 1 and Table 2 are consistent with earlier

findings in the literature which have examined the relationship between

future inflation and nominal interest rates for a more limited range of

time horizons (one to three months). To summarize the results here:

nominal interest rates with maturities of one to twelve months do contain

a great deal of information about future inflation, especially in the

pre-October 1979 sample period; the constancy of the real rate is

strongly rejected; nominal interest rates are negatively correlated with

real interest rates in the pre—October 1979 period and are positively

correlated with real interest rates thereafter; only during the October

1919 to October 1982 period of the fed's nonborrowed reserves target

operating procedure do nominal interest rates move one—for—one with real

rates; and the relationship between nominal interest rates and future

inflation does undergo significant shifts with the changes in monetary

policy regimes in October 1979 and October 1982.

     Although we have found that nominal interest rates contain signifi-

cant information about the level of future inflation at all the maturi-

ties we have looked at here, this does not mean that the slope of the

term structure contains information about the future path of inflation.

The significant    coefficients at all maturities may not reflect any

marginal explanatory power for the term structure, but might rather just

reflect the fact that the overall level of nominal interest rates is

correlated with the overall level of future inflation. To see if the
                                                                                16




term structure helps to forecast future inflation, we turn to the infla-

tion change equations which regress the change in the future rn-period

inflation rate from the n—period inflation rate (n'         - t) on   the "slope"

of the term structure (i -
                                    i).   These results are found in Table 3.

       As we can see in Table 3, at the shortest end of the ten structure

(maturities six months or less) the results for the inflation change

equations is strikingly different than that found for the inflation level

equations in Table 1. For all sample periods and time horizons of six

months or less in Table 3, the R2s of the inflation change equations are

near zero and none of the Bmn coefficients is statistically significant.

Further tests, found in the appendix, which look at all combinations of in

and   ii,   for   rn and n less than or equal to six months, also strongly con-

firm these findings. Apparently, the ten structure for maturities of

six months or less contains almost no information about the path of

future inflation.

       The results for the longer maturities, nine and twelve months, tell

a different story, however. For the full sample period in Panel A, the

difference between the twelve month and six month rate and between the

twelve month and nine month rate do have substantial information about

the path of future inflation. The P126 and p12,9 coefficients are quite




                                                      i
     10The word "information" is being used in this paper quite narrowly.
Information in the term structure about the path of future inflation
refers only to the ability of the slope, i' -    to predict the change in
the inflation rate, 11m -       n
                              None of the evidence in this paper rules
out predictive power or orecasting equations that make use of more
complicated interactions of interest rates at maturities of six months or
less or that use additional economic variables in combination with the
slope of the term structure. This paper focuses on the predictive power
of the slope term, m -         n
                            because it is the most natural piece of
information in the term structure to examine.

cantly different from zero at the one percent level.           In looking at the

sub—periods, we see the             coefficient is significantly different from

zero in the February 1964 —     October 1979 sample period, as are the B96

and p12,6 coefficients in the November 1979 — October 1982 sample period.

Indeed, the R2's are particularly high for the regressions with m,n =             9,6

and 12,6 in the November 1979 —       October 1982 period, indicating a large

amount of forecast power for changes in inflationj'

structure of real interest rates for the shortest maturities.               For in =

statistically significant from zero, and never statistically significant

follows along the lines of Fama (1984) who looks at whether forward rates

For the full sample period, the coefficient on the forsiar&spot differen-
tial is never significantly different from zero, and it is significant
for only a few time horizons in other sample periods. The evidence thus
does not reveal a great deal of information in forward rates about
future changes1in one1month inflation rates.
      Because      - it i the cumulative change in the one-month

from one.      Indeed, in three of the four sample periods the [1 —

term is statistically significant from zero at the one percent level,

and for the full sample period, its t-statistic is very large, exceeding

five.      The evidence thus suggests that most fluctuations in the slope of

the term structure at the very short end reflect changes in the slope of

the term structure of real interest rates on a one-for-one basis and do

not reflect changes in expectations about future changes in inflation.

        The t—tests of 1 -         for the intermediate maturities, six and
                             m,n
nine months, provide some evidence for the the nominal term structure

containing information about the real term structure, but the evidence is

not always strong. For        = 6 and 9. (i —          is positive in seven out

of eight cases in Table 3, but is statistically significant only once

(when rn = 9 in Panel B, the February 1964 -       October 1979 sample period).

However, additional results in the appendix lend stronger support for the

view that the term structure of nominal interest rates provides informa-

tion about the term structure of real interest rates for maturities up to

six months.

     At the longest end of the term structure studied here, however, the

story is quite different. For in     equal to twelve months, (1 —            is
                                                                    m,n1
only significantly different from zero in one case, and in this case it

is negative and is only barely significant at the five percent level. The

evidence for maturities around twelve months thus suggests that the term

structure of nominal interest rates does not provide information about

the term structure of real interest rates, but is rather more likely to

reflect changes in expectations about future changes in inflation.

sub-periods is completely different than is true for the inflation level

             Where Table 2 shows very strong evidence that the              co-
equations.

efficients for m C 6 are not stable in the inflation level equations,

Table 4 indicates that we cannot reject the equality of the              in the

three sample periods for in C   6; indeed, the marginal significance levels
are quite high with values above one-half.       For m,n =   9,6   and 12,6,

Table 4 indicates that mn do shift from one sub-period to another, but

as the comparison of the Table 3 versus Table 1 results indicates, these

shifts are in exactly the opposite direction for the inflation change

equations than they are for the inflation level equations. In the

inflation level equations, the       coefficients decline in November 1979 —

October 1982 period and become statistically insignificant, thus indicat-
ing that the level of interest rates is unable to forecast the future

level of inflation. In stark contrast, the 96 and p12,6 coefficients

increase in the November 1979 — October 1982 period and become statisti-

cally significant, thus indicating a greater ability to forecast the

future path of inflation. Tests for shifts in both a    and                 reveal

evidence of parameter stability when m >     3, but the marginal significance
levels are far higher than in Table 2.

     As was discussed in the section on some additional econometric

issues, if equation residuals across different time horizons are corre-

lated, more efficient estiDates can be obtained by exploiting this

information with seemingly unrelated regression (SUB) estimation. Table

•5, which contains the SUB estimates of the same inflation change equa-

tions found in Table 3, indicates that SUR estimation sometimes leads to

large increases in efficiency --    nearly   half of the standard errors of

the Bm,n coefficients decline more than 20% in going from Table 3 to

Table 12 Even greater increases in efficiency can be achieved by

choosing a system of equations in which the error terms are highly

correlated. For example, in the system of eleven equations in which ! =

2,   3,      .   12 and a =   1, SUR estimation results in standard errors which
typically decline by 50% and in a few cases decline by as much as 80%.

          The increased efficiency of the SUR estimates, however, does not

change the conclusions we reached before; indeed, in the cases where

there are large efficiency gains it only tends to strengthen them. In

the full sample of Panel A, we find that, in addition to B26 and B12,9,

          now is significantly different from zero at the one percent level.

B12,6 also becomes significant in the February 1964 to October 1979

sample period and in the November 1979 to October 1982 sample period, we

now also find that all three of these coefficients are statistically

significant at the one percent level. SUR estimation thus strengthens

the conclusion that the slope of the term structure around maturities of

nine and twelve months provides substantial information about the path of

future inflation.



                                     VI. Conclusions.


          The empirical evidence in this paper indicates that the information

 in the term structure about the future path of inflation is quite




      t2Note, however, that in several cases, the estimated standard
 errors are higher in Table 5 than they are in Table 3. Even though the
 SUR estimates are asymptotically more efficient than OLS estimates, in
 small samples estimated SUR standard errors can turn out to be larger
 than OLS standard errors, especially when the order of the MA process for
 each equation is taken to be the highest order of the MA process for the
 error term of any equation in the system. (This is done to assure
 posttxve-definiteness of the variance-covariance matrix. See footnote 7.)

different at the shortest end of the term structure (maturities six

months or less) than it is for maturities nine months or greater. For

maturities of six months or less, in all the sample periods examined --

February 1964 to December 1986, 1964 to October 1979, November 1979 to
October 1982, November 1982 to December 1986 -—   the   term structure

provides almost no information about the future path of inflation. On

the other hand at this end of the term structure, the results do indicate

that the term structure of nominal interest rates contain a great deal of

information about the term structure of real interest rates. This

finding is quite important because it suggests that researchers can

examine observable data on the shortest end of the nominal term structure

to provide them with information about the behavior of the real term

structure.13

     For maturities of nine and twelve months, the term structure does

appear to contain information about the future path of inflation. The




     13me inability of the shortest end of the term structure to provide
information about the future path of inflation is related to research
that suggests that term premiums undergo substantial fluctuations over
time (Jones and Roley (1983), liankiw and Summers (1984) Shiller, Camp-
bell and Schoenholtz (1983), and Startz (1982)). If these premiums are an
important enough source of fluctuations in the slope of the term struc-
ture, then they can obscure any information that the term structure might
contain about expected changes in inflation and hence future changes in
inflation.   Furthermore since fluctuations in these term premiums are
reflected in both nominal and real interest rates, it is logical that the
slopes of the nominal and real term structures move together.   The fact
that the term structure of nominal interest rates for very short maturi-
ties contains a great deal of information about the term structure of
real interest rates is then just a consequence of substantial fluctua-
tions in term premiums which dominate fluctuations in expected changes in
inflation. One way that this could occur is if changes in the inflation
rate are not very predictable for short horizons (as would be the case if
the inflation rate were close to a random walk over short horizons). Then
fluctuations of expected changes in inflation would be small, while
fluctuations in the slope of the term structure of real interest rates
might be high because term premiums vary substantially over time.

                   for these maturities are often highly significant in
m,n coefficients
the full sample period and in the sub-periods before October 1982.14 At

these longer maturities, however, there does not appear to be much

information in the nominal term structure about the term structure of

real interest rates.

    The results in this paper on the information in the term   structure
strongly contrast with those which find that, for much of the postwar

period, nominal interest rate movements reflect changes in expected

inflation rather than real interest rates. Furthermore, while the degree

to which the overall level of nominal interest rates reflects expectations

of future inflation decreases dramatically with the change in the

monetary policy regime in October 1979 and October 1982, the information

in the term structure about future inflation remains unchanged for the

shortest maturities, but increases for maturities of nine and twelve

months in the October 1979 to October 1982 period. The nature of the

relationship between the term structure and future inflation is thus

strikingly different from that found between the overall level of

interest rates and future inflation.

     The evidence in this paper suggests that some caution should be

exercised in using the term structure of interest rates as a guide for

assessing inflationary pressures in the economy, as is currently under

consideration by the Federal Reserve. Although there is apparently

significant information ia the term structure about the future path of




     14These results are consistent with those in Fan (1988) who finds
that the interest rate spread between five year bonds and one year bonds
helps forecast future one—year changes in inflation for horizons of two
to five years.

inflation for maturities greater than six months, there is no information

about the future path of inflation that can be obtained I rom the shorter

end of the term structure.
