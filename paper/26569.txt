                                           ABSTRACT

We use a dynamic panel Tobit model with heteroskedasticity to generate point, set, and density
forecasts for a large cross-section of short time series of censored observations. Our fully
Bayesian approach allows us to flexibly estimate the cross-sectional distribution of heterogeneous
coefficients and then implicitly use this distribution as prior to construct Bayes forecasts for the
individual time series. We construct set forecasts that explicitly target the average coverage
probability for the cross-section. We present a novel application in which we forecast bank-level
charge-off rates for credit card and residential real estate loans, comparing various versions of the
panel Tobit model.

1         Introduction

This paper considers the problem of forecasting a large collection of short time series with
censored observations. In the empirical application we forecast charge-off rates on loans for
a panel of small banks. The prediction of charge-off rates is interesting from a regulator's
perspective because charge-offs generate losses on loan portfolios. If these charge-offs are
large, the bank may be entering a period of distress and require additional capital. Due to
mergers and acquisitions, changing business models, and changes in regulatory environments
the time series dimension that is useful for forecasting is often short. The general methods
developed in this paper are not tied to the charge-off rate application and can be used in
any setting in which a researcher would like to analyze a panel of censored data with a large
cross-sectional and a short time-series dimension.

        In a panel data setting, we often capture cross-sectional heterogeneity in the data with
unit-specific parameters. The more precisely these heterogeneous coefficients are estimated,
the more accurate are the forecasts. The challenge in forecasting panels with a short time
dimension is that they do not contain a lot of information about unit-specific parameters.
A natural way of adding information to the estimation of the unit-specific parameters is
through the use of prior distributions. For each time series, the prior information can be
combined with the unit-specific likelihood function to form a posterior. From a Bayesian
perspective the posterior distribution then can be used to derive a forecast that minimizes
posterior expected loss. From a frequentist perspective one obtains a forecast that will have
some bias, but in a mean-squared-error sense, the resulting reduction in sampling variance
might dominate the introduction of bias. The key insight in panel data applications is that
in the absence of any meaningful subjective prior information, one can extract information
from the cross section and equate the prior distribution with the cross-sectional distribution
of unit-specific coefficients.

        There are several ways of implementing this basic idea. An empirical Bayes imple-
mentation creates a point estimate of the cross-sectional distribution of the heterogeneous
coefficients and then condition the subsequent posterior calculations on the estimated prior
distribution.1 In fact, the classic James-Stein estimator for a vector of means can be inter-
preted as an estimator constructed as follows. In the first step a prior is generated by fitting
a normal distribution to a cross-section of observations. In a second step, this prior is then

    Empirical Bayes methods have a long history in the statistics literature going back to Robbins (1956);
see Robert (1994) for a textbook treatment.

combined with the unit-specific likelihood function to generate a posterior estimate of the
unknown mean for that unit. In a panel setting the implementation is more involved but
follows the same steps. If the model is linear in the coefficients and the forecast is evalu-
ated under a quadratic forecast error loss function, then Tweedie's formula, which expresses
the posterior mean of the heterogeneous coefficients as the maximum likelihood estimate
corrected by a function of the cross-sectional density of sufficient statistic, can be used to
construct a forecast without having to explicitly estimate a prior distribution for the hetero-
geneous coefficients. This insight has been recently used by Brown and Greenshtein (2009),
Gu and Koenker (2017a,b), and Liu, Moon, and Schorfheide (2019).

   Unfortunately, Tweedie's formula does not extend to nonlinear panel data models. Thus,
rather than pursuing an Empirical Bayes strategy, we will engage in a full Bayesian anal-
ysis by specifying a hyperprior for the distribution of heterogeneous coefficients and then
constructing a joint posterior for the coefficients of this hyperprior as well as the actual
unit-specific coefficients. While the computations are more involved, this approach can in
principle handle quite general nonlinearities. Moreover, it is possible to generate point pre-
dictions under more general loss functions, as well as interval and density forecasts. For a
linear panel data model, a full Bayesian analysis is implemented by Liu (2018).

   The contributions of our paper are threefold. First, we extend the implementation of the
full Bayesian estimation in Liu (2018) to the dynamic panel Tobit model with heteroskedastic
innovations and correlated random effects. Second, in regard to interval forecasting, we
construct forecasts that target average posterior coverage probability across all units in our
panel instead of pointwise coverage probability for each unit. These forecasts are obtained
from highest posterior density sets that are constructed using the same threshold for each
unit instead of unit-specific thresholds. Because the predictive distributions associated with
the Tobit models are mixtures of discrete and continuous distributions, interval forecasts may
also take the form of the union of an interval and the value zero or simply the value zero
(singleton). For this reason we will refer to these forecasts as set instead of interval forecasts
throughout this paper. Both in the Monte Carlo study and the empirical application the
proposed Bayesian set forecasts have good frequentist coverage properties in the cross-section.
This basic insight has been used in the literature on nonparametric function estimation and
dates back to Wahba (1983) and Nychka (1988).

   Third, we present a novel application in which we forecast bank-level charge-off rates.
Our empirical analysis is based on more than 100 short panel data sets with a time dimension
of T = 10. These panel data sets include predominantly credit card (CC) and residential
This Version: December 10, 2019                                                               3


real estate (RRE) loans and cover various (overlapping) time periods. For each data set,
we consider several model specifications that differ with respect to assumptions about the
correlation between heterogeneous coefficients and initial conditions (random versus corre-
lated random effects), heterogeneity in the variances of the error terms (homoskedasticity
versus heteroskedasticity) and the distributional assumptions about the distribution of the
heterogeneous coefficients (Normal versus flexible). The model with flexibly modeled corre-
lated random effects and heteroskedasticity serves as a benchmark. We conduct a variety
of posterior predictive checks to document that this model is able to capture the salient
features of our data.

   We compare Bayesian density, set, and point forecasts for the various specifications.
Forecasts from a Tobit model that allows for heterogeneous coefficients, clearly dominate
forecasts from a model that imposes homogeneity. Modeling heteroskedasticity improves
the density and set forecasts substantially. Set forecasts are evaluated based on average (in
the cross section) length and coverage probability. We show how to construct Bayesian set
forecasts that target average posterior coverage probability in the cross section. With respect
to average length, these forecasts dominate traditional set forecasts that are constructed by
targeting pointwise posterior coverage probability. Our empirical model includes local house
prices and unemployment rates as additional predictors. The estimated effects of these
predictors in the benchmark specification are qualitatively and quantitatively plausible.

   Our paper relates to several branches of the literature. The papers most closely related
are Gu and Koenker (2017a,b), Liu (2018), and Liu, Moon, and Schorfheide (2019). All four
of these papers focus on the estimation of the heterogeneous coefficients in linear panel data
models and the subsequent use of the estimated coefficients for the purpose of prediction.
Only the full Bayesian analysis in Liu (2018) has a natural extension to nonlinear models.
Liu, Moon, and Schorfheide (2019), building on Brown and Greenshtein (2009), show that
an empirical Bayes implementation based on Tweedie's formula can asymptotically (as the
cross-sectional dimension tends to infinity) lead to forecasts that are as accurate as the so-
called oracle forecasts. Here the oracle forecast is an infeasible benchmark that assumes that
all homogeneous coefficients, as well as the distribution of the heterogeneous coefficients, are
known to the forecaster. Liu (2018) shows that the predictive density obtained from the full
Bayesian analysis converges strongly to the oracle's predictive density as the cross-section
gets large.

   There is a Bayesian literature on the estimation of censored regression models. The
idea of using data augmentation and Gibbs sampling to estimate a Tobit model dates back

to Chib (1992). To sample the latent uncensored observations we rely on an algorithm
tailored toward dynamic Tobit models by Wei (1999). Sampling from truncated normal
distributions is implemented with a recent algorithm of Botev (2017). Our benchmark
model is most closely related to the Bayesian semiparametric panel Tobit model of Li and
Zheng (2008). They used their model to study female labor supply and estimated average
partial effects and average transition probabilities. We generalize Li and Zheng's model by
introducing heteroskedasticity through a latent unit-specific error variance and allowing for a
more flexible form of correlated random effects. As mentioned previously, the former is very
important for the density and set forecast performance. A broader survey of the literature on
Bayesian estimation of univariate and multivariate censored regression models can be found
in the handbook chapter by Li and Tobias (2011).
       We model the unknown distribution of the heterogeneous coefficients (intercepts and
innovation variances) as Dirichlet process mixtures of Normals. Even though we do not
emphasize the nonparametric aspect of this modeling approach (due to a truncation, our
mixtures are strictly speaking finite and in that sense parametric), our paper is related to
the literature on nonparametric density modeling using Dirichlet process mixtures (DPM).2
Examples of papers that use DPMs in the panel data context are Hirano (2002), Burda and
Harding (2013), Rossi (2014), and Jensen, Fisher, and Tkac (2015). The implementation of
our Gibbs sampler relies on Ishwaran and James (2001, 2002). If we restrict the number of
mixture components to be equal to one, then we obtain a Normal correlated random effects
model as a special case.
       The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the specification
of our dynamic panel Tobit model, a characterization of the posterior predictive distribution
for future observations, and discusses the construction and evaluation of point, density,
and set forecasts. Section 3 provides details on how we model the correlated random effects
distribution and heteroskedasticity. It also presents the prior distributions for the parametric
and flexible components of the model, and outlines a posterior sampler. We conduct a Monte
Carlo experiment in Section 4 to examine the performance of the proposed techniques in a
controlled environment. The empirical application in which we forecast charge-off rates on
various types of loans for a panel of banks is presented in Section 5. Finally, Section 6
concludes. A description of the data sets, additional empirical results, and some derivations
are relegated to the Online Appendix.

    Keane and Stavrunova (2011) introduce a smooth mixture of Tobits to model a cross-section of healthcare
expenditures. Our model is related, but different in that we are using a DPM to average across different
intercept values and innovation variances.

2         Model Specification and Forecast Evaluation

Throughout this paper we consider the following dynamic panel Tobit model with heteroge-
neous intercepts and innovation variances:

                                                            2                              2
            yit = yit I{yit  0},   yit |(yit -1 , xit , i , i , ,  )  N i + yit-1 +  xit , i ,             (1)

where i = 1, . . . , N , t = 1, . . . , T , and I{y  a} is the indicator function that is equal to one
if y  a and equal to zero otherwise. The nx О 1 vector xit comprises a set of regressors
and we define the homogeneous parameter  = [,  ] . It is assumed that conditional on
the heterogenous parameters and the regressors xit the observations yit are cross-sectionally
                                                                
independent. Our specification uses the lagged latent variable yit -1 on the right-hand side
because it is more plausible for our empirical application. The Bayesian computations de-
scribed in Section 3.2 below can be easily adapted to the alternative model, in which the
lagged censored variable yit-1 appears on the right-hand side.

        We model the heterogeneous parameters as correlated random effects (CRE) with density

assuming cross-sectional independence of the heterogeneous coefficients.3 Here  is the pa-
rameter vector that indexes the CRE distribution, which we flexibly represent by a mixture
of Normal distributions. The model is completed with the specification of a prior distribution
for ,  . In the remainder of this section, we will discuss the posterior predictive density in
Section 2.1, point and density forecasting in Section 2.2, and the construction and evaluation
of set forecasts in Section 2.3.


2.1        Posterior Predictive Densities

Our goal is to generate forecasts of Y1:N,T +h = y1,T +h , . . . , yN,T +h } conditional on the ob-
servations

                        Y1:N,0:T =       (y10 , . . . , yN 0 ), . . . , (y1T , . . . , yN T )
                     X1:N,0:T +h =       (x10 , . . . , xN 0 ), . . . , (x1T +h , . . . , xN T +h ) .
    3                                                        2
    In principle the conditional distribution of (i , yi 0 , i ) could also depend on xit for t > 0, but in our
applications we simply condition on the initial value of the regressors.
This Version: December 10, 2019                                                                     6

         
Because yit +h depends on xit+h we are implicitly assuming that the sequence X1:N,T +1:T +h is
known once the forecast is made. In our application we focus on h = 1-step-ahead forecasts
and define xit as house price growth and unemployment growth in period t - 1.

   Define 1:N = (1 , . . . , N ) and 1: N = (1 , . . . , N ). Assuming that X1:N,T +1:T +h contains
                            2
no information about (1:N , 1:N , ,  ) and is strictly exogenous, we can write the posterior
distribution of the parameters and time-T latent variables as

where  denotes proportionality. Here, p(Yi,1:T |Yi, 1:T ) and p(yi0 |yi0 ) represent the censoring
                                                         
(in slight abuse of notation). The distribution of yit |yit is a unit point mass that is located at
                                                                                                 2

is the CRE density, and p() and p( ) are priors for  and  , respectively.

   The posterior predictive distribution for unit i is given by

             p(yiT +h |Y1:N,0:T , X1:N,0:T +h )                                                   (3)
                                                                                    2

Draws from the density p(yiT +h |yiT , Xi,T +1:T +h , i , i ,  ) can be generated by forward simu-
                                                
lation of the autoregressive law of motion for yit in (1). Using decision-theoretic arguments,
one can derive point and set forecasts from the predictive density p(yiT +h |Yi,0:T , Xi,0:T +h ).
To simplify the notation, we will drop X1:N,0:T +h from the conditioning set in the remain-
der of this section. We denote expectations and probabilities under the posterior predictive

Both LPS and CRPS are proper scoring rules, meaning that it is optimal for the forecaster
to truthfully reveal her predictive density.


2.3       Constructing and Evaluating Set Forecasts

We construct set forecasts Ci,T +h|T (Y1:N,0:T ) from the posterior predictive distribution p(yiT +h |Y1:N,0:T )
in (3). We consider the following types of set forecasts:

                                  {0},       [0, bi ],     {0}  [ai , bi ],   .                        (8)

The {0} values are generated by the discrete portion of the predictive density, whereas the
interval components are obtained from the continuous portion of the predictive density; see
the decomposition in (4). Throughout this paper, we restrict the interval portions to be
connected. The empty set  may arise for some units if we target an average coverage
probability in the cross section. We measure the volume of the sets using the Euclidean
length of the interval portions of the sets, which are 0, bi , bi - ai , and 0, respectively.

       The assessment of the set forecasts in our simulation study and the empirical application
is based on the cross-sectional coverage frequency

                                     N
                                 1
                                           I yiT +h  Ci,T +h|T (Y1:N,0:T )                             (9)
                                 N   i=1


and the average length of the sets Ci,T +h|T (Y1:N,0:T ). Rather than trading off average length
against deviations of average coverage frequency from the nominal coverage probability in a
single criterion, we will simply report both.4

       To generate the set forecasts, we adopt a Bayesian approach and require that the proba-
bility of {yiT +h  Ci,T +h|T (Y1:N,0:T )} conditional on having observed Y1:N,0:T is at least 1 - .
Given that the estimation of the Tobit model is executed with Bayesian techniques, the use
of posterior predictive credible sets is natural. Moreover, it is known from the literature on
   4
    Various approaches to rank interval forecasts are discussed in Askanazi, Diebold, Schorfheide, and Shin
(2018).
This Version: December 10, 2019                                                                                     9


nonparametric function estimation, that Bayesian credible sets can have good frequentist
average coverage probability; see Wahba (1983) and Nychka (1988). We will distinguish be-
tween forecasts that are constructed to satisfy the coverage probability constraint pointwise,
that is,
                            y
                       PYiT +h
                         1:N,0:T
                                 yiT +h  Ci,T +h|T (Y1:N,0:T )  1 -  for all i,

and sets that are constructed to satisfy the constraint on average:

                                N
                            1           y
                                      PYiT +h
                                                yiT +h  Ci,T +h|T (Y1:N,0:T )  1 - .
                            N   i=1
                                        1:N,0:T




The latter approach allows the sets Ci,T +h|T (Y1:N,0:T ) for some units i to be "shortened" in
the sense that their posterior credible level drops below 1 - , whereas sets for other units
are "lengthened."

    In the remainder of this subsection we describe how the endpoints ai and bi of the interval
                                                                              y
portion of the set forecasts are determined. Let i0 = PYiT +h
                                                        1:N,0:T
                                                                {yiT +h = 0} and define the
interval length li = bi - ai . The problem of minimizing the average length subject to the
constraint on coverage probability is given by

                                              ai +li
                  min li         s.t.                  pc (yiT +h |Y1:N,0:T )dyiT +h = 1 -  - i0 ,                (10)
                   ai ,li                    ai
                                            ai  0.

Because pc (yiT +h |Y1:N,0:T ) represents the continuous part of the predictive density, we deduce
that li > 0 provided that 1 -  - i0 > 0. The first-order conditions are

     (li ) : 1 = х pc (ai + li |Y1:N,0:T )
     (ai ) : 0 = х pc (ai + li |Y1:N,0:T ) - pc (ai |Y1:N,0:T ) + хi,a ,              хi,a и ai = 0,   хi,a  0,

where х and хi,a are the Lagrange multipliers for the coverage probability constraint and
the non-negativity constraint for ai , respectively. If хi,a > 0 and ai = 0, then the set
forecast is of the form [0, bi ]; otherwise it takes the form {0}  [ai , bi ], where pc (bi |Y1:N,0:T ) =
pc (ai |Y1:N,0:T ). If, in addition, the continuous portion of the predictive density is unimodal,
then the interval part of the set forecast is the HPD interval yiT +h | pc (yiT +h |Y1:N,0:T )  C ,
where C = pc (ai + li |Y1:N,0:T ).

    Targeting average coverage probability changes the derivation as follows. Define »0 =

                      {yiT +h = 0}. If » 0 > 1 -  then we can set the forecasts for some units
to Ci,T +h|T (Y1:N,0:T ) =  and for the other units to Ci,T +h|T (Y1:N,0:T ) = {0} such that the
constraint on the coverage probability is satisfied. Otherwise, we need to solve

                               N                   N      ai +li
                           1                   1
              min                    li   s.t.                     pc (yiT +h |Y1:N,0:T )dyiT +h = 1 -  - »0,      (11)

                           N   i=1
                                               N   i=1   ai

                                              ai  0 and li  0 i.

Because it is conceivable that the solution implies that for some i the forecast is given by {0},
we now also account for the constraint li  0 with Lagrange multiplier хil . The first-order
conditions take the form

               1   х
      (li ) :    =   p(ai + li |Y1:N,0:T ) + хi,l , хi,l и li = 0, хi,l  0
              N    N
                  х
      (ai ) : 0 =    p(ai + li |Y1:N,0:T ) - p(ai |Y1:N,0:T ) + хi,a , хi,a и ai = 0,                   хi,a  0.
                  N

The first-order condition for li implies that for all units with li > 0 the densities at the
endpoint bi = ai + li are identical. If the continuous parts of the predictive densities are
unimodal for each i, then the first-order conditions imply that there is a common HPD
threshold C for all i such that the interval components of the set forecasts are of the form
 yiT +h | pc (yiT +h |Y1:N,0:T )  C .



3     Correlated Random Effects, Priors, and Posteriors
                                                                   2
We provide a characterization of the CRE distribution p(i , yi 0 , i |xi0 ,  ) and a specification
of the prior distribution for (,  ) in Section 3.1. Section 3.2 provides a description of the
posterior sampler and Section 3.3 discusses potential generalizations of the dynamic panel
Tobit model.


3.1     Correlated Random Effects and Prior Distributions

We will start out with a CRE specification in which we allow for heteroskedasticity, the
                               2                                   2
heterogeneous parameters i and i are independent, and p(i , yi 0 , i |xi0 ,  ) belongs to a
flexible family of mixtures. Subsequently, we will consider various special cases of this
This Version: December 10, 2019                                                                     11

model, including a more tightly parameterized p(i , yi 0 , i |xi0 ,  ), random effects (RE), and
                                                                      2
homoskedasticity. At last, we will consider a prior under which i and i are correlated.

      Before we estimate the model specifications, we standardize the regressors xit to have zero
mean and unit variance. This will facilitate the scaling of the prior distributions. Our prior
depends on various hyperparameters that can be chosen by the user. The prior variances for
the conditional mean parameters are scaled by  . We set  = 5 in the simulation study in
Section 4 and the empirical analysis in Section 5, which makes these priors fairly diffuse. In
                                          2
order to scale the prior distribution for i , we define the cross-sectional average of the time-
                                           N
series variances of yit : let V  =   1
                                     N     i=1   Vi (yit ). For all other hyperparameters we report a
default choice based on the use of similar priors in other studies. These default choices seem
to work well in the application in that they provide a reasonable trade-off between flexibility
and model complexity.

      The description of the CRE and prior distribution involves various parametric prob-
ability distributions in addition to the Normal distribution that appeared in (1). We use
B (a, b), G(a, b), and IG(a, b) to denote the Beta, Gamma, and Inverse Gamma distributions,
respectively. The pair (,  2 ) has a Normal-Inverse-Gamma distribution N IG(m, v, a, b) if
 2  IG(a, b) and | 2  N (m,  2 v ). Finally, the pair (, ) has a matricvariate Normal-
Inverse-Wishart distribution M N IW (M, V, S,  ) if   IW (S,  ) has an inverse Wishart
distribution and vec()|  N (vec(M ),   V ).

Flexible CRE with heteroskedasticity. We assume that the baseline CRE distribution
factorizes as follows:

                                        2                                  2
                           p(i , yi 0 , i |xi0 ,  ) = p(i , yi0 |xi0 ,  )p(i | ).


                         2
The distribution of (i , i ) is a mixture of Normal distributions:

                   i         iid
                    
                          xi0  N [1, xi0 ]k , k with prob. ,k ,              k = 1, . . . , K,    (12)
                   yi 0


where k is an (nx + 1) О 2 matrix and k is a 2 О 2 matrix.5 Similarly, we model ln i
                                                                                   2
                                                                                     as

    In our simulations we choose K = 20. This leads to the following uniform bound on the approximation

the prior mean of  (» = 1) and a cross-sectional sample size N = 1000.

   Our prior for ,  takes the following form: the homogeneous regression parameters are
distributed according to

                                      N (0,  Inx +1 ),      = 5.                                 (14)

To generate a prior for the CRE distribution we use Dirichlet Process Mixtures (DPM).
We fix the maximum number of mixture components at a large number K which we set
equal to 20 in the simulation exercise and the empirical analysis. The prior for the mixture
probabilities ,1:K is generated by a truncated stick breaking process T SB (1,  , K ) of the
form

We use G(2, 2) priors for the hyperparameter  of the T SB (1,  , K ) process. The prior
for the mixture probabilities ,1:K takes the same form, with  replaced by  .
                                               
   The coefficient matrices k and k for p(i , yi 0 |xi0 ,  ) are assumed to follow a MNIW
distribution:
                              iid
                     (k , k )  M N IW 0,  I3 , 4I2 , 7),        k = 1, . . . , K.                (16)

The coefficients k and k have N IG priors:

                    iid
            (k , k )  N IG ln V  - ln(2)/2, 1, 3, (3 - 1) ln 2 ,             k = 1, . . . , K.   (17)

In the specification of these two distributions we already fixed some of the parameters of the
MNIW and NIG distributions in light of the subsequent application. This parameterization
                                                                                   2
of the heteroskedasticity prior in (17) is chosen so that the implied prior mean E[i ] and
                 2
prior variance V[i ] matches the one implied by the prior used in the homoskedastic versions
of the Tobit model (see (18) below).

Random Effects (RE). The CRE specification can be simplified to an RE specification as
follows. We factorize

                                       2                               2
                          p(i , yi 0 , i |xi0 ,  ) = p(i | )p(yi0 | )p(i | ).


        2
While p(i | ) remains the same as in (13), we set

                         iid
                     i  N (,k , ,k ) with prob. ,k ,               k = 1, . . . , K           (19)
                         iid
                    yi 0  N (y , y ).


The prior for the mixture probabilities is the same as in (15) and the priors for the coefficients
of the normal distributions are

                         iid
             (,k , ,k )  N IG(0, , 3, 2),        (y , y )  N IG(0, , 3, 2),            = 5.   (20)

By selecting between CRE versus RE, heteroskedastic versus homoskedastic, and flexible
(k > 1) versus Normal distributions (k = 1) we can generate eight specifications.


3.2    Posterior Sampling

Draws from the posterior distribution can be obtained with a Gibbs sampling algorithm.
We will subsequently describe the conditional distributions over which the Gibbs sampler
iterates. We will focus on the flexible CRE specification with heteroskedasticity, which is
the most complicated specification. A key feature of the Gibbs sampler is that it uses
                                                                  
data augmentation by sampling the sequences of latent variables Yi, 0:T , i = 1, . . . , N ; see
Tanner and Wong (1987) and for the Tobit model Chib (1992) and Wei (1999). The sampler
for the flexible mixture representation of the CRE distribution is based on Ishwaran and
                                                                                  
James (2001, 2002). With the exception of the treatment of the latent variables Yi, 0:T , the
computations for the Tobit model are very similar to the ones for the linear model studied
in Liu (2018).

    In order to characterize the conditional posterior distributions for the Gibbs sampler, we
                                                                       2
introduce some additional notation. Because p(i , yi 0 |xi0 ,  ) and p(i | ) are mixture distri-

butions, ex post each (i , yi 0 ) and i is associated with one of the K mixture components,
respectively. We denote the component affiliations by i, and i,  {1, . . . , K }, respectively.
                                            2
Step 1: Drawing from Yi, 0:T |(Yi,0:T , i , i , i,y , i, , ,  ). To fix ideas, consider the follow-
ing sequence of observations yi0 , . . . , yiT :

                                                                                         
                                             yi 0 , yi1 , 0, 0, 0, yi5 , yi6 , 0, 0, 0, yi10 .


                                                            
Our model implies that whenever yit > 0 we can deduce that yit = yit . Thus, we can
focus our attention on periods in which yit = 0. In the hypothetical sample we observe
two strings of censored observations: (yi2 , yi3 , yi4 ) and (yi7 , yi8 , yi9 ). We use t1 for the start
date of a string of censored observations and t2 for the end date. In the example we have
                                               (1)         (1)           (2)           (2)
two such strings, we write t1 = 2, t2 = 4, t1 = 7, t2 = 9. The goal is to characterize
p(Y  (1)   (1)   , Y  (2)   (2)   |Yi,0:T , . . .). Because of the AR(1) structure, observations in periods t <
    i,t1 :t2        i,t1 :t2
                                                                               
t1 - 1 and t > t2 + 1 contain no additional information about yit 1
                                                                    , . . . , yit 2
                                                                                    . Thus, we obtain

                                           
                        p(Yi,t (1) (1) , Y (2) (2) |Yi,0:T , . . .)

                            =      p(Yi,t (1) (1) |Y (1)       (1)    , . . .)p(Yi,t (2) (2) |Y (2)     (2)  , . . .),
                                          1  : t2
                                                    i,t 1 -1: t2   +1                1 :t2
                                                                                               i,t1 -1:t2 +1


which implies that we can sample each string of latent observations independently.

    Let s = t2 - t1 + 2 be the length of the segment that includes the string of censored
observations as well as the adjacent uncensored observations. Iterating the AR(1) law of
motion for yit forward from period t = t1 - 1 we deduce that the vector of random variables
   
[Yi,t 1 :t2
            , yit2 +1 ] conditional on yit1 -1 is multivariate normal with mean

M1:s|0 = [х1 , . . . , хs ] ,              х1 = i + yit1 -1 +  xit ,            х = i + х -1 +  xit for  = 2, . . . , s.
                                                                                                                          (21)
The covariance matrix takes                     the form

Here we use T N- (х, ) to denote a normal distribution that is truncated to satisfy y 
0. Draws from this truncated normal distribution can be efficiently generated using the
algorithm recently proposed by Botev (2017).

   There are two important special cases. First, suppose that t2 = T , meaning that the
last observation in the sample is censored. Then the mean vector and the covariance matrix
of the truncated normal distribution are given by (21) and (22) with the understanding
that s = t2 - t1 + 1. Second, suppose that t1 = 0, meaning that the initial observation
in the sample yi0 = 0. Because in this case the observation yit1 -1 = yi,-1 is missing, we
need to modify the expressions in (21) and (22). According to (12), the joint distribution of
      
(i , yi 0 ) is a mixture of normals. Using the mixture component affiliation i, , we can express
                                 2
yi 0 |(i xi0 )  N (х (i , xi0 ),  ). This leads to the mean vector

the formulas in (23) to obtain the mean and covariance parameters of the truncated normal

However, even conditional on the mixture component affiliation i, , the prior for i in (13) is
not conjugate and direct sampling is not possible. Instead, we sample from this non-standard
posterior via an adaptive random walk Metropolis-Hastings (RWMH) step.6
                                                   2
Step 4: Drawing from |(Y1:N,0:T , Y1:N,0:T , 1:N , 1:N , 1:N, , 1:N, ,  ). Conditional on the
                                                                2
latent variables Yi, 0:T and the heterogeneous coefficients i , i , we can express our model as


                                                iid  2
       yit - i = yit -1 +  xit + uit ,    uit  N (0, i ),        i = 1, . . . , N,   t = 1, . . . , T.   (29)

The temporal and spatial independence of the uit 's allows us to pool observations across i
and t. Under the Normal prior in (14), the posterior distribution of  = [,  ] is also Normal
and we can obtain draws by direct sampling.
                                                        2
Step 5: Drawing from (i, , i, )|(Yi,0:T , Yi, 0:T , i , i , ,  ). We describe how to draw the
component affiliation i, . Straightforward modifications lead to a sampler for i, . Note
that  contains the elements of 1:K , 1:K , and ,1:K . The prior probability that unit i is
affiliated with component k is given by ,k . Let »i,,k denote the posterior probability of
unit i belonging to component k conditional on the set of means 1:K and variances 1:K as
well as i . The »i,,k 's are given by

Note that the conditional distribution i |(yi 0 , xi0 , k , k ) is Normal, indicated by the nota-
tion pN (и), and can be derived from the joint normal distributions of the mixture components
   6
     We use an adaptive procedure based on Atchad┤  e and Rosenthal (2005) and Griffin (2016), which adap-
tively adjusts the random walk step size to keep acceptance rates around 30%.

Step 6: Drawing from  |(Y1:N,0:T , Y1: N,0:T , 1:N , 1:N , 1:N, , 1:N, ,  ). Sampling from the
conditional posterior of 1:K , 1:K , and ,1:K can be implemented as follows. Let n,k be
the number of units and J,k the set of units affiliated with component k . Both n,k and J,k
can be determined based on 1:N, . The conditional posterior of the component probabilities
takes the form of a generalized truncated stick breaking process

meaning that the k 's in (15) have a B 1 + n,k ,  +         j =k+1   n,j distribution. Conditional
on ,1:K the hyperparameter  has a Gamma posterior distribution of the form

                             |,1:K  G(2 + K - 1, 2 - ln ,K ).                                           (33)

The conditional posterior for (k , k ) takes the form

                                      2

Because here the prior p(k , k ) is MNIW and the likelhood                     iJ,k    p(i , yi 0 |k , k ) is
derived from a multivariate Normal linear regression model, the conditional posterior of
(k , k ) is also MNIW. All three conditional posteriors allow direct sampling. The deriva-
tions can be modified to obtain the conditional posterior of 1:K , 1:K , and ,1:K .
                                                                       2
Step 7: Drawing from the predictive density. Conditional on (yiT , i , i , ) and
xi,T +1:T +H , paths from the predictive distribution for yi,T +1:T +h can be easily generated by
simulating (1) forward.

Modifications for the simplified model specifications. If the CRE distribution is
modeled parametrically instead of flexibly, then the drawing of the component affiliations
(i, , i, ) in Step 5 and the drawing of и,1:K and  in Step 6 are unnecessary. One only
has to draw from the MNIW posterior of (1 , 1 ) and the NIG posterior of (1 , 1 ). Under
                        2
homoskedasticity, i.e., i =  2 for all i, we can pool (28) in Step 3 across t and i. In combi-
nation with the prior in (18) this leads to an IG posterior for  2 from which one can sample
directly. The RE specification requires modifications to Step 1, because the distribution

of yi0 is now simplified to yi 0  N (y , y ), to Step 2 because the prior distribution of i
is different, and to Step 6 because the pairs of VAR coefficients (k , k ) are replaced by
(,k , ,k ) and (y , y ), which leads to NIG posteriors.


3.3      Generalizations

The basic dynamic panel Tobit model in (1) can be generalized in several dimensions. First,
it is fairly straightforward to allow for randomly missing observations by modifying the
inference about the latent variables yit in Step 1 of Section 3.2. Rather than drawing the
latent variables in Step 1 of the posterior sampler from a truncated normal distribution, we
need to draw them from a regular normal distribution.

    Second, the panel setup can be extended to richer limited-dependent variable models.
                                                               
Let Yit = [y1,it , . . . , yM,it ] and Yit = [y1,it , . . . , yM,it ] and consider


                                                               2                                2
               Yit = f (Yit ),        Yit |(Yit -1 , xit , i , i ,  )  p(Yit |Yit-1 , xit , i , i ,  ),   (35)
                          (i , Yi    2                 2
                                 0 , i )|  p(i , Yi0 , i |,  ),


                                                                                           
where f (и) is a known function, p(Yit |и) is a known homogeneous transition density for Yit ,
and p(i , Yi    2
            0 , i |и) is the correlated random-effects distribution. In the benchmark model
(1) the dependent variable is a scalar, i.e., M = 1, the transformation of the latent variable
                                                                                        2
is given by f (yit ) = yit I{yit  0}, and the transition density is N (i + yit +  xit , i ). In
addition to this standard Tobit model, Amemiya (1985) defines four generalizations. For
instance, in the so-called Type 2 Tobit model M = 2 and the f (и) function takes the form

                                                                                
                         f (и) :   y1,it = I{y1,it  0},        y2,it = y2,it I{y1,it  0},


in which the censoring of observation y2,it depends on the observed sign of the latent vari-
      
able y1,it . In order to implement richer Tobit models in our dynamic panel framework one
has to modify the sampler for the conditional posterior distribution of the latent variables
                       2
Yi, 0:T |(Yi,0:T , i , i , i, , i, , ,  ) in Step 1 above. For instance, a posterior sampler for the
(static) Type 2 Tobit model is discussed in Li and Tobias (2011). These extensions may be
of interest for other panel data forecasting applications with limited dependent variables.

4         Monte Carlo Experiment

The Monte Carlo experiment is based on the dynamic panel Tobit model in (1), which
we simplify by omitting the additional predictors xit and using an RE version. We will
                                                                                      2
endow the forecaster with knowledge of the true p(yi 0 ) and factorize p(i , yi0 , ln i | ) as
          
p(i | )p(yi 0 )p(ln i | ). The data generating process (DGP) is summarized in Table 1. We
set the autocorrelation parameter to  = 0.8 and consider skewed random effects distributions
             2
for i and ln i that are generated as mixtures of Normals.

        The simulated panel data sets consist of N = 1, 000 cross-sectional units and the number
of time periods in the estimation sample is T = 10. We generate one-step-ahead forecasts
for period t = T + 1. The fraction of zeros across all samples is 45% and for roughly 15% of
the cross-sectional units the sample consists of T = 10 zeros ("all zeros"). The measures of
forecast accuracy discussed in Sections 2.2 and 2.3 are first computed for the cross section
i = 1, . . . , N = 1, 000 and then average the performance statistics over the nsim = 100 Monte
Carlo repetitions.7

Model Specifications and Predictors. We will compare the performance of six predictors
described below: four Bayes predictors derived from different versions of the dynamic panel
Tobit model, a predictor derived from a Tobit model with homogeneous coefficients, and a
predictor from a linear model with homogeneous coefficients that ignores the censoring. The
prior distributions used for the estimation of the various models were described in Section 3.1
and are summarized in Table 2. Further implementation details are provided in the Online
Appendix.
    7
    If the performance statistic is linear, e.g., the coverage probability or the average length of credible sets,
then averaging the statistic is the same as pooling across i and across Monte Carlo samples.

Notes: The design of the experiment is summarized in Table 1. The true values for  is 0.8.


    We consider four versions of the dynamic panel Tobit model with random effects (see Sec-
tion 3.1 for details): (i) flexible RE and heteroskedasticity; (ii) Normal RE and heteroskedas-
ticity; (iii) flexible RE and homoskedasticity; and (iii) Normal RE and homoskedasticity.
Versions (b)-(d) are misspecified in light of the DGP. The pooled Tobit specification ignores
the heterogeneity in i , setting i =  for all i, and imposes homoskedasticity. Finally, the
pooled linear specification imposes i = , i =  2 for all i, and, in addition, ignores the
censoring of the observations during the estimation stage.

    To generate point, set, and density forecasts, we first generate draws from the posterior
                                                              
distribution of the model parameters and the latent variable yiT , and then, conditional on
                                                             h
each of these draws, simulate a trajectory {yiT +s , yiT +s }s=1 from the predictive distribution.
While we ignore the censoring in the estimation of the pooled linear specification, we do
account for it when we generate forecasts from the linear model.

Point Forecasts and Parameter Estimates. In Table 3 we report RMSEs for poste-
rior mean point forecasts. We decompose the RMSEs into a bias and standard deviation
component. We also report the bias and standard deviation of the posterior mean estimate
of  across Monte Carlo repetitions. The correctly specified dynamic Tobit model that ap-
proximates the RE distribution flexibly and allows for heteroskedasticity attains the smallest
RMSE. Forcing the RE distributions to be Normal leads to a slight deterioration in RMSE.
Incorrectly imposing homoskedasticity increases the RMSE more substantially because of a
loss in efficiency. The bias of all four panel Tobit predictors is essentially negligible and the
RMSEs are determined by the standard deviations of the forecast errors. The behavior of
forecast errors across model versions mirrors the behavior of the  estimates: they are un-

biased and the standard deviation increases if the heteroskedasticity is ignored. The pooled
Tobit and pooled linear predictors perform significantly worse as their estimates of  and
the resulting forecast errors are severely biased.

       Each model delivers a forecast of the probability that yiT +1 = 0. We use this probability
as a point forecast of I{yiT +1 = 0} and compute the corresponding RMSEs, which are also
reported in Table 3. The two heteroskedastic specifications dominate all other predictors.
Conditional on using a homoskedastic specification, shutting down heterogeneity (pooled
Tobit) does not lead to a further increase in RMSE. Ignoring the censoring when estimat-
ing the parameters of the homogeneous specification (pooled linear), raises the RMSE for
predicting zero versus non-zero from 0.23 to 0.41.8

       The panels of Figure 1 show the true RE density p(), hairlines that represent p(| )
generated from posterior draws of  , and histograms of the point estimates E[i |Y1:N,0:T ]. The
left panel corresponds to the flexible specification, whereas the panel on the right displays
results for the Normal specification. In both cases we allow for heteroskedasticity. The
posterior distribution of p(| ) under the flexible specification concentrates near the true
density, whereas, not surprisingly, the parametric specification yields to larger discrepancies
between the true RE density and the draws from the posterior distribution.

       To interpret the histograms of E[i |Y1:N,0:T ] in view of the plotted p()'s, we consider two
stylized examples that capture important aspects of our setup. First, suppose that the model

    If Y  {0, 1} and the probability of Y = 0 is p, then the RMSE associated with the optimal forecast
I{Y = 0} = 1 - p is p(1 - p)  0.5.

is static, linear, and homoskedastic, i.e., yit = i + uit , uit  N (0,  2 ) and i  N ( , 1), and
 is known (which implies p() is known). Therefore, the maximum likelihood estimator

In this example, the distribution of the posterior mean estimates is less dispersed than the
distribution of the i 's, but centered at the same mean, which is qualitatively consistent with
                                                                       
Figure 1. Second, to understand the effect of censoring, suppose that yit = i + uit and we
observe a sequence of zeros. The likelihood associated with this sequence of zeros is given
by T
   N (-i / ). The posterior mean for a sequence of zeros is then given by


                                                  TN (-/ )p()d
                           E[i |Y1:N,1:T = 0] =   T

and provides a lower bound for the estimator ^ i . If the i 's are sampled from the prior, we
should observe this posterior mean with probability       T
                                                          N - / p()d. Thus, according
to this example, there should be a spike in the left tail of the distributions of E[i |Y1:N,1:T ].
This spike is clearly visible in the two panels of Figure 1.

Density and Set Forecasts. The dynamic panel Tobit model generates a posterior pre-
dictive density for yiT +1 from which one can derive density and set forecasts. Both types
                                                                         
of forecasts reflect parameter uncertainty, potential uncertainty about yiT , and uncertainty
about future shocks. Accuracy statistics are reported in Table 4. To assess the density fore-

casts we compute LPS and CRPS; see Section 2.2. The larger LPS and the smaller CRPS
the better the forecast. As expected, the flexible specification with heteroskedasticity that
nests the DGP delivers the most accurate density forecasts. While replacing the flexible
representations of the RE distributions with Normal distributions only leads to a marginal
deterioration of forecast performance, imposing homoskedasticity generates a substantial
drop in accuracy.

    As discussed in Section 2.3, we consider two types of set forecasts. The first type targets
the average coverage probability in the cross-section ("average"), whereas the other type
targets the correct coverage probability for each unit i ("pointwise"). To assess the set
forecasts we compute the coverage frequency and the average length of 90% predictive sets.
The "average" sets constructed from the heteroskedastic specification have good frequentist
coverage properties. They attain coverage frequencies of 91.0% and 90.8%, respectively.

    The relationship between the nominal credible level of the set forecasts and the empirical
coverage frequency is delicate. Sampling in a Bayesian framework involves drawing parame-
ters from the appropriate distribution and generating data conditional on these parameters.
                                                                    2
Define Ui,T +1:T +h = {uiT +1 , . . . , uiT +h }. In our model (i , i , Ui,T +1:T +h ) are cross-sectionally
independent conditional on (,  ), but not unconditionally. Let (~            N ,  ~N ) be a draw from the
                                        2
posterior p(,  |Y1:N,0:T ). Then, (i , i  , Ui,T +1:T +h ) and hence Yi,T +1:T +h are cross-sectionally
independent conditional on (~  N , ~N , Y1:N,0:T ) and we can apply a law of large numbers for
independently and identically distributed random variables to deduce that (9) approximates
the random variable

Recall that by construction of the set forecasts we have

If the posterior distribution of (,  ) concentrates around a limit point, then under suitable
regularity conditions the discrepancy between (36) and (37) will asymptotically vanish.

    A comparison between the "average" and the "pointwise" set forecasts from the het-
eroskedastic models highlights that the average length of the "average" sets is indeed smaller.
Moreover, the coverage frequency of the "pointwise" sets exceeds the nominal coverage level

of 90% by a larger amount. We observe a similar pattern also for the set forecasts from the
homoskedastic model specifications. Overall, the homoskedastic specifications generate worse
set forecasts, in terms of coverage frequency and average length, than the heteroskedastic
specifications.



5     Empirical Analysis

We will now use different versions of the dynamic panel Tobit model to forecast loan charge-
off rates (charge-offs divided by the stock of loans in the previous period, multiplied by
400) for a panel of "small" banks, which we define to be banks with total assets of less
than one billion dollars. For these banks it is reasonable to assume that they operate in
local markets. Thus, we will include local changes in house prices and the unemployment
rate as additional predictors in the empirical model. As mentioned in the introduction, the
prediction of charge-off rates is interesting from a regulator's perspective because charge-offs
generate losses on loan portfolios. If these charge-offs are large, the bank may be entering a
period of distress and require additional capital.


5.1    Data

The raw data are obtained from "call reports" (FFIEC 031 and 041) that the banks have
to file with their regulator and are available through the website of the Federal Reserve
Bank of Chicago. Due to missing observations and outliers we restrict our attention to four
loan categories: credit card loans (CC), other consumer credit (CON), construction and
land development (CLD), and residential real estate (RRE). We construct rolling panel data
sets for each loan category that have a time dimension of twelve quarterly observations:
one observation y0 to initialize the estimation, T = 10 observations for estimation, and one
observation to evaluate the one-step-ahead forecast. The number of banks N in the cross
section varies depending on market size and date availability. The earliest sample considered
in the estimation starts (t = 0) in 2001Q2 and the most recent sample starts in 2016Q1. A
detailed description of the construction of the data set is provided in the Online Appendix.

    In the remainder of this section, we will present two types of results: (i) forecast evalua-
tion statistics and parameter estimates for RRE and CC charge-off rates based on samples
that cover the Great Recession and range from 2007Q2 (t = 0) to 2009Q4 (t = T + 1); (ii)

Notes: The estimation sample ranges from 2007Q2 (t = 0) to 2009Q4 (t = T = 10). We forecast 2010Q1
observations. "Zeros" refers to the fraction of zeros in the overall sample of observations (all i and all t),
"All Zeros" is the fraction of banks for which charge-off rates are zero in all periods. Mean, 75th percentile,
and maximum are computed based on the overall sample.


scatter plots summarizing forecast evaluation statistics for the 111 rolling samples that we
constructed (based on data availability) for the above-mentioned four loan categories.

    Table 5 contains some summary statistics for the two baseline samples. For the small
banks in our sample, residential real estate loans are an important part of their loan portfolio.
For approximately 45% of the banks these loans account for 20% to 50% of their loan
portfolio. For 25% of the banks in the sample, RREs sum up to more than 50% of their
loan portfolio. Credit card loans, on the other hand, make up less than 2% of the loans held
by the banks in our sample. Both baseline samples contain a substantial fraction of zero
charge-off observations: 76% for RREs and 43% for CC which makes it more challenging
to estimate the coefficients of our panel data models. Moreover, 61% of the banks in the
RRE sample never write off any loans between 2007 and 2009. The distribution of charge-off
rates, across banks and time, is severely skewed. For RREs the 75th percentile is 0 and
the maximum is 33.1% annualized. For CCs the corresponding figures are 4.07% and 260%,
respectively. A table with summary statistics for the remaining samples is provided in the
Online Appendix.


5.2     Charge-Off Rates and the Tobit Model

The forecasts are generated from model (1) with xit = [ ln HPIit-1 , URit-1 ] , where yit are
charge-off rates,  is the temporal difference operator, HPIit is a house price index, and URit
is the unemployment rate. Define  = [,  ] . The model is completed by the specification
of a CRE distribution and a prior:

                                             
                                      p i , yi 0 , i |xi0 ,  ,   p ,  .
This Version: December 10, 2019                                                                            27

                                                                      
In the empirical analysis below we consider various choices of p(i , yi 0 , i |xi0 ,  ) that were
described in Section 3.1.

         The Tobit model is consistent with the following stylized model. Suppose that bank i
has issued a continuum of loans indexed by j  [0, 1] in the constant amount of                       and let
(j ) be the probability of repayment of loan j . We assume that the bank writes off the loan
j if the repayment probability falls below a threshold . Then, we can write the charge-off
as
                                          x(j ) = I{(j )  }.                                             (38)

Let Fit () = F ( - хit ) be the cumulative distribution function of repayment probabilities
and assume that it belongs to a location family with a location parameter хit that varies
across banks and time. Then the charge-off rate is given by

                                                                   
                         yit = F ( - хit ) = F (yit ),      where yit =  - хit .                         (39)

Under the assumption that F (и) is the cdf of a random variable that is uniformly distributed
on the unit interval (or has a cdf that is locally linear near zero) we obtain for values of
yit  1:9
                                                         
                                           yit = yit I {yit  0} ,                                        (40)
                                                              
which is the censoring used in (1). In our specification for yit the heterogenous intercept
i can be interpreted as a bank-specific measure of the quality of the loan portfolio, the
autoregressive term captures the persistence of the composition of the loan portfolio over
time, and the covariates shift the density of repayment probabilities.


5.3         Density Forecasts

We begin the empirical analysis by comparing the density forecast performance of several
variants of (1) for the two baseline samples. This comparison includes forecasts from a
Tobit model and a linear model with homogeneous intercepts and homoskedastic innovation
variances. Table 6 reports LPS (the larger the better) and CRPS (the smaller the better).
Several observations stand out. First, allowing for heteroskedasticity improves the density
forecasts unambiguously. For RRE the CRE specification leads to more accurate density
forecasts than the RE specification. However, the gain from modeling the distribution of
     9                                              
    In the empirical analysis we use a scaling for yit which implies that it is between 0 and 400 instead of 0
and 1.

the heterogeneous coefficients in a flexible manner is small. For CC charge-off rates the
predictive scores for the flexible CRE and RE specifications are essentially the same and
slightly dominate the scores of the Normal specifications.

   Figure 2 summarizes the LPS comparisons for all 111 samples. The left panel compares
predictive scores from the heteroskedastic specifications versus homoskedastic specifications
using flexibly modeled correlated random effects. The center panel contrasts LPS obtained
from flexible and Normal CRE distributions. Finally, the right panel assesses the importance
of the correlation between the heterogeneous intercept and the initial observations and the
regressors. The solid lines are 45-degree lines and the blue and red circles correspond to the
scores associated with the baseline RRE and CC samples reported in Table 6. The figure
shows that the results for the baseline samples are qualitatively representative: incorporating
heteroskedasticity is important for density forecasting whereas accuracy differentials between
Normal and flexible CREs on the one hand, and CREs versus REs are small. In view of these
results, we will subsequently focus on the flexible CRE specification with heteroskedasticity.

5.4     Parameter Estimates and Predictive Checks

Parameter estimates of the common coefficients for the flexible CRE specification with het-
eroskedasticity are reported in Table 7. We report posterior means and 90% credible inter-
vals. Both samples exhibit mild autocorrelation. The point estimate of  is 0.22 for RRE and
0.46 for CC. A reduction in house prices leads to an increase in the charge-off rates for RRE
and CC which is consistent with the narrative of the Great Recession. Likewise, a rise in the
unemployment rate is associated with higher charge-off rates. The effect of unemployment
changes is more pronounced for RRE loans than for CC loans. In fact, the credible interval
for the CC sample also contains some negative values.

    Because we are using standardized regressors in our estimation, the numerical values in
Table 7 are not directly interpretable. The mean of the pooled log HPI changes in our sample

is -0.012 and corresponds to a 4.8% drop at an annualized rate. The standard deviation is
0.014. Suppose that house prices drop by an additional one percent within a quarter. For
1 = 4, this leads to an increase of the charge-off rate by 4  (-0.01)/0.014 = 2.86 percentage
points relative to the baseline value. The average change in the unemployment rate is 0.47
percentage points per quarter and the standard deviation is 0.46. Suppose that 2 = 5 and
the increase in the unemployment rate within a quarter is 0.5 percentages higher than its
baseline value. In response, the charge-off rate rises by 5  0.5/0.46 = 5.43 percentage points.
                   The distributions of posterior mean estimates of the heterogeneous coefficients are de-
picted in Figure 3. We use the AR coefficient  to rescale i and i . The panels on the
left and in the center of the figure show histograms for the posterior means of i and i ,
respectively, whereas the panels on the right contain scatter plots that illustrate the corre-
lation between the posterior means of intercepts and shock standard deviations. A notable

feature of the histograms for the posterior means of i /(1 - ) are the spikes in the left tail
of the distribution.10 The spikes correspond to banks with predominantly zero charge-off
rates. For these banks, the sample contains very little information about i other than that
it has to be sufficiently small to explain the zero charge-off rates. In turn, the posterior mean
estimate is predominantly driven by the prior. Similar spikes are visible in the histograms
for the posterior means of the re-scaled log standard deviations and the right panels show
that the i spikes and the i spikes are associated with the same banks.

       Recall from Table 5 that the RRE sample contains more zero charge-off observations
than the CC sample. Accordingly, the spikes in the RRE histograms are associated with
larger mass. The unconditional distribution of charge-off rates in the CC sample has a non-
zero mean and a longer right tail. This is captured in the histograms by larger posterior
mean estimates of i and a more pronounced right tail. The estimated re-scaled standard
deviations are also larger for the CC sample than for the RRE sample. The large dispersion
of i estimates in both samples is consistent with the substantially better density forecast
performance of the heteroskedastic models. For the RRE loan sample small estimates of i
are associated with near zero estimates of i , whereas large estimates of i are associated
with a broad range of i estimates. This pattern is less pronounced for the CC sample.

       In order to assess the fit of the estimated panel Tobit model, we report posterior pre-
dictive checks in Figure 4. A posterior predictive check examines the extent to which the
estimated model can generate artificial data with sample characteristics that are similar to
the characteristics of the actual data that have been used for estimation.11 Consider the
top left panel of the figure. Here, the particular characteristic, or sample statistic, under
consideration is the cross-sectional density of yiT +1 conditional on yiT +1 > 0. The black line
is computed from the actual RRE loan sample. Each blue hairline is generated as follows:
(i) take a draw of (, ,  ) from the posterior distribution; (ii) conditional on these draws
                                                                    ~1:N,0+T +1 ; (iv) compute
generate 1:N , Y  , and  2 ; (iii) simulate a panel of observations Y

                                   ~1:N,T +1 . The swarm of hairlines visualizes the posterior

predictive distribution. A model passes a posterior predictive check if the observed value of
the sample statistic does not fall too far into the tails of the posterior predictive distribution.
Rather than formally computing p-values, we will focus on a qualitative assessment of the
model fit.

   Recall that these spikes were also present in the Monte Carlo simulation; see Figure 1.

   Textbook treatments of posterior predictive checks can be found, for instance, in Lancaster (2004) and
Geweke (2005).

Notes: Heteroskedastic flexible CRE specification. The estimation sample ranges from 2007Q2 (t = 0) to
2009Q4 (t = T = 10). The black lines (left and right panels) and the histogram (center panels) are computed
from the actual data. Each hairline corresponds to a simulation of a sample Y  ~1:N,0:T +1 of the panel Tobit
model based on a parameter draw from the posterior distribution.


                   By and large, the estimated models for RRE and CC charge-off rates do a fairly good job
in reproducing the cross-sectional densities of yiT +1 in that some of the hairlines generated
from the posterior cover the observed densities. The only discrepancies arise for charge-off
values close to zero. With high probability, the densities computed from simulated data have
less mass than the observed RRE and CC densities. Moreover, the modes of the simulated
densities are slightly to the right and lower than the mode in the two actual densities. The
hairlines depict the densities conditional on yiT +1 > 0. In the RRE sample the fraction of
yiT +1 = 0 is 0.71. The 90% posterior predictive interval is [0.73, 0.79]. For CC charge-off
rates, the value in the data is 0.43 and the posterior predictive interval is [0.37, 0.47].

                   The center panels of Figure 4 focus on the estimated models' ability to reproduce the
number of zero charge-off observations. For each unit i we compute the number of periods in
which yit = 0. Because T = 10 the maximum number of zeros between t = 0 and t = T + 1
is 12. The histogram is generated from the actual data, whereas the hairlines are computed
from the simulated data. For instance, 61% of the banks do not write off any RRE loans in
the twelve quarters of the sample and roughly 5% of the banks write off RRE loans in every
This Version: December 10, 2019                                                            33


period. Overall, the estimated models do remarkably well in reproducing the patterns in the
data. For RRE loans, the model captures the large number of all-zero samples and the fairly
uniform distribution of the number of samples with zero to nine instances of yit = 0. The
only deficiency is that the model cannot explain the absence of samples with ten or eleven
instances of zero charge-off rates. In the case of CC loans, the estimated model underpredicts
the number of all-zero samples but generally is able to match the rest of the distribution.

   The last column of Figure 4 provides information about the models' ability to capture
some of the dynamics of the charge-off data. Here the test statistic is the first-order sam-
ple autocorrelation of the yi0:T +1 sequence, conditional on both yit and yit-1 being greater
than zero. The panels in the figure depict the cross-sectional density of these sample au-
tocorrelations. For the RRE loans the density computed from the actual data is covered
by the hairlines generated from the posterior predictive distribution. For the CC loans the
estimated model generates somewhat higher sample autocorrelations than what is present
in the data.

   In the Online Appendix (see Figure A-1) we consider three additional predictive checks
based on (i) the time series mean of yit after observing a zero (and, if applicable, before
observing the next zero), (ii) the time series mean of yit before observing a zero (and,
if applicable, after observing the previous zero), (iii) a robust estimate of the first-order
autocorrelation of yi,0:T +1 provided there are sufficiently many non-zero observations. With
the exception of the autocorrelations in the CC charge-off sample, the two estimated models
are able to reproduce the cross-sectional densities of the sample statistics.


5.5    Set Forecasts

Results on the accuracy of set forecasts for the 2007Q2 samples of RRE and CC charge-
off rates are presented in Table 8. The nominal credible level is 90%. We distinguish
forecasts that for each bank i are constructed from the posterior predictive distribution
as 90% credible sets, denoted by "Pointwise", from forecasts that target conditional on
the observations Y1:N,0:T an average coverage probability across banks of 90%, labeled as
"Average." In addition to the flexible CRE specification with heteroskedastic innovations,
we also consider a homoskedastic version. It turns out that the set forecasts generated by
the homoskedastic specifications are substantially larger than the sets obtained from the
models with heteroskedasticity, without improving the coverage probability. This finding is
consistent with the density forecast results in Table 6.

Notes: Flexible CRE specification. The estimation sample ranges from 2007Q2 (t = 0) to 2009Q4 (t = T =
10). We forecast 2010Q1 observations. The nominal coverage probability is 90%.


   The set forecasts that are constructed by targeting the average coverage probability
have a cross-sectional coverage frequency that is closer to the nominal coverage probability
of 90% and they tend to be shorter. The reduction in the average length is particularly
pronounced for the heteroskedastic specifications, because due to the cross-sectional variation
in the variance of the posterior predictive distributions, there is more scope for tightening
wide forecast sets and enlarging narrow forecast sets while maintaining the average coverage
probability.

   We also report the frequency of the three types of set forecasts. Due to the large number
of zero observations in the RRE sample, there is a large fraction of banks, between 60% and
68%, for which the posterior predictive probability of observing yiT +1 = 0 exceeds 90%. This
leads to a forecast of {0}. For the CC sample the fraction of {0} forecasts is considerably
smaller. As one switches from targeting pointwise coverage probability to average coverage
probability the composition of the set types changes. Recall that the set forecasts correspond
to HPD sets constructed from the posterior predictive distributions. If the forecaster targets
average instead of pointwise coverage probability, then, roughly speaking, she should widen
the "narrow" sets (small i ) by lowering their HPD threshold, and tighten the wide sets (large
i ) by raising their HPD threshold. For RRE we observe that the fraction of disconnected
set forecasts decreases when one switches to targeting average coverage probability, which
means that the HPD threshold for these sets has to fall. Thus, we can infer that the short

    In Figure 5 we provide information about the coverage frequency and average length size
of the set forecast for all samples. The left panel compares the quality of the set forecasts for
the homoskedastic specification to that of the heteroskedastic specification. Each hairline
corresponds to one of the 111 different samples and the endpoints of the hairlines indicate
coverage and length. The circled endpoint corresponds to the heteroskedastic specification
whereas the unmarked endpoint indicates the performance of the homoskedastic specification.
In all samples allowing for heteroskedastic errors shortens the the average length of the set
forecasts. In addition, for 76% of the samples (blue hairlines) the discrepancy between
coverage frequency and nominal coverage probability is also reduced.

    The right panel of Figure 5 compares set forecasts that target pointwise (unmarked
endpoint) and average (circled endpoint) coverage probability. Targeting the latter unam-
biguously reduces the average length. For 59% of the samples it also improves the empirical

coverage frequency (blue hairlines). For many of the remaining 41% of the samples the dete-
rioration of the coverage frequency is relatively small. In all samples, the coverage frequency
falls. We conclude that, by and large, directly targeting the average posterior coverage prob-
ability improves the empirical coverage frequency in the cross section and produces shorter
set forecasts.


5.6     Point Forecasts

Finally, we provide an assessment of the performance of point forecasts, measured through
RMSEs. We consider the same model specifications as in Section 5.3. In Table 9 we report
results for forecasts of yiT +1 and the event that charge-offs are zero, I{yiT +1 = 0}. For the
two samples considered in the table, the heteroskedastic specifications deliver more accurate
forecasts than the homoskedastic representations, just as for density and set forecasts. The
RE specifications perform slightly better than the CRE specifications and in the CC charge-
off sample the Normal specifications deliver more precise point forecasts than the flexible
specifications. Thus, imposing parsimony on the Tobit model improves the point forecasts
in these two samples, at least marginally. We also consider a pooled Tobit model and a
pooled linear model (with homoskedasticity), but they perform generally worse than the
Tobit models that allow for intercept heterogeneity.12
  12
    We censor the draws from the posterior predictive distribution of the pooled linear model, which leads
to a non-trivial probability of a zero charge-off.

observations.


   Figure 6 compares the accuracy of point forecasts for the full set of our 111 samples. The
left panel compares log RMSE differentials Г using the RMSE from the pooled Tobit models
as baseline Г from the heteroskedastic specifications versus homoskedastic specifications using
flexibly modeled correlated random effects. A value below zero corresponds to a sample
in which the heterogeneous coefficient Tobit model leads to a more precise forecast than
its homogeneous counterpart. A point below the 45-degree line corresponds to a sample
in which the heteroskedastic specification delivers a lower RMSE than the homoskedastic
specification. Unlike in the case of density forecasts (see Figure 2), the heteroskedastic
specification does not dominate the homoskedastic specification. In fact, for about 60% of
the samples, the ranking is reversed. Because 86% of the dots lie to the left of the vertical
zero line, it remains the case that the model with heterogeneous i 's dominates the pooled
Tobit model that imposes homogeneity.

   Abstracting from the effect of censoring, the posterior mean of i is a linear combination
of the MLE and the prior mean. The relative weights depend on the relative precision
of likelihood and prior. For our benchmark prior the variance of i is not scaled by the
                    2
innovation variance i . Thus, while for the homoskedastic model the relative weight of MLE
and prior mean is similar for all banks in the panel, under the heteroskedastic specification

the MLE receives little weight for banks that are associated with a large i . We investigated
whether this feature contributed to the poor point forecast performance by considering an
                                                               2

The multiplication of the prior variance by i disassociates the degree of shrinkage toward
                                            2
the prior mean from the innovation variance i . While changing the prior leads to small
improvements in the point forecast performance in some samples, it created large distortions
in many other samples and therefore does not provide a robust remedy against a weak
point forecast performance of the heteroskedastic models in many of the samples that we
considered. A figure documenting this finding is provided in the Online Appendix.

    The center panel and the right panel of Figure 6 focus on the homoskedastic specifications.
The center panel indicates that representing the CRE distribution by a multivariate Normal
distribution works as well and in many instances better than modeling it more flexibly
as a mixture of Normals (65% of the points are above the 45-degree line, and most of
the remaining points are very close to the line). The right panel focuses on a comparison
between CRE and RE. Here the ranking is mixed. In about half of the samples modeling the
correlation between intercept and initial observation improves the forecast accuracy. In the
other have of the samples the RE specification that assumes independence between intercept
and initial conditions leads to lower RMSEs. All three panels of Figure 6 that modeling the
heterogeneity in the intercept is important for point forecasting: once heteroskedasticity is
imposed, in the vast majority of samples (about 82%) the forecast from the dynamic panel
Tobit model with intercept heterogeneity is more accurate than the pooled Tobit forecast.



6     Conclusion

The limited dependent variable panel with unobserved individual effects is a common data
structure but not extensively studied in the forecasting literature. This paper constructs
forecasts based on a flexible dynamic panel Tobit model to forecast individual future out-
comes based on a panel of censored data with large N and small T dimensions. Our empirical
application to loan charge-off rates of small banks shows that the estimation of heteroge-
neous intercepts and conditional variances improves density and set forecasting performance

in the more than 100 samples that are considering. Posterior predictive checks conducted
for two particular samples indicate that the Tobit model is able to capture salient features of
the charge-off panel data sets. Our framework can be extended to dynamic panel versions of
more general multivariate censored regression models. We can also allow for missing obser-
vations in our panel data set. Finally, even though we focused on the analysis of charge-off
data, there are many other potential applications for our methods.

This Online Appendix consists of the following sections:


    A Data Set

    C Additional Empirical Results



A         Data Set

Charge-off rates. The raw data are obtained from the website of the Federal Reserve Bank
of Chicago:
https://www.chicagofed.org/banking/financial-institution-reports/commercial-bank-data.
The raw data are available at a quarterly frequency. The charge-off rates are defined as
charge-offs divided by the stock of loans and constructed in a similar manner as in Tables
A-1 and A-2 of Covas, Rump, and Zakrajsek (2014). However, the construction differs in the
following dimensions: (i) We focus on charge-off rates instead of net charge-off rates. (ii) We
standardize the charge-offs by the lagged stock of loans instead of the current stock of loans
to reduce the timing issue.13 (iii) For banks with domestic offices only (Form FFIEC 041),
RIAD4645 (numerator for commercial and industrial loans) is not reported, so we switch to
the corresponding variable RIAD4638.

       The charge-offs are reported as year-to-date values. Thus, in order to obtain quarterly
data, we take differences: Q1  Q1, (Q2 - Q1)  Q2, (Q3 - Q2)  Q3, and (Q4 - Q3) 
Q4. The loans are stock variables and no further transformation is needed. We multiply the
charge-off rates by 400 to convert them into annualized percentages. We construct charge-off
rates for the following types of loans:

    и CI = commercial & industrial;
  13
    According to bank report forms (e.g. FFIEC 041), the stocks of loans are given by quarterly averages.
"For all items, banks have the option of reporting either (1) an average of DAILY figures for the quarter, or
(2) an average of WEEKLY figures (i.e., the Wednesday of each week of the quarter)."

   и CLD = construction & land development;

   и MF = multifamily real estate;

   и CRE = (nonfarm) nonresidential commercial real estate;

   и HLC = home equity lines of credit (HELOCs);

   и RRE = residential real estate, excluding HELOCs;

   и CC = credit card;

   и CON = consumer, excluding credit card loans.

   Because in our econometric model we are relating the charge-off rates to local economic
conditions, we restrict our analysis to "small" banks that operate in well-defined local mar-
kets. We include a bank in the sample if its assets are below one billion dollars. The raw
data set contains missing observations and outliers that we are unable to explain with our
econometric model. Thus, we proceed as follows to select a subset of observations from the
raw data:

  1. Eliminate banks for which domestic total assets are missing for all time periods in the
     sample.

  2. Compute average non-missing domestic total assets and eliminate banks with average
     assets above 1 billion dollars.

  3. For each loan category, eliminate banks for which the target charge-off rate is missing
     for at least one period of the sample.

  4. For each loan category, eliminate banks for which the target charge-off rate is negative
     or greater than 400% for at least one period of the sample.

  5. For loan category proceed as follows: First, for each bank, drop the two largest observa-
     tions yit , t = 0, и и и , T +1, and calculate the standard deviation (stdd) of the remaining
     observations. Then, eliminate a bank if any successive change |yit - yit-1 | + |yit+1 - yit | >
     10stdd. For t = 0 and t = T + 1, we only have one of the two terms and we set the
     other term in this selection criterion to zero.

The remaining sample sizes after each of these steps for the credit card loan charge-off rates
as well as some summary statistics are reported in Table A-1.

Notes: This table provides summary statistics for samples with cross-sectional dimension N > 400 and
percentage of zeros less than 80%. The date assigned to each panel refers to t = t0 , which is the conditioning
information used to initialize the lag in the dynamic Tobit. We assume that T = 10, which means that
each sample has 12 time periods. The descriptive statistics are computed across N and T dimension of each
panel.

Local Market. We use the annual Summary of Deposits data from the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation to determine the local market for each bank. This data set contains
information about the locations (at ZIP code level) in which deposits were made. Based on
this information, for each bank in the charge-off data set we compute the amount of deposits
received by state. We then associate each bank with the state from which it received the
largest amount of deposits.

Unemployment Rate (URit ). Obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. We use sea-
sonally adjusted monthly data, time-aggregated to quarterly frequency by simple averaging.

Housing Price Index (HPIit ). Obtained from the Federal Housing Finance Agency on
all transactions, not seasonally adjusted. The index is available at a quarterly frequency.

The Gibbs samplers for the other dynamic panel Tobit specifications are special cases in
which some of the parameter blocks drop out. The Gibbs sampler for the pooled Tobit and

  1. Sort {yiT +h }j =1 in increasing order and denote the elements of the sorted sequence by

  3. If p1 = 0, the credible set is {0} and we can terminate.

  4. If p1 > 0, then

         (a) Define 1 = 1 - p1 .
         (b) For j = j0 + 1 to 1 M , compute the length of the j 'th connected 1 - 1 interval

         (c) Choose the shortest interval that contains (1 - 1 )M draws.
         (d) If p0 > 0, then take the union of the shortest connected interval and {0}. Note that
                                                                                               (j +1)
                if the shortest interval constructed from the non-zero draws starts with yiT0+h ,

                understanding that  is replaced by a large number in the code.

B.4       Density Forecasts

The log-predictive density can be approximated by
                              
                               ln P yiT +h = 0|Y1:N,0:T                                             if yiT +h = 0
     ln p yiT +h |Y1:N,0:T          1    M                j         2,j                                               .    (A.7)
                                         j =1 pN yiT +h |хiT +h|T , iT +h|T
                               ln M                                                                 otherwise


     Define the empirical distribution function based on the draws from the posterior predic-
tive distribution as
                                                           M
                                      ^ (yiT +h ) = 1
                                      F
                                                                         (j )
                                                                  I{yiT +h  yiT +h }.                                      (A.8)
                                                    M      j =1

Then the probability integral transform associated with the density forecast of yiT +h can be
approximated as
                                                             ^ (yiT +h ).
                                             P IT (yiT +h )  F                                                             (A.9)

The continuous ranked probability score associated with the density can be approximated
as                                                         
                                ^ , yiT +h ) =
                         CRP S (F                              ^ (x) - I{yiT +h  x} 2 dx.
                                                               F                                                          (A.10)
                                                       0

                         ^ (yiT +h ) is a step function, we can express the integral as a Riemann
     Because the density F
sum. To simplify the notation we drop the iT + h subscripts and add an o superscript for
the observed value at which the score is evaluated. Drawing a figure will help with the
subsequent formulas. Define

Notes: Heteroskedastic flexible CRE specification. The estimation sample ranges from 2007Q2 (t = 0) to
2009Q4 (t = T = 10). The black lines are computed from the actual data. Each hairline corresponds to a
                       ~1:N,0:T +1 of the panel Tobit model based on a parameter draw from the posterior
simulation of a sample Y
distribution. Robust autocorrelations are computed using the MM estimator in Chang and Politis (2016).
