            Country Risk, Asymmetric Information and Domestic Rules



                                    ABSTRACT



This paper describes an economy where incomplete information regarding the
default penalty can result in an upward-sloping supply of' credit. We evaluate
the role of partial information and other related factors in determining the
elasticity of supply of credit and the credit ceiling facing the economy. We
identify conditions under which the presence of country risk induces a
domestic distortion. Next, we derive the cost-minimizing domestic policies
needed in the presence of such a distortion. It is shown that cost-minimizing
policies for a country that wishes to service its debt in the presence of
country risk calls for a combination of borrowing taxes and time varying
consumption taxes. If all  consumers have access to the domestic capital
market, the two policies are equivalent. If domestic consumers are subject to
liquidity constraints, cost-minimizing policies call for a combination of time
varying consumption taxes and product subsidies that will mimic the
consumption distribution achieved by cost-minimizing policies in the absence
of liquidity constraints. The policies derived in the paper are formulated in
terms of' the country risk, as embodied in the elasticity of supply of credit
facing the borrower. In a mixed economy, where some consumers are subject to
credit rationing whereas others have full access to the domestic credit
market, there is a need for taxes on borrowing as well as time varying
consumption and production tax cum subsidies. The analysis also shows that if
the level of external borrowing is substantial, cost-minimizing domestic
policies call for instituting a two-tier exchange rate system.

      In the 1980's a growing number of countries have found servicing their

 debt a challenging task. Countries in balance of payments crises have tended

 to impose restrictions on capital mobility, and have adopted various versions

 of two—tier exchange rate systems. The growing policy concern with balance of

 payments crises has also been reflected in considerable interest in the

 factors governing country risk1 and in the role of two—tier exchange rate

 systems as means of restricting capital flows.2 The purpose of this paper is

 to integrate these two lines of research by analyzing the design of cost-

minimizing domestic policies in the presence of country risk. This paper

derives the characteristics of the supply of credit in a stochastic

environment. The analysis identifies the considerations under which country

risk introduces a domestic distortion. These considerations facilitates the

derivation of the cost-minimizing policies needed to deal with the

distortion. To add a dimension of reality we also examine the effect of an

imperfect domestic capital market on the cost-minimizing policies. Hence, we

specify the cost-minimizing policies applicable to situations with perfect

domestic capital market as well as to situations in which the capital market

•is subject to credit rationing.

      Section I formulates a two periods model. Borrowing occurs in period

zero before the realization of the stochastic shocks, and debt repayment is

scheduled for period one.    In case of default, a default penalty is inflicted

upon the borrower. We derive the supply of credit offered by the lender. The

elasticity   of the supply of credit is shown to be determined by the degree of

uncertainty about the size of the (stochastic) default penalty. For "mild"

degree of uncertainty the supply of credit is perfectly elastic up to a credit

ceiling. On the other hand if the uncertainty is substantial, the supply

schedule is composed of three portions. It is perfectly elastic (at the world
                                       2




 risk-free rate of interest) for small levels of credit, it is upward sloping

 for intermediate credit levels (until the credit ceiling is reached) and it is

 completely inelastic at the credit-ceiling level. It might even include a

 backwards-bending portion emerging from the credit—ceiling level. The

elasticity of the supply of credit along the upward sloping portion is shown

to rise with the magnitude of the penalty relative to the credit volume. This

elasticity depends negatively on the interest rate. The analysis also

identifies the factors determining the level of the credit ceiling.

     In section II we show that if the equilibrium occurs along the upwards

sloping portion of the supply of credit then it results in a domestic

distortion (for a related analysis see Harberger (1980)). This situation

provides the rationale for government intervention .   The distortion arises

from the fact that individual borrowers treat the rate of interest as given

even though from the perspective of the country as a whole the rate of

interest rises with the volume of borrowing. The fact that individual

borrowers do not take account of the rising supply curve implies that from the

social point of view the equilibrium is associated with "excess" borrowing.

The welfare cost induced by the distortion can be eliminated through policies

that reduce the amount of aggregate borrowing. For such policies to be

effective they need to raise the relevant intertemporal cost of current

spending. Such a rise in the intertemporal cost can be achieved by either a

tax on international borrowing, or by a time varying consumption tax (tilted

towards the present) or by a combination of the two. With perfect domestic

capital markets, the two policies are equivalent. These policies internalize

the distortion, created by the "semi monopsony" situation in the financial

market. If the level of external borrowing is substantial (that is, if it

approaches the credit limit level), then the cost-minimizing domestic policies

are equivalent to the adaption of a two—tier exchange rate system. Such
                                        3




 policies amount to a combination of a quota on borrowing (equal to the credit

 ceiling) and a borrowing tax. This tax equals the percentage spread between

 the domestic interest rate ("the demand price") and the foreign interest rate

 ("the supply price") at the ceiling. This policy captures the 'quota rent'

 generated in the presence of credit rationing and prevents the possibility of

 an inefficient equilibrium along the backward-bending portion of the supply of

 credit.

      The substitutability of borrowing taxes with time varying consumption taxes

as cost—minimizing policies is a consequence of the perfect domestic capital

market assumed in section II.   In section III we will relax this assumption,

considering the case where domestic consumers are subject to credit rationing.

Cost—minimizing policies are shown to involve time varying consumption and

production taxes and subsidies at a rate that will imply an intertemporal

transfer of income. This transfer will allow consumers to enjoy the cost-

minimizing allocation of consumption that is attainable with access to the

capital market. A "loan" is granted where subsidies exceed taxes; and a loan is

"serviced" when taxes exceed subsidies. In a way, the authorities are providing

the financial intermediation services of a bank. Cost—minimizing policies allow

the indirect participation of consumers subject to credit rationing in the

financial market. The economic justification for such a role for the public

sector is the presumption that authorities may have a cost advantage over banks

in the provision of financial intermediation for risky consumers. This is

because the authorities can force consumers to service their debt by imposing a

needed set of consumption taxes. In general, the presence of limited domestic

financial integration destroys the equivalence between borrowing taxes and time

varying consumption taxes, putting a greater weight on the second set of

policies. Section IV closes the paper with concluding remarks.
I. Country Risk and Incomplete Information

       This section provides an example of the economic factors determining the

supply of credit. We consider a small economy where there is partial

information regarding the costs of default. Debt issuance occurs before the

resolution of uncertainty. Thus, the lender determines the supply of credit

based upon his partial information. The elasticity of the supply of credit

will be shown to be determined by the nature of uncertainty regarding the

borrower's myopia and the penalty size.

       Consider a two periods horizon. Borrowing B takes place in period zero,
                 *
at    a rate r       .   Debt repayment is scheduled for period one. In case of

default a penalty of N/'+ is inflicted upon the borrower. The partial

information stems from the assumption that the lender has only incomplete

information regarding '          .   A   possible economic interpretation of '   is   as

the discount factor applied for a penalty to be inflicted in the future

(period two). Let N be the cost of being excluded from the international

credit market in the future due to a default in period 1; and                be the

effective discount factor that translates the future penalty (N) into N/

in terms of period one. Thus,                can be viewed as a myopia measure, where a

higher       corresponds to a smaller weight attached to the future. For

example, if the default decision is determined by a party whose political

horizon is limited,            will reflect the myopia of the decision maker.

Alternatively, the analysis can apply for the case of partial information

regarding the size of the penalty N: let the default penalty (N) be

proportional to output (or export) in period one. The term            i'   may reflect

a stochastic productivity term.

       Default will take place if the penalty falls short of the debt.3

As        e÷     0        ,    we approach the case of full information regarding the default

penalty. With complete information (                                               0)       ,   default           will take place only if

rate. Thus, in such a case the borrower will face a supply of credit given

by abc (Figure 1), where BR is the credit ceiling. We assume that the

borrowing country is small. Thus, in the absence of risk it faces an elastic

supply of credit, at the risk free rate (r)

general, equation 1 implies that for values of B smaller than

          N/[(1 +             r) y0eEJ       the default probability is zero, because '

Thus, the supply of credit is elastic till BL .                                                         For       B >            we expect

 defines the supply of credit. It implies that along the supply of credit

 Iotice that for 0                q    <    1        the supply of credit is either elastic or upward

 sloping. For    ri   >       1       the supply of credit bends backwards. Maximization

 implies that the borrowing country will not operate on the backward bending

 portion of the supply of credit.5 Thus, a credit ceiling is reached when

d log B/d log (1 +        r*)              0 .        To conclude the specification of the supply

schedule, let us determine the credit ceiling, denoted by B .                                                    In   general,

we should distinguish between two cases. If BL is on the backward bending part

of' the supply curve (defined by equation 5), then B                                            BL (recall that BL is the

largest B that is consistent with P                               1) .       Otherwise, the credit ceiling is
reached when n        1 (or, equivalently, when d log B/d log (1 +                                            r*)         0).   In terms

of our example, the supply curve is defined by:

portion ki is given by equation (10). Higher values of the interest rate

and of the myopia index () are associated with higher credit-supply

elasticity. Likewise, the elasticity rises with the ratio of the penalty (N)

relative to the volume of credit.

In   general, a higher myopia index (dip0 > 0)           , a higher risk-free interest

rate and a igher uncertainty concerning the penalty of default (dC > 0) are

associated with a lower credit ceiling. Our analysis has demonstrated that

the degree of uncertainty plays an important role in the determination of the

supply of credit. For "mild't uncertainty (          that       is, for       < in 2) the

supply of' credit is elastic for credit levels below the ceiling. If the

uncertainty exceeds a certain threshold (e > in 2)                     , the supply of

credit is upward sloping for a credit volume that is below the ceiling

(BL < B < B)

       While our discussion has been conducted for a special distribution, the

main results apply for a general distribution. For example, let f(p) denote

a general distribution of ip     .    It   can be shown that the elasticity of the

probability of no default with respect to indebtedness (n) equals to



(6')




where F(p) j f'(y)dy is the cumulative distribution of f. Equation (6')

reveals that the shape of the supply of credit is determined by the character-

istics of the distribution f.        it is backwards—bending for values of 8(1 +                     r*)   that
                                                         *                                *
satisfy   the condition that f [log (N/(B(1 +        r       )))] > F[logUJ/(B(1 +    r       )))]

It can be shown that a large class of the distributions f(ip)                   (including the

normal distribution) yields a supply of credit of the type reported in Figure

1——a supply curve that is perfectly elastic for small level of credit (at the
                                                                         *

elasticity of supply drops with the interest rate. Furthermore, the main

arguments made in the subsequent analysis are independent of the shape of

f(14))


         In the next section we derive the cost minimizing domestic policies for a

small economy operating along the upward sloping portion of the supply of

credit.


II. Optimal Domestic Policies

         The purpose of this section is to derive optimal domestic policies in the

presence of the supply characterized by (5). It is useful to start with a

real model, because the design of the optimal policies can be shown to be

independent of monetary considerations. Consider a one-good open economy that

faces given international prices. Let the utility of a representative

consumer be given by

(114)                             U        u(X0) + pu(X1)

where p      stands for the subjective rate of time preference and        is the

consumption at time i.       The domestic interest rate, r,       is defined by
                                                *
(15)                                   rr(1-*-a)
where r* is defined by the supply of credit (5) and            is the domestic tax on

borrowing. We assume that the country is a net debtor in period zero, thus
                                                                  *
equation (15) defines the domestic interest rate. Let 6, 6            denote,

respectively, the discount factors gross and net of borrowing taxes
                  *          *
(6   11(1 +    r);
                6    1/(1 + r )). The authorities can use consumption taxes

and subsidies, as well as borrowing taxes. The private-sector budget

constraints are

                                              X X1 —
 where     (8, 9) are the consumption taxes in periods 0 and 1, (X, X)                           is

 consumption in period one for the case default and no default, respectively;

 (X0, X1) is the endowment, R0 is the transfer in period 0 and we assume that

 foreign prices are one. Equations (16b) and (16c) are the budget constraints

 for period one for the case of no default and default, respectively. To

simplify exposition, we assume that 01 is applied only in case of no

default. Combining (16a) and (16b) yields an intertemporal budget

constraint:


(17)                     (1 +            + 6(1   +
                                                     o1)X         X0 +   6   •1 + R0


The specification of the budget constraint embodies the notion that the

consumer is the owner of the claims on output (, ).

       The consumer's problem is to allocate consumption so as to maximize his

expected utility subject to the budget constraint. Let V denote the value of

the expected utility. In computing this value, the expectations are taken in

period zero, based upon the information regarding the distribution of '!

denoted by g(') .        Let the ratio Ni[B(1 +             r * )J   be denoted by Z.   It follows

that


                                     z
(18)              V    u(X0) +
                                    - u(X)g()d            +
                                                              f u(X1
                                                              z
                                                                         -




Thus     V is a function of three argumets:



(19)                                      V
                                                 V(X0, X, Z)
       In maximizing V subject to the budget constraint (17), the consumer

chooses in period zero the values of X0 and X' .                      This maximization yields

the first order conditions (20)—(21):
                                               11




 (20)                                   V      \(l + 0
                                                      0

                                       V<n
where     X is the multiplier associated with the budget constraint (17) and

v           for any y.   In deriving these first-order conditions, we are using

the fact that each consumer treats r as given. As the subsequent analysis

reveals this price—taker behavior brings about a distorted domestic

equilibrium.

        To close the model, we specify the supply of credit facing the small

country. The determination of the interest rate is represented by a negative
                                                                          *
functional    dependency between the net discount factor (6 )                 and the level of

indebtedness:

(22)                       6       6 (B(1 +   r*))   ,       (5 )' < 0.


Equation (22) is a reduced form equation, which is derived from (5).                  t'Jotice


that equation (6) implies that


(23)                                d log B          1   —
                                                -
                                                         n
                                    d log 6
where n was defined in (6).

        The value of n reflects the degree of integration of the domestic

economy with the international financial market. Equation (23) implies that

as ri   approaches unity, the economy approaches a credit ceiling under which a
further rise in the interest rate r* does not increase the credit offered to

the country. Alternatively, as n approaches zero we approach the case of

full integration, where the country risk factor is absent. Therefore, a value

of n that is close to one reflects a high degree of financial segmentation

of the domestic economy. For the purpose of our discussion we take n as

given, focusing on the design of optimal domestic policies.

       The set of optimal policies is derived in two stages. First, we derive

the change in the expected utility of a representative consumer due to a

revenue—neutral change in taxes. e then apply this expression to compute the

implied restrictions on optimal policies. To simplify, we neglect the role of

the public sector; hence we assume that the net revenue of' all taxes and

transfers is zero. Thus, the economy-wide budget constraint implies that:8


(2k)                         [X0 -                 +                - X1}

       Equation (214) reflects the fundamental budget constraint: using the

external prices, net present value of borrowing is zero.                                      In general, the

marginal change in welfare can be approximated by

       The economy-wide budget constraint (24) and the supply of credit (22)

imply that the net present value of changes in net borrowing in both periods

should add up to zero, where the relevant discount factor is the social

discount factor,     (1 - ri):

       From equation (27) we infer a value of AX0 .                             We   substitute this value

for AX0 into (26), and obtain the final expression for the change in utility:

Equation (28) is a reduced-form expression in which (as usual) the change in
welfare is described as the sum of changes in quantities, weighted by the

 initial distortions(see Harberger (1971)). This expression is useful in

assessing the set of optimal policies because optimality requires that the

distortion (i.e., the coefficient of the quantity changes) should be set to

zero.9'1° Thus:

that (29') applies only for small values of all the parameters. For example,

(29) implies that as q        approaches unity (as is the case in the presence of
credit rationing),          approaches infinite.11 At the limit (n                                       1)

(B      B) the domestic interest rate is demand determind, generating

 charged by lenders when B is marginally below the credit ceiling B

 This argument is summarized in Figure 1.         If the supply of credit is akim, and

 the demand by D, the 'quota rent' is the shaded area in Figure 1. The optimal

 policy is a quota B and a borrowing tax a , where
      —     _* _*
 a   (r -   r   )/r   .   The tax is designed to capture the rent, preventing it from

 being captured by foreigh lenders. This policy can be implemented in the form

of a two-tier regime, where the domestic interest rate is endogenously de-

 termined by the spread between the financial and the commercial exchange

rates. Thus, our analysis demonstrates that a two-tier exchange rate can

be the outcome of an equilibrium response of the domestic authorities to

credit rationing by foreign creditors--when a borrower approaches the

inelastic portion of the supply of credit, optimality calls for a borrowing

tax at a rate defined by the spread between the domestic and the foreign
                — .__* _.*
interest rate ((r — r )/r ) . Note that as n-l there is
important role for the quota            --to prevent an equilibrium along the

backward bending portion of the supply of credit. 12

     Equation (29) implies that there is a redundancy of an instrument, in the

sense that a tax on borrowing can be substituted by time varying uniform

consumption taxes. This apparent redundancy reflects the assumption that all

consumers have full access to the domestic financial market. We turn now to

an analysis of optimal policies in the presence of credit rationing.


III. Liquidity Constraints

     The previous section derived optimal policies in the presence of country

risk for the case where consumers have full access to the domestic capital

market. Sometimes, however, enough consumers face effective credit rationing

to pose the question of what policies might be optimal in the presence of

liquidity constraints. While the economic explanation for the extent to which
                                        15




credit rationing is binding is beyond the scope of the present paper, it is

useful to make the following observations.13 Countries subject to country

risk tend to be countries in which the sophistication of their domestic credit

market is limited. These countries also tend to apply for credit assistance

during severe recessions. Both of the above conditions tend to be associated

with the presence of credit rationing. Thus, it is desirable to assess the

role of domestic policies for the case of country risk and liquidity

constraints.

     Suppose that the consumer described in Section II is facing credit

rationing. As a consequence, he faces distinct periodic budget constraints,

denoted by BC:


(19'a)                         (1 +            -   -       0
                         BC0           80)X0

(19'b)                         (1 +            -   -R      0
                         BC

(19'c)                          (1 +           -       0
                          BC

     The terms H0, R include terms related to the intertemporal transfer of

income allowed by the existing level of credit offered to the consumer. What

is relevant, however, is that at the margin our consumer is effectively

rationed in the credit market. For simplicity of exposition, we consider the

case where H0 H z 0 .      The public sector chooses the set of taxes cum

subsidies as to maximize the expected utility of a representative consumer.

Formally, this is equivalent to optimizing equation (18) subject to the budget

constraint (2L) and the external supply of credit (22). We can obtain the

optimal policies by applying the two stages procedure used in section II.

Notice that equation (25) still holds as a measure of the change in utility

due to marginal change in policies. Note also that equation (27), the
                                                        16




economy-wide budget constraint, is still valid. Applying (27) to (25) yields

the final expression:

                                                                                 Vn
                                     *                        n                      Xl
(30)                             —       (1   —   n)]       AX1
                                                                      where
                       Xo                                                            Xo


The restrictions on optimal policies are obtained by equating the coefficient

in (30) to zero, yielding

                                                        *
(31)                                                        (1 —



Equation (31) implies that intertemporal taxes should be imposed in such a way
as to equate the ratio of private intertemporal marginal utilities of
                                                                      *
consumption       ()   to   the social discount rate (o (1 -                  n)).    This is also the

condition that institutes the Ricardian equivalence proposition.h24 For small
              *
values   of r ,         - 1,   we can approximate (31) by:


(31')                                              1 —            —




A comparison of the conditions for an optimal path of taxes between the cases

of liquidity constraint (31') and full access to the domestic financial market

(29') reveals that liquidity constraints destroy the equivalence between time

varying consumption taxes (and production subsidies) and taxes on

borrowings. For a consumer subject to credit rationing, taxes on borrowing

are not relevant because they do not affect his behavior. Thus, the presence

of credit rationing implies that the optimal intertemporal allocation should

be achieved via uniform, time varying consumption and production taxes and

subsidies. The optimal set of policies would mimic the intertemporal

allocation of consumption for a consumer with access to the domestic financial

market. This can be accomplished by applying taxes cuzn subsidies as a means
                                                   17




 of intertemporal transfer of income. In designing such a policy, the public

 sector provides the intermediation services of a bank to consumers who are

 excluded from the credit market. A "loan" is granted where subsidies exceed

 taxes, and the loan is "serviced" when taxes exceed subsidies. The economic

 justification for such a role for the public sector is the implicit assumption

 that the authorities have a cost advantage over banks in the provision of

 financial intermediation for risky consumers. This is because the authorities

can force consumers to service their debt by imposing a needed set of

consumption taxes. Thus, the argument for the application of the optimal

policies described above necessitates a sound fiscal system with the capacity

to enforce taxes.

       The above arguments are illustrated with the following Cobb-Douglas

model. Let the utility of a representative consumer be given by:


(32)                             U        log X0 +       p log   X1


       We consider now the case where the consumer lacks access to financial

markets. If (La, ) stands for the endowment vector, equation (18)

implies that for the Cobb—Douglas case

                                                 1+0 X

 The first term in (35) measures the endowment bias towards period zero. Note

 that with full access to financial markets, a consumer facing a discount rate

        will choose a consumption path such that 6fX1/X0                              p.   Thus,   if the first

 term is zero, the intertemporal distribution of endowment coincides with the

desired distribution of consumption, whereas a negative value reflects an

endowment bias towards period one. Equation (35) implies that the inter—

temporal path of net taxes is determined by country risk and by the endowment

bias. Assuming that the design of taxes O,                                 is such that the net present

value of government revenue is zero15, we can infer that for small values of

where w                     + X1],            and we are assuming that the country is a

borrower in period zero (or that the endowment bias towards period one exceeds

the country risk factor, i               ).    Suppose that we start with no endowment bias

                p)   and   no country risk (ii                   0).   In such a case, no policies are

called for. This is also the case where a consumer with full access to the

credit market would not borrow. Suppose now that there is a drop in income in

period zero (X0 K 0) , leaving                        intact. In such a case

Thus, optimal policies call for a net subsidy in period zero and a net tax in

period one. Such a policy transfers income from period one to period zero.

This is also the case in which a consumer who has access to the credit market
                          16
borrows in period zero.

     Suppose now that the transitory drop in income in period zero comes with

a rise in country risk (n). Higher country risk weakens the use of the

subsidy cum tax scheme as a means of intertemporal transfer of income. This

is also the case in which borrowing by the consumers who have access to the

credit market should be taxed. In general, optimal policies allow the con-

sumer who is subject to credit rationing to use the credit market indirectly

in order to smooth the path of consumption over time.

     It is relevant to note that in a mixed economy, where some consumers are

subject to liquidity constraints, whereas others have full access to the

domestic credit market, there is a need for taxes on borrowing as well as for

time varying consumption cum production taxes and subsidies. In such a case

(31) defines the path of consumption curn production taxes, and (29) defines

the borrowing tax that is consistent with the path of consumption taxes.17

     A potential difficulty of our analysis in this section is the lack of

additional channels that allow a consumer subject to credit rationing to

smooth consumption. These channels include investment in productive capital

and the presence of money. It can be shown that the main results remain

intact in the presence of these channels. Finally, while our discussion was

formulated in terms of a one good model, it can also be varified that (because

optimal policies do not affect within-period relative prices) all the results

regarding optimal policies hold for a two (or ri) goods model.18

IV. Concluding Remarks

     Rather than repeating the summary from the introduction, we conclude with

an outline of possible extensions. Throughout the paper we have evaluated the

conditions under which the presence of country risk can introduce a domestic

distortion, and we have studied the implied characteristics of the supply of

credit and the optimal domestic policies. We considered a simple example in

which there is incomplete information regarding the default penalty. The

present paper does not allow for the possibility of a direct feedback between

the borrower's policies and the evaluation of the country risk. An extension

that allows for such a possibility would be useful, bringing up issues related

to credibility and reputation.

         100ur analysis has been conducted for the case of an incomplete and

 symmetric information regarding                     .    It   can be extended to allow for

asymmetric information by allowing different density functions g() for the

 lender and the borrower. Let g(") g(\i1) stand for the density function

supply of credit (5) is determined according to                                (i.e., P in (5) should be

replaced by L' L                   g(t)d)       ,
                                                    whereas the expected utility (18) is

determined by applying g(i.e., g in (18) should be replaced by ge).                                             It

can be shown that the optimal domestic policy is defined by (29), where                                    ri        is

      12For example, if the supply curve is akl (Figure 1), the 'shadow' supply

curve defined by (9) includes a backward bending section ('in' in Figure 1). The

optimal policy                                           has also the consequence of excluding

equilibria along the backward bending portion of akin (equilibria that are

     l6Notice that if the drop in income is permanent, such that            is

not affected, rio policies are called for.

     17Note that in the presence of heterogeneous consumers subject to credit

rationing and the lack of transfer policies conditional on income, optimal

policies are not capable of mimicking the intertemporal distribution achieved

without credit rationing.

     18Notice that in the presence of two goods a desired path of   81 - 80

can be obtained by imposing tariffs and export subsidies at an equal rate

(e in period i, i    0, 1).
