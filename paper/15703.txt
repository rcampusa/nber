                                               ABSTRACT

We discover and document errors in public use microdata samples ("PUMS files") of the 2000 Census,
the 2003-2006 American Community Survey, and the 2004-2009 Current Population Survey. For women
and men ages 65 and older, age- and sex-specific population estimates generated from the PUMS files
differ by as much as 15% from counts in published data tables. Moreover, an analysis of labor force
participation and marriage rates suggests the PUMS samples are not representative of the population
at individual ages for those ages 65 and over. PUMS files substantially underestimate labor force participation
of those near retirement ages and overestimate labor force participation rates of those at older ages.
These problems were an unintentional by-product of the misapplication of a newer generation of disclosure
avoidance procedures carried out on the data. The resulting errors in the public use data could significantly
impact studies of people ages 65 and older, particularly analyses of variables that are expected to change
by age.

       This article investigates serious problems with the age and sex data provided by the

Census Bureau in many recent public data products. Census Bureau data resources include

published tables based on the full data that the agency collects, and public use microdata samples

("PUMS files") based on an anonymized subsample of the data that has been subjected to

disclosure avoidance techniques. For women and men ages 65 and older, age- and sex-specific

population estimates generated from many recent PUMS files differ substantially from counts

presented in published data tables that were created using the full, confidential data. For

example, population estimates from the 2000 decennial Census PUMS files differ from the

published data tables by up to 15% for some age and sex combinations. These differences are not

related to regular sampling variation. Instead, the problems were an unintentional by-product of

the misapplication of disclosure avoidance procedures carried out on the data. The resulting

errors in the public use data are severe, and, as such, we argue that the Census Bureau's PUMS

files from several years should not be used to study people ages 65 and older.

       We discover and document the impact of these errors in PUMS files of the 2000 Census,

the 2003-2006 American Community Survey (ACS), and the 2004-2009 Current Population

Survey (CPS). We explore this issue with two main goals in mind. First, Census Bureau PUMS

files are extremely important datasets for researchers and policy-makers. The problematic data

have been used by thousands of researchers for a variety of purposes. We aim to raise awareness

of how the data errors could generate biases in current and future research results. Second, this

issue provides an important cautionary tale for producers and users of data that is subject to

disclosure avoidance techniques. The newest generation of disclosure avoidance techniques has

significant benefits for both data producers and data users. Older techniques simply removed

detail from datasets (for example, by aggregating small categories, top-coding extreme values,
                                                                                                  2


etc.). Newer techniques, such as swapping or blanking, retain detail and provide better protection

of respondents' confidentiality. However, the effects of the new techniques are less transparent to

data users and mistakes can easily be overlooked. Therefore these new techniques carry

increased responsibility for both data users and data producers to vigilantly review the

anonymized data.

           Our analysis begins with a review of available documentation on the issue, followed by a

data analysis illustrating the apparent error in PUMS files from the decennial census, the

American Community Survey, and the Current Population Survey. We then discuss the

continuing effect that these problems are likely to have on the study of aging and the elderly. We

conclude by suggesting methods for identifying problematic data, potential work-arounds, and

longer-term approaches to correcting the errors.


Disclosure Avoidance Techniques

           Following communication with the authors of this paper, the Census Bureau

acknowledged in two user notes that disclosure avoidance techniques have caused seemingly

minor problems with age and sex data in Census and ACS PUMS files published between 2000

and 2007. The first user note was added in October 2008, in the errata notes that are appended to

the Census 2000 PUMS codebook. The codebook's "Data Note 12" warns researchers that

disclosure avoidance techniques resulted in "some abnormal ratios for the number of men to the

number of women (sex ratio) for people age 65 and over".1 The note presents sex ratios and

population counts by grouped years of age, comparing the 2000 1% PUMS file to published

estimates from Summary File 3. Released in April 2009, ACS PUMS User Note 47 presents

2006 ACS data and contains identical warnings regarding the 2000-2006 ACS samples and the

2005-2007 ACS 3-year sample.2 The Census 2000 user note indicates that "the PUMS files will

not be re-released using a modified technique as that would pose a disclosure risk."3

        PUMS files have always been subject to a wide range of disclosure avoidance techniques.

Some of these techniques are transparent to data users and are discussed at length in dataset

documentation. The most common and well-known of these are: (1) the microdata released to the

public is only a sample of all the records the Census has; (2) the data file does not release low-

level geographic identifiers; (3) variables with hundreds of categories have a smaller number of

categories on the public use file; and (4) continuous variables with outlying values, such as

income and transportation time, are top- and bottom coded.

        Disclosure avoidance techniques have grown more complex in the past few years, due

largely to concerns that new data technologies present a growing disclosure threat. These newer

techniques include swapping or rank swapping (also called switching), replacing randomly

selected records with imputed values (as if the data were missing), and noise addition.4 It seems

possible that any of these techniques could be primarily responsible for the highly distorted age

data in the Census 2000 and ACS PUMS files.

        The user notes do not provide information on the particular technique that caused the

problem, but the data itself can be used to better understand the effects that the errors could be

having on research.5 In the next section, we use public census data to describe the extent of the

  The Census Bureau has been unwilling to give further detail regarding the nature of the misapplication of the
disclosure avoidance techniques, since public knowledge of such detail may jeopardize the effectiveness of these
techniques.

problem by comparing the faulty age and sex distribution of the PUMS files to those from

published census tables.


Data Comparisons

       The Census publishes tables that are almost always based on datasets that are much larger

than the PUMS files. In the 2000 Census, published tables are based on either the complete

population (in Summary Files 1 and 2) or about one sixth of the population (in Summary Files 3

and 4). The largest PUMS file in 2000 included fewer than a third of the cases that were used to

make Summary Files 3 and 4. Similarly, American Community Survey PUMS files include

about two-thirds of the cases in the larger datasets that are used to make the published tables

available on the Census Bureau's American FactFinder site (http://factfinder.census.gov). While

it is possible that the Census' internal files were also exposed to disclosure avoidance techniques,

these techniques may be done separately, to a lesser extent, or not at all.


2000 Decennial Census data

       Documentation of the erroneous data focuses on problems with sex ratios in the PUMS

files. However, the full extent of the problem can be seen more clearly in single-year population

estimates by age and sex. In Figure 1, we show sex- and age-specific population estimates from

the 2000 5% Census PUMS as a proportion of published counts from Summary File 4. For all

ages 0-64, PUMS estimates are never more than 1.5% higher or lower than published counts. In

contrast, for those ages 65 and up, PUMS estimates differ from published population counts

substantially, in some cases by more than 10%. For instance, the PUMS estimate of the number

of 65-year-old women is 895,052, which is only about 83% of Summary File 4's published count

of 1,079,328.
                                                                                                  5


American Community Survey data

       There are no published single-year age estimates from the American Community Survey

(ACS), so it is not possible to view the problem at the same level of detail as in the 2000 Census.

The ACS publishes counts by age groups, and thus, we compare these published group counts

with population count estimates for comparable age groups calculated using population-weighted

PUMS data. Once again we see that the PUMS calculations diverge substantially from published

counts beginning at age 65. Figure 2 shows estimates from the 2006 ACS PUMS as a proportion

of the 2006 ACS published data obtained from American FactFinder.

       The problem with the disclosure avoidance techniques were corrected before the release

of the 2007 ACS PUMS file. Both the 2007 and 2008 ACS PUMS files produce estimates of the

population at all ages that are close to those in the published tables. Examining the ACS PUMS

since the inception of the ACS reveals that the problem with the disclosure avoidance techniques

in the ACS PUMS files appeared for the first time in 2003. PUMS estimates of the population of

those ages 65 years and older differ substantially from published accounts in the 2003 through

the 2006 survey years. The Census Bureau's Data Note 47 suggests that the errors also exist in

the 2000-2002 ACS PUMS data; however our analysis suggests that the 2000-2002 files do not

contain errors

       Figure 3 shows ACS PUMS estimates as a proportion of published data for all ACS

samples. To facilitate easy comparisons of the seven different samples, Figure 3 presents data for

women. The samples in Figure 3's left panel—the 2001, 2002, 2007, and 2008 ACS—all

produce good estimates of the female population at all ages. The samples on the right panel—the

2003-2006 ACS—reveal undercounts of women in their mid-60s and overcounts of women over

age 85 in all samples. Additionally, in 2003 and 2004, the ACS PUMS samples overcount
                                                                                                                 6


women in their early 70s and early 80s; in 2005 and 2006 ACS PUMS samples overcount

women in their late 60s. The 2003 and 2004 ACS samples produce the worst estimates,

particularly for 65 and 66-year-olds. In these samples, the PUMS estimates of 65-66 year-old

women are about 85% of the count in the published tables. A similar analysis of the data for

men reveals that estimates of the male population are also distorted in the 2003-2006 samples.


Current Population Survey data

        While the Census has thus far only acknowledged a link between the misapplication of

disclosure avoidance techniques and data problems in the 2000 Census and the ACS public use

files, an investigation of the Current Population Survey (CPS) data suggests that the problems

affecting estimates of the older population may have affected these public use files as well.

        There are no published population totals for the CPS, so it is not possible to conduct the

same type of analysis we did for the 2000 Census and the ACS.6 Instead of comparing CPS

estimates to an external standard, we investigate the problem in CPS using a measure that is

internal to the dataset: the sex ratio. In the Census and ACS public use files, the over- and

undercounts of men and women ages 65 and older do not occur proportionally by age and

gender; indeed at age 65 men tend to be overcounted while women tend to be undercounted.

These under and overcounts of men and women impact the sex ratio, resulting in implausibly

large shifts in the sex ratio across the ages for those ages 65 and up.

        Panel 1 of Figure 4 shows the sex ratio of men to women among 62-to-64-year-olds not

living in group quarters, comparing three data sources: (1) the CPS Annual Social and Economic
6
  ACS published tables are not directly compared to the CPS. The CPS excludes institutional group quarters, while
the 2000-2004 ACS excludes all group quarters (institutional and non-institutional), and the 2005-2008 ACS
includes all group quarters. There are also slight differences in how CPS and ACS identify non-institutional group
quarters (ACS counts many more non-institutional group quarters than the CPS). Because of these differences, ACS
published data never represent the same population that is sampled in the CPS. However, a comparison of
population estimates by age, still reveal unexpectedly large shifts in the ratio of CPS PUMS estimates to ACS
published estimates at age 65 beginning in 2004.
                                                                                                               7


Supplement (CPS ASEC) PUMS; (2) the ACS PUMS; and (3) the ACS published data.7 These

data on 62-to-64-year-olds show the level of variation one would normally expect to see between

the three different data sources, absent any disclosure avoidance distortions. All three data

sources produce similar estimates—among 62-to-64-year-olds there are about 9 men for every 10

women. Not surprisingly, there is more variance in the estimates produced from the CPS, since

the CPS is a much smaller survey than the ACS. Still, 90% confidence intervals around the CPS

estimates easily contain estimates from the published ACS tables and ACS PUMS samples for

each year. In other words, there are never statistically significant differences between the three

sources' estimates of the 62-to-64 year-old population.8

        In Panel 2 of Figure 4 we turn to those ages 65 and 66, ages shown to have substantial

errors stemming from the misapplication of disclosure avoidance techniques in the ACS PUMS

files from 2003 to 2006. As with the estimates for 62-to-64-year-olds, in 2001 and 2002, and

again in 2007 and 2008, the ratio of men to women among 65 and 66-year-olds in the PUMS

files tracks the ratios calculated from the published ACS data quite closely. Moreover, the ratios

follow a sensible pattern given death patterns by age, with a small decline in the sex ratio at ages

62-to-64 from .9 to around .87 at ages 65 and 66.

        In contrast, the ratios calculated using the ACS PUMS data from 2003 to 2006 differ

substantially from the ratios calculated using the published tables for this period. Moreover,

these estimates differ from what one would expect given life expectancy patterns and the sex

ratios for those a few years younger, with the gender ratio increasing, rather than decreasing, as

  Published data from the 2005-2009 ACS includes a small number group quarters cases; it was not possible to

  We generated 90% confidence intervals for the CPS sex ratios using the delta method; standard errors were
adjusted to take account of added weighting variance in light of the complex sample design of the CPS.
                                                                                                     8


these cohorts age. Indeed, in 2003 and 2004, the ACS PUMS estimates suggest a reverse gender

ratio with more men than women for those ages 65 and 66.

        Sex ratios from the CPS ASEC PUMS are also much higher than the published ACS data

from 2004 to 2009. To test whether sex ratios in CPS data and published ACS data could be due

to ordinary sampling error, we generated 90% confidence intervals for the CPS sex ratios. In

2000 through 2003, the published ACS sex ratios were contained well within the 90%

confidence interval of the sex ratio estimated using the CPS PUMS data. Beginning in 2004, the

90% confidence interval no longer contains, in most years, the published ACS sex ratio.

Moreover, it is unlikely that regular sampling variance would cause such large overestimates of

the sex ratio of 65 and 66-year-olds calculated from the CPS data for six consecutive years.

While there is no ACS data to compare the CPS with in 2009, the 2009 CPS ASEC PUMS

estimate of the sex ratio is the highest estimate seen across all years.

        Taken together, the estimates in Figure 4 suggest that the CPS ASEC PUMS samples

may have been created using the Census Bureau's faulty disclosure avoidance techniques

beginning with the 2004 PUMS, continuing through the most recent available ASEC PUMS in

2009.

        Thus far we have shown that the PUMS samples produce inaccurate population estimates

and sex ratios for those ages 65 and up. The larger issue with these erroneous data is not simply

that sex ratios could be inaccurate, but rather that the sex and age data attached to each case is

probably often wrong, which creates the potential for the errors to spill over into analyses of any

related variable. When the PUMS vastly under-estimates the number of 65-year old women, for

instance, we have to wonder whether these "missing" women are included elsewhere in the

PUMS file. Given the unexplained surplus of women in higher age ranges, the altered cases were
                                                                                                    9


likely allocated to other, older ages. For instance, the lack of women in their mid-60s in Figure 1

seems to be offset by spikes of women in their early 70s and 80s. Alternatively, some of the

missing 65 year-old women could have been "switched" to be 65-year-old men, since Figure 1

also shows a surplus of men at age 65.

       These "reassigned" age and sex data could lead researchers to draw incorrect inferences

about any variable related to age or sex. For example, Figure 5 shows PUMS estimates of labor

force participation in 2000 as a proportion of published rates from the Census' internal files.

PUMS files underestimate labor force participation of men and women age 65 and substantially

overestimates labor force participation of women in their 70s and older and of men over age 75.

The likely explanation for this unusual trend is that people have been reassigned ages. For

example, women that the PUMS identifies as 70-to-74-year-olds may be women in their 60s or

men in their 70s; both groups with higher labor force participation and an over-representation in

the PUMS files.

       An examination of marriage rates further demonstrates problems with the population

sample at individual ages and gender beginning at age 65. Figure 6 shows estimates of the

proportion of women of each age who are currently married. In the 2007 ACS PUMS data,

which does not have the identified errors, women's marriage rates decline steadily from ages 60

to 75 as they become increasingly likely to be widows. In the 2006 ACS PUMS, which suffers

from the misapplication of disclosure avoidance techniques, marriage rates are particularly low

for 65 year-old women and particularly high for 68 year-old women.

       Figure 6's estimates for 65-year-old women reveal that the women whose ages were not

reassigned (i.e., those who were still classified as 65-year-olds) had significantly lower marriage

rates than one would expect based on the corrected 2007 data. This illustrates that, beyond the
                                                                                                                10


fact that there are not enough women in the PUMS files at age 65, the women that are there are

not representative of the whole set of 65-year-old women. This suggests that a non-random sub-

set of 65-year-old women were reassigned to older ages or to be men. For example, most persons

with an age value of 65 in the PUMS file may actually be a different age—there is no reason to

believe that just because there is an undercount that the remaining sample is truly the age or sex

that they are assigned in the PUMS data. Clearly, the problems in Census and ACS age/sex data

are complex and analyses of any variable that is expected to grow or decline with each year of

age could be biased as a result of the misapplied disclosure avoidance techniques.


Who is affected by this problem?

        We suspect that the problem with age and sex data for older adults is not widely known

among analysts relying on these data. After being alerted to the problem in 2008, the Census

Bureau created data notes (Data Note 12 and User Note 47) to let users know of potential

problems. However, these notes are not in locations where data users will necessarily see them.

Moreover, the emphasis of the data notes could give the impression that this is only an issue for

research that is specifically focused on sex ratios among the elderly.9 Finally, users have spent

nearly a decade using these data sources without being made aware of the problem. We believe

that the problems could be having broad-ranging effects for several different groups of stake-

holders, discussed in turn below.


(1) Researchers who treat age as a continuous variable

        These data issues raise serious concerns for researchers who analyze those ages 65 and

over in PUMS data. The problems with the data go beyond that which is currently described in

9
  The Census Bureau's User Notes may focus on sex ratios because the authors of this paper stressed this issue when
describing the problem to census staff. Our subsequent research to understand the extent of the problem revealed
that sex ratios are one of many statistics that is impacted by the misapplication of disclosure review techniques.
                                                                                                    11


the Census Bureau note (which implies that only sex ratios will be erroneously estimated in

PUMS files). As we document above, the issue is not simply that sex ratios could be inaccurate,

but rather that the sex and age data attached to each case is probably often wrong and the

remaining sample is not likely representative of the actual population at a given age and sex. It is

clear that PUMS files from the affected years should not be used by researchers for detailed

studies of the 65 and over population. Our research suggests that the data are only accurate when

grouped into a single 65 and over category. For example, our analysis of labor force participation

data shows that researchers interested in studying how the current economic downturn has

affected retirement behavior will be led astray if they use ACS (2003-2006) or CPS PUMS

(2004-2009) files in their analysis.


(2) Social service agencies that rely on PUMS data for important policy research

          The second major group of stake-holders affected by faulty age and sex values is social

service agencies who rely on the PUMS. Census Bureau microdata products are widely used by

the policy research community and by government agencies, both for allocation formulas to fund

specific government programs and for more general program planning (Blewett and Davern,

2007). One important example of estimates that could be impacted by the underlying error in the

PUMS data are the simulations used to project the solvency of Old Age, Survivors, and

Disability Insurance (OASDI). Age-sex ratios are commonly used to derive program estimates

and for long-term forecasting for the OASDI Trustees Report.10

          More generally, the Social Security Administration (SSA) also uses simulation models

"to estimate the effects of demographic and economic trends and legislative and policy options

                                                                                                    12


on various SSA programs and beneficiary populations now and in the future."11 Many of these

simulations rely on various census microdata samples. Because the population of greatest interest

to SSA is impacted by the errors outlined in this paper, SSA simulations could be significantly

biased. The Congressional Budget Office and Office of Management and the Budget also rely

heavily upon Census Bureau microdata to examine current programs and to assess the impact of

programmatic changes associated with proposed legislation (Glied, Remler, and Zivin, 2002).

           In many cases, public use microdata from the decennial census and American

Community Survey are the only sources that can address the needs of these agencies. While the

most recent two ACS PUMS files do not have these errors, it is important to note that using

public use data for the 2000 Census or the 2003-to-2006 ACS may result in incorrect

calculations and provide an incorrect baseline for understanding long-term change. For example,

when a federal agency identifies significant change between the 2000 and 2010 Censuses, for

instance, they may be interpreting social change where the only real change has been in the

accuracy of the data.


(3) Survey researchers who use PUMS data to generate population estimates

           Federal government agencies, survey data collection vendors, and pollsters regularly use

census data to construct survey weights. Tabulations generated from Census PUMS data are

often used in a process called "post-stratification," where preliminary survey weights are set so

that the sample cases sum up to Census Bureau totals by geography, age, sex, race, ethnicity, and

other key demographic variables.12 Post-stratification is commonly implemented using a

technique known as "raking," which could be sensitive to the age and sex errors in the PUMS.

Raking allows survey researchers to fit many control variables to their preliminary weighted total

11
     http://www.ssa.gov/515/ssaguidelines.html
12
      http://www.fcsm.gov/01papers/SPWP31_final.pdf
                                                                                                                  13


to make sure the survey adds up to appropriate totals by, for example, age and sex within a

specific geography. The data errors in the Census Bureau's PUMS data products would

especially be problematic for those surveys that fit age by sex control totals from Census PUMS

categories in five-year increments and include people 65 years of age and older.

           Researchers using any weighted dataset in which the weighting strategy relied on the

2000 Census or the 2003-2006 ACS PUMS samples need to consider the potential for errors in

their estimates. In such cases, researchers can investigate the potential error by charting any basic

demographic pattern by single year of age or by small age groupings, looking for unexpected

peaks or troughs in the statistics. As we have suggested above, the problems are severe enough

that they tend to produce visible divergences from expected patterns, such as was seen in sex

ratios and in sex-specific distributions of labor force status or marital status. Alternatively, one

could compare current estimates with those produced re-weight using information from a Census

PUMS file that does not have errors (such as the 2001 ACS PUMS file).

           Researchers, policy-makers, and survey researchers have expressed a clear desire for

accurate year-specific age data in the PUMS files. In fact, many researchers and policy makers

spoke to this exact issue as the Census Bureau was preparing the 2000 PUMS data. At that time,

the Census Bureau was considering a plan that would significantly reduce the PUMS's single-

year age detail for persons over age 65. In the quotes below, just a small sample of responses to

a survey administered and published by the Census 2000 Advisory Committee, researchers from

a variety of backgrounds made their objections to this plan clear.13


       •   "Aggregated age especially at older ages would be disastrous for analyses of the older
           and oldest-old (one of the fastest growing segments of the population)." (p. 35)

                                                                                                   14


   •   My research is on the marriage patterns of older women (especially related to the Social
       Security re-marriage penalty). I need to calculate marriage rates by age for women ages
       55-75, and this would be impossible with age-grouped data. (p. 51)

   •   "To understand age-related changes of behaviors and characteristics, the AGE IN
       SINGLE YEAR (65, 66, 67 etc.) is essential." (p. 58)

   •   "With the aging of the population the key demographic issue in the U.S., grouping data at
       the oldest ages poses a key threat to research on aging." (p. 61)


Data users need to be aware that, despite the Census Bureau's subsequent decision to provide

year-specific age data for the elderly, the misapplication of disclosure avoidance techniques has

resulted in PUMS files that contain data that must be grouped into a single 65 and over age-

group in order to provide accurate estimates of the population and behavior within it.


Correcting the Data

       The most straightforward fix for this problem would be to release updated datasets of all

affected samples from Census 2000, the 2003-2006 ACS, the 2004-2009 CPS ASEC, and any

other datasets produced with the faulty disclosure avoidance techniques. An alternative approach

would be to release additional cases for households containing persons aged 65 and up, since

internal data files contain significantly more cases than are made public in the PUMS. The

Census Bureau could draw new correctly-weighted samples for households containing persons

aged 65 and up in these years. These data could then be used to replace households containing

persons aged 65 and up in existing PUMS files.

       The Census Bureau and other data providers may be reluctant to take these approaches.

The Census Bureau's original user notes express concern that correcting the problem would

reveal too much information about the specific disclosure avoidance techniques currently being

used. Furthermore, there is always a reluctance to release additional cases, also for disclosure
                                                                                                 15


avoidance reasons. The Census Bureau sees the public release of only a subset of cases as an

important part of its disclosure avoidance strategy.

       It may be possible for the Census Bureau or the Bureau of Labor Statistics to correct the

problematic data while maintaining the integrity of the disclosure avoidance edit procedures. A

third approach that could potentially allow the Census Bureau to not identify which cases were

altered, and yet not release additional cases, would involve providing new weights for half of the

households currently in the PUMS files. Assuming that there is an accurate, representative sub-

sample by age and sex contained within the PUMS files, a new set of weights could be created

that would identify such a subsample. This could be done perhaps by assigning a weight value of

0 to all persons in households containing a case that was affected by the error. In order to mask

the disclosure avoidance technique that was in error, one could also give an additional subset of

households that were never in error would a weight of 0.

       Changing the weight values for the unaffected households would ensure that researchers

would not be able to identify the exact individuals who were affected by the erroneous disclosure

avoidance techniques. The remaining households would then receive an alternative weight

variable that researchers could use at their own discretion. Researchers focusing on groups below

age 65 could continue to use the old weights and the full case count. Researchers needing

accurate age information for those aged 65 and older could use the new weights, with the

understanding that they would only be analyzing a portion of the cases in the dataset.



Conclusion

       Most Census PUMS files published since 2000 have serious errors with age and/or sex

values for persons ages 65 and up. Datasets with errors include the 2000 5% and 1% Census
                                                                                               16


PUMS, the 2003-2006 ACS PUMS, the 2005-2007 3-year ACS PUMS, and the 2004-2009 CPS

ASEC files. Until a solution is devised, researchers should not use the affected samples to

conduct analyses that assume a representative sample of the population by age and sex for people

ages 65 and older. For any analysis relying on the age variable, we would recommend treating

those aged 65 and older as a single analytic category (making no differentiation between men

and women), or eliminating those ages 65 and up from the analysis. The problems with these

data highlight the complexities inherent in modern disclosure avoidance techniques; the fact that

the erroneous data went undocumented until late 2008 is suggestive of how difficult it can be to

connect data anomalies to less obvious disclosure avoidance techniques. We hope that this

document helps data users and producers to better understand the problem and to avoid making

further mistakes with the flawed public data files.
