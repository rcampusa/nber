The debate on the benefits of financial integration is revisited in a two-country neoclassical growth
model with aggregate uncertainty. Gains from more efficient capital allocation and gains from risk
sharing are accounted for simultaneously|together with their interaction. Global numerical methods
allow for meaningful welfare comparisons. Gains from integration are quantitatively small, even for
riskier and capital scarce emerging economies. These countries import capital for efficiency reasons
before exporting it for self-insurance, leading to capital ows and growth reversals along the transition.
This opens the door to a richer set of empirical implications than previously considered in the literature.

1      Introduction
 What are the welfare effects of financial integration? This is one of the perennial questions
in international macroeconomics and finance. The usual answer, given by academics and
taken up by policy makers, is that financial integration allows for a more efficient allocation
of capital and improves risk sharing across countries. To the extent that the policy making
world has been actively promoting financial integration, implicit in this answer is that these
gains are large enough quantitatively to offset any costs associated with integration. So
how large are actually the efficiency and risk sharing gains of financial integration? As the
literature stands, we cannot answer this question in one go.
    In the context of neoclassical growth models, capital flows from capital-abundant to
capital-scarce countries, raising welfare as the marginal product of capital is higher in the
latter than in the former. However, as the calibrations of Gourinchas and Jeanne (2006) show
in a deterministic model, the welfare gains brought by financial integration remain elusive.
Even when a country starts off with a low level of capital, speeding up its transition towards
its steady-state by opening the financial account brings small gains. The reason is that the
distortion induced by a lack of capital mobility is transitory: the country would have reached
its steady-state level of capital regardless of financial openness, albeit at a slower speed.
    In the context of the international risk-sharing literature, which usually does not feature
endogenous production, openness to financial flows allows country specific shocks to be
diversified away. The debate still rages regarding the magnitude of the gains from risk-
sharing (Cole and Obstfeld (1991), van Wincoop (1994, 1999), Tesar (1995), Lewis (1999,
2000)). In most studies, gains are of second order as financial integration allows a reduction
of consumption volatility but does not affect output.1 Welfare gains are potentially large if
the market price of risk is high—when asset price data are to be trusted, but remarkably
small if computed from consumption data with a reasonable risk aversion parameter (Lucas
(1987)).2 Recent work aims at reconciling the two by relying either on long-run consumption
risks (Colacito and Croce (2010), Lewis and Liu (2015)) or rare disasters risks (Martin
(2010)). In these contexts, financial integration may bring sizable gains but their magnitude
is sensitive to the cross-country correlation of long-run (or disaster) risks. In any case, the
framework used is the one of endowment economies, shutting down efficiency gains from
capital reallocation.
    Assessing efficiency and risk sharing gains separately, using two different types of models,

     A theoretical literature studies the effect of asset trade on efficient specialization and risk taking (Obstfeld
(1994), Acemoglu, and Zilibotti (1997), Martin and Rey (2006). We abstract from this channel.
   2
     Large welfare gains driven by realistic asset prices are also hard to reconcile with the observed degree of
portfolio home-bias (see Lewis (1999) and Coeurdacier and Rey (2013) for a recent survey).

prevents reaching a solid conclusion. Are those two gains substitute or complement? They
are surely intertwined as, through precautionary savings, the steady state level of the capital
stock depends on the level of risk agents seek to insure (see Aiyagari (1994)). Thus, when
capital is allowed to flow across borders, risk-sharing modifies the steady-state level of capital
stock and impacts the process of capital reallocation across countries. Financial integration
can therefore have a permanent effect on output in a stochastic environment.
    In this paper, we study how financial integration affects the growth and welfare of coun-
tries in a standard two country version of the stochastic neoclassical growth model. As a
well established benchmark in the psyche of economists, it underpins implicitly the widely
heard qualitative claims that financial integration improves capital allocation efficiency and
enables risk-sharing across countries. Ironically may be, since they have been very influential
in the policy world, those claims have not so far been evaluated in a quantitative version of
the model due to the technical difficulties of modelling aggregate uncertainty and production
in open economy settings. In our baseline model, the world is made of two heterogeneous
countries which are allowed to trade a risk-free bond internationally (incomplete financial
markets version of Backus et al. (1992) as in Baxter in Crucini (1995)). Countries produce
a single tradable good using capital and labor and face stochastic transitory productivity
shocks. Countries are allowed to be asymmetric in three dimensions: the amount of aggre-
gate risk they are facing, their level of capital at time of integration and their size. This
allows us to characterize ,in a richer way than the previous literature, which countries, if
any, reap large gains from integration.3 Our framework is particularly well suited to study
the integration of a set of emerging markets that face larger aggregate risk and tend to be
on average capital scarce. Importantly, it allows for general equilibrium effects, which can
be large since historically liberalization episodes occcured by waves—a set of countries in-
tegrating simultaneously.4 Our main experiment thus mimics the integration of risky and
capital scarce emerging markets to (safer) developed countries.
    Our main findings are that financial integration has very heterogeneous effects depending
on the stochastic structure of shocks, the size of countries and their initial degree of capital
scarcity. Interestingly, financial integration can generate output growth and capital flows
reversals along the transition, with capital flowing downstream initially and upstream later
on. Regarding welfare, financial integration does not bring sizable benefits to any plausi-
bly parameterized country, even for the typical emerging country—at most a permanent
increase in consumption of 0.5% in our calibration with a moderate risk aversion. The in-
    3
      Fogli and Perri (2015) present a two-country RBC model with aggregate risk but focus on the busi-
ness cycle implications of (asymmetric) changes in aggregate risk. They provide empirical evidence that
differences in aggregate risk are a source of capital flows—as in our framework. Kent (2013) provides a two-
country growth model with aggregate risk. The model is solved using perturbation methods so that welfare
implications and transition across steady-states are not studied. Angeletos and Panousi (2011) and Corneli
(2010) investigate how financial integration can affect the steady-state as well as the transition dynamics
in a model with uninsurable idiosyncratic entrepreneurial risk. See also Mendoza et al. (2008), Benhima
(2013) and Carroll and Jeanne (2015). In the absence of aggregate risk, they cannot explore the gains from
consumption smoothing through international risk sharing. Bai and Zhang (2010) also explores the size of
capital flows in a model with idiosyncratic risk and incomplete markets in the form of imperfect spanning
and limited commitment.

      Most emerging markets opened up to financial markets in the late eighties-early nineties. See Appendix
B for liberalization dates of emerging countries.


                                                     2
tuition for these results can be summarized as follows. Relatively safe (developed) countries
have small gains from reducing consumption volatility (Lucas (1987)). They also have small
gains due to a more efficient world allocation of capital after integration (Gourinchas and
Jeanne (2006)).5 Emerging countries face higher levels of uncertainty 6 and could have po-
tentially larger gains when they share risk. However, financial integration, by affecting the
distribution of risk across countries, also leads to a change in the value of the steady state
capital stocks. Unless riskier countries are also capital scarce, they will see capital flowing out
and output falling as their precautionary savings are reallocated towards safer (developed)
countries. When riskier countries are also significantly capital scarce (as emerging countries
in the data), the standard efficiency gains driven by faster convergence are strongly damp-
ened by the reallocation of precautionary savings. Our findings thus qualify in an important
way the conventional wisdom that emerging countries should face larger gains from finan-
cial integration since they face more volatile business cycles. They significantly differ from
the risk-sharing literature, which would, in the context of endowment economies, typically
predict much higher gains for riskier countries. Our baseline calibration relies on parameter
values for risk aversion and levels of risk in line with the business cycles literature but at
the expense of counterfactually low risk premia. In an alternative calibration, we show that
increasing the market price of risk using non-expected recursive utility (increasing risk aver-
sion as in Tallarini (2000)) generates higher welfare gains from integration. But the same
logic applies: gains for volatile emerging countries are dampened by an even stronger capital
reallocation towards safer countries. Gains for riskier (emerging) countries are below 0.5% of
permanent consumption. Safer countries actually benefit the most from integration as their
permanent increase in consumption approaches 1%. They sell insurance at higher price and
benefit from a larger fall in the world interest rate upon integration. Following the long-run
risks literature (Bansal and Yaron (2004), Lewis and Liu (2015), Nakamura et al. (2014)
among others), an extension of our model considers persistent shocks to world productivity
growth—allowing us to generate meaningful risk premia without relying on extreme degrees
of risk aversion. Our findings are robust to this extension and, if, anything welfare gains are
smaller—countries are reluctant to built leveraged positions to limit their exposure to the
world long-run risk, which reduces their ability to smooth country specific transitory shocks.
    From a methodological point of view, the paper provides an accurate welfare assessment
using a ‘global solution’ for the model along the transition path and around the steady-
states. Standard approximation methods based on perturbation or log-linearization around
deterministic steady-states (see Judd (1998)) are not well suited. As the steady-state depends
on the risk sharing opportunities of agents, we should focus on risky steady-states and not
deterministic ones (Coeurdacier, Rey and Winant (2011)). Because financial integration
modifies the ability to smooth shocks, it has a first order effect on the steady-state. Moreover,
global solutions allow for an accurate treatment of non-linearities, when countries are far
away from their steady-states (as it is typically the case with incomplete markets), or when
the utility function has extreme curvature. We build on Kubler and Schmedders (2003) to
develop ‘global methods’ necessary for the welfare evaluation of financial integration in a
two-country stochastic model with incomplete markets.7

    Hoxha et al. (2013) find higher welfare gains in a model where capital goods are not perfect substitutes.

    Contrary to standard perturbation methods, the method captures well non-linearities
over the state space, and can deal with high risk premia and/or large persistent shocks.
    From an empirical perspective, no clear evidence emerges from the literature regarding
the effect of financial integration on growth and risk sharing. Henry (2007), Kose et al.
(2009) provide excellent surveys of the hundreds of papers analyzing the effect of financial
integration on growth. Overall, the evidence is mixed, ranging from no effect on growth
to moderate effects of at most 1% per year following the liberalization of financial flows.
Similarly, empirical results on the impact of financial integration on risk-sharing are very
mixed (Kose et al. (2007)). Our results show that the effect of financial integration on growth
and welfare is very heterogeneous (across countries and over time) depending in particular
on risk characteristics and a number of other conditioning variables. Such heterogeneity can
explain the difficulties of the empirical literature which, by focusing on the average effect of
financial integration, could not reach a conclusive answer.8
    The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 develops our baseline model of financial
integration and describes briefly our solution method. Section 3 presents our main findings
regarding the growth impact of financial integration, the dynamics of consumption and net
foreign assets in our stochastic environment. Section 4 evaluates quantitatively the welfare
benefits of financial integration. Section 5 provides robustness checks and extensions of our
findings, performing sensitivity analysis with respect to the specification of shocks—including
a long-run risk component, asset market structures and market sizes. Section 6 concludes.


2     A baseline model of financial integration
We consider a two-country neoclassical growth model with aggregate uncertainty. Countries
can be asymmetric in three dimensions: the aggregate risk they face, their initial level of
capital and their size. This allows us to analyze the benefits of financial integration in terms
of gains from capital accumulation due to capital scarcity together with gains from risk
sharing, and study how these gains are distributed across heterogeneous countries.
    In our baseline model, we consider an incomplete market set-up where countries are
allowed to trade in a riskless bond only. This regime of financial integration is compared to
a benchmark model where countries stay under financial autarky. This incomplete markets
environment is more realistic since the focus is on the liberalization episodes of emerging
markets. At the time of their financial integration in late eighties-early nineties, capital
flows were mostly driven by intertemporal borrowing and lending (Kraay et al. (2005)).9
In robustness checks (Section 5), we consider the alternative case of complete markets to
provide some upper-bounds of the benefits of integration.
where the policy function is approximated by products of polynomials over a grid of current state variables.
    8
      The literature on the positive effects of FDI on growth has reached more consensus but does not fit well
our context as we abstract from direct effects (or positive externalities) of integration on TFP. See Alfaro et
al. (2009), Section 2, for references and recent evidence in Fons-Rosen et al. (2013).
    9
      Portfolio equity home bias is also very extreme for emerging markets, even nowadays, as pointed out in
Coeurdacier and Rey (2013).

where Ai,t is a stochastic level of total factor productivity; log(Ai,t ) follows an AR(1) process

                                                                      σD      ζσD σE

The law of motion of the capital stock in each country is:

where 0 < δ < 1 is the depreciation rate of capital and ii,t is gross investment in country i
at date t. φ(x) is an adjustment cost function:
                                                   1−ξ 
                                                   x
                                  φ (x) = a1 + a2
                                                   1−ξ

with ξ measuring the degree of adjustment costs, a1 and a2 chosen such that φ(δ) = δ and
φ0 (δ) = 1.11
Factor payments. Labour and capital markets are perfectly competitive and inputs are
paid their marginal productivity. If wi,t denotes the wage rate in country i and ri,t the rental
rate of capital, we have:

                             wi,t li,t = (1 − θ) yi,t       ;       ri,t ki,t = θyi,t                     (3)

For simplicity, we normalize population to unity in each country: li,t = 1. Country size
is then parametrized by productivity levels in our set-up (and not population).12 We also
implicitly assume an inelastic labor supply. If anything, this tends to increase the gains from
international risk sharing by suppressing a margin of adjustment of households following
shocks.
Preferences. Country i is inhabited by a representative household with Epstein-Zin pref-
  10
     Note that increasing the variance of the shocks also imply multiplying the productivity level by a (very)
small constant number in our parametrization. This is equivalent to a minor change in country size which
does not affect the findings.
  11
     The definition of φ (x) ensures that in the neighborhood of i = δk (replacement of capital), adjustment
costs are zero to a first-order. Note also that, for ξ = 0 (no adjustment costs), φ(x) = x—implying a standard
law of accumulation, while for ξ → ∞, ki,t+1 = ki,t —corresponding to fixed capital (endowment economy).
  12
     This is irrelevant for the model dynamics as long as one focuses on capital per efficiency units.

(i) Financial autarky. Under financial autarky, the only vehicle for savings is domestic
capital. A household can therefore either consume or invest in domestic capital the revenues
from labour and capital. This gives the following household budget constraint:

                                          ci,t + ii,t = wi,t + ri,t ki,t .

Investment decisions in country i satisfies the following Euler equation:

                                    φ0i,t
                                                                         

                   ii,t                                                                           ii,t
where φi,t = φ      and
                   ki,t
                              φ0i,t
                             denotes the first derivative of φ(x) at x =    .                     ki,t
Abstracting from capital adjustment costs (φ(x) = x), we get the usual Euler equation:

                                      Et [Mi,t+1 (1 + ri,t+1 − δ)] = 1

where ri,t denotes the marginal productivity of capital defined in Eq. (3).
The associated goods market clearing condition in country i is:

                                                ci,t + ii,t = yi,t .                                         (7)

(ii) Financial integration: bond-only economy. We introduce a riskless international bond
whose price at date t is pt and which delivers one unit of good in the next period. Bonds are
in zero net supply. The instantaneous budget constraint at date t in country i becomes:

                                ci,t + ii,t = wi,t + ri,t ki,t + bi,t−1 − bi,t pt



                                                         6
where bi,t denotes bond purchases at date t by country i. For computational reasons, one
needs to bound the state space for bond holdings. We do so by assuming that agents in
country i face the following borrowing constraint under financial integration,

                                               bi,t ≥ bi .                                           (8)

The debt limit bi < 0 is chosen small enough in our simulations such that the constraint
barely affects the path of bi,t .13 The Euler equation for bond holdings in country i = {D, E}
is:
                                      pt = Et [Mi,t+1 ] + µi,t                              (9)
where µi,t ≥ 0 is the Lagrange multiplier associated to the borrowing constraint (Eq. (8)).
Household investment decisions satisfies the same Euler equation as before (Eq. (6)).
Model is closed with goods and bonds market clearing conditions:

                                           bD,t + bE,t = 0                                          (10)
                              cD,t + iD,t + cE,t + iE,t = yD,t + yE,t                               (11)

Definition of equilibrium. Under autarky, an equilibrium in a country i is a sequence of
consumption and capital stocks (ci,t ; ki,t+1 ) such that individual Euler equations for invest-
ment decisions are verified (Equation (6)) and goods market clears at all dates (Equation
(7)).
    Under financial integration, an equilibrium is a sequence of consumption, capital stocks
and bond holdings in both countries (ci,t ; ki,t+1 ; bi,t )i={D,E} and a sequence of bond prices pt
such that Euler equations for investment decisions are verified in both countries (Equation
(6)), Euler equations for bonds together with borrowing constraints are verified in both
countries (Equations (8) and (9)), bonds and goods markets clear at all dates (Equations
(10) and (11)).

2.2     Solution method
Motivation for a global solution. From a methodological point of view, the paper pro-
vides a ‘global solution’ for the model accurate around the steady-states as well as along the
transition path. Standard approximation methods based on perturbation or log-linearization
around a deterministic steady-state are not well suited for welfare evaluations. First, with
incomplete markets, net foreign assets are extremely persistent (Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe
(2003)) and the dynamics of the model can drift away from the point of approximation—
casting doubt on the accuracy of the approximation along the transition dynamics. Second,
the steady state depends on the risk sharing opportunities of agents due to the presence of
precautionary savings so that we should focus on a risky steady-state and not a deterministic
one as in standard perturbation methods. The risky steady-state is the point where state
and choice variables remain unchanged if agents expect future risk but shocks innovations
turn out to be zero (Coeurdacier, Rey and Winant (2011), Juillard (2012)). In general, it
  13
    The numerical applications take full account of occasionally binding constraints. In our simulations,
they are seldom binding and have almost no effect on the dynamics (see discussion in Appendix C).



                                                   7
differs from the deterministic one where agents do not expect any risk in the future.14 Third,
standard perturbation methods are found to be less appropriate, when non-linearities are
important (e.g. when countries are far away from their steady-state) and/or when coun-
tries are asymmetric as in our baseline simulations (Rabitsch, Stepanchuk and Tsyrennikov
(2015)).
Time-iteration algorithm. We solve the model using the time-iteration algorithm (Cole-
man (1991) and Judd, Kubler and Schmedders (2002)). This algorithm is theoretically
appealing since it illustrates computationally a contraction mapping property of rational
expectations behaviour. In single agents models its convergence has been proven to be
equivalent to value function iteration (Rendahl (2015)). To our knowledge, there is no such
proof of convergence in generic two-agent models, with incomplete markets, even as simple
as ours. For this reason the time-iteration algorithm can be seen as a substitute to missing
theoretical tools in order to investigate the convergence properties of our model.
Model reformulation. Using the net-zero supply condition for bonds (Eq. (10)), we choose
to track only bond holdings of the Developed country by setting bt = bD,t with the constraint
bD = b ≤ bt ≤ b = −bE . In order to separate conceptually the states from the endogenous
controls, we set
                                           dt = bt−1 ,                                   (12)
and define st = (kD,t , kE,t , dt ) the vector of endogenous states.
Our solution approach makes use of first order conditions (Equations (6) and (9)) to solve for
unknown policy rules for investment ii,t , bond holdings bt and the bond price pt . Because of
Epstein-Zin preferences, these conditions depend on the utility values Ui,t . We thus append
                                                                  ?

Equation (9) is rewritten as a single pricing equation,

                                pt = Et [λt MD,t+1 + (1 − λt )ME,t+1 ] ,                                (15)
                       
                bt −b
with λt =        such that λt = 0 (resp. λt = 1) when country D (resp. E) is constrained.
                b−b
With this formulation, the bond price is always set by a non-constrained country. Lastly,
using complementarity notations,15 one can get rid of the Lagrange multipliers µi,t and
rewrite Equation (15) together with Equation (8) as follows:

                               Et [ME,t+1 ] − Et [MD,t+1 ] ⊥ b ≤ bt ≤ b                                 (16)
  14
     It also differs from the stochastic steady-state, which is the state of the economy averaged over an
asymptotically stable distribution (Clarida (1987)).
  15
     For any scalars x, y, a, b, the complementarity condition y ⊥ a ≤ x ≤ b is equivalent to say that one of
the three following conditions must be met: either y = 0, or y > 0 and x = a, or y < 0 and x = b. For
vectors x, y, a, b, the complementarity condition (y ⊥ a ≤ x ≤ b) must hold coordinate by coordinate, i.e.
yn ⊥ an ≤ xn ≤ bn .

omy and by xt = (UD,t , UE,t , UD,t , UE,t , iD,t , iE,t , pt , bt ) the full set of controls. Introducing
two smooth functions f (for Equations (6), (13), (14), (15) and (16)) and g (for Equations
(2) and (12)), our model is reformulated as follows:

                    Et [f (mt , st , xt , mt+1 , st+1 , xt+1 )] ⊥ x ≤ xt ≤ x,                             (17)
                                                          st+1 = g(mt , st , xt , mt+1 )                  (18)

with boundaries on xt : x = (−∞, −∞, −∞, −∞, −∞, −∞, b) and x = (∞, ∞, ∞, ∞, ∞, ∞, b).
Numerical implementation. We discretize the bivariate exogenous process of productivity
mt as a discrete Markov chain with 3×3 states, and choose a compact domain for endogenous
states D = (kD,t ∈ [1, 10]) × (kE,t ∈ [1, 10]) × (dt ∈ [−5, 5]), which is discretized using
30 × 30 × 30 points. For each discrete combination (mt , st ), the numerical solution of Eq.
(17) and Eq. (18) yields corresponding values for the controls xt . We use natural cubic
splines to interpolate between the grid points. The solution of our problem is a decision
rule xt = ϕ(mt , st ), continuous with respect to st . The relatively high number of grid
points (243000) is needed to produce accurate welfare estimates.16 The implementation of
the time-iteration algorithm is further detailed in Appendix C.

2.3     Calibration
Our structural parameters, set on a yearly basis, are summarized in Table 1.
Preferences. We use a standard value for the discount rate β of 0.96. In the CRRA case
coefficient of risk aversion γ is set to 4 (Baseline Low Risk Aversion).17 This pins down the
elasticity of intertemporal substitution (EIS) 1/ψ to 1/4, which is in the range of estimates in
the literature, towards the lower end of the distribution though.18 Results with a higher EIS
are provided in Section 5 but note that a low EIS implies larger benefits from integration,
giving the best chances to our calibration to generate large gains. Since the risk aversion
coefficient is a crucial parameter for the quantitative properties of the model, higher levels
of risk aversion are also considered — keeping the EIS constant to its baseline value of 1/4.
We set γ up to 40 in our alternative calibration (Baseline High Risk Aversion).
Technology. The depreciation rate δ and the capital share θ are set to standard values,
respectively 8% and 30%. The capital adjustment costs parameter ξ is set to 0.2. In line
with the data, this generates a volatility for the rate of investment about 2.5 times higher
than the volatility of output.19

This can be reduced to 25 minutes when using the improvement method from Winant (2017).
   17
      Macro models typically use a lower value of 2 while the finance literature uses higher values such as 30
or above to generate meaningful risk premia.
   18
      Most of the empirical literature finds estimates of the EIS between 0.1 and 0.5 (Hall (1988), Vissing-
Jorgensen (2002), Yogo (2004), Best et al. (2017) among others). The macro asset pricing literature discussed
in Guvenen (2006) assumes higher values between 0.5 and 1, even though the long-run risk literature focuses
on values above unity (Bansal and Yaron (2004)). Those cases are investigated in Section 5.2.
   19
      Standard moments for business cycles and asset prices in our baseline calibrations under autarky and
financial integration are reported in Appendix A.1.

of equal size—equalizing the initial level of productivity across countries: AD,0 = AE,0 = 1.
This is for two reasons. First, we focus on the role played by heterogeneity in risk and/or
in the level of capital, neutralizing any effect driven by the size of countries. Second, unlike
other studies, our focus is not the financial integration of small economies. In the late 1980s-
early 1990s, a large set of emerging markets integrated almost simultaneously (see Appendix
B for a list of countries and liberalization dates). These countries account for a large share of
world GDP, around 50% in 1990,20 so that general equilibrium effects cannot be neglected.
The importance of size for our results is investigated further in Section 5.
    A crucial exogenous parameter for our analysis is the capital stock in both countries at
time of integration. In all our baseline experiments, country D starts at its autarky steady-
state. Country E is significantly capital-scarce, its initial capital stock being 50% of the
initial capital stock of country D. This choice for capital scarcity is well justified regarding
the set of emerging markets which opened financially since 1985. Their capital-output ratio
at time of opening is on average 62% of the one of (already integrated) developed countries,
  20
    The total set of emerging countries liberalizing described in Appendix B accounted in 1990 for 97% of
the GDP size of (already integrated) developed countries. If we focus only on emerging countries belonging
to the main liberalization wave (between 1988 and 1992), they still account for 83% of the size of (already
integrated) developed countries. Note that this sample of countries does not include Russia and Central and
Eastern European countries due to lack of data for these countries pre-1990. See Appendix B for details.


                                                    10
where capital is measured using a perpetual inventory method. With a usual Cobb-Douglas
production function, this corresponds to a level of capital per efficiency units in emerging
markets equal to 52% of the one of developed countries (see Appendix B for details).
Stochastic structure. In our baseline simulations, we assume that country E is riskier
than country D (σD ≤ σE ). Appendix B, provides evidence on the difference in volatility
between developed countries and a set of emerging markets which integrated into the world
economy since 1985. On an annual basis, the average output growth volatility of these
liberalizing emerging markets is 4.9% compared to 2.5% in (already integrated) developed
countries. Accordingly, in our baseline calibration, σD is set to 2.5% while σE is twice as
large, set to 5%. The persistence of stochastic shocks ρ is set to 0.9 for both countries.21
For simplicity, we assume, that productivity shocks are uncorrelated across countries but
investigates alternative stochastic structures in Section 5. If anything, such a calibration
tends to overstate the gains from financial integration, as the potential for risk sharing is
overestimated.


3      Growth and consumption dynamics in a risky world
We turn to the simulations of our model in the baseline calibrations. This section describes
the growth and consumption dynamics of countries under integration (compared to autarky)
as well as the paths of net foreign assets and world interest rates. These simulations are also
helpful to build intuitions for the welfare implications developed in Section 4.

3.1     A riskless world: the role of capital scarcity
First, we briefly recall the predictions of the neoclassical growth model with respect to finan-
cial integration in a deterministic environment. In partial equilibrium analyses, countries,
modeled as small open economies with different degrees of capital scarcity, do not impact
the world rate of interest when they integrate financially. They import capital if their au-
tarky interest rate is above the world rate of interest, which will be generally the case if
they are capital-scarce emerging markets. Upon integration, their time profile of consump-
tion is perfectly smoothed, investment jumps up. Capital flows from ‘low marginal product
of capital countries’ (developed countries) to ‘high marginal product countries’ (emerging
countries). Financial integration brings welfare gains at it speeds up capital accumulation
towards the steady state capital stock, pinned down by the exogenous world rate of inter-
est. Quantitatively, Gourinchas and Jeanne (2006) show these gains are small (around 1%
increase in permanent consumption for realistic degrees of capital scarcity), a reflection of
their transitory nature.
Experiment 1: A riskless world in general equilibrium. Figure 1 shows the dynam-
ics of macro variables in a non-stochastic environment (σD = σE = 0).22 Compared to
Gourinchas and Jeanne (2006), we relax the small open economy assumption—so the world
  21
     Such a persistence parameter for productivity shocks is well within the range of admissible values (stan-
dard estimates on an annual basis are usually slightly lower even though not statistically different from 1).
A lower value for ρ would reduce further the benefits from integration.
  22
     Simulations are performed with an EIS ψ equal to 1/4. The risk aversion is irrelevant in this case.

Countries are symmetric except for initial capital stock. The capital scarce country is endowed
at the date of integration with 50% of the autarkic steady-state capital stock while the developed
economy starts at its steady state. There is no uncertainty. Dotted lines (resp. solid lines) refer to
autarky levels (resp. levels under integration).


rate of interest is here endogenously determined. The environment is symmetric except that
the emerging country starts off being 50% capital scarce, while the rest of the world (de-
veloped country) starts at its autarky steady state. The upper (lower) panel of Figure 1
shows the capital and consumption transition paths for the developed (emerging) country
as well as interest rates (net external debt over GDP). Dashed lines refer to autarky levels
while plain lines refer to levels after integration. The developed country lends to the capital
scarce emerging country to finance its capital accumulation: country D cuts consumption
and grows at a slower pace under integration, while the emerging country grows faster. Like
in the small open economy case, the benefits of integration come from the capacity of the
capital scarce economy to borrow in order to speed up capital accumulation and reach faster
its steady state capital stock. Unlike in the small open economy case, consumption is not
constant over time and the debt level is not as high due to the increase of the world interest
rate upon integration. In general equilibrium, the increase in output and consumption of
the capital scarce economy are dampened by adverse movements of the world interest rate.

3.2     A risky world: capital scarcity and risk sharing effects
We now turn to the richer predictions of the stochastic model, focusing on the interactions
between the risk sharing motives and the effect of integration on capital accumulation. To
our knowledge, these interactions, which materially affect the predictions of the model with
respect to consumption, investment and output have not been studied in the literature.
Risky steady-states. The steady state of the model depends on the risk sharing opportu-
nities of agents due to the presence of precautionary savings (Coeurdacier, Rey and Winant


                                                             12
(2011)). As financial integration modifies the ability to smooth shocks, it has a first order ef-
fect in the long-run by modifying the steady-state towards which the economy is converging.
Under autarky, countries converge to a steady-state described in the first panel of Table 2
in the CRRA case (Baseline low risk aversion, Top Panel) and in the Epstein-Zin case (High
risk aversion, Bottom Panel). The difference in volatility is the only (long-run) asymmetry
in the model. The riskier country E accumulates more capital and produces more output
in its autarky steady-state. This is due to the presence of higher precautionary savings in
that country which also depress its autarky interest rate. With a low risk aversion, the
model generates fairly small cross-country differences in the autarky steady-state levels of
capital. The riskier country E ends up with a level of capital stock 4% higher than the safer
country (top panel of Table 2). With a higher level of risk aversion (γ = 40), precautionary
savings increase and differences in autarkic steady-states level of capital are much larger:
the riskier country ends up having a capital stock 25% higher (bottom panel of Table 2).23
Despite a significant effect of risk on the interest rate and the capital stock, risk premia
remain relatively small, even with a high risk aversion.24 However, it is important to note
that the return on equity is equal to the return on risky capital in our baseline. Changing
the dividend policy by introducing some leverage increases the riskiness of dividends and the
equity premium (Jermann (1998)). In Appendix A.3, we show how levered dividends can
generate equity premia 4 to 5 times larger than in our baseline of Table 2—without affecting
the firm value, consumption and capital accumulation (Modigliani-Miller).25
    Under financial integration (bond only), the steady-state level of capital converges across
countries as the riskless rate is equalized across borders. Note however that capital stocks
are not fully equalized across countries. The riskier country E ends up with a stock of capital
permanently lower than the safer country D as the risk premium on capital remains higher in
E due to larger volatility. In other words, contrary to autarky, the cost of capital in E is above
the one in D: the increase in the riskless rate in E dominates the fall in the risk premium. The
difference between the two capital stocks remains however quantitatively very small. With
a high degree of risk aversion (γ = 40) and a more realistic market price of risk, the risky
country ends up with a capital stock under integration about 6% lower than the safe country.
The reason is that financial integration brings significant risk-sharing opportunities, despite
markets remaining incomplete. As both countries can smooth consumption better following
productivity shocks, precautionary savings decline and the world steady-state capital stock
falls. This largely affects the riskier country which ends up producing less under financial
integration than in the autarkic steady-state—the opposite holds for the safer country.26
  23
     The higher steady-state capital stock in autarky in the emerging country might appear counterfactual.
This is true only at the steady-state for which there is potentially no empirical counterpart. In the data,
at time of opening, emerging markets are significantly capital scarce. Under integration, the riskier country
has a lower steady-state capital stock.
  24
     This is a well-known limit of models with production economies (Jermann (1998), Tallarini (2000)).
However, as in Tallarini (2000), our calibration with high risk aversion does replicates reasonable market
prices of risk (ratio of risk premium to excess returns volatility). See Appendix A.1.
  25
     With a high risk aversion, the equity premium with levered dividends is however somewhat lower than
in the data, unless assuming a leverage that exceeds the data.
  26
     In our baseline calibrations, the level of risk is heterogeneous across countries but when the two countries
are equally risky, financial integration still enables them to share their aggregate risk. This reduces the need
for precautionary savings in both countries and leads to lower steady state levels of capital stock and output.

The riskier country turns into a net lender in the steady-state as it gets rid of some of his
risk by holding a positive net foreign asset position. The safer country is willing to hold
that risk by having a leveraged position since it faces a lower amount of aggregate risk.
Contrary to what is obtained with local approximations around a deterministic steady-state
(see Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe (2003)), our global solution pins down a stationary cross-
country distribution of wealth. In the long term, there is a stable level of debt associated
with the equilibrium world rate of interest. Intuitively, the accumulation of net foreign
assets by the riskier country is less attractive once his ‘buffer stock’ of precautionary savings
is reached. An unpleasant feature of our predictions though, is the extreme value for the net
foreign asset position once the integrated steady-state is reached—above 200% of GDP.

                                                 14
    This calls for two comments. First, welfare gains from integration as computed in Section
4 would be further reduced if the developed country was not allowed—through a stricter
borrowing limit—to take such an extreme leveraged position to insure the emerging country.
Second, our extension with a worldwide long-run risk component for productivity growth
(Section 5) resolves that unrealistic feature of the model, while keeping our results mostly
unaffected.
    This comparison across steady-states highlights a crucial force that is at play within our
model when financial integration takes place: integration enables better risk sharing, which
at the same time affects the steady state level of capital stock as precautionary savings
adjust. As a result the speed of capital accumulation associated to the usual neoclassical
gains to financial integration will be altered. We now turn to the description of the transitory
dynamics following financial integration in our baseline experiment.
Experiment 2. Growth and capital flows dynamics along the risky path. This
experiment corresponds to the financial integration of a large, risky and capital scarce (emerg-
ing) country E to a safe (developed) country D. We first stick to the CRRA calibration
(Baseline Low risk aversion). In Figure 2, we plot the dynamics of consumption and capital
in both countries under autarky or following financial integration (in period zero), together
with the interest rate in country D and net external debt in country E. Dynamics of ag-
gregate variables are taken along the path where agents expect stochastic shocks but the
realization of innovations are zero. We refer to this path as the risky path. When a country is
capital-scarce and far away from its autarky steady-state, its growth accelerates following fi-
nancial integration—fostering convergence, like in the deterministic model. But the key new
aspect is that the steady-state towards which the country converges is changing with finan-
cial integration due to risk-sharing opportunities. Since the growth rate of output depends
on how far the country is from its steady-state, two forces are at play: the capital scarcity
effect and the risk sharing effect which alters the desirability of precautionary savings and
modifies the country’s steady-state upon integration.
    For country E, which is both capital scarce and volatile, these two forces are conflicting
(Figure 2, bottom panel). On the one hand, capital scarcity implies faster convergence and
faster growth upon financial integration compared to autarky. On the other hand, since the
steady-state level of capital of the riskier country decreases with integration, the country
is now closer to its steady-state. This implies a lower rate of output growth compared to
autarky. Which effect dominates at a given date depends on the initial level of capital stock
in the country and distances towards autarky and integration steady-states. If country E
is sufficiently capital scarce as in our baseline experiment, the capital scarcity effect dom-
inates initially and financial integration leads to a growth acceleration in country E. This
acceleration is however muted compared to the deterministic case.27 As time passes, the
capital scarcity effect dissipates and the dominant effect is the risk sharing one. Growth
slows down and is lower under integration than under autarky. For country D, which starts
at its autarky steady-state (upper panel of Figure 2), the growth rate tends to fall on impact
since resources are initially allocated to the capital scarce economy with the highest marginal
  27
    In another experiment not shown where capital scarcity is less important (country E being 15% away
from country D’s capital stock), country E is growing at a slower pace compared to autarky at the date of
integration.

productivity of capital. Later on, the growth rate of country D picks up since it enjoys a
higher steady-state level of output as it integrates with a more volatile economy. Interest-
ingly, both countries exhibit growth and consumption reversals due to financial integration.

         Figure 2: Dynamics along the risky path in Experiment 2 (low risk aversion).
Notes: Parameters of the model are shown in Table 1 (baseline with low risk aversion γ = 4).
Countries are asymmetric in terms of risk with σE = 2σD . Initial capital stock of the risky country
E is at 50% of the one in the safe country D. Safe country starts at its autarky steady-state.
Dotted lines (resp. solid lines) refer to autarky levels (resp. levels under integration).

    For capital flows, similar conflicting forces are at play: on the one hand, country E has a
higher marginal productivity of capital at opening and is willing to borrow internationally.
On the other hand, E wants to lend for self-insurance due to its higher level of risk. When
the country is further away from its steady-state, the capital scarcity effect dominates and
country E tends to run current account deficits. As it converges, the risk sharing effect
starts to dominate and country E runs current account surpluses. In the long-run, the
intertemporal budget constraint imposes that country E, which ends up as a net lender,
runs trade deficits financed by debt payments of country D. Hence, our model exhibits
capital flow reversals along the transition path. Quantitatively, country E starts running a
trade deficit of about 10% of its GDP immediately after opening, then moves into surplus of
roughly 3% of GDP (attained after two decades) before moving back again much later into
a deficit.
Experiment 3. Growth and capital flows dynamics with high risk aversion. We
consider the alternative calibration under non-expected utility, setting the risk aversion γ to
the value of 40 to increase the market price of risk (see Tallarini (2000) among others).
    Figure 3 shows the main variables of interest following integration. The dynamic is
quantitatively altered compared to the previous experiment with a low risk aversion but
intuitions are the same. We insist on the differences in terms of output growth dynamics.
Since countries care more about risk, the effects driven by the reallocation of precautionary
savings are quantitatively amplified compared to the effects due to capital scarcity. Capital

still moves away from the capital-abundant country D upon integration, which grows initially
at a smaller pace. However, this reallocation of capital due to the capital scarcity of E is
severely muted and quickly dominated by the reallocation of precautionary savings away
from the risky country towards the safe one. D grows at a much faster pace later on, ending
with a significantly higher capital stock.28 Capital flows towards D finance a long-lasting
consumption and investment boom in the country. In contrast, despite a low initial capital
stock, the output growth of the emerging market barely increases at integration and over
time the country turns into a capital exporter, growing at a slower pace than it would have
under autarky.

3.3       Empirical Implications
Our experiments mimic the financial integration episodes of a large set of emerging markets
starting in the late eighties. We discuss the main testable implications in light of the litera-
ture on the growth effect of financial integration and confront to the data some predictions
regarding the dynamics of capital flows and asset prices along the long-lasting transition.
The growth effect of financial integration. Our experiments illustrate the heteroge-
nous effects of financial integration on output growth both across developed and emerging
countries and over time. One strand of the empirical literature, based on cross-country re-
gressions, tries to identify an average effect of financial integration on growth—leaving aside
potential heterogeneous responses (see survey by Kose et al. (2009)). Empirical estimates
vary widely across studies, across countries samples and time-periods. By showing that
  28
    The permanent difference in the long-run capital stock between autarky and integration is quantitatively
important when risk premia are large: under integration, country D ends up with capital stock 6% larger
while E ends up with a capital stock 20% smaller.


                                                               17
the growth effect of financial integration varies across countries and over time, our theory
qualifies this empirical literature and sheds some light on the lack of robust findings.
    Another strand of the literature discussed in Henry (2007) compares the growth per-
formance of emerging markets before and after financial integration—zooming on the time-
window around capital account liberalization episodes. This literature tends to find more
robust positive effects of financial integration on output and capital accumulation. The ef-
fect remains very moderate though, an increase in output growth in emerging countries of at
most 1% following liberalization episodes—likely an upper-bound due to policy endogeneity
(Henry (2007)). In line with the evidence, output growth in country E does increase at the
time of integration in our baseline experiments and the magnitude of the effect is within
the range of empirical estimates.29 However, our experiments also qualifies this empirical
evidence. While the emerging country is predicted to grow faster at opening, it grows at a
slower pace compared to autarky later on. These empirical studies are silent regarding the
effect at longer horizons. One cannot identify the impact of integration decades later without
counterfactual growth observed in an autarky regime. This is precisely why our theory is
helpful in enlightening the debate on the growth effects of financial integration.
The dynamics of capital flows. In our experiments, emerging countries initially import
capital to finance their faster capital accumulation (capital scarcity effect) before turning
into capital exporters for self-insurance (risk-sharing effect). Turning to data on net external
positions (Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2018)), one can aggregate current account balances and
net foreign assets for the sample of 40 emerging markets liberalizing in the late eighties/early
nineties (Appendix B.1). This sample did exhibit a capital flows reversal over the recent
period. While capital was flowing towards this set of emerging markets until the late nineties,
they started to run current account surpluses in the 2000s. Their net foreign assets as a share
of GDP worsen until 1999 before improving in the later years.30
The dynamics of asset prices. Our theory provides predictions regarding the evolution
of the risk-free rate and the return to risky capital during the transition in the integration
regime: (i) the initial faster accumulation of capital in the emerging country together with the
later progressive reallocation of precautionary savings trigger a long-lasting fall in the risk-
free rate; (ii) over time, the developed country provides insurance to the emerging country
and its levered external position translates into a higher risk premium on its capital; (iii)
for the emerging country, improved risk-sharing lowers the risk premium. The predictions
are consistent with the fall of the world real interest rate since the late 1980s.31 Considering
   29
      Considering the estimates of Henry (2007), the growth rate of the capital stock increases by 1.1% in the
years following liberalization episodes. Abstracting from effects on total factor productivity, this corresponds
to a 0.4% increase in output growth with a capital share of 1/3. In experiment 2 (resp. 3), output growth
increases by about 1% (resp. 0.05%) following integration. Related empirical studies (see Henry (2007))
focus on the asset prices implications of integration, finding a fall in the cost of capital and/or a stock
price revaluation for emerging markets around liberalization dates. Our experiments are consistent with
such findings at the time of integration as the risk-free rate of emerging markets falls together with the risk
premium.
   30
      The net foreign asset position of these countries worsen until 1999 to reach -25% of their GDP. Starting in
the 2000s, their net foreign asset over GDP improves progressively, reaching -6% of GDP in 2015. This pattern
is, in magnitude and in terms of timing, within the range of the predictions of our baseline experiments.
   31
      Quantitatively, the fall in the risk-free rate over twenty years following integration is about 2% in our
experiments—about 40% of the fall observed in the data.


                                                       18
returns to risky capital, the model unambiguously predicts a progressive fall in the return
to capital in the emerging country. While time-series data on aggregate returns to capital
in emerging countries are not directly available, evidence in Ohanian et al. (2018) for Asia
and Latin America, indicates that, if anything, returns to capital have been falling in those
regions since the 1980s in line with our experiments. For the developed country, the effect
of the risk-free rate dominates in our calibrations and the return to capital also falls in the
transition. Thus our model does not account for the stable return observed over the period
in developed countries (see estimates using national accounts in Gomme et al. (2011) for the
U.S. and Ohanian et al. (2018) for developed countries). It remains a challenge to separate
enough the evolution of the return to capital from the one of the risk-free rate.32


4      Welfare analysis
If riskier countries are also capital scarce at opening, the effect on output is ambiguous,
depending on two conflicting forces, the standard efficiency gains and the reallocation of
precautionary savings towards the safer country. Our findings thus qualify the conventional
wisdom that risky and capital scarce emerging countries should face large gains from finan-
cial integration. In this section, we present quantitative estimates of the welfare gains of
integration.
Definition of welfare gains. We express welfare gains in terms of equivalent increase in
permanent consumption compared to autarky. For a given asset market structure (A for
autarky or F I for financial integration), define the permanent certainty equivalent level of
                                                                             j                   j
consumption ci j in country i = {D, E} in regime j = {A; F I} such that: Ui,0  (ci j ) = E0 (Ui,0  ),
          j                                                                                    j
where Ui,0 is the utility defined recursively in Equation (4) in regime j = {A; F I} and ci the
constant consumption providing the same expected utility. The welfare gains from financial
                                                                                     FI     A

                                                                                              ×100.

4.1     Welfare analysis with constant relative risk aversion
We start by quantifying the welfare gains in our baseline case with low risk aversion.
Results. Table 3 (upper panel) provides a summary of the findings with CRRA utility
(Baseline Low Risk aversion). The Baseline corresponds to Experiment 2, where country E
is riskier and capital scarce initially. The ‘nocapital scarcity’ case corresponds to a case where
the emerging country starts with the same level of capital as the developed country (only
risk asymmetry). Keeping all other parameters identical, we also provide results for a case
with symmetric (developed) countries (symmetric risk σD = σE = 2.5% and identical initial
autarky steady-state capital stock, line 3 of Table 3), for endowment economies (infinite
capital adjustment costs ξ → ∞, line 4 of Table 3) and for the riskless world model (σD =
σE = 0, line 5 of Table 3). In the latter case, E starts off being capital-scarce (kE,0 is 50%
of the initial (steady-state) capital stock of D). Thus, it has to be compared to the capital
scarce experiment with aggregate risk (Baseline, line 1 of Table 3).
  32
    In our baseline experiments, the risk premium remains low compared to the data. The version of the
model with long-run risk does better in levels but the change in the return to capital over time remains
largely dominated by the change in the risk-free rate.

                           Table 3: Welfare gains of financial integration.

Notes: Gains expressed in % equivalent increase of permanent consumption. Parameters of the
model are shown in Table 1 (low risk aversion with γ = 4 and high risk aversion with γ = 40).
For the benchmark and ‘no capital scarcity’ cases, σE = 2σD = 5%. For the ‘symmetric’ case:
σD = σE = 2.5% and both countries start at their autarky steady state capital stock. In the
riskless world and in the benchmark cases, country E is capital scarce (50% of the developed
country capital stock) at date 0. In the endowment case, both countries have the same initial size
and adjustment costs to capital are infinite.


    First and foremost, in our stochastic model with production, gains from financial integra-
tion are remarkably small for each country: at most half-a-percent of permanent consumption
despite the presence of both types of gains, efficiency gains and gains from better risk-sharing.
Indeed, gains from efficient reallocation of capital and gains from risk-sharing are roughly
speaking substitutes, which makes it unlikely to observe large gains from financial integration
for any country. The intuition goes as follows: the riskier country benefits the most from
better consumption smoothing, but self-insurance requires capital to reallocate away from
that country. This goes against what standard neoclassical efficiency gains would require as
the riskier country is also capital scarce. Reciprocally, as the country is initially very capital
scarce in our baseline, by importing capital initially for efficiency reasons, the risky country
cannot self-insure optimally, reducing its gains from risk-sharing along the transition.
    The risky country has to pay a price for better insurance, which benefits the safer one—
in the form of higher consumption for a while following integration. The emerging country
benefits more from the efficient reallocation of capital but this entails welfare costs as it has
to bear more risk along the transition to build up its capital stock. Thus, perhaps counter-
intuitively, gains from better risk sharing are relatively equally shared, even though the
safer country ends up with an almost unchanged consumption volatility under integration
(see Appendix A.1 for business cycles moments).33 In a world with symmetric (but low)
  33
     Two conflicting forces under integration are at play to determine the steady-state volatility of consump-
tion of D: D can smooth better transitory shocks through the bond market but D is also holding more
risk on average (leveraged position). The former effect dominates slightly in our calibration with a low risk


                                                     20
risk, welfare gains are even smaller: this is not a surprise since similar countries have less
incentives to reallocate capital and risk—lowering the ‘gains from trade’.
Comparison with alternative models. The gains from integration are significantly higher
for endowment economies, even if there are no efficiency gains due to the capital realloca-
tion.34 With endogenous production, gains from risk-sharing are significantly smaller for
both countries because capital can be used in the autarky regime to smooth stochastic
shocks.
    Our findings call for another important comment when comparing to Gourinchas and
Jeanne (2006). In their small open economy set-up, capital reallocation is not slowed down
by a raise in the world interest rate. In partial equilibrium, welfare gains of the capital scarce
economy amount to a 1.30% increase of permanent consumption while in general equilibrium
(in Exp.1), the emerging country gains 0.37% of consumption and the rest of the world 0.29%
only. Not taking into account adverse changes of interest rates leads to an overestimation of
the neoclassical gains of financial integration even without risk.
Timing of the welfare gains. Countries can extract most of the welfare benefits in the
earlier periods (and then pay in later periods), or conversely, suffer in the earlier periods for
larger gains in the far future. Abstracting from capital scarcity, gains are front loaded by the
safer country which initially enjoys a consumption boom. Gains in the medium-run (first
two decades following integration) are thus potentially much larger than the overall gains.
Far in the future, country D faces more volatile consumption due to its leveraged position
and cuts its consumption to pay back the initial debt. The opposite holds for the riskier
country which significantly cuts consumption in the medium-run for better self-insurance far
in the future. Holding risk constant across countries, welfare gains are front loaded by capital
scarce economies. Therefore, two forces are at play: on one side, the capital scarcity effect
generates medium-run consumption gains (resp. losses) for country E (resp. country D). On
the other side, the reallocation of precautionary savings towards the safer country generates
medium-run gains (resp. losses) for country D (resp. country E). In our simulations, we
find that on average both effects tend to offset each other and both countries have fairly
small consumption gains in the first twenty years following integration.

4.2     Welfare analysis with non-expected utility
We now compute welfare gains with recursive utility, cranking up the degree of risk aversion
to generate higher risk premia. Other parameters are kept to their baseline values (Table
1). Welfare gains in our baseline financial integration experiment with a high risk aversion
(γ = 40) are shown in Table 3 (bottom panel). To isolate the effect driven by the price of
risk, Figure 4 shows the welfare gains as a function of the degree of risk aversion γ when
                                                                                     kE,0
countries are asymmetric in terms of risk but start with the same level of capital ( kD,0 = 1).
Aggregate welfare gains. First, overall welfare gains from integration (i.e the average
of the gains across countries) are increasing in the degree of risk aversion. International
risk sharing is more valued with higher risk aversion. However, despite a higher market
aversion, while the latter effect dominates with a high risk aversion.
  34
     This experiment corresponds to the ones run in the international risk-sharing literature (see van Wincoop
(1999) and Lewis (1999) among others for references).



                                                     21
price of risk, the welfare gains remain small, with an average across countries barely above
0.5%. As in the CRRA case, they are also remarkably lower in production economies than
in endowment economies—despite gains from more efficient capital reallocation.

risk aversion γ . Countries starts off with the same capital stock (no capital scarcity) kD,0 = 1. In-
dividuals have Epstein-Zin preferences with an elasticity of intertemporal substitution 1/ψ = 0.25
and a risk aversion γ ≥ 4. Other parameters of the model are kept identical to the ones in Table 1.

Distribution of welfare gains. Welfare gains are remarkably low for the risky country
for any level of risk aversion (always below 0.5%). They are unevenly shared between the
safe and the risky country: the higher the degree of risk aversion, the more the safe country
benefits from financial integration compared to the risky country (see Figure 4 in the absence
of capital scarcity in E). With γ = 40, welfare gains in the safe country are getting close to
1% of permanent consumption (versus 0.39% in the experiment with γ = 4). The emerging
risky country has actually lower gains when γ = 40 (only 0.32% of permanent consumption
compared to 0.52% with γ = 4). The intuition for this result goes as follows: the safe
country has the technology that both countries prefer, i.e. a less risky production function.
Comparative advantage logic predicts that the safe country benefits more from trading. The
higher the risk aversion the more agents value the safest technology, increasing thereby the
terms of trade of the safe country. The risky country benefits more from risk sharing when
more risk averse but the costs of reallocating risk are also much higher: insurance is more
expensive and the world interest rate is much lower upon integration (see Figure 3).

4.3     Sensitivity and Accuracy
The role of capital scarcity. We investigate how the overall welfare gains from integration
depend on the initial relative endowment in capital. Figure 5 shows the welfare benefits (solid

lines) in our baseline with low risk aversion (upper panel) and with high risk aversion (lower
                                                              kE,0
panel) as a function of the relative initial capital stocks ( kD,0 ).
    With CRRA utility (upper panel), the curves exhibit a clear U-shape since large ex-ante
differences in capital stocks increase benefits from efficient capital reallocation. For most
values of relative capital stock, the safer country benefits more from integration but the
difference is small quantitatively for low risk aversion. With a high risk aversion (lower panel),
the safer country extracts a much larger share of the benefits. The risky country benefits less
from integration when risk aversion is high, even if capital scarce, since the dominant force
driving the capital allocation across countries is the reallocation of precautionary savings.
For the safer country, welfare gains are larger but the shape of the curve is also modified.
The minimum is shifted to the left and the slope is now steeper: when the safe country
starts with an initially low level of capital, the gains from integration are larger. The
reallocation of precautionary savings and the reallocation of capital for efficiency reasons
are complementing each other. They both imply capital flow towards the safe country. With
a higher risk aversion, the larger reallocation of precautionary savings away from the risky
country accelerates the convergence of the safe country when capital scarce, boosting its
gains from integration.
Global methods vs. perturbations. Figure 5 also shows the welfare gains estimated
using a standard second-order perturbation method around the deterministic steady-state
(dotted lines). The perturbation method gives results similar to our global method when
none of the country is significantly capital scarce and when the degree of risk aversion is low.
For these parameter values, the model does not drift too far away from the approximation
point and curvature in the utility is small enough to guarantee a minimal effect of non-
linearities.35 Perturbation methods are however very inaccurate when risk aversion is set to
a high value and/or one country is significantly capital scarce.




  35
     When countries start with similar level of capital (or slightly higher in the emerging country), welfare
gains are underestimated for the safe country using the perturbation method, even with low risk aversion.
The perturbation methods does not capture well that the minimum level of gains for the safe country is
shifted to the left (compared to the deterministic case) due to the reallocation of precautionary savings.
When one country is very capital scarce and/or precautionary savings matter more (high risk aversion), the
perturbation methods provides inaccurate estimates of the welfare gains. This is the combination of two
effects: non-linearities are more important with significant capital scarcity or high curvature in the utility
function and the risky steady-state is further away from the deterministic one.

5      Robustness Checks and Extensions
We perform a wide range of robustness checks regarding the stochastic process governing
the shocks, the financial asset market structure (assuming complete markets) and the size
of countries. In particular, we provide an extension of our model with a world long-run
risk component to generate a significant market price of risk without extreme values for
the risk aversion. Our main findings still hold: financial integration does not bring sizable
welfare gains, in particular for riskier emerging economies where benefits do not exceed 1%
of permanent consumption for realistic parameter values. Only a small, capital scarce and
very safe country can extract significant welfare gains when integrating to riskier countries.



                                                                                      24
5.1      Alternative specifications of transitory risk
We investigate the robustness of our findings with respect to the stochastic structure in the
baseline model of Section 2. We compute the welfare gains for different levels of volatility in
the risky country σE and different correlation ζ of productivity shocks across countries.
Data. In our sample of emerging countries integrating to the world economy, the volatility
of output ranges from 2.1% (Spain) to 8.7% (Jordan). The correlation of output growth
between emerging countries and the sample of developed countries (already integrated) varies
across regions, ranging from close to zero in Asia and Middle-East to 0.6 for Southern Europe
countries.36 The average (GDP-weighted) correlation across all liberalizing emerging markets
is equal to 0.20 (see Appendix B).

  Table 4: Welfare gains from financial integration with alternative stochastic structures.

Notes: Welfare gains from financial integration are expressed in % equivalent of permanent con-
sumption. Apart from σE and ζ, parameters of the model are set to their baseline values in Table
1 with risk aversion equal to its low value (γ = 4). In the ‘No capital scarcity’ experiment, both
countries start with the same level of capital corresponding to the autarkic steady-state in D.

Results. In the following simulations, all parameters but the volatility σE and correlation ζ
are kept to their baseline values (see Table 1) in the low risk aversion case (Experiment 2).
We also provide results when both countries start at the same level of capital (‘No capital
scarcity’, right panel) to isolate better the role of risk sharing. Welfare gains from integration
with alternative stochastic structures of transitory shocks are displayed in Table 4.
    Higher correlation of shocks ζ reduces the gains from integration, limiting the ability of
countries to share risks internationally. Abstracting from capital scarcity, gains fall quickly
with the level of correlation. For a correlation ζ of 0.25 and a volatility σE of 5%, very close to
the empirical average across liberalizing emerging markets, gains from financial integration
amounts to 0.32% in D and 0.45% in E in our baseline experiment. Larger asymmetry
in aggregate risk across countries increases the welfare gains for both countries but the safe
country benefits more—similarly to our calibration with a higher market price of risk through
higher risk aversion.37 As country E gets riskier, its precautionary demand for safe assets at
opening increases, which benefits the safe country more.
  36
     Abstracting from Southern Europe, the correlation of output growth of a given region of emerging
markets with developed countries is always between 0 and 0.35.
  37
     Higher risk asymmetry increases welfare gains for both countries in the absence of capital scarcity (right
panel of Table 4). With E capital scarce (left panel), results are ambiguous at higher level of correlation ζ

5.2     Extension with long-run world productivity risk
Our production economies feature low risk premia, unless one assumes extreme values for
the risk aversion. Another unpleasant prediction of the model is very high net foreign asset
positions in the long-run risky steady-state, which is reached after a long transition of at
least a century. To remedy these limitations, we add persistent shocks to world productivity
growth, following the long-run risk literature (Bansal and Yaron (2004)).
Set-up with a long-run world productivity risk. We specify a common world com-
ponent instead of country-specific long-run risks, for technical reasons—otherwise countries
dynamics would not be stationary in an incomplete markets model, but this choice is also
motivated by empirical evidence. Country-specific long-run risks are found very highly cor-
related across countries using asset prices data (Lewis and Liu (2015)) or consumption data
(Colacito and Croce (2011), Nakamura et al. (2014)).38 Our framework is thus broadly in line
with previous empirical findings, which point towards a fairly low cross-country correlation
of transitory risk and a very high correlation of persistent risk.
    The stochastic total factor productivity Ai,t in country i can be decomposed into a tran-
sitory country-specific component ai,t and a persistent world component aW,t , such that:
Ai,t = aW,t ai,t , where log(ai,t ) follows an AR(1) process as defined in Section 2.1—with our
baseline calibration of transitory shocks (Table 1). The long-run component aW,t is such that
                                                                  a                   aW,t
the world is hit by persistent world TFP growth shocks: log( W,t+1  aW,t
                                                                         ) = ρW log( aW,t−1 ) + W,t ,
with W,t an i.i.d process normally distributed with volatility σW —W,t is assumed to be
uncorrelated with transitory shocks. In our baseline with long-run risk (LRR), we use
the following values for the persistence ρW and volatility parameter σW : ρW = 0.999 and
σW = 8% · σD = 4% · σE = 0.002—a calibration close to Colacito and Croce (2011, 2013)
or Lewis and Liu (2015).39 For long-run risks to matter for asset prices, the elasticity of
intertemporal substitution 1/ψ is assumed above unity, equal to 2. With persistent risk, our
model does not require a high risk aversion to generate significant risk premia and we set γ
to 10, as in Lewis and Liu (2015).
Results. We describe the risky-steady state under autarky and financial integration in
our economies with a world long-run risk in Table A.2 in Appendix A.1. Our version with
long-run risk generates significantly higher risk premia (together with a reasonably low risk-
free rate): the risk premium under integration is 1.98% (resp. 2.22%) in the developed
country (resp. emerging country).40 The introduction of long-run risk also modifies the long-
(e.g. third column for ζ = 0.5): in this case, the direction of capital flows due to capital scarcity implies less
efficient risk sharing along the transition—the riskier country, attracting capital, is less able to self-insure
along the transition. Consumption smoothing is even more limited if shocks are more correlated. The
combination of high correlation and capital scarcity can generate lower gains despite higher risk asymmetry.
   38
      Nakamura et al. (2014) find that world (highly persistent) growth rate shocks are crucial to match
cross-country consumption data over a long-time period. They disentangle country-specific and world growth
shocks and find the latter to be twice as persistent and thus more crucial for asset pricing.
   39
      In those papers, the ratio of volatility between long run and short run shocks is small, between 4% and
10% depending on the calibration. Our calibration assumes a slightly more persistent risk since countries
they consider— US/UK/Canada—are among the ones with the lowest variability of consumption of our
sample. To reduce the state-space, persistent shocks to world productivity growth are approximated by a
three-states Markov chain with the same persistence and volatility. See details in Appendix C.
   40
      See Appendix A.1. Our baseline LRR calibration still falls short of observed risk premia compared to
the LRR literature as our model features production economies.

 Figure 6: Dynamics along the risky path in presence of long-run world productivity risk.
Notes: Preferences are such that 1/ψ = 2 and γ = 10—other parameters, including the calibration
for transitory risk, are identical to the baseline calibration in Table 1. Persistence (resp. volatility)
of long-run world productivity risk ρW (resp. σW ) is set to 0.999 (resp. 0.002). Country D starts
at its autarky steady-state. Country E starts with a capital stock equal to 50% of the one in D.


term distribution of wealth: the safe country still ends up as a debtor but the net foreign
asset position is an order of magnitude smaller (-38% in the risky-steady state compared to
multiple of GDPs, see Table 2).41 The safe country is willing to borrow from the riskier one
but any leveraged position implies a higher exposure to the (non-diversifiable) world-long
run risk. Hence, countries choose a smaller net foreign asset positions. For the same reasons,
countries are less willing to borrow and lend to smooth transitory shocks, also implying a
more compressed distribution of net foreign assets (see Figure A.1 in Appendix A.1). Thus,
our extension with a world persistent risk generates more realistic asset prices together with
more realistic net foreign asset positions.
    The dynamics of the main aggregate variables following integration are qualitatively
unchanged (Figure 6) but the lower magnitude of capital flows reduces significantly the
impact of financial integration (compared to autarky)—limiting in particular its growth
impact. Regarding welfare, the same logic applies: as the reallocation of transitory risk in
the long-run and the ability to smooth transitory shocks are both limited by the presence of
a world long-run risk, welfare gains are very small, significantly smaller than in our baseline
calibrations with transitory shocks only. For both countries, the gains are below a 0.1%
increase in permanent consumption in our baseline LRR calibration (see Appendix A.2).
  41
     This lower level of net foreign assets is due to the presence of long-run risk and not to alternative values
for the preference parameters—our economy with identical preferences but no LRR behave similarly as in
the previous simulations.

5.3     The role of financial markets structure
In our baseline incomplete markets model, international risk-sharing is limited due to the
absence of state-contingent claims. We go to the extreme case of complete financial markets
as a robustness check, providing a useful upper-bound of the gains from financial integration.
Solution under complete markets. To solve the model under complete markets, we
assume that the world economy consists of only one fictitious agent whose preferences are
identical to those of each country. This agent invests optimally in both countries, maximizing
its intertemporal utility subject to the law of capital accumulation (Equation (2)) and the
resource constraints (Equation (11)). Let us denote cCM   t    her consumption. With complete
markets and symmetric preferences, each country i is consuming a constant fraction λi of
the world consumption at all dates, with λD + λE = 1: cCM              CM
                                                             i,t = λi ct
    These fractions are allocated according to initial wealth at time of integration, which
depends on initial state variables, the capital stock and the productivity level. The wealth
Wi,t of country i, a claim on total output net of investment, is defined by the recursive
equation: Wi,t = (yi,t − ii,t ) + Et {Mt+1 Wi,t+1 }, with Mt+1 the stochastic discount factor
common to both countries under complete markets (defined in Equation (5)), which is also
the stochastic discount factor of the fictitious representative agent. The initial consumption
                                                                      Wi,0
share λi in country i at date of integration (t = 0) is equal to WD,0 +W   E,0
                                                                               .
                       CM
    We denote by c         the welfare of the representative (fictitious) agent in terms of per-
manent consumption equivalent under complete markets. The homogeneity of preferences
                                                                 CM   A
implies: ci CM = λi cCM . The welfare increase in % is then ci ci A−ci × 100 for country i.
Welfare analysis under complete markets. Figure 7 shows the welfare benefits from
financial integration under complete markets (solid line) as a function of the relative initial
                 kE,0
capital stocks ( kD,0 ) in our baseline calibration. Welfare gains are compared to our baseline
model with incomplete markets (dotted line). With low risk aversion (top panel), wel-
fare gains under complete markets are significantly higher than under incomplete markets,
roughly doubling in magnitude. They do remain small, about 1% of permanent consump-
tion. With high risk aversion (bottom panel), welfare benefits of completing the markets are
significantly higher. Depending on the level of initial capital stock and on the country, gains
are roughly three to five times larger than in the model with incomplete markets. In this
case, completing the markets has a significant welfare impact since agents are extremely risk
averse to consumption fluctuations.42 When countries start off with similar initial capital
stock, gains amount to 3.26% of permanent consumption in the safe country and 2.43% in
the risky one—resp. 3.35% and 2.73% when E is significantly capital scarce. This is arguably
a loose upper bound of the welfare gains that can be achieved—risk aversion being very high
and financial markets complete. The magnitude of the gains has changed but our results go
through qualitatively regarding the shape of the curves and the distribution of gains across
countries. They are still unevenly distributed across countries for high risk aversion, but less
so compared to the incomplete markets model. With incomplete markets, the safer asset
issued by country D is more valuable since country E is less able to smooth consumption.
  42
    This result might come as a surprise as bond-only integration is known to deliver similar outcomes to
complete markets unless shocks are almost permanent (Baxter and Crucini (1995), Kollmann (1996)). In our
framework, business cycle implications around the steady-state are also similar (Appendix A.1) but welfare
benefits are quite different due to low frequency changes in the consumption profiles upon integration.

identical to the ones shown in Table 1.

5.4     The role of country size
Welfare gains with small countries. Our experiments rely on countries of equal sizes,
focusing on the integration of a set of potentially large emerging countries. It is a reasonable
baseline to understand the recent liberalizing wave where large emerging markets, account-
ing for almost 50% of world GDP, integrated financially at similar dates. However, some
smaller emerging countries did integrate at earlier (resp. later) dates.43 From a theoretical
  43
    In our sample, Spain, Portugal and Greece integrated financially in the mid-eighties, before the main
wave of liberalization in Latin America and Asia. Oman and Saudi Arabia integrated financially in the late
nineties.

    Smaller countries have little impact on the world interest rate and are less negatively
affected by adverse movements in the interest rate, both at opening and when hit by a
                                                                                          AE,0
shock. We explore the case of a smaller country E and set the relative productivity AD,0
                                                                                                                                                             A
such that the average output of country E is 10% of the one in country D ( AD,0 E,0
                                                                                    = (0.1)1−θ ).
All other parameters are kept identical to our baseline experiment (Table 1). Welfare gains
from integration are shown in Figure 8 for the risky country of small size for different values
of the relative initial capital stocks per efficiency unit. The results in the baseline case of
symmetric initial size/productivity (dotted line) are shown for comparison purposes.44
    Not surprisingly, market size matters for the distribution of the gains and country E
benefits more from financial integration if smaller—the converse holds for the large country
D. Interest rates move more favorably for country E following financial integration: E is
now lending at higher rates, very close to the autarky interest rate of country D. Similarly,
when country E is willing to lend more following a productivity shock, interest rates do not
fall and the country can smooth consumption at a better price. The overall welfare gains
(average across countries weighted by size) remain small. They do not exceed a 1.5% increase
of permanent consumption for realistic degrees of capital scarcity.
  44
     For such a large size difference, welfare gains are negligible in D. Results in the deterministic case are
quantitatively very close to the small open economy experiment performed in Gourinchas and Jeanne (2006).

6      Conclusion
Intuitions about the gains from financial integration are implicitly based on the stochastic
neoclassical growth model. But those gains have never been quantitatively evaluated.45
We use a general equilibrium model featuring aggregate risk, potentially asymmetric across
countries, and endogenous capital accumulation. We show that welfare gains from integration
remain small, at most a couple percentage points in the favourable cases where risk premia
are high.
    A key finding is that riskier countries while benefiting from risk sharing will also reallo-
cate precautionary savings towards the safer countries. This has two important implications.
First, it qualifies the conventional wisdom that riskier countries should have large gains from
financial integration. In reality, safer (developed) country benefit more from their integration
with riskier (emerging) countries; they sell insurance at a high price, even more so if risk aver-
sion and risk premia are high. Second, the standard predictions linking financial integration
and growth are altered: financial integration has heterogeneous effects on growth depending
on the degree of capital scarcity, the level of risk and the size of countries. It potentially re-
duces growth in emerging markets compared to autarky if their level of aggregate risk is high
compared to developed countries (or if the market price of risk is high). If emerging markets
are sufficiently capital scarce at opening, integration accelerates growth in the short-run but
slows it down at longer horizons. These heterogeneous responses across countries and across
time following financial integration can partially explain why the empirical literature has
had difficulties to find robust results. Finally, we focus on previous liberalization episodes
where a group of large emerging countries integrated over a short time period. We emphasize
how general equilibrium effects significantly reduce the gains compared to the case where
only one small country is integrating. This also challenges the way growth benefits of inte-
gration have been identified empirically as the literature implicitly assumes that the growth
impact of integration is independent across countries. From a theoretical perspective, this
has the flavour of a pecuniary externality. Individually, benefits of integration can outweigh
significantly the costs but correlated behaviour where all emerging countries simultaneously
integrate reduces significantly the gains due to adverse price movements. A full-fledged the-
ory of endogenous financial integration with multiple countries is beyond the scope of the
paper and left for future work.

A.3     Extension with alternative dividend policies
In our baseline, investment is financed out of earnings—dividends being equal to the frac-
tion of output distributed to capital holders net of investment spending. Due to the mere
presence of investment, dividends are not risky enough as they do not co-vary enough with
output and consumption—a standard difficulty of production economies. This leads to a low
equity premium, equal in our baseline with fully equity financed firm to the risk premium on
risky capital (displayed in Table A.1). If one stays in an environment where the Modigliani-
Miller theorem holds, as we do, the dividend policy is irrelevant for the dynamics of aggregate
consumption and capital, as well as for the aggregate return to capital. However, alterna-
tive dividend policies, implying some leverage and riskier dividends, might help generating a
higher equity premium—keeping the aggregate dynamics unchanged (Jermann (1998)). This
section aims at exploring the implications for the equity premium of our framework with pro-
duction economies, considering alternative dividend policies and firms financing strategies.
For simplicity, we do so by adopting exogenous policies for levered dividends—separating
dividends from the aggregate income stream paid to capital holders.46
Dividend policies. First, rewrite the dividend policy without leverage in our baseline, d0i,t ,
as follows:
                d0i,t = θyi,t − ii,t = θyi,t − κi − (ii,t − κi ) = d1i,t (κi ) − (ii,t − κi )
  46
    See Bansal and Yaron (2004) in endowment economies for a similar approach to separate dividends and
consumption.

Notes: Gains are expressed in equivalent of permanent consumption as a function of initial relative

capital stock ( kE,0 ). Solid lines correspond to our baseline calibrations without long-run risk (High
                 D,0
and Low Risk Aversion). Parameters of the model are shown in Table 1. Dashed lines correspond
to our calibration with a world long-run risk, with EIS 1/ψ = 2 and risk aversion γ = 10. Under
the long-run risk calibrations, parameters of the model except EIS (1/ψ) and risk aversion (γ) are

with κi a (country-specific) constant, κi < mint {θyi,t } and d1i,t (κi ) = θyi,t − κi > 0.
In our alternative dividend policies, we consider the following levered dividends in country
i,
                                     d1i,t (κi ) = θyi,t − κi .                             (A.1)
This dividend policy corresponds to firms distributing the capital share to shareholders net
of some fixed debt payments. Possible values of κi are chosen such that the representative
firm is leveraged—rising κi corresponds to a higher leverage. Intuitively, this policy implies
riskier dividends than our baseline since investment above κi is financed through debt.
Leverage. Call Vi,t the value of the representative firm at date t in country i. Importantly,
in the environment we consider, the value of the firm is independent of the dividend policy
and equal to the value of a firm distributing dividend d0i,t , denoted Si,t
                                                                        0             1
                                                                            . Denote Si,t (κi ), the
                              1
stock market value, and Li,t (κi ), the corporate debt value, of a firm with a dividend policy
d1i,t (κi ). The aggregate value of the firm satisfies:
                                                             0      1
                                                     Vi,t = Si,t = Si,t (κi ) + L1i,t (κi ).


                                                                      39
Thus, valuing the stream of dividends with the appropriate stochastic discount factor, also
independent of the dividend policy, one can compute the aggregate value of corporate debt,

                                         L1i,t (κ1 ) = Vi,t − Si,t
                                                               1
                                                                   (κi ),

                                                                                                   L1 (κi )
and corporate leverage (at market value) is defined as debt value over firm value, i,tVi,t .
    In other words, once the model is solved in our baseline with fully equity-financed firm,
one can easily compute stock prices and corporate debt for any alternative dividend policy.
This can be done under autarky as well as under financial integration.
Results. Considering the dividend policy described by Eq. A.1, we compute for each
country the (average) leverage and equity premium by simulating the model for different
values of κi . This is done in autarky and under integration under the baseline calibration
with low and high risk aversion (see Table 1). Values of κi are chosen such that the firm in
country i issues a positive quantity of debt on average while having strictly positive dividends
in all states. In practice, we focus on values of κi such that leverage (debt to asset ratio,
L1i,t (κi )
   Vi,t
          varies between 0 and 70%.47 In the data, recent evidence in Graham et al. (2015)
            )
shows that the market value of leverage of U.S firms oscillated between 25% and 40% since
1970.48
     Results are displayed in Figure A.3, which represents the equity premium as a function of
(average) leverage. Such a (levered) dividend policy generates a significantly higher equity
premium than our baseline. This so because dividends are riskier when investment (above
κi ) is financed out of debt, even when the firm has a very small leverage on average. The
effect on the equity premium is amplified with higher values of leverage (e.g. higher values
for κi ). Compared to the baseline with equity-financed firms, the equity premium is an
order of magnitude larger—about 4 to 5 times larger than in our baseline for a leverage
around 30-40%. With a very high risk aversion (bottom panel), one can generate an equity
premium comparable to the data, above 4% in the developed country, and even higher in
the (riskier) emerging country. However, beyond the extreme degree of risk aversion, this is
at the expense a counterfactual leverage, above 60%, and a dividend volatility that exceeds
the data.
Sensitivity analysis. For sensitivity analysis, we also consider the more general family of
dividend policies, dνi,t (κi )

                  dνi,t (κi ) = νd1i,t (κi ) + (1 − ν) d0i,t = ν (θyi,t − κi ) + (1 − ν) d0i,t ,        (A.2)

where 0 ≤ v ≤ 1. By construction, d0i,t (κi ) = d0i,t , d1i,t (κi ) = θyi,t − κi and dνi,t (κi ) =
θyi,t − νκi − (1 − ν) ii,t . Firms pay fixed debt payments νκi and finance a fraction (1 − ν) of
investment out of earnings—in between a fully-equity financed firm and the levered dividends
of Eq. A.1.
    In our simulations, we set κi such that the leverage varies in between 0 and 70% for the
   47
     Note that the set of κ considered differ across countries since they have different steady-state output
and investment rates due to their heterogeneity. κ is set below 0.39 for the developed country and below
0.36 for the emerging country.
  48
     The book value is slightly above, oscillating between 35% and 50% over the same period. Similarly,
Jermann (1998) documents market values of leverage for the U.S between 13% and 44% post-WWII.

Notes: The dividend policy follows Eq. A.1 for different values of κi . The support of κi is set in each
country such that the firm has a positive leverage but below 70%. The leverage and equity premium
are computed by simulating the model under autarky and under integration for different values of
κi . Dotted lines (resp. solid) refer to values under autarky (resp. integration). Models parameters
are summarized in Table 1. The upper (resp. bottom) panels correspond to the calibration with a
low (resp. high) risk aversion, γ = 4 (resp. γ = 40).


different values of ν.49 Then, we explore the dividend policy described by Equation A.2 for
values of ν between 0 and 1. Note that ν = 0 corresponds to our baseline without leverage
  49
    We set: κD = 0.39 and κE = 0.36 for a low risk aversion; κD = 0.38 and κE = 0.34 for a high risk
aversion.

and ν = 1 corresponds to the dividend policy of Eq. A.1.
    Results are displayed in Figure A.4. Relative to the baseline with equity-financed firms,
a higher ν increases the leverage and equity premium. However, similarly to the previous
levered dividends, only with a high risk aversion and very large values of ν, our model
generates a high enough equity premium. In the high risk aversion case (bottom panel), the
equity premium is around 2% in country D (resp. 4% in E) for a leverage about 30-40% —
significantly higher than our baseline but lower than the data.
    Overall, these alternative dividend policies show that, with a realistic degree of leverage,
one gets significantly higher equity premium than in our baseline without leverage. However,
unless assuming parameters which generate a leverage significantly higher than the data,
together with an extremely high risk aversion, it remains difficult to generate a high enough
equity premium, at least for the developed country.

Figure A.4: Leverage and equity premium. Sensitivity with the dividend policy of Eq. A.2.
Notes: The dividend policy follows Eq. A.2 for different values of ν. κD = 0.39 and κE = 0.36 for
a low risk aversion; κD = 0.38 and κE = 0.34 for a high risk aversion. Extreme points on the left
(resp. right) of the curves correspond to the baseline, ν = 0 (resp. dividends of Eq. A.1, ν = 1).
Leverage and equity premium are computed by simulating the model under autarky and under
integration for different values of ν. Dotted lines (resp. solid) refer to values under autarky (resp.
integration). Model parameters are summarized in Table 1. The upper (resp. bottom) panels
correspond to the calibration with a low (resp. high) risk aversion, γ = 4 (resp. γ = 40).

According to other indicators of financial integration, the country can be considered as opened starting 1991
(see Bekaert et al. (2005) for a discussion). We do include China in our sample.

Figure B.1: Volatility of annual real output growth per capita across countries (1975-1995).
Notes: Penn World Tables. Volatility of annual real output growth per capita for each country
is computed over the period 1975-1995. Volatility of each group of countries is a sample average
(arithmetic or GDP-weighted) of the volatility of each country in the group as defined in Section
B.1. GDP weights are based on PPP GDP in 1990.

Volatility of output growth. We compute the volatility of annual real GDP per capita
for each country in the sample over the period 1975-1995 (PPP adjusted). This corresponds
largely to the time period before and around the integration date of the emerging mar-
kets considered. Volatility computed over a longer time frame gives very similar results.
Figure B.1 reports the volatility for each group of countries (arithmetic or GDP-weighted
average across countries belonging to the group). The (arithmetic) averaged volatility of
output growth across liberalizing emerging countries is 4.9% compared to 2.5% in developed
countries, in line with our baseline calibration.51
Correlation of output growth with developed countries. For any given country, we
also compute the correlation of annual real GDP growth per capita in the country with the
group of (already integrated) developed countries over the period 1975-2010.52 We compute
            51
     We display simple arithmetic averages and GDP-weighted (using 1990 PPP GDPs) averages. Both are
very similar quantitatively although the GDP-weighted averages tend to be smaller (except for Asia) since
larger countries tend to be less volatile. Importantly, the ratio of volatilities between developed and emerging
markets is very similar across the two measures.

the arithmetic and the GDP-weighted means in a given group of countries (region or whole
sample of liberalizing countries). Results are shown in Table B.2. Our baseline assume zero
correlation while the correlation is between 0 and 0.25 for all groups but Southern Europe,
which is significantly higher. Thus, If anything, we overestimate slightly the gains from
financial integration in our baseline.

B.3     Capital scarcity
Definitions. Consider a country i with the following production function at date t:

                                        Yi,t = Ai,t (Ki,t )θ (Li,t )1−θ

where Ki,t denotes the capital stock, Ai,t the country TFP and Li,t the labour supply.
   Capital-output ratio ( K ) is then a monotonic transformation of capital per efficiency
                          Y i,t
                Ki,t
units ki,t = 1/(1−θ) :
             Ai,t     Li,t

                                     K              Ki,t              1−θ
                                 (     )i,t = ( 1/(1−θ)       )1−θ = ki,t
                                     Y         Ai,t      Li,t
Thus capital per efficiency units ki,t can easily be recovered from capital-output ratio as
follows:                                         1/(1−θ)
                                            K
                                   ki,t = ( )i,t                                      (B.1)
                                            Y
ki,t is the empirical counterpart of the capital stock in the model of Section 2.
Capital stocks. We compute the stock of capital Ki,t of country i at date t using the
perpetual inventory method with a depreciation rate of δ = 8% per year. The initial value
are very similar when considering the period 1975-1995. The real GDP growth rate of developed country is
weighted sum of the GDP growth rates of each country, where weights correspond to the size of countries.


                                                      46
capital stock at date t0 is defined as:
                                          Investment rate at t0
                                                                ,
                                                 δ + gt0

where gt0 is the average geometric growth rate of investment over the ten years preceding
t0 . The initial period t0 considered depends on data availability for a given country. For
developed countries it is 1960, for emerging markets, we use generally 1970 and at the latest
1980. Results are quite insensitive to the use of a common initial date if anterior to 1980.
     We compute the capital-output ratio ( K ) at date t in country i defined as Ki,t divided
                                            Y i,t
by GDP of that year (all expressed in constant 2005 USD). ki,t is then defined according to
Equation (B.1) with θ = 0.3. The capital-output ratio of the sample of developed countries
(already integrated in 1985) is the GDP-weighted average of capital-output ratios in these
countries. Their capital per efficiency unit kt∗ is defined according to Equation (B.1) with
θ = 0.3.
Capital scarcity at date of financial opening. Consider an emerging country i inte-
grating financially at date ti with the sample of developed country (∗). We measure ‘capital
scarcity’ at opening by the following ratio:
                                                                     ki,ti
                                      ‘capital scarcity’(i, ti ) =
                                                                     kt∗i
    A ratio smaller than 1 indicated that at time of opening, country i has a lower capital
stock per-efficiency unit than developed countries. Note that the use the word scarcity is a
bit of a language abuse since in a stochastic environment as ours, country i can have a higher
capital stock than developed countries and still be below its own autarky steady-state.
    We measure the average capital scarcity at time of opening of a considered group of
countries by computing the arithmetic average of ki,ti /kt∗0 across countries i belonging to
the group (region or set of emerging liberalizing countries).53 Figure B.2 reports the degree
of capital scarcity at time of opening for each group of countries. At time of opening,
liberalizing emerging countries have on average a capital stock very close to 50% of the one
of developed countries, in line with our baseline calibration. There is some heterogeneity
though with Southern Europe being much more capital abundant at opening than Asia or
Middle-Eastern countries.

      GDP-weighted (using GDPs in 1990) averages gives very similar results quantitatively.

Notes: Penn World Tables. Capital scarcity of a given region at time of opening is the average
(arithmetic or GDP-weighted) across countries i in the region of ki,ti /kt∗i . ki,ti (resp. kt∗i ) denotes
the capital per efficiency units in country i (resp. the set of developed countries) at time of opening.
The sample of countries is described in Section B.1. GDP weights for the average scarcity across
countries in a group are based on 1990 GDPs.

Model description. The model’s equations are reformulated as follows (see Section 2.2):

                   Et [f (mt , st , xt , mt+1 , st+1 , xt+1 )] ⊥ x ≤ xt ≤ x                         (C.1)
                                                         st+1 = g(mt , st , xt , mt+1 )             (C.2)

where mt is a vector of exogenous Markov processes, st the vector of endogenous states and xt
the vector of controls to be determined, constrained to lie within [x, x]. The solution satisfies
at all dates xt = ϕ(mt , st ) where ϕ is the unknown decision rule to solve for. The algorithm
described in the next paragraphs, and our implementation in Python, is independent from
the precise formulation of the model. Model is described in a text file, using the conventions
set by the Dolo software, freely available online.54 Section 2.2 shows how to cast the baseline
model into functions f and g. The reference set of equations for the other model variables
(autarky, complete markets, endowments, long-run risk) are included in the companion code
and its online documentation.55
Removing occasionally binding constraints. Mixed complementarity problem (Eq.
C.1) could be solved using a specialized nonlinear complementarity solver.56 We choose
instead to follow the simple approach of reformulating the slackness conditions as smooth
functions and solve the resulting system using a regular nonlinear solver. Recall that v ⊥ a ≤
x ≤ b is by definition equivalent to | min(x  √− a, v)| + | min(b − x, −v)| = 0. Using the Fischer-
Burmeister function ϕB (a, b) = a + b − a2 + b2 , one can check that the complementarity
condition is equivalent to ϕB (b − x, −ϕB (x − a, v)) = 0 which is a smooth function of f .
Consequently, in the following sections, it is assumed, without loss of generality, that f and
g are differentiable functions which incorporate occasionally binding constraints.
Discretizing the exogenous process. We discretize the joint AR(1) process of the pro-
ductivity shocks as a finite Markov chain. For this purpose, we perform a Cholesky decom-
position of the random innovations D,t , E,t . This gives us a lower tridiagonal matrix Ω and
two independent i.i.d. Gaussian noises (0D,t , 0E,t ) whose joint process is defined by a diagonal
covariance matrix Σd such that Σd = ΩΩ0 . Let us define:

                                  log(A0D,t )
                                                                 
                                                         log(AD,t )
                                                 =Ω
                                  log(A0E,t )            log(AE,t )
Since the autocorrelation coefficient for log(AD,t ) and log(AE,t ) is ρ, the processes log(A0D,t )
and log(A0E,t ) are two independent unidimensional AR(1) processes with autocorrelation ρ
and conditional variance given by the diagonal elements of Σd . Each of them is discretized as
a three states Markov chain, using the method from Rouwenhorst (1995). Free coefficients are
chosen so that the resulting Markov chain has the exact same autocorrelation and asymptotic
variance as the original continuous process. The discretized process is a series of Nm = 9

the conditional probability of reaching state j from state i.
Discretizing the endogenous state-space. First, we choose boundaries for the domain
containing the continuous states kD , kE and d. Capital interval must be large enough to
contain simulations which start with significant capital scarcity, while capturing precau-
tionary capital accumulation, under autarky or integration. We set the same bounds for
both countries [kmin , kmax ] = [1, 10].57 Consistent with the borrowing constraints we restrict
−b̄ ≤ d ≤ b̄ where b̄ denotes the exogenous debt limit with numerical value b̄ = 10. To
check that our conclusions are not dependent on a specific b̄ value, robustness checks are
performed with higher/lower debt limits. Using 30 points along each dimension, state-space
is discretized as a list of points S = (sn )n∈[1,Ns ] where each of the Ns = 30 × 30 elements is
a different set of coordinates in the state space.
Decision rules. The numerical solution of the problem for each realization mi of the Markov
chain is a matrix Xi = (xin )n∈[1,Ns ] whose elements are vectors with nx = 8 coordinates. We
also set X = (Xi )i∈[1,Nm ] . For any exogenous value mj and any state s, possibly outside
of the grid, solution ϕ(mj , s) is approximated with an interpolation scheme I such that
ϕ(mj , s) ≈ I(s, Xj ). Given the nature of our welfare comparison exercise, we trade speed for
precision and use natural cubic splines to interpolate the decision rule.58 At each iteration
step, we store the prefiltered coefficients to avoid recomputing them for multiple evaluations
of I(s, Xj ) with the same Xj .
Time iterations. To check optimality conditions, we compute:
                                 X
                                       pij f (mi , sn , xin , mj , sinj , xinj )
                                  j∈[1,Nm ]


                                          sinj = g(mi , sn , xin , mj )
                                              xinj = I(sinj , X̃j )
where (mi , sn ) is a discretized state today and xin the control taken in that state. The
state attained with the exogenous realization mj is denoted by sinj . The decision taken in
tomorrow’s state (mjn , sinj ) is xinj according to the rule X̃j .
    These optimality conditions can be vectorized with respect n. For any i ∈ [1, Nm ] we
define the residual function for exogenous realization mi today at all grid points S
                                       X
                      Φi (Xi , X̃) =        pij f (mi , S, Xi , mj , Sij , Xij )      (C.3)
                                         j∈[1,Nm ]

                                                        Sij = g(mi , S, Xi , mj )                         (C.4)
                                                               Xij = I(Sij , X̃j )                        (C.5)

     For comparison, in our baseline simulation, in country D the steady-state stocks of capital are respectively
2.32, 2.92, and 3.68 respectively, when the productivity shocks stays constant at its lower, medium and high
level. Country E starts with 50% of the steady-state autarky capital stock in D. As a result, in our
simulations, capital always stays within the boundaries.

sponding controls.
   Given a termination criterium η > 0, the time-iteration algorithm works as follows:

   • Choose an initial guess for the controls X0

   • At step k given an initial guess Xk

        – assume future controls are given by the preceding step X̃ = Xk
        – For each i in [1, Nm ]
             ∗ find the zero Xk+1
                              i   of Xi → Φi (Xi , X̃)
        – Define new set of controls Xk+1 = (Xk+1
                                              i   )i∈[1,Nm ]
        – Compute successive approximation errors ηk+1 = Xk+1 − Xk         ∞
                                                                               and ratio λk+1 =
           ηk+1
            ηk
        – If ηk+1 < η , solution has converged. Otherwise, start again with k ← k + 1.

We choose η = 10−7 . As the simulation go, we make sure there is a λ < 1 and a rank K such
that ∀k > K, λk ≤ λ < 1. In the baseline λk converges towards 0.959, which is a necessary
condition for the model to be well defined (see Winant (2017) for details). After the solution
has converged to X, we also check that the final residuals (computed with X = Xk = Xk+1 )
are smaller than  = 10−6 .
