How do differences of opinion affect asset prices? Do investors earn a risk premium when disagreement
arises in the market? Despite their fundamental importance, these questions are among the most controversial
issues in finance. In this paper, we use a novel data set that allows us to directly measure the level
of disagreement among Wall Street mortgage dealers about prepayment speeds. We examine how
disagreement evolves over time and study its effects on expected returns, return volatility, and trading
volume in the mortgage-backed security market. We find that increased disagreement is associated
with higher expected returns, higher return volatility, and larger trading volume. These results imply
that there is a positive risk premium for disagreement in asset prices. We also show that volatility in
and of itself does not lead to higher trading volume. Rather, it is only when disagreement arises in
the market that higher uncertainty is associated with more trading. Finally, we are able to distinguish
empirically between two competing hypotheses regarding how information in markets gets incorporated
into asset prices. We find that sophisticated investors appear to update their beliefs through a rational
expectations mechanism when disagreement arises.

1     Introduction

Understanding how disagreement affects security prices in financial markets is one of the

most important issues in finance. When participants in a market disagree with each other,

an investor who goes out on a limb and takes a position based on his unique information

may face a greater risk of being wrong. Such trading risk or adverse-selection risk differs

fundamentally from the traditional types of market risks that are priced in asset values.

This means that investors who trade when there is disagreement may require additional

compensation for bearing this risk. Despite the fundamental nature of this issue, though,

there still remains significant controversy in the literature about how disagreement risk affects

expected returns and asset prices.

    On one hand, there is an extensive theoretical literature that implies that divergence in

beliefs or opinions should lead to a positive risk premium. For example, Varian (1985, 1989),

Abel (1989), David (2008), and many others argue that the equity premium puzzle may be

explained in terms of a risk premium for heterogeneous beliefs, differences of opinion, or

both. As such, it appears that investors should be compensated for bearing trading risk or

the risk due to adverse selection when disagreement arises.

    On the other hand, Miller (1977) argues that differences of opinion in the market can

lead to lower expected returns (higher prices) when short-sale constraints are present. This

occurs because pessimists sit out of the market and asset prices reflect only the valuation

of optimists. Chen, Hong, and Stein (2002) and Diether, Malloy, and Scherbina (2002)

find compelling support for the Miller hypothesis in several markets in which there are


                                               1
binding short-sale constraints. However, Boehme, Danielsen, Kumar, and Sorescu (2009)

and Avramov, Chordia, Jostova, and Philipov (2009) find evidence to the contrary. Either

way, this still leaves open the more fundamental issue of how disagreement is priced in general

markets without significant short-sale constraints, illiquidity, or other trading frictions.

      To best resolve the controversy, we would ideally want to study a market with several

key characteristics. First, the market should be highly liquid and essentially free from short-

sale constraints. Second, the key drivers of the asset’s value should be easily defined and

common knowledge. Finally, disagreement about these key drivers among the institutions

that actually trade the assets should be directly observable. This latter condition bypasses

the measurement uncertainty that results when an indirect proxy for disagreement is used.

      In this paper, we study how disagreement affects asset pricing in such a setting. Specif-

ically, we analyze a time series of prepayment speed (PSA) forecasts issued by major Wall

Street mortgage dealers and then analyze how disagreement affects expected returns, return

volatility, and trading volume in the agency mortgage-backed security market.1

      This market provides several unique advantages. First, since the PSA forecasts are given

for various interest rate scenarios and the mortgage-backed securities are guaranteed by the

U.S. government, credit risk and interest rate risk do not affect the dealers’ PSA estimates.

Thus, the only cash flow uncertainty associated with a mortgage-backed security is the timing

of prepayments. In turn, the timing of cash flows is a key factor affecting how investors value
  1
    Providers of PSA estimates included Barclays, Bank of America, Bear Stearns, Credit Suisse, Deutsche
Bank, Donaldson, Lufin, and Jenrette, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, JP Morgan Chase, Lehman Brothers, Merrill
Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Nations Bank, Prudential, Greenwich Capital, Salomon Brothers, Smith Barney,
and UBS Warburg.

mortgage-backed securities. This allows us to precisely correlate disagreement with the

return characteristics of mortgage-backed securities. Second, the PSA forecasts are made

by the same institutions that trade mortgage-backed securities. Therefore, we know directly

what the dealers’ best estimate is for the key input to valuing the assets under consideration,

and this allows us to best study the relationship between disagreement and asset prices. Last,

it is unlikely that disagreement stems from differences in either private or public information.

Specifically, since none of the dealers service the underlying mortgages, they have little or no

private information about the prepayment behavior of specific mortgage-backed securities.

On the other hand, these dealers clearly have full access to all available public information

given the enormous budgets they devote to prepayment modeling. Thus, it is much more

likely that disagreement among dealers is due to differences in their model choice, underlying

assumptions, and interpretation of economic news.

   Using PSA estimates during the period from July 1993 to January 2012, we construct

a disagreement index and document a surprisingly high level of disagreement among the

participants in the survey. We show that disagreement is time-varying, correlated with

financial and macroeconomic variables, and magnified when major events occur in financial

markets (e.g., the failure of Long Term Capital Management, the September 11 attacks, and

Lehman Brothers default).

   Following this, we study whether disagreement is priced in the market. To examine

whether disagreement about prepayment rates affects the expected returns of mortgage-

backed securities, we use the standard approach of regressing ex post realized returns on



                                               3
the ex ante measures of disagreement and other proxies for risk premia. For disagreement

to be priced in expected returns, the disagreement index should have predictive power for

subsequent returns on mortgage-backed securities even after controlling for the other ex

ante risk premium proxies. Using a proprietary data set of daily returns on the Fannie

Mae (FNMA) “To Be Announced” (TBA) security closest to the current coupon mortgage

rate, we construct a measure of monthly returns.2 Including the disagreement index in

the regression increases the predictive power nearly two-fold, and the coefficient on the

disagreement variable is positive and highly significant. Based on this, we can conclude that

increased disagreement is associated with higher expected returns, which supports the thesis

that disagreement is associated with a positive risk premium, as posited by Varian (1985,

1989) and Abel (1989). Further, since we control for several measures of market risk in our

empirical specification (e.g., interest rate risk, the S&P 500 volatility index (VIX), and the

monthly excess return on the CRSP Value Weighted Index), this implies that disagreement

risk is likely to be a form of trading risk or risk due to adverse selection.

       Finally, we analyze the relationship between disagreement, return volatility, and trad-

ing volume. We use a simple vector-autoregression (VAR) framework in which we include

all three variables with lags and controls. We find that increasing disagreement is followed

by periods of higher volatility and trading volume. This is consistent with Shalen (1993)

and Zapatero (1998) who posit that disagreement and price volatility should be positively

correlated. More strikingly, though, we find that volatility in and of itself does not lead to
   2
    The “To Be Announced” (TBA) market is a highly liquid market in which buyers and sellers agree on the
future sale prices of mortgage-backed securities, but do not specify which particular assets will be delivered.
Details about this market are in Section 3.2.


                                                      4
higher trading volume. Rather, it is only when there exists more disagreement that trading

volume increases. Our findings lend support to the predictions of Harris and Raviv (1993)

who predict that differences in opinion is the primary channel through which uncertainty

leads to higher trading volume. To our knowledge, our study is the first paper to empirically

document the importance of this channel. Our results are also consistent with the empirical

findings of Kandel and Pearson (1995) who document that dispersion in analyst forecasts

affects trading volume, particularly around anticipated earnings announcements. Interest-

ingly, we find that higher trading volume is associated with lower subsequent disagreement.

We view this as intuitive: as investors learn through trade, this gives them opportunities to

update their beliefs about the drivers of asset value.

   Besides providing evidence that disagreement is associated with a positive risk premium,

we are able to distinguish between two competing hypotheses regarding how information in

markets gets incorporated into asset prices. As Banerjee (2011) highlights, investors may

update their beliefs via a rational expectations mechanism or may agree to disagree, which

results in persistent differences in opinion. According to Banerjee (2011), these two mecha-

nisms can be distinguished empirically by comparing how return-volume characteristics vary

with disagreement in the market. We find that higher disagreement is associated with higher

expected returns, higher subsequent return volatility, and higher trading volume. These re-

sults directly support the rational expectations channel. Especially given our finding that

higher trading volume is associated with lower subsequent disagreement, this makes it more

likely that rational investors do learn from prices and opinions in the market, updating



                                              5
their beliefs using Bayes rule via a rational expectations channel. To our knowledge, these

channels have not been distinguished empirically in previous studies.

    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review the literature in

this area to highlight our contribution. In Section 3, we review the data that we collect

and some important institutional details regarding the estimation of prepayment speeds, the

agency mortgage-backed security markets, and the TBA market. In Section 4, we construct a

measure of disagreement and describe its empirical properties. In Section 5, we characterize

the relationship between disagreement and expected returns, return volatility, and trading

volume. Section 6 provides some concluding remarks.




2     Literature Review

2.1    Disagreement and Learning

At any point in time, disagreement may arise due to heterogeneous beliefs or due to persistent

differences of opinion. Much attention has been devoted to whether the former eventually

leads to asymptotic agreement when learning occurs. Starting with Blackwell and Dubins

(1962), Aumann (1976), and Geanakoplos and Polemarchakis (1982), investigators have

focused on conditions that make disagreement impossible in a rational setting. As Aumann

(1976) shows in a remarkably clear way, if agents share a common prior and have common

knowledge of each other’s posterior beliefs, they cannot agree to disagree. Geanakoplos

and Polemarchakis (1982) extend this analysis showing that communication, either direct or



                                              6
indirect, results in an equilibrium with common posterior beliefs. In their words, “we can’t

disagree forever”.

   Later work, however, shows that permanent disagreement can arise even when agents

have common priors and observe the same time series of public information. As Acemoglu,

Chernozhukov, and Yildiz (2006) point out, there are many empirical settings where such

permanent disagreement arises. As such, they study a setting in which individuals are

uncertain about the interpretation of the signals they receive, which implies they have non-

degenerate probability distributions over the conditional distribution of signals given the

underlying parameter of interest. In such case, Acemoglu, Chernozhukov, and Yildiz (2006)

show that agreement may be impossible, despite the fact that all agents update their beliefs

as Bayesians.

   Given this, at any given time there may be several mechanisms whereby disagreement

in a financial market may arise. First, investors may update according to Blackwell and

Dubins (1962), but at the time of observation investors’ beliefs have yet to fully converge.

Second, investors update their beliefs rationally, but because they are uncertain about the

quality of their signal, may fail to converge. Last, market participants may simply “agree to

disagree”, in that they observe the same public information but adhere to different models.

This etiology may have an added behavioral component, but has been used by Varian (1985),

Harris and Raviv (1993), and David (2008).

   Given this, the evolution of beliefs may occur via two learning mechanisms. Investors may

learn over time via a rational expectations channel in which heterogeneous beliefs are more



                                             7
likely to converge. Alternatively, disagreement may persist as differences of opinion lead to

dispersion in forecasts. As pointed out by Banerjee (2011) in a theoretical model, these two

channels can be distinguished empirically. With the rational expectations channel, Banerjee

(2011) predicts that increased disagreement should induce higher expected returns, higher

volatility, higher market betas, and higher covariance between volume and absolute returns,

but lower return autocorrelation. When investors agree to disagree (i.e., differences in opinion

persist), the opposite trends should be present. In both channels, disagreement is positively

correlated with trading volume. However, which of these channels exists empirically has not

been addressed in the previous academic literature.



2.2    Disagreement and Risk-Premia

As mentioned earlier, much of the extant theoretical work posits that there should be a pos-

itive risk premium associated with disagreement in the market. Following the seminal work

of Mehra and Prescott (1985), several authors rationalized the equity premium puzzle by

considering that investors may have heterogeneous beliefs or differences of opinion. Varian

(1985) considers an Arrow-Debreu economy with agents who have different subjective prob-

abilities. In equilibrium, an increase in the range of probability beliefs typically decreases

asset values, as long as risk aversion is not abnormally high. As such, disagreement is as-

sociated with a positive risk premium under reasonable preferences. Varian (1989) provides

an elegant summary of these results.

   Likewise, Abel (1989) investigates an equilibrium asset pricing model in which investors’



                                               8
demands for risky stocks and riskless bonds depend on their subjective belief about payoffs

to the risky capital. When beliefs are more heterogeneous, this reduces the stock’s price, and

can dramatically increase the equity premium relative to bonds. Abel (1989) concludes that

the equity premium under homogenous beliefs understates the premium that would arise

under heterogeneous beliefs.

   Subsequent theoretical work has confirmed these findings. Basak (2005) provides a good

survey. More recently, David (2008) studies a general equilibrium exchange economy in

which two types of agents have heterogeneous beliefs. The agents have a difference of opinion

and “agree to disagree”, in that they update their beliefs differently about the state of the

economy even though they observe the same signals. Agents trade and may speculate on

the relative accuracy of their respective models. David (2008) shows that less risk-averse

agents speculate more, but demand higher risk premia. Chen, Joslin, and Tran (2010) study

an equilibrium model with “affine” disagreement about fundamentals, which allows them to

consider stochastic disagreement about growth rates, volatility dynamics, and the likelihood

and size of jumps. They show that the risk premium depends on whether disasters strike: in

normal times, optimistic agents accumulate wealth and there is a decline in the risk premium,

whereas when disasters strike, pessimistic agents become more wealthy, which causes the risk

premium to increase.

   One important exception in this literature is Miller (1977), who posits that short-sale

constraints should cause disagreement to have a positive effect on stock prices. The intuition

is that when pessimists are forced to sit out of the market, stock prices only reflect the



                                              9
demand from optimists, which causes prices (returns) to increase (decrease). This intuition

is supported in Liu and Seasholes (2011) who study dual-listed shares in China and Hong

Kong. They show that when there is a short-sale ban in China, the prices of Chinese stocks

are 1.8 times higher compared to those in Hong Kong.

   Miller (1977) has been tested in several empirical studies and has been shown to be

plausible. Chen, Hong, Stein (2002) develop a stock market model in which an increase

in divergence of opinion results in a decrease in the breadth of stock market ownership,

causing a high stock price and a lower expected return. Then, they show empirically that

reducing the breadth of mutual fund ownership of stocks forecasts a lower stock return.

Diether, Malloy, and Scherbina (2002) analyze the role of dispersion in analysts’ earnings

forecasts in predicting the cross section of future stock returns. They find that stocks with

higher dispersion in analysts’ earnings forecasts earn significantly lower future returns than

otherwise similar stocks. Park (2005) extends this work by testing whether the aggregate

stock market also becomes overpriced when differences in expectations are high. According

to Park (2005), the dispersion in expectations among market analysts has predictive power

for future stock returns: higher dispersion predicts lower stock returns. Similarly, Yu (2011)

uses the Institutional Brokers’ Estimate System (I/B/E/S) database on analyst forecast and

finds that the ex post market return is negatively related to the bottom-up disagreement.

   These findings have led others to study disagreement and expected returns in other

settings where short-sale constraints exist. Moeller, Schlingermann, and Stulz (2007) study

the impact of divergence of opinion on acquirer returns in M&A activity. They find that



                                             10
increasing diversity of opinion about an acquirer’s value causes the acquirer’s return in stock

payment acquisitions to decrease, but have no effect in cash transactions. Chatterjee, John,

and Yan (2012) show that the total takeover premium, pre-announcement target stock price

run-up, and post-announcement target stock price run-up are all higher when investors have

a higher divergence of opinion. They use analysts forecasts, change of breadth of mutual fund

ownership, and idiosyncratic volatility as three proxies for divergence of analyst opinions.

   In contrast, Avramov, Chordia, Jostova, and Philipov (2009) show that the negative rela-

tionship between dispersion in analysts’ forecasts and stock returns may be simply explained

by financial distress risk. Specifically, they show that the profitability of dispersion-based

trading is only high when credit conditions deteriorate and is concentrated in a small number

of firms with the worst credit ratings. However, the authors find that when their dispersion

measure is adjusted by credit risk, even for this small group of firms, the negative dispersion-

return relationship disappears. Likewise, Boehme, Danielsen, Kumar, and Sorescu (2009)

demonstrate a positive relationship between dispersion of beliefs and expected returns, after

controlling for short-interest and investor recognition as proxied by institutional ownership.

   Given this, the support for Miller (1977) is mixed. However, as we note in the intro-

duction, this still leaves open the more fundamental issue of how disagreement is priced in

general markets without short-sale constraints, illiquidity, or other trade frictions.




                                              11
2.3    Disagreement, Trading Volume, and Price Volatility

The earlier literature, both theoretical and empirical, has documented a positive relationship

between disagreement, trading volume, and price volatility. Harris and Raviv (1993) study

the effect of news announcements on trading prices and volume. They assume that traders

receive the same common information, but differ in the way they interpret the information.

Additionally, each trader believes absolutely in the validity of his own interpretation, so

there is difference in opinion. Some of their key findings are that absolute price changes and

volume are positively correlated, and that absolute changes in the mean forecast of the final

payoff and volume are positively related.

   Shalen (1993) examines a two-period noisy rational expectations model of a futures mar-

ket and studies the effect that dispersion in expectations has on price volatility and trading

volume. Higher dispersion causes higher price volatility, higher expected trade volume, and

increases the correlation between absolute price changes and both contemporaneous and

lagged trade volume.

   Kandel and Pearson (1995) study how dispersion in analyst forecasts affects trading

volume and asset prices. They analyze trading activity around anticipated announcements

and document increases in trading volume, even when there are no changes in price. Authors

posit that this occurs because traders are using different likelihood functions when they

Bayesian update.

   Zapatero (1995) considers a model with two logarithmic utility maximizers that observe

aggregate consumption but disagree about its expected rate of change. Additional infor-


                                             12
mation, which induces heterogeneous beliefs, causes higher volatility of interest rates in the

economy.

        Finally, Banerjee and Kremer (2010) study the relationship between disagreement and the

dynamics of trade in a theoretical model in which investors disagree about the interpretation

of public signals. They show that disagreement exacerbates volatility and leads to higher

trading volume, and that there is a positive correlation between volatility and trading volume.




3         The Data

In this paper, we focus on generic agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) in which the

monthly principal and interest payments are pooled in a passthrough and distributed to

investors on a pro-rata basis.3 The speed at which homeowners prepay their mortgages is

a key driver of value for these securities. In what follows, we describe PSA estimates that

were made by major MBS dealers for Ginnie Mae (GNMA) mortgage-backed securities. We

then describe how we construct a return series of Fannie Mae (FNMA) forward contracts

that are traded in the “To Be Announced” (TBA) market.



3.1        Prepayment Speed Forecasts

In the mortgage industry, prepayments speeds are typically quoted according to the Public

Securities Association (PSA) convention in which an annualized constant prepayment rate

(CPR) is adjusted for the age of the underlying mortgages. New mortgages tend to have very
    3
   For in-depth discussions of passthough securities and the MBS market, see Hayre (2001) and Fabozzi,
Bhattacharya, and Berliner (2007).

                                                 13
low prepayment speeds and the rate of prepayment rises with age until the mortgages become

seasoned, at which point the rate of prepayment remains constant. The PSA benchmark

curve was introduced in the 1980’s and is often referred to as the 100% curve. At 100%,

the prepayment rate starts at 0% for new mortgages, rises by 0.2% per month until month

30, after which the prepayment speed remains constant at 6%. PSA estimates are quoted

relative to this benchmark. For example, a GNMA with a PSA of 200% would experience

prepayments at a rate twice that of the usual benchmark rate and a GNMA with a PSA of

50% would experience prepayments at a rate that is half the usual benchmark rate.

       The expected rate of mortgage prepayment is a key driver of value for valuing MBS,

but is challenging to forecast. Many factors affect prepayments: home sales, refinancings,

defaults, and curtailments. In turn, these are driven by changes in housing supply, mobility,

inflation, interest rates, income, employment, and consumer confidence. Estimating prepay-

ment speeds requires careful modeling, and given the degree of complexity involved may be

a significant source of heterogeneous beliefs about the value of generic MBS.

       Major Wall Street dealers in the MBS market participate in a monthly survey, in which

they provide Bloomberg with their best estimate of what the PSA would be for a generic

GNMA with a given coupon rate.4 PSA estimates are given for several interest rate scenarios,

ranging from 300 basis points below the current rate to 300 basis points above. As such,
   4
    Although there may be slight differences in the characteristics of the mortgage-backed securities for which
the dealers provide forecasts, these differences have a negligible effect on prepayment speeds. This is because
any mortgage-backed security that does not have a generic prepayment speed behavior is excluded from the
pool of mortgages that are traded in the TBA markets and for which dealers have provide forecasts. Instead,
mortgage-backed securities with non-generic prepayment behavior are traded in the separate specified pool
market (Hayre, 2001).




                                                      14
the forecasts not only reflect the dealers’ expectations of current prepayment speeds, but

also how those speeds would change in response to interest rate shocks. This has important

ramifications to our analysis: since the PSA estimates offered by the dealers vary with interest

rate changes, any difference of opinion or beliefs that they exhibit is only a function of their

calculation of prepayment risk, not of expected interest rate dynamics. As such, the dealers’

opinions regarding the prepayment speeds are the only source of variation driving returns

of the MBS. In Section 5, this will allow us to study the relationship between disagreement

and asset prices.

   Table 1 provides an illustration of the prepayment forecasts provided by survey par-

ticipants for a generic GNMA I 4.0 percent passthrough security as of January 31, 2012.

Figures 1 plots the forecasts. Not surprisingly, forecasted prepayment speeds are very sen-

sitive to changes in interest rates. As interest rates decline, PSA forecasts increase and vice

versa. More interestingly, however, there is considerable cross-sectional variation in the pat-

tern of PSA forecasts across dealers. In particular, these PSA forecasts differ by a factor of

roughly two at current and lower rate levels, but tend to converge for rate levels substantially

above the current rate level.

   Another way to compare prepayment forecasts is to consider measures based on normal-

ized values. For each date and each MBS, we normalize the PSA forecasts provided by a

participant in the survey by their PSA forecast for the current rate level. As such, the nor-

malized value represents the relative change or slope in the PSA forecast for a given change

in the level of rates. Figure 2 plots the normalized version of the data in Table 1. Even with



                                              15
this normalization, Figure 2 shows that there remains significant cross-sectional variation

across the various dealers in terms of their estimates of the sensitivity of prepayment speeds

to changes in the level of mortgage rates.

   Figure 3 provides three more snapshots of disagreement during extreme market events:

the failure of Askin Capital Management in 1994, the attacks of September 11, 2001, and

the failure of Lehman Brothers in 2008. In the top three plots, there is substantial cross-

sectional variation in dealer prepayment forecasts for nine interest rate scenarios ranging

from 300 basis above the current rate to 300 basis points below. The three bottom plots use

normalized prepayment forecasts for the same nine interest rate scenarios. As is evident, not

only is disagreement present during the three distinct time periods, but also its severity is

time-varying.

   We collected monthly survey data from Bloomberg during July 1993 to January 2012.

In total, 18 dealers participated in the survey at some time during the sample period. The

participants are listed in Table 2. On average, in each month the survey includes forecasts

from 8.42 dealers, with the actual number ranging from 3 to 14. Table 2 also reports the

average ratio of each dealer’s forecast relative to the cross-sectional average across all dealers

for a given date and coupon rate. As shown, the average ratios are all in the range from

0.90 to 1.10, suggesting that none of the dealers are producing forecasts that are, on average,

fundamentally different from the others on average. This last point highlights the fact that

disagreement about prepayment speeds are not likely due to asymmetric access to public or

private information.



                                               16
   Indeed, the very nature of the mortgage passthrough market inherently makes it unlikely

that differences in access to public information drives variation in PSA estimates. All of the

dealers in the survey are large financial institutions that have devoted extensive resources

to the mortgage market and each has the ability to obtain all publicly available information

about the term structure of interest rates, interest rate forecasts, volatility, fixed income

markets, mortgage prepayment rates, market liquidity, funding availability, and macroeco-

nomic fundamentals. As such, the inputs to most PSA models are readily available to the

dealers.

   It is also unlikely that variation in estimates rests on access to private information. This is

simply because there is actually very little private information available to anyone about the

mortgage pools underlying the MBS or TBA markets. For example, the generic pools traded

on a forward basis in the TBA market tend to be based on recently-originated mortgages

for which there is little prepayment history. In addition, the dealers generally do not hold

or service the mortgage passthrough securities for which they provide forecasts. Thus, they

are likely to have little or no private information about the performance of the underlying

mortgages. Finally, all of the data about the characteristics of individual mortgage borrowers

(such as income, FICO score, appraisals, etc.) are readily available to all market participants.

   Taken together, these considerations suggest that asymmetric information is unlikely to

drive disagreement about prepayment speeds. Rather, a more likely explanation is that

variation in PSA estimates is driven by differences in interpretation and beliefs about the

common set of information available to them. These differences in interpretation and beliefs



                                               17
might manifest themselves as differences in the assumptions and/or the structure of the

models that each dealer uses to estimate mortgage prepayments.

   Finally, one concern that might arise is whether the dealers have an incentive to dis-

close their best estimate of prepayment speed truthfully. We believe that they do. First,

as Table 2 suggests, none of the dealers systematically provide different forecasts from their

contemporaries. Second, based on a time series of disagreement that we present in Section 4,

times of larger variation in estimates correspond to large economic events in which uncer-

tainty is present in the market. Last, the estimates themselves are observable to potential

clients of the dealers and therefore provide a signal of technical expertise. As such, dealers

have a strong incentive to demonstrate their skills as they compete for customers.



3.2    Returns on TBA securities

The TBA market is an attractive setting to study returns on MBS since it is such a highly

liquid market. In a TBA trade, the buyer and seller agree on a future sale price, but do not

specify which particular securities will be delivered. Instead, only five additional parameters

are promised: the settlement date, issuer, maturity, coupon, and par amount. According

to Vickery and Wright (2010), this convention simplifies trade, but also ameliorates asym-

metric information conflicts in the MBS market, leading to higher agency MBS liquidity.

In the context of our analysis, though, this makes our study of the relationship between

disagreement and returns more precise. That is, since the TBA market is so liquid, we can

be confident that the asset pricing results we document are not merely due to time-varying



                                              18
transaction costs or other trading frictions.

    To measure the returns on mortgage-backed securities, we make use of a proprietary data

set provided to us by a major fixed-income asset management firm. This data set consists

of daily returns on Fannie Mae TBA’s closest to the current coupon mortgage rate. Since

TBA’s are forward contracts, the return series consists of the return from going long a one-

month TBA, investing the TBA price in a riskless margin account, and then rolling the

portfolio over every month on the monthly TBA settlement date. Constructing it this way

provides continuity over the monthly roll date in the TBA settlement. We then compute

monthly returns by aggregating the daily returns during the month.




4     Measuring Disagreement

Our extensive data set of PSA forecasts provides us with a unique opportunity to measure

the amount of disagreement in the market directly. Not only does the data set cover a broad

cross section of dealers over nearly 20 years, but there are a number of key features of the

data that allow us to obtain more accurate measures of disagreement. First, since dealers

provide multiple forecasts for each passthrough security, we can normalize each dealer’s

forecasts before estimating cross-sectional variation among dealers. This allows us to control

for the possibility that the levels of PSA forecasts might vary across dealers because of model

calibration issues rather than because of actual disagreement. Second, each PSA forecast

is conditional on a specific term structure scenario. Thus, we can compare forecasts across

dealers while holding fixed assumptions about the evolution of the term structure. Finally,


                                                19
since all of the forecasts are visible in the Bloomberg system, dealers are aware of the extent

to which they disagree with other dealers.

   To measure the amount of disagreement in the mortgage markets about prepayments,

we construct a monthly index based on the cross-sectional dispersion among dealers in their

normalized PSA forecasts. Specifically, we first identify the GNMA coupon that is closest to

the current yield of par mortgage-backed securities (the current coupon) and for which three

or more dealer forecasts are available. Generally, the GNMAs closest to the current coupon

tend to have the greatest homogeneity across dealers in terms of their maturity, pricing, and

information availability. Then, for each dealer providing forecasts for the GNMA with the

closest coupon, we take the ratio of the PSA forecast for the −100 basis point scenario to

the PSA for the +100 basis point scenario. Thus, this ratio is a measure of the relative

(normalized) change in prepayment forecast as rates move from 100 basis points above the

current level of interest rates to 100 basis points below. Alternatively, this ratio can be

viewed as a measure of the slope or sensitivity (duration) of prepayments to changes in

interest rates. Finally, we compute the simple standard deviation of the ratios across dealers

providing forecasts for that month. We repeat the same process for all 223 months in the

study period to form the index.

   The top panel of Table 3 presents summary statistics for the disagreement index, and

Figure 4 plots its time series. The index has a number of interesting features which may

provide some insight into the nature of disagreement in financial markets. First, there is a

surprisingly high level of disagreement among the participants in the survey. The average



                                              20
value of the index is 40.29 percent, and the median value is 35.43 percent. Thus, even after

normalizing the data, there is wide dispersion among the dealers in their views about changes

in prepayment rates. Second, there is considerable time series variation in the amount of

disagreement among dealers. In particular, the index varies from a low of 1.96 percent,

reflecting almost perfect agreement among dealers, to a high of 138.60 percent, representing

extreme diversity among dealers in terms of their forecasts. The standard deviation of the

index is 24.80 percent. Thus, disagreement is a dynamic phenomenon. Finally, disagreement

among the dealers tends to be persistent in nature; the first-order serial correlation coefficient

for the index is 0.6298. On the other hand, the disagreement index is also strongly mean

reverting as evidenced by the serial correlation of monthly changes in the index of −0.455.

Intuitively, this suggests that the persistence of a period of higher (or lower) disagreement

can be measured in terms of months, rather than years.

   Figure 4 also shows that there is an strong episodic nature to period of higher disagree-

ment. In particular, the graph illustrates that peaks in the level of disagreement tend to

coincide with major events in the mortgage and financial markets. Important examples in-

clude the mortgage crisis in early 1994 during which the prominent mortgage hedge fund

Askin Capital Management failed. Similarly, the highest level of disagreement during the

study period occurred in August 1998 during the Long Term Capital Management crisis

in the financial markets. Other major events associated with high levels of disagreement

include September 11, 2001, and the Lehman Brothers default of September 2008. Clearly,

disagreement increases during times of extreme uncertainty in the financial markets.



                                               21
   To explore this in more depth, we examine the relation between the disagreement index

and a number of key financial and macroeconomic variables that could potentially affect

aggregate prepayment behavior. It is important to stress that in estimating this regression,

we are not implying causality in the relation between the level of disagreement and these

financial and macroeconomic variables. In fact, the level of disagreement and the financial

variables are likely all endogenously determined. Rather, our objective is simply to describe

the contemporaneous relation between the disagreement index and the other variables.

   Table 4 reports the results from the regression and lists the independent variables that we

included. As shown, a number of the variables are significantly related to the disagreement

index. For example, the mortgage refinancing index is positively related to the level of

disagreement. This is intuitive since an increase in prepayments is likely to result in greater

dispersion among dealers in their estimates of subsequent prepayments. Similarly, both of

the volatility measures are significantly related to the disagreement index. Interestingly,

however, the sign of the two volatility measures differ. An increase in stock market volatility

results in higher disagreement, while the opposite is true for Treasury yield volatility. An

increase in the slope of the term structure is associated with an increase in disagreement.

Stock returns are negatively related to disagreement. Finally, an increase in unemployment

is associated with a decline in disagreement.




                                                22
5     Is Disagreement Priced?

5.1    Disagreement and Expected Returns

To examine whether disagreement about prepayment rates affects the expected returns of

mortgage-backed securities, we use the standard approach of regressing ex post realized

returns on the ex ante measures of disagreement and other proxies for risk premia. If dis-

agreement is priced in expected returns, then the disagreement index should have predictive

power for the subsequent returns on mortgage backed securities even after controlling for the

other ex ante risk premium proxies.

    As discussed in Section 3, we make use of a proprietary data set provided to us by a

major fixed-income asset management firm to construct a monthly return series on mortgage-

backed securities. The lower panel of Table 3 provides summary statistics for the FNMA

TBA returns.

    Table 5 reports the results from the regression of the monthly mortgage returns on the

risk premium and disagreement proxies. The first specification in the table reports the

results when only the risk premium proxies are included. The second specification reports

the results when the change in the disagreement index added to the regression. To control

for other factors besides disagreement that may drive the expected returns of mortgage-

backed securities we include a number of ex ante financial and macroeconomic variables in

the regression. Note that in forecasting the mortgage-backed security return for month t + 1,

we use only the ex ante values of these variables measured from the end of month t − 1 to the



                                             23
end of month t. By including the lagged mortgage return, we control for the possibility of

persistence in the returns. The various fixed income variables control for any term premia,

credit risk premia, or liquidity premia that might be present in expected returns. The stock

return and volatility variables potentially capture any equity risk or volatility risk premia in

mortgage returns. The refinancing index, inflation, and unemployment variables are include

to control for any macroeconomic related risk premia not captured by the other variables.

   As shown in the first specification, the risk premium proxies collectively have a significant

amount of predictive power for the mortgage returns. The coefficients for the lagged mortgage

return, the change in the mortgage rate, the stock return, and the inflation rate are significant

at either the five-percent or ten-percent levels. The adjusted R2 for the regression is 8.07

percent. Thus, variation in expected mortgage returns is clearly predictable on the basis of

these risk premium proxies.

   The second specification, however, shows that the predictive power of the regression

nearly doubles to 13.83 percent when the disagreement variable is included. The coefficient

is positive and highly significant with a t-statistic of 2.88. Thus, the expected return on

mortgage-backed securities increases when disagreement increases. This is consistent with

the existence of a risk premium for disagreement (i.e., Varian, 1985, 1989; Abel, 1989; David,

2008). Finally, the same risk premium proxies that are significant in the first panel remain

significant when the change in disagreement is added to the regression specification.




                                               24
5.2    Disagreement, Volatility, and Trading Volume

To explore the effects of disagreement on volatility and trading activity we use a simple

vector-autoregression (VAR) framework in which we include measures of all three of these

variables. To measure mortgage return volatility, we use the daily return data described

previously to calculate the standard deviation of returns for each month in the sample

period. As the measure of trading volume, we use the total agency mortgage trading volume

of primary government bond dealers reported by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. This

series is aggregated to the monthly level and includes both trading activity among primary

government bond dealers and trading activity among customers of these bond dealers. An

important advantage of this series is that it covers the trading activity of virtually every

major dealer included in the PSA surveys. Summary statistics for the mortgage return

volatility and trading volume measures are also presented in the lower panel of Table 3. We

estimate the VAR using a specification that includes three lags of the monthly change in the

disagreement index, mortgage return volatility, and trading volume.

   Table 6 reports the results from the estimation of the VAR system. Focusing first on the

regression for disagreement, Table 6 again shows that disagreement is strongly mean reverting

since two of the three lagged changes in disagreement are negative and significant. Thus,

an increase in disagreement this month tends to be followed by a decrease in disagreement

in the next two months. There does not appear to be any significant relation between

volatility and subsequent changes in disagreement. The results indicate that there is a

relation between trading activity and subsequent changes in disagreement. In particular,


                                             25
changes in trading activity are significantly related to disagreement. The negative sign of the

coefficient indicates that an increase in trading volume is associated with lower disagreement

in the second subsequent month. This result is intuitive: as investors learn through trade,

this gives them opportunities to update their beliefs about the drivers of asset value.

   Turning next to the second regression for volatility, we also see that volatility is strongly

mean reverting, with all three lagged values of changes in volatility significantly negative.

This is not surprising given the well known properties of return volatility. What is interesting,

however, is that there is a strong positive relation between disagreement and subsequent

volatility. In particular, the second lagged change in disagreement is positive and highly

significant, indicating that an increase in disagreement tends to be followed by higher levels

of mortgage return volatility. This effect can be viewed as providing support for Shalen (2003)

and Zapatero (1998), who posit that there is a positive correlation between disagreement and

price volatility. The results also show that increases in trading activity tend to be followed

by higher levels of return volatility. All three lagged values of the change in trading volume

are positive and significant.

   Finally, turning to the third VAR equation in which changes in trading volume are the

dependent variable, Table 6 shows that there is a strong relation between disagreement and

trading activity. Both the first and second lagged changes in disagreement are significantly

positively related to changes in trading volume. As discussed earlier, this effect can be

viewed as providing support for Harris and Raviv (1993) and consistent with the empirical

findings in Kandel and Pearson (1995). The results also show that increases in volatility



                                               26
are not significantly related to subsequent changes in trading volume, after controlling for

disagreement. This provides evidence that uncertainty only increases trading volume when

disagreement arises. Alternatively, disagreement is the mechanism by which uncertainty

increases trading in the market. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to identify this

relationship. Finally, we again find that trading volume has a mean reverting tendency as

both the first and second lagged changes in trading volume and significant and negative in

sign.




6       Concluding Remarks

Understanding how information gets incorporated into asset prices may be one of the most

fundamental issues in finance. This paper contributes by helping us to understand whether

and how heterogeneous beliefs and differences in opinions are priced in the market. It also

clarifies how investors take disagreement into consideration and what effect that has on the

time-series of asset prices.

    Previous theoretical work tends to support a positive risk premium that is associated

with disagreement. Indeed, the equity risk premium as identified by Mehra and Prescott

(1985) can be rationalized by introducing heterogeneous beliefs or differences of opinion

(Varian, 1985, 1989; Abel, 1989). To our knowledge, this paper is the first academic study

to document this fact empirically in a setting in which there are essentially no short-sale

constraints or other trade frictions.

    Disagreement is also associated with higher volatility and trading volume. This relation-


                                             27
ship has been studied in theoretical work (Harris and Raviv, 1993; Shalen, 1993; Zapatero,

1998) and documented empirically by Kandel and Pearson (1995). In our paper, we show

that disagreement is the primary channel through which uncertainty leads to higher trading

volume. That is, volatility in and of itself does not lead to higher trading volume. Rather, it

is only when there exists more disagreement that trading volume increases with uncertainty.

This distinction has not been identified empirically in previous work.

   Finally, disagreement may become incorporated into asset prices via two different mech-

anisms. As Banerjee (2011) highlights, investors may update their beliefs via a rational

expectations mechanism or may agree to disagree, which results in persistent differences in

opinion. By studying how return-volume characteristics vary with disagreement in the mar-

ket, we find support for the rational expectations channel. We find that higher disagreement

is associated with higher expected returns, higher subsequent return volatility, and higher

trading volume. Especially given our finding that higher trading volume is associated with

lower subsequent disagreement, this makes it more likely that rational investors do learn from

prices and opinions in the market, updating their beliefs using Bayes rule. These channels

have not been distinguished empirically in previous studies.

               Figure 4. The time series of disagreement: July 1993 through January
               2012. The disagreement measure is the cross-sectional standard deviation of a
               dealer’s normalized prepayment duration forecast, which is the ratio between the
               normalized forecast prepayment forecasts conditional upon a -100 and a +100 basis
               point shift in the term structure. We use the forecast on the instrument having a
               coupon closest to the current par yield, which generally has the best coverage and
               most uniform terms.

An Example of the PSA Forecasts Provided by Survey Participants. This table shows the PSA forecasts provided by the survey participants
on January 31, 2012 for a four-percent GNMA mortgage backed security. The PSA forecasts are given for term structure scenarios ranging from a
downward shift of 300 basis points to an upward shift of 300 basis points. The PSA forecasts for the current term structure are given in the column
denoted by zero. Maturity denotes the weighted-average maturity of the mortgages underlying the GNMA mortgage backed security. Coupon denotes
the weighted-average coupon or mortgage rate of the mortgages underlying the GNMA mortgage backed security.
