       Purchasing-Power Annuities: Financial Innovation for
   Stable Real Retirement Ihcome in an Inflationary Environment


                           ABSTRACT



     This paper explores the desireability and feasibility in the context

of the u.S. financial system of purchasing<power annuities (PPA), i.e.,

retirement annuities offering some kind of consumer price level indexation.

After investigating the inadequacies of conventional and equity-based

variable annuities in an inflationary environment, the paper assesses the

suitability of money market instruments hedged with commodity futures

contracts as the asset base for PPA's and eonsiders the possib1ity of having

life insurance companies and private pension plans offer them to the public.

The empirical evidence of the past 26 years indicates that the real (inflation-

adjusted) earnings rate which these financial institutions should use in

pricing PPA's is at most zero.

 I., Introduction

     In no area of financial planning is the problem created by
inflation more acute than in providing for retirement income.     The.)
essence of the problem is that a household's needs are defined in terms
of real goods and services while conventional private pension plans and
contractual savings schemes offer a money fixed stream of benefits.
In the U.S. the problem is mitigated somewhat by the fact that Social
Security currently does provide a cost-of-living adjustment to its
retirement benefits.    But for most households, Social Security benefits
provide only a "floor" which must be supplemented at least in part with
income from other retirement plans.    It is no wonder, therefore, that
labor unions have started to include a demand for cost-of-living escalators
in pension benefits in their recent contract negotiations.
       In an inflationary environment, conventional money-fixed
 pensions and contractual savings plans are risky both as a vehicle
 for accumulating savings and as a source of retirement benefits.

 This was one of the considerations which led to the
 development of equity-based variable annuities (VA's) in the
 1950's.   At that time it was believed that common stocks could
 provide a hedge against inflation, in the sense that stock prices
would on average increase at the same rate as the prices of consump-
 tion g>ods.    By investing a portion of its retirement funds in an
                                     -2-


equity based VA, it was thought the household could thus protect itself
        . fl atJ.on.
against J.n     .    1   I




     The experience with VA's has been disappointing but not really that
surprising.   After all, even:i.f it were true, as many hypothesized,

that the inflation-adjusted or real rate of return on common stocks
is tmaffected by the rate of inflation, this would not imply that they
are a riskless investment.   By switching ftmds out of money-fixed

securities and into stocks, an investor would at best be eliminating
his exposure to inflation risk but only at the cost of exposing himself
to substantial business and financial risk. 2
    What is needed is a different kind of annuity, which is
defined in purchasing-power terms.    It is the purpose of this
paper to present a proposal for such a financial instrument,
which we shall call a purchasing power annuity (PPA)', and to
explore its feasibiiity in the context of the U.S. financial
system.   It would seem that the only asset which could provide
a base for such an annuity Would be default-free bonds linked to

some index of the cost of living. 3 Although proposals for the U.S.
government or some other institution to issue such price-indexed
bonds have abounded, there is no indication that anyone with the
power and authority to implement any of these proposals is inclined
to do so.4
                                  -3-




     Given the apparent reluctance, if not outright opposition,

 on the part of the government and private corporations to the

 issuance of price-indexed bonds the relevant question is
 whether there is any other asset, or combination of assets,

 currently existing in the U.S. financial system which could

 fulfill the same function.   The empirical evidence suggests that the
 most promising asset base for PPA's is short-term bonds hedged against
 unanticipated inflation with a small position in a well-diversified

 portfolio of commodity futures contracts.

     The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.     In the next
 part we explore the inadequacies of conventional and equity-based
 variable annuities in an inflationary environment by contrast-
 ting them with a hypothetical PPA.     We then try to assess the

suitability of money market instruments hedged with commodity futures as the

asset base for PPA's, and consider the possibility of having life insurance
companies and private pension plans offer them to the public.

Finally, we conclude with a brief summary' and discussion of the proposal.

II.   The Nature of the Problem and the Demand for PPA's


         The problems created by conventional annuities in a period

of rapid and unpredictable inflation are best considered by
dividing a household's lifetime into a pre-retirement (or accumu-

lation) period and a retirement period.     We will first focus on

the accumulation phase by assuming that the household has decided

that it will need a fund of $100,000 in terms of today's

purchasing power in order to finance its consumption flow during

retirement and that it has 30 years left before then.      At

an 8% per year rate of inflation the fund would have to have a
nominal value of $1,006,266 in it 30 years from now in order for

its real value in terms of today's purchasing power to be $100,000;
a ratio of roughly 10 to 1.


         There are two major problems associated with trying to meet

this savings goal with a conventional retirement savings plan,

which calls for equal periodic dollar contributions over the
working years.     The first problem is that the time pattern of

contributions in real terms will not in general match the time
pattern of the household's real labor income, and the second is

that there will be considerable uncertainty about the eventual

purchasing power of the dollar amount accumulated in the fund.

Both of these problems can be clarified with an example.


         Suppose the household is considering investing in a con-
ventional retirement savings plan offering a nominal interest

rate of 8% per year and consisting of 30 equal annual contribu-

tions.     In order to accumulate $1,006,266 by the end of the

30 year period, the annual premium         would have to be $8883.
                                    -5-



For most households this would represent an unrealistically high

proportion of its current labor income.       On the other hand, if

the household's nominal labor income keeps pace with inflation
during the working years, even with no real income growth, by

the end of the period the ratio of premium to income will
have shrunk to one-tenth its initial value.        Furthermore with

the conventional plan the household has no assurance that its
savings goal will be met in real terms.       Since the rate of

inflation is not known with certainty, the real value of the

fund at retirement may turn out to be far from 100,000 constant

dollars (c$lOO,OOO).For example, if the rate of inflation averages

10% per year the real value of the fund will be only
c$57,668, while at 6% per year inflation its real value will

be c$175, 201.


       Now let us contrast this conventional money-fixed savings

plan with a hypothetical PPA, which calls for a level flow of

annual contributions in terms of constant dollars.            Since the

expected real rate of interest S$sumed on the conventional plan was
zero, let us use that same real rate for the PPA.         In order

to accumulate c$lOO,OOO at the end of 30 years, the annual

premiUJ!} would have to be c$3333 l/3~ "A't 8% l?el;" yea;r
inflation the current dollar amount of the premiUJ!} would
start at $3,600 at the end of the first year and climb to
$33,542 by the last payment.      Assuming the household's labor income
remains constant in real terms, the ratio of premium to income
remains constant.
                                  -6- -




      Many insurance companies have in recent years taken steps
to move partially in the direction of this PPA accumulation idea

by including a cost-of-living clause in their insured savings

plans, which allows policyholders to increase coverage in accor-

dance with the annual rise in the price level.   But typically

the interest rate earned under these plans remains fixed in

nominal terms, so that although the saver can achieve a better
time profile of contributions, he still faces considerable risk
of not achieving his ultimate savings goal in real terms.


      To deal with this latter problem of a fixed nominal

earnings rate insurance companies started offering equity-based

variable annuities (VA's) in the 1950's.   The impetus for creating

these savings plans came from the idea that common stocks are a

long-run hedge against inflation, in the sense that over a long

holding-period one could count on earning a positive real rate
of return, i.e., a nominal rate of at least whatever the rate of
inflation turned out to be.


      Unfortunately, this idea has only limited merit.   Even if
it were true that the mean real rate of return on equity was

positive regardless of the rate of inflation, if the annual
fluctuations around that mean are independently distributed and

fairly large, then even with an investment horizon which is
far in the future, one can miss 9ne's savings target by quite a    bit~   for

example, suppose we wanted to invest a sum now which would provide

us with c$lOO,OOO for retirement 30 years from now.   If we could
                                         -7-


countona4% per year real rate of return then we would have to

invest $30,832.        But if the average compound real rate of return

turned out to be off by only 1%, so .that we wound up           ~arning

only 3 ratherthan4% per year, we would have only c$74,837 at

the end of the 30 year period.


        Of course, an     equity~based   VA offering a mean real rate of

return of 4% per year may be an attractive alternative to a               con~

ventional annuity offering an expected real rate of return of

zero.    Furthermore, by dividing its retirement savings between
a conventional money-fixed plan and a VA, the household can achieve
a better risk-return combination than by investing all of its funds

in either one alone.        However, no mixture of these two types of
savings plans can prOVide the household with a truly low risk option

in real terms.


        ine   ~ccd   f.or a PPA alternative to conventional money-fixed

annuities and equity-based VA's is even greater in the retirement

phase of the household's lifetime.             Let us first consider the

conventional money-fixed annuity.          Even with a deterministic rate

of inflation, equal periodic dollar amounts imply a negative "tilt"
to the stream of real retirement income, which many households
might not want.       Moreover, in an environment with an uncertain

rate of inflation, both the level and the slope of the real stream

of benefits are unpredictable and out of the beneficiary's control.
                                   -8-


     To illustrate this point let us consider a conventional retirement

annuity which is assumed to last 15 years (from retirement until death)
at a nominal interest rate of 8% per year and compare it to a hypothetical
purchasing-power annuity (PPA) which earns a real interest rate of zero.
It is important to stress that in comparing conventional annuities to PPA's,

the relevant comparison is not between a conventional money-fixed annuity
and the   ~   annuity with an escalator clause.         In pension planning as in
all other areas of personal finance, there is no free lunch!           Assuming
that the beneficiary has accumulated $100,00 for retirement, the PPA
would pay the annuitant c$6,667 per year, while the conventional annuity

would pay $11,683 per year.

     Table land Figure 1 show the pattern of real income flows associa-
ted with the conventional annuity for various rates of inflation·.

If as anticipated tQe actual rate        o~ ~nflation   over tQe life of the
annui ty turns out to be 8% per year th.en th.e real value of the
conventional annuity :elow will start at c$lO,8l8 in the fj,rst year and fall
to c$3683 in th.e 15 th..   Whi.le some reti.rees might view this pattern as
preferable to a constant real flow of c$6667 per year, the conventional
annuity offers no guarantee that it will be realized.           Should the rate

of inflation turn out to be 12% per year, the stream of real payments

will be both lower and more steeply tilted than anticipated, starting
at c$lO,43l in year 1 and fall!ng to c$2l34 by year 15.          0:f course, if the

retiree is lucky, the rate of inflation might turn out to be less          th~,

8% per year, but most people would prefer not to speculate with their

retirement income.

        For retirees who like the idea of a real stream of retirement
benefits which has a downward tilt, it would be relatively simple to
design a PPA with this property.           The essential distinguishing feature of
the PPA, however, would remain the same:             the slope and level of the
benefit stream should be fixed in real terms and unaffected by the actual

rate of inflation.

        Which brings us again to< acons:Lderation of equity-based variable annui-
ties. Under a VA the annuitant's retirement fund is invested in a diversified
                                           .-..,.

portfolio of common stocks which is managed by the institution offering
the annuity.     Most of the risk associated with the value of this portfolio
and the rate of return on it are passed through to the annuitant.               This
is accomplished by defining the periodic            ~efitin     teriilsof a fixed
number of annuity units, which are essentially shares of the underlying
stock portfolio.     The dollar amount of the benefit is then just
the fixed number of annuity units times the current market value of a
unit.
        Let us illustrate the VA and its drawbacks with a concrete example.
Since there are some differences in the kinds of VA's offered, we wi~l'
focus on a hypothetical one, which typifies the species.              As in the case

of the conventional, money-fixed annuity, let us assume that our household
has accumulated $100,000 in its retirement fund and is purchasing a
                                                                               ..
15 year annuity.     The insurance company uses this money to buy a portfolio
of stocks and sets the initial number of annuity units or "shares" at 10,000,
each thus having an initial value of, $10.             It then determines an

assumed earnings rate in order to compute the amount of the periodic
payment in terms of annuity units.              Let us assume a 4% pe_r_ year rate,
which represents a "conservative" judgement on the part of the company as
to th~ .ayerage·· i:eal   rate of return ~~~ich·· win     De earned on the stock

portfolio.     The annuity benefit will then be 899.4,annuity units per year.
                                   -11-




     The actual experience with     VA~s~ however~   has been disappointing.

Figure 2 and Table 2 present the experience of the College Retirement

Equities Fund   (~REF),   which pioneered the VA.    The value of an annuity

unit at CREF's inception on July 1, 1952 was set at $10, which in tenus

of 1967 purchasing power was worth c$12.52.         Since that time its real

value has fluctuated considerably in value from year to year, trending

its way to a peak of c$31.92 in 1967 and then falling back to .c$11.86

by 1978. It is ironic and expecially disappointing that it has done

particularly poorly in the last ten years, the period of the most

rapid inflation.

     Imagine the plight of a CREF beneficiary who started receiving

his benefits in 1967, when the current dollar value of an annuity

unit was $31.92.     Assuming he had accumulated $100,000 in his

fund prior to retirement, he would have been entitled to a monthly

benefit of 19.103 annuity units, with a current dollar value of
                     6
$609.76 per month.        In 1978 his monthly benefit would have been

$444.72   in current dollars and only c$226.56 in tenus of 1967 purchasing

vower.

     Although equity-based VA's have failed to provide a source of
stable real retirement income, the basic principle behind them could
be applied in creating an annuity with characteristics similar to the
hypothetical PPA described before.   All that is needed is an asset offering
a more stable real rate of return than common stocks.

III.     Money Market Instruments as an Asset Base for PPA's

        The only assets which could offer a completely satisfactory

investment base for PPA's would be securities explicitly linked

to the consumer price level, such as index bonds or price-level-
adjusted mortgages.       In lieu of such index-linked securities, recent
historical evidence suggests that the most promising asset base for

PPA's in the    u.s.   is short-term bonds hedged against unanticipated
inflation with a small position in a well-diversified portfolio of

commodity futures contracts.        Umlike index bonds, these securities
cannot provide a completely risk-free real rate of return.        They

can, however, be used     t~   produce a much more stable real rate of
return than can be earned on the traditional pension fund assets:

long-term bonds and common stocks; and unlike index bonds they do
already exist.

        Table 3 presents the year-by-year real rates of return one would

have earned on various categories of investments during the 26-year

period from January 1953 through December 1978.        The first column is the

real rate of return on a policy of "rolling-over" 30-day Treasury Bills.
Fama(6] maintains that the nominal rate of return on 30-day T-Bills'is

determined as the sum of a time-invariant real rate plus the market's
expectation of the rate of inflation over the coming month.        If the

market's short-run inflation expectations are fairly accurate then the

annual real rate of return reported in column 1 should not vary much
over time.     Indeed, over the period investigated by Fama, 1953 to 1972,
the real rate on 30-day Bills averaged 1% per year and had a standard

deviation of orily 0.69%.       But as the last column in Table 3 shows, a

serious escalation in the rate of inflation occurred in 1973 and 1974,

and the real rate of return on Bills has not been able to recover since

then.     The mean real rate of return during the 1973-1978 period was -1.62%

with a standard deviation of 1.29%.

    Column 2 shows that by increasing the maturity of the Treasury Bills

from a month to a year, an investor would have raised both his mean annual

real rate of return and its standard deviation.     During the 1953-1972 period
the mean would have increased by 46 basis points and the standard

deviation by 20.     Over the 1973-78 period the difference in the means

is only 5 basis points, while the difference in standard deviations is 80.
    Column 3 presents the real rate of return an investor would have
earned by investing in U.S. Treasury bonds with a 20-year maturity.        The

assumption underlying this series is that the. investor bought a 20-year
bond at the beginning of each year and sold it at the end.     His return

therefore includes both/coupon interest and capital gains or losses.        As the
relatively low mean and high standard deviation in both subperiods indicate,

the past 26 years was a bad time for the investor in long-term bonds.        Capital

losses caused by unanticipated increases in long-term interest rates tended

to cancel the coupon yield over this period.     While it is probably reasonable

to expect the mean real rate of return to be higher in the future, as       l~ng

as int~rest' rates!emain volatile the standard deviation will remain high.

    Column 4 presents the real rate of return on the Standard and Poor's
Composite Index of common stocks, which is a value-weighted stock portfolio

of the 500 largest corporations in the U.S ..    The return includes dividends
and capital gains.     As in the cases of bills and bonds there is a dramatic

decline in mean and increase in standard deviation going from the 1953-72
to the 1973-78 subperiod. 'The mean falls from 10.48% per year to -4.19%,

while the standard deviation rises from 18.19% to 23.87%.     Looking at the

year-by-year returns it is clear that stocks did especially badly in years

in which the rate of inflation was high.     Thus contrary to the usual assumption

made in the economics literature, that the real return on stocks is uncorrelated

negative correlation, we present in Table 4 the correlation coefficients

of the annual returns series reported in Table 3.    The correlation coefficient
between the real rate of return on common stocks and the rate of inflation

was -.562 during the 1953-72 subperiod and c .768 during the 1973-78 subperiod.
During the entire 26-year period stocks seem to have behaved more like a
money-fixed security than a claim to a real asset.
    Summarizing the data we have examined so far, it is clear that bills

have offered a far more stable annual real rate of return than long-term

bonds or stocks.   Furthermore, the 1 month bills are more stable than 1 year

bills.   But there is still variation in the real return on I-month bills,

which is caused primarily by variation in the rate of inflation as revealed

by the high negative correlation coefficients in the upper right hand corners

of the matrices in Table 4.   During the 1973-78 subperiod that correlation

was -.967, indicating that 93.5% of the variance of the real rate of return

on I-month bills could be explained by inflation.    We will now consider how

much of the variance of the real return on bills could have been diversified

away by using commodity futures contracts.

    Column 5 in Table 3 presents the year-by-year annual rate of return one
would have earned on a well-diversified portfolio of commodity futures

contracts over the 1953-78 period. 8 The rate of return on a futures
contract was measured as the proportional change in the futures price

over the holding period.   The series was generated by assuming a buy-and-hold
strategy whereby contracts were entered into at quarterly intervals, held

for three months, and then liquidated.   The number of commodities increases

from 13 in 1953 to 22 by the end of the period.   Table 5 presents the

list of commodities and the year in which each was added to the portfolio.

The portfolio was assumed to consist of equal dollar amounts invested in
each commodity.

    The rates of return for commodity futures listed in Column 5 of

Table 3 must be interpreted somewhat differently from the real rates in

columns 1 through 4.   When an investor takes a long position in a futures
contract, he does not buy it in the sense that he would buy a stock, a Qond,

or the physical commodity itself.   Rather, he agrees to purchase the

commodity for a specified price at a certain point in the future.     The
commodities exchange, which acts as an intermediary, requires all parties
to a futures contract to post bond which is called "margin," to guarantee

performance.   But investors are permitted to post Treasury Bills, on

which they continue to earn the interest, so the funds used as margin are

therefore not strictly speaking an investment in commodity futures.

The rate of return reported in column 5 should, therefore, be interpreted

as the addition to an investor's total investment portfolio rate of

return which he would have earned in each year had he taken a position

in commodity futures equal to the value of his total investments in other

assets.   Alternatively, it can be interpreted as the additional r~te of return

one would have earned on the Treasury Bills posted as margin, assuming the

amount posted was equal to 100% of the face value of the contracts.

     Our principal interest in commodity futures contracts is to determine

whether they can be used to reduce the variance of the real return on
l-mon~'    ~-Bills.   Their effectiveness for this purpose is determined by the

degree of correlation between their rate of return and the real return on
           9
T-Bills.       Indeed, the square of the correlation coefficient measures
the proportional reduction in the variance of the real rate of return on

T-Bills attainable by combining them with the variance-minimizing proportion
of commodity futures contracts.      This optimal proportion is equal to

the negative of the correlation coefficient multiplied by the ratio         of

the standard deviation of the real return on T-Bills to the standard
deviation of the rate of return on commodity futures.        Using the parameters

estimated over the entire 26 year period 1953-78 and reported in Tafules 3

and 4, we find a correlation coefficient of -.417 and standard deviations

of 1.41% and 16.34% respectively.      The variance-minimizing proportion

o~   T-Bills was therefore 3.6%, and the proportional reduction in variance
17.4%.     This implies that the standard deviation of the real return on the

resulting minimum-variance portfolio is 1.28% vs 1.41% on I-month T-Bills.

The mean real rate of return on the minimum-variance portfolio is 0.63%

per year vs 0.41% on I-month T-Bills.

Thus by adding a small position (3.6%) in commodity futures to I-month

T-Billsone could have attained both a smaller standard deviation and

a higher mean during the 1953-1978 period.
       It would seem that T-Bills hedged against unanticipated inflation with

commodity futures offers a relatively stable real rate of return.        But even

the hedged T-Bills had a disappointingly low mean real rate of return of

-0~98% per year in the 1973-78 subperiod.         While this is considerably

better than the -1.62% on unhedged T-Bills, it is still low.

Some improvement in yield can be obtained by investing in other money-market

instruments such as corporate commercial paper and negotiable certificates of
deposit 7 and in long-term floating-rate notes and bonds whose interest rates
are tied to short-term rates.    These debt instruments are only slightly

riskier than T-Bills, and institutional investors such as insurance
companies have traditionally been willing to assume that extra risk.

Over the past ten years the average yield spread between gO-day
commercial paper and T-Bills has been about 1% per year although

recently the spread has been narrowing.

      Were life insurance companies to offer PPA's to the public, the most

 natural use for the funds raised would      probab~y.   be to make long-term floating-
 rate loans to their traditional borrowers.       As is the case with the
 floating-rate notes recently issued by financial institutions, the

 interest rate could be set at some premium above the 6-month Treasury
 Bill rate.   If, as in the past, the Treasury Bill rate were to more
 or less match the concurrent rate of inflation, the premium would
 represent the real interest rate on the loan.       Under these circumstances
 even after expenses PPA's might well be expected to earn at least a

 zero real rate of return.

         A question which should be addressed in the case of stock

  insurance companies (as opposed to mutual companies) is who should bear
  the risk associated with possible deviations of the real rate of return

 from the assumed rate - the insurance company or the policyholders?          The

risk could eas'ily De passed tIil'ough_ to policyholders oy offering PPA' s

as variaole annuities 1 similar in design to     eqt1ity~based   VA "s.
but based on a portfolio consisting primarily of         money~market
                                    - 23 -

instruments and long;term floating rate debt instead of common stocks •
.On the other hand, one of the traditional fmctions of stock life

insurance companies has been to transfer risk from the policyholders
to the shareholders.    As long as PPA's are fairly priced, these companies

should be willing to offer them with a purchasing power guarantee
and bear the residual investment risk themselves.

IV. PPA's and Corporate Defined - Benefit Pension Plans.
     We have been considering the possibility of life insurance   c~mpanies

offering PPA's to the public as discretionary annuities, but in the U.S.
most private retirement income is provided by defined-benefit pension plans.
Many of these plans already offer a kind of de facto purchasing:-power

guarantee to their employees through a benefit formula which bases the

monthly retirement payment on the employee's wage just prior to retirement.
Since wages and consumer prices are highly correlated in the long run,
workers covered by such plans can at least count on purchasing-power
protection of pension benefits during the pre-retirement years.

     But very few pension plans offer a cost-of-living escalator during
the retirement phase.   In recent years some corporations, under pressure
from labor'unions, have made one-time increases in pensions being paid to
retired employees, and if inflation persists at.anything like its current
rate it seems likely that union pressure in this direction will increase.
The analysis presented in this paper suggests that corporate pension plans
could meet these union demands by offering a PPA option to their employees
at retirement.   Employees could be offered a choice between a conventional
money-fixed annuity or a PPA, both of which would cost the employer the same
amount of money to fund.

 V•. SUMMARY AND CONCLUDING COMMENTS

      One need not subscribe to the entire proposal presented in this

paper in order to endorse parts of it.        In this last section we will

summarize the proposal, highlighting the separability of its components.

      1.    It would be desirable for financial intermediaries to offer

      households a contractual retirement savings plan where both the

      nominal premiums paid in and the dollar value of the annuity
      benefits received were scheduled to increase at the rate of in-

      flation expected to prevail over the duration of the plan.

      During the accumulation period, it      would~e   relatively easy
      to adjust the premiums to the actual rate of inflation experienced.

      During the benefit phase, it would be especially desirable to

      have an annuity whose dollar value was. qdjusted at leastapproxi'"
      mately in accordance with the actual rate of inflation experienced.

      2.    Be cause there are no se curities in the U. S. capi tal markets

      which offer a riskless real rate of return, PPA's might best be
      offered as variable annuities with most of the investment risk

      passed through to the policyholders.        This risk could be minimized

      by using money-market instruments hedged against unanticipated inflation with
      a small amount of commodity futures contracts as the asset base.        The mean

      real rate of return on such a portfolio over the past 26 years has

     been about zero, suggesting that if stock insurance compan1es

     were to underwrite PPA's, the real earnings rate which they would
     use in pricing their policies would be at most zero.

     3.    In response to the growing demand by labor unions to include a

     cost~of~living escalator in defined-benefit pension plans, employers

    could offer employees a PPA option which costs them the same as a
    conventional annuity.

    The calculation was made according to the following explanation given
    in TlAA-CREF (15).

Using current mortality rates for male and female annuitants, the
actuaries estimate that for a husband and wife both aged 65 there
must be $164 on hand earning 4% a year (after expense charges) to
pay them $1 monthly under the Joint and 2/3 to Survivor option.*
The Annuity Factor then is 164 for this method of payment to a
couple aged 65. Dividing the annuity owners accumulated retirement
fund by 164 gives the amount of monthly income payable to the couple
as a Joint and 2/3 to Survivor annuity. Or, stated another way, each
$16,400 of accumulated value would provide this couple an initial
income of $100 a month.
To illustrate the conversion of accumulation units to annuity units,
suppose that on April 1, 1978 you and your spouse were age 65 and
began receiving a CREF monthly income under the Joint and 2/3 to Sur-
vivor option mentioned previously.
a.     Assume that on April 1 the total value of your accumulation units
       was $50,000.
b.     The value of your accumulation units would have been divided by the
       Annuity Factor of 164 to determine the initial amount of monthly
       income payable under the option selected
       $50,000   ~   164 = $304.88 monthly.
c.     To determine the number of annuity units that would be used
       each month to measure the changing value of your share in
       CREF's experience, the $304.88 would then have been divided by
       the current value of the annuity unit ($23.28 as of April 1, 1978).
                                                     -   ":;0   -




Thus your accumulation units would have been converted into a series of
13.096 annuity units payable each month as long as both you and your
spouse live, and a series of 8.731 annuity units -- 2/3 of 13.096 --
payable to the survivor each month for life following the death of either
you or your spouse with payments in any event guaranteed to continue for
a minimum of ten years. The monthly income of $304.88 (13.096 X $23.28)
would continue until the next yearly revaluation of the annuity unit, at
which time your monthly income for the succedding year would be determined
by multiplying your 13.096 annuity units by the new annuity unit value.
The amount of your check would thus change on May 1 each year.


*This option pays a life time income to husband and wife, with the amount
reducing by a third at the death of either. If both die within the first
ten years of payments, the two-thirds benefit continues to their named
beneficiary for the balance of the ten-year period.

    Proof:     Let    sp     be the variance of the real rate of return on an investment
in T-Bills hedged with commodity futures contracts, and let x be the ratio
of the face value of the position in futures to the investment inT-Bills.
Then:
                2          2 2                   2
               SP    = x    Sc   + 2xs CT + sT


where        s~ is the variance of the rate of return on commodity futures, s~ the
variance of the real rate of return on T-Bills, and sCT the covariance between
them. The variance minimizing ratio, x*, is found by setting the derivative of
s2 with respect to x equal to zero:
p


                                    + 2s
                                           CT
                                                 = o

                                            x*   = _ Scr
                                                         2
                                                     s
                                                         C
                                   - 27 -




Substituting this value for x back into the expression for s~ we find that the
resulting minimized variance is:
                    2
               = - Scr
                   -- +
                   s2
                    C
The proportional reduction in the variance of the real rate of return on the
T-Bills is therefore:
           2    2           2
          s - s           s
           T    min =       CT
             s2         2     2
              T        s s
                        C T
which is the square of the correlation coefficient between the real rate of
return on T-Bills and the rate of return on commodity futures.
