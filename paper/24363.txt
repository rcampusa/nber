We combine survey and administrative data for about 13,000 New Zealand firms from 2005 to

lower intangible investment. Examining firm performance, we find that higher investment is
associated with higher labour and capital input, higher revenue, and higher firm-reported
employee and customer satisfaction, but not with higher productivity or profitability. The

objectives, but not with productivity or profitability.

Intangible Investment and Firm Performance
Abstract

We combine survey and administrative data for about 13,000 New Zealand firms from 2005 to

2013 to study intangible investment and firm performance. We find that firm size and moderate

competition is associated with higher intangible investment, while firm age is associated with

lower intangible investment. Examining firm performance, we find that higher investment is

associated with higher labour and capital input, higher revenue, and higher firm-reported

employee and customer satisfaction, but not with higher productivity or profitability. The

evidence suggests that intangible investment is associated with growth and ‘soft’ performance

objectives, but not with productivity or profitability.



1        Introduction
Throughout his career, F. M. Scherer was interested in the determinants of firm performance,

including how strategy and investment decisions -- particularly related to technology and

innovation -- contributed to performance. The possible importance of management and R&D in

productivity is an aspect of a broader developing realization of the importance of intangible

investment in firm performance (Corrado et al., 2009; Corrado et al., 2012; Bontempi and

Mairesse, 2015).

      We can think of firms as having stocks of intangible capital of various kinds, in the form of:

knowledge about production possibilities; practices and procedures; strategies; organizational

structures; etc. Intangible investment increases these stocks, just as traditional investment

increases traditional capital such as machines and structures. And an increase in intangible

capital should increase firm output and the productivity of labour, in a manner that is analogous

to that resulting from increases in tangible capital.

      If we could measure the stocks of intangible capital, we could include them in estimating

production functions for firms, and estimate their effect on output and their rates of return. But
if we don’t include them in the production function, then their impact on output flows through

to the “residual” or the productivity of the firm. This means that, in principle, observed

differences in productivity could be due to underlying differences in the extent of intangible

investment. Similarly, since we would expect firms to earn a return on their intangible

investment, the profitability of the firm—measured in the traditional manner as profits relative

to the value of traditional capital—should be increased by intangible investment.

          An alternative view could be that firms engage in intangible investment (e.g. employee

training, organizational restructuring, new product designs) in response to perceived weakness

or threats to the business. While this possibility is not inconsistent with such investment’s

having a productivity and profitability payoff, it suggests that observed investment might be

concentrated in poorly performing firms and perhaps is thereby obscuring an underlying

positive causal effect of intangible investment on productivity. 1

          In this paper, we try to untangle the relationships among intangible investment, firm

characteristics and environment, and firm performance, with the use of New Zealand firm-level

survey data on intangible investment that is linked to administrative and tax records of firm

performance and characteristics. We examine both the characteristics of firms that are

associated with intangible investment, and what firm performance looks like subsequent to

such investment.

          To preview our findings: The results suggest that -- when we compare firms within a

narrowly defined industry -- intangible investment is highest in larger firms, younger firms, and

firms that face moderate competition in the marketplace. Contrary to the prediction from the

simple version of the investment story, we find no evidence that higher intangible investment is

associated with higher productivity or higher profitability. Subsequent to reporting intangible


1   By analogy, the building fires to which the most fire engines are sent are also the ones in which the largest amount

of property damage occurs. It is likely that, holding constant the initial intensity of the fire, sending more engines

reduces the amount of damage. But that relationship is obscured by the ‘reverse causality’ running from fire damage

to number of engines.

investment, firms appear to increase spending on both capital and labour, and they report an

increase in deflated revenue; but the rates of increase of inputs and outputs are such that

measured productivity and profitability do not increase. Consistent with this “growth without

profit” picture, we find some evidence that intangible investment is associated with subsequent

improvement in ‘soft’ aspects of firm performance such as firm-reported customer and

employee satisfaction.

      Because all of our variables are determined jointly by the decisions of the firm, it is very

difficult to draw causal inferences with regard to the empirical associations we have found.

Nonetheless, we have sliced the data many different ways and found little evidence of intangible

investment’s contributing positively to productivity in New Zealand. Further, we find no

evidence that firms that invest in intangibles are underperformers before undertaking the

investment, so it appears unlikely that a positive investment effect is being concealed by a

negative selection effect. Thus it appears that low intangible investment is a not a likely

candidate for a large contribution to New Zealand’s relatively poor productivity performance.

      Instead, such investment appears to be associated with firm growth, and possibly

improvement in firm performance along dimensions that are not captured by productivity

statistics. The results do not allow us to say whether intangible investment causes firm growth,

in the sense of being a choice available to any firm that wants to grow faster. But it is clearly

associated with growth, which suggests that in at least some situations it is a necessary factor

for growth.



2        Literature
Much of the previous literature on intangibles and firm performance focuses specifically on

research and development (R&D). F. M. Scherer was a pioneer of this literature. Scherer (1982)

is one of the earliest studies to document the empirical linkage between expenditure on R&D

and productivity growth. Similarly, Scherer (1983) looks at the contribution of firm R&D to

innovation, as represented by patents. A major theme of Scherer’s work has been the


                                                                                                     3
application of the Schumpeterian perspective to empirical analyses of innovation and firm

performance (Scherer, 1986). Its key insight is that innovation is the result of firms’

investments, which are in turn driven by the forces of competition, resulting in a process of

creative destruction whereby innovators’ success simultaneously erodes the market power of

previous incumbents and induces the next round of competitors.

      Griliches (1979) highlights the difficulties -- both conceptual and empirical -- in studying

the impact of R&D on productivity growth, while Pakes and Griliches (1984) model the flow of

intangible R&D investment into innovation output as measured by patents; they find that their

knowledge production function explains much of the between-firm variation in knowledge but

little of the within-firm changes over time. Crepon et al. (1998) develop a framework for

analysing the determinants of R&D, how R&D contributes to innovation, and finally how

innovation contributes to productivity. Their empirical results are consistent with the typical

stylised facts: R&D increases with firm size, market share, and diversification; innovation output

increases with research effort and demand-pull and technology indicators; and firm

productivity increases with innovation output, even after controlling for the skill composition of

labour.

      More recently, researchers have begun to look at intangible investment more broadly, as

R&D is only one facet of intangible investment and is more relevant in some industries than

others. Corrado et al. (2005) argue that intangible investment should be treated equivalently to

tangible investment; it delays current production in order to increase future production. They

group intangible capital into three broad categories that have gained traction in the literature:

computerised information (primarily software and databases); innovative property (primarily

R&D); and economic competencies (firm-specific resources, including trained employees, brand

names, etc.). While caveating their imperfect data, they estimate that intangible expenditure

made up around 13 percent of GDP in the US in the late 1990s, and conclude that the only

reason for not incorporating intangibles into the productivity framework should be a lack of




4
data. They end with the hope that statistical agencies will work towards the development of

accurate intangible measures.

      Corrado et al. (2009) build on their 2005 paper by incorporating intangibles into growth

accounting, and find that output per hour in the non-farm business sector is 10–20 percent

higher when intangibles are measured. Relatedly, Elnasri and Fox (2015) examine the presence

and trends of intangibles in the Australian economy; they find that the ratio of intangible to

tangible investment increased from around 0.24 in 1974–75 to 0.36 in 2012–13.

      These studies examine intangible investment at the macro level. Limited recent work has

analysed intangibles at the firm level, though firm-level analysis is needed to uncover the

determinants and consequences of intangible investment. Crass and Peters (2014) believe that

many of the within-industry differences in productivity can be explained by differences in

intangible investment. Using survey data on German manufacturing and services firms, they find

positive associations between firm productivity and their three measures of intangibles:

innovative capital, human capital, and branding capital. Bontempi and Mairesse (2015) use

Italian firm-level data and find an output elasticity of overall intangible capital of 0.03–0.07.

Furthermore, their data allow them to measure intangible expenditure as an investment, and

they argue that accounting standards that treat intangibles as costs tend to underestimate the

true impact of intangibles on productivity.

      Relatedly, Lin and Lo (2015) use data on a panel of Taiwanese manufacturing firms and

their expenditures on intangibles as measured by: the acquisition of technology; purchasing of

software and databases; marketing; employee training; and R&D. They present evidence of a

positive impact of intangible investment on productivity, with an overall output elasticity of

around 0.07. Finally, Montresor and Vezzani (2016) investigate the links between intangible

investment and innovation by examining a cross-section of European firms that appear in a

2013 multi-country survey. They conclude that developing intangibles internally rather than

externally is conducive to innovation; that the amount invested is important for firms in

manufacturing but not in services; and that investing in ‘technological’ intangibles (R&D,


                                                                                                    5
software and design) fosters innovation more than investing in non-technological intangibles

(training, reputation/ branding, and organisational/business processes).

      A final strand of literature focuses on whether resources flow freely to firms that will use

these resources productively. Balasubramanian and Sivadasan (2011) look at U.S. firms and find

that increases in a firm’s patent stock is strongly associated with increases in size, while weaker

evidence also suggests that patenting is associated with an increase in the number of new

products, capital intensity, skill intensity and productivity. Similarly, Andrews et al. (2014)

examine firms across 23 OECD countries from 2003–2010 and find that within-firm increases in

patenting lead to increases in employment, capital, turnover, and value added. They also use

patent litigation data to construct an instrumental variable for the patent stock, and suggest that

the increase in real economic activity from patenting is causal. More broadly, Andrews and de

Serres (2012) emphasise the importance of reallocating labour and capital to intangibles-

investing firms, as such investment flourishes when supported by standard tangible investment.

They conclude that some countries are more successful at channelling resources to their most

productive use, and suggest future research should analyse which policies are conducive to

targeting resources to intangibles-investing firms.

      Our study adds to this literature by examining the links between broad intangible

investment and activity across all industries in New Zealand. The use of numerous indicators

allows us to consider the numerous types of intangible investment -- including R&D, employee

training, and organisational restructuring -- while the rich firm-level data allow us to describe in

detail the characteristics of firms that invest in intangibles, and what happens to them

subsequently.



3        Data
3.1      Description of data and key variables
We use data from Statistics New Zealand’s Longitudinal Business Database (LBD): a firm-level

longitudinal dataset that contains administrative and survey data. Within the LBD, our main



6
sample consists of firms that appear in at least one innovation module of the Business

Operations Survey (BOS). The BOS is an annual survey of business performance and activities

that is explicitly designed for longitudinal analysis (Fabling & Sanderson, 2016); however, our

key intangible measures come from the innovation module, which appears every second year

(2005, 2007, 2009, 2011 and 2013). For firms that make at least one appearance in the

innovation module, we then link administrative data from the given and additional years to

create an unbalanced panel of firms that covers odd years in the period 2005–2013. This broad

sample contains 12,603 firms and 52,983 firm-years, with the average firm’s appearing 4.2

times.

       The following question contains our main measure of intangible investment: 2

    During the last 2 financial years, did this business do any of the following? (Mark

    whether done to support innovation; 3 done though not to support innovation; not applicable;

    or don’t know)

       • Acquisition of computer hardware and software

       • Implementing new business strategies or management techniques

       • Organisational restructuring

       • Design (e.g. industrial, graphic or fashion design)

       • Market research

       • Significant changes to marketing strategies

       • Employee training

       • Any research and development in the previous year 4




2 The batch of questions also asks about acquiring of machinery and equipment; acquiring of other knowledge (e.g.,
licenses, patents, or other intellectual property); and marketing the introduction of new goods or services. We
exclude the first as it is a measure of tangible investment, and exclude the latter two as firms may see them as
innovation-output indicators, rather than measures of intangible investment.
3 In 2005 the question only asks whether the activities were done to support innovation, meaning there is a

systematic difference in our intangible measures between 2005 and the other years. Including year fixed effects in
our later regression analysis helps to deal with this issue.
4 This question comes from the main ‘business operations’ module, and so asks whether R&D occurred in the

previous year rather than in the previous two years. The question does not ask whether it is done to support
innovation, though presumably fostering innovation is an inherent goal of R&D.

                                                                                                                     7
From these indicators, our main measure of firm-level intangible investment is a simple
intangibles index, which ranges in value from zero to one and is defined as:

                                                             𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛. 𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
                      𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 =
                                                            𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛. 𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖


       Hence we give equal weight to each intangible indicator, lacking strong theory on the

different contributions of different types of intangible investment. Scaling by the number of

non-missing intangible indicators ensures we don’t infer that a firm has low intangible

investment simply because it failed to answer a question, though we set the index to missing

when a firm is missing four or more of the eight indicators. 5 As an alternative, we perform

principal component analysis on these eight indicators. Principal components analysis is a data-

driven method for taking a large number of variables that are believed to capture overlapping

aspects of the same phenomena, and reducing them to a smaller number of variables that

capture most of the information present in the larger variable set. This reduces the eight

responses to two constructed ‘component’ variables designed to capture the patterns of the

eight original metrics. The correlation matrix of the intangibles indicators is presented in

Appendix Table 1, while the weights of each indicator for the two components are shown in

Appendix Table 2. 6

       A separate measure of intangible investment comes from the following question on

intangibles-related expenditure 7:

For the last financial year, please estimate this business’s combined expenditure on (the

following) product development and related activities:

       • Research and development

       • Design



5 We assume the information in these answers is too messy and better dropped. This sets 12% of index values to be
missing, though the majority (72%) of these changes come from the 2005 BOS, where non-innovating firms were
steered away from the question on intangible investments.
6 In practice we only use the primary principal component, but present details on the second component for

completion. In addition we use tetrachoric correlations between the underlying indicators, which estimate the
correlation between two indicator variables, assuming that some normally-distributed latent variable underlies
them.
7 This question was not asked in 2005; our expenditure measures are missing for this year.




8
         • Marketing and market research (for product development)

         • Other expenditure related to product development (e.g. prototyping, trials,

                 commercialisation)

         In parts of our analysis we use these questions as another measure of a firm’s intangible

investment, either by summing the total expenditure on these activities, or by using a dummy

variable for whether a firm reports any expenditure.

          In our analysis of firm-reported customer and employee satisfaction, we use the following

questions from the main ‘business operations’ module: 8

Is this business lower than competitors; on a par with competitors; higher than

competitors; or don’t know for the each of the following?

         • Costs

         • Time taken to provide customers with goods or services

         • Quality

         • Flexibility or ability to make changes

         • Customer satisfaction

         • Employee satisfaction



         We use the answers for customer and employee satisfaction as indicators of some kind of

firm ‘success.” We use the other answers to try to control for a generic tendency of the

questionnaire respondent towards self-congratulation or overconfidence regarding the firm’s

overall quality or performance. We construct a simple ‘confidence’ index as the average

reported category for questions on relative costs; relative time to provide goods and services;

relative quality of goods and services; and relative flexibility. We assign the number 1 to “lower”

answers, 2 to “on par” answers, and 3 to “higher than” answers. Hence the confidence index

takes on values between 1 and 3, where a value of 3 corresponds to answering “higher than” on

all of our control questions.


8   The question is slightly rephrased for clarity, but the substance and key words are unchanged.

                                                                                                     9
          We combine these self-reported answers with administrative data from the LBD that

show other firm characteristics and allow us to compute measures of firm performance. Firm

size in a given year is measured by average monthly full-time equivalent (FTE) labour, using the

FTE measure that was created by Fabling and Maré (2015b). Firm age is derived from the birth

date of the firm, while a firm’s time-invariant industry comes from Australian and New Zealand

Standard Industrial Classification (ANZSIC) 2006 codes. At the broadest level there are 19

industry divisions, as listed in Appendix Table 3, though for much of our analysis we use the

more detailed level 3 ANZSIC 2006 codes, which divide firms into 203 disaggregated industries.

          Finally, productivity data comes from the work of Fabling and Maré (2015a). Their

created dataset includes measures of gross output (deflated revenue); capital (deflated flow of

capital services in a year); labour (using their adjusted FTE measure); and deflated intermediate

consumption. These measures allow us to examine what happens to firms’ inputs and outputs

after investing in intangibles, and also allow us to measure labour productivity as the ratio of

value added to labour input. We also measure profitability as profit (value added minus total

wages) per unit of capital. Finally, multi-factor productivity (MFP) is measured by the residuals

in the Fabling and Maré (2015a) dataset, which come from translog gross-output production

function regressions that are run separately for 52 industries. Hence these MFP measures are

derived from the entire population of firms with available production data, and not only our

sample of firms. This gives a more accurate picture of a firm’s productivity relative to the

industry average. 9

          Our sample size decreases in analysis that require these productivity data, from 12,603

firms that provide 52,983 observations to 9,756 firms that provide 28,236 observations. Partly

this is because certain firms don’t meet the criteria or have implausible variation in

inputs/outputs (see Fabling and Maré 2015a for details). Also, productivity data are not yet

available for the 2013 March-year, which causes the loss of 9,936 observations.




9   We also use the alternate firm identifiers developed in Fabling (2011) to fix broken firm identifiers.

3.2       Descriptive Statistics
      Table 1 shows the proportion of firm-year observations that report engaging in various

intangible activities, across the entire period. At the high end, over 70 percent of firm-years

report acquiring computer-ware and training employees, while the least common activities are

significant changes to marketing strategies (22 percent), design (20 percent), and R&D (12

percent).

      To provide more detail, Figure 1 presents, separately for each level 1 industry, the

proportion of firm-years engaging in each of the eight intangible activities. The figure shows

many similarities across industries. For example, in each industry the percentage of firm-years

investing in employee training is greater than 70 percent, while the percentage reporting R&D is

less than 30 percent. The differences that do exist are expected, and lend credibility to the

intangible indicators as capturing real activities. Professional services firms have a relatively

high likelihood of investment in all forms of intangibles, and agriculture firms relatively low.

                                                                                                            11
Manufacturing is the only industry with more than 20 percent of firms reporting R&D; the

percentage doing restructuring is 10–20 percentage points lower in agriculture and mining than

in most other industries; and investment in computer-ware is most prevalent in information

media, administration/support services and public administration.

        Table 2 summarises the transitions into and out of intangible investment for firm-years in

our sample. For a firm that was also in the innovation module two years previously, we report

whether it adopted an intangible activity; dropped an intangible activity; or has the same status

as last time (either doing the activity in both periods, or in neither period). There is some

evidence of dynamism here: For most intangible indicators, between nine and 17 percent of

firm-years report picking up an activity in which they were not engaged two years ago, with

similar but slightly higher proportions for dropping an activity.

 NZ confidentiality rules.


      Table 3 summarises the distribution of the non-binary intangible measures, where the

intangibles index is constructed from the eight dummy variables as described in Section 3.1. The

intangibles index distribution is fairly symmetric, with the mean close to the median. The

median value of 0.375 corresponds to engaging in three intangible activities for a firm with no

missing dummy variables (0.375 * 8 = 3). It is striking that, in contrast, the majority of firms do

not report spending any money on the categories for product development and related

activities: The median value of total intangible expenditure, and hence all the component

categories, is $0. Even the 90th percentile value is fairly low, with a value of $150,200 for total

intangible expenditure and between $3,000 and $20,000 for the component categories, though

these values steeply increase when we observe the 95th percentile value.

      How do we reconcile the fact that most firms say they engage in these activities, and yet a

majority do not report any expenditure? One explanation is that firms may falsely report

engaging in broadly defined activities that are viewed positively (e.g. employee training or



                                                                                                            13
  market research), but tell the truth when it comes to the specifics of how much was spent.

  Alternatively, a firm may well know that it had activities that fit a given intangible definition, but

  not track expenditures that are connected to those activities. Hence in our analysis we focus on

  the broad intangible indicators and the construced intangibles index, but use reported

  expenditure in robustness tests as an alternative measure of intangible investment.

            Figure 2 plots the average and one-standard-deviation spread of the intangibles index

  across all firm-years in the data, separately for each level 1 industry. The results show plausible

  variation in intangible investment across industries; firms in ‘information media’,

  ‘manufacturing’, or ‘professional, technical and scientific services’ have an average index value

  of over 0.4, which corresponds to just over three out of eight activities when all questions are

  answered. In contrast, the average index for firms in ‘agriculture’ or ‘mining’ is around 0.3,

  which corresponds to around two of the eight activities. The bands show all values that fall

  within one standard deviation of the mean for each industry, and show substantial variation in




  14
intangible investment for each industry. Indeed, a firm that is one standard deviation above the

mean for the lowest average industry (agriculture) participates in more intangible investment

categories than the average firm in the highest average industry (information media). Appendix

Figure 1 plots the average principal component and one-standard-deviation bands by industry,

and reveals a similar pattern.

      A particular concern with the intangibles survey questions might be that with respect to

any question of the form “did your firm do any of this activity”, larger firms are more likely to

answer yes because the chances of any activity occuring somewhere in the firm are higher for a

larger firm. To explore this issue, Appendix Table 4 presents a regression of firms’ intangible

investment on past firm size and industry dummies. The differences across industries remain.

Together with Figure 1, these show that the BOS intangibles data are consistent with broad

pre-existing notions of where such activity is likely. However, the large standard deviation

bands show that the variation in firms’ index values within an industry dominates the variation

across industries.

       Figure 3 explores the variation in the intangibles index within firms. It shows the

cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the ratio of each firm’s minimum intangibles index to

its average intangibles index, in panel A, and the ratio of the maximum intangibles index to the

average, in panel B. The CDF shows the proportion of firms that take a given value or lower,

with the proportion ranging from 0–1 on the vertical axis. For example, panel A shows that only

about half of the firms experience a year in which the index is less than 60% of its average value

for that firm. Approximately 90 percent of firms experience a year in which the index is 90% of

its average value or lower. Panel B shows that for about a quarter of the firms, the maximum

value that is experienced by that firm is no more than 20% greater than the average, while

about 85 percent of firms have a maximum ratio of 2 or less. 10

       We interpret Figure 3 as showing a plausible degree of variation. We see neither a large

number of firms with no variation over time, nor a large number with dramatic variations from

year to year.

4.1        Explaining intangible investment
Our first set of regressions describe the characteristics of firms that invest in intangibles. 11 We

estimate the following reduced-form model:

                                  𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 = 𝛽𝛽0 + 𝛽𝛽1 𝑋𝑋𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗−1 + 𝜌𝜌𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 + 𝜀𝜀𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 ,      (1)


where j denotes firm, k denotes industry, and t denotes year. 𝑋𝑋𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗−1 is a vector of last-period

firm characteristics, which include: FTE; self-reported competition; age; and output growth

relative to the industry average. The 𝜌𝜌𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 represent a complete set of year-industry interacted

fixed effects, which thus allow each industry to have its own average investment rate and its




10 The large ratio values of three and above in panel B are driven by firms with very low average index values, which
blow up the proportion when used as the denominator.

thus examine within-firm variation in the covariates and how this translates to subsequent

intangible investment.

          Note that our industry classification is considerably disaggregated, using level 3 ANZSIC

2006 codes, which divide firms into 203 industries. Firm characteristics are lagged because of

the nature of our intangible measures: As was detailed in Section 3.1, firms report intangible

activity over the past two years (or one year for the R&D indicator and expenditure measures),

and we do not want to explain past intangible investment using current firm characteristics. We

cluster standard errors at the firm level to account for within-firm correlations of the error term

over time.

          Table 4 presents ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions 12, where the intangibles

measure is a firm’s intangibles index in columns (1) to (3) and an indicator for the firm

reporting any intangible expenditure in columns (4) to (6). In columns with age-category

dummy variables, the omitted age category is between six and ten years old, and so all age-

category coefficients are interpreted relative to this baseline. Similarly, the omitted category for

self-reported competition is many competitors, some dominant, so competition coefficients are

interpreted relative to this monopolistic-competition baseline.

          Column (1) shows our baseline specification, and indicates that firm size is associated

with a small but statistically significant increase in the intangibles index. The coefficient of 0.057

implies that a doubling of firm size is associated with an increase of just under half an intangible

investment activity for firms with no missing intangible indicators. We also see that younger

firms tend to invest more; for example, the intangibles index is 0.029 greater for firms that are

aged less than two years relative to firms that are aged 6–10 years.

          There is also evidence of some relationship between intangibles and competition,

reminiscent of findings of such a relationship between innovation and competition (e.g. Aghion


12   Average marginal effects are very similar when estimating fractional logit models in columns (1)-(2) and logit

models in columns (4)-(6). We show OLS results because of the ease of interpretation and because the estimator is

tractable enough to include industry-year interactions.




18
et al., 2002). In particular, the estimates indicate that firms that perceive themselves to be

operating in a ‘captive market’ engage in just under half an intangible investment less than firms

with ‘many competitors, some dominant.’ But there is some evidence of an inverted U-shaped

relationship, with intangible investment decreasing slightly for firms reporting the highest

perceived competition, relative to the intermediate, baseline group.

      Column (2) keeps the same controls but includes a firm’s output growth four to two years

ago relative to its industry average, in decimal form. This investigates whether firms that invest

in intangibles are building on success or, alternatively, responding to perceived weakness in

competitive performance. The coefficient estimate of 0.020 is positive and statistically

significant, but is economically insignificant: A firm whose recent growth exceeded the industry

average by 10 percentage points would be predicted to have an increase in the intangibles index

of about .002 (0.1x.02). This indicates that intangibles-investing firms were neither thriving nor

struggling prior to investment, but rather had similar momentum to other firms in their

industry.

      Column (3) includes firm fixed effects, so that only within-firm variation in the other

explanatory variables explains intangible investment. We control for the log of age instead of

age-category dummies, because few firms make the discrete jump from one category to the

other, and we would not expect large effects from crossing the thresholds.

      Unsurprisingly, the results become much noisier, with most estimates losing statistical

significance. This means that the results in Column (1) with regard to (for example) firm age are

not driven by the firms in the sample decreasing their investment as they age. Rather, the

results are driven by the cross-sectional variation: a tendency for younger (or larger) sample

firms to be bigger investors, all else equal, than the older (or smaller) ones. The diminished but

still positive relationship between intangible investment and firm size means that in addition to

the cross-sectional relationship, there is some tendency for firms’ investment to

increase/decrease as they grow/shrink over the sample period; however, this result is not

statistically significant.


                                                                                                 19
      Columns (4) to (6) of Table 4 mirror the first three columns, but replace the dependent

variable with an indicator for reporting any intangible expenditure. A similar picture emerges.

In column (4) we see that intangible investment is associated positively with firm size and

negatively with age, though these estimates are statistically insignificant. In terms of

competition we again see a negative effect of ‘captive market’ and a smaller negative effect of

‘many competitors, none dominant’, in both cases relative to the intermediate ‘many

competitors, some dominant’. Column (5) shows that firms that report any intangible

expenditure experienced similar output growth to the industry average, holding all else

constant; a firm whose recent growth exceeded the industry average by 10 percentage points

would be expected to have an economically tiny 0.25 percentage point higher chance of

reporting any intangible expenditure (exp(0.1x0.025)-1).

      The firm-fixed-effects results in column (6) show point estimates that are small in

magnitude and statistically insignificant. The relatively large standard errors cloud any lessons

that can be learnt from this specification.

      Finally, we note that we have included in all of these regressions a dummy variable for

those firms that responded “don’t know” to the competition question, and this group shows

generally lower intangible investment, all else equal. We suspect that this reflects that such

firms simply did a poorer job overall in responding to the survey, but there is no way really to

know.

      As further robustness explorations, Appendix Table 6 replicates Table 4 with the principal

component summary of the multiple intangibles questions rather than our constructed index,

and the log of reported expenditure rather than the simple yes/no indicator for expenditure.

The results are qualitatively similar.


4.2      Firm performance and past intangible investment
The next set of regressions address firm performance outcomes after intangible investment,

with versions of the following baseline model run at the firm-year level:




20
         𝑦𝑦𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 = 𝛽𝛽0 + 𝛽𝛽1 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗−1 + 𝛽𝛽2 𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 + 𝛽𝛽3 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 + 𝜌𝜌𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 + 𝜀𝜀𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 ,   (2)


where j denotes firm, k denotes industry, and t denotes year, and 𝑦𝑦𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 is a measure of firm

performance, such as multi-factor productivity, labour productivity, or profitability. As before,

we include a complete set of industry-year interactions. We also include a ‘doesn’t-know’

intangibles index, which is constructed in the same way as our intangibles index but for the

number of ‘don’t know’ answers for a firm. Hence the intangibles index is interpreted relative to

the proportion of indicators not engaged in, holding constant the ‘doesn’t-know’ answers.

      In principle, what should affect performance is the stock of intangible capital. Our

intangibles indicator is more closely related to the flow of intangible investment than to the

stock, although across firms the stocks and flows are typically highly correlated. If productivity

depends on the stock, then the change in productivity from one year to the next is

approximately related to the flow. Given the ambiguity of the meaning of our intangibles

indicator, rather than pick a single form for this relationship, we explore a number of different

variations.

      Clearly the decision to invest in intangibles is endogenous: Firms decide whether and

when to invest. If the factors that affect that decision are correlated with the 𝜀𝜀𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 in Eq. (2), then

our estimates of 𝛽𝛽1 will be biased. While the theoretically possible ways that this might occur are

almost limitless, two are of particular concern in this context: First, there may be unobserved

firm attributes or developments in the firm’s environment that affect both its incentive to invest

in intangibles and its productivity. For example, if the firm hires a new hot-shot manager, she

may increase intangible investment, and she may also directly increase productivity. In that

case, it will appear as if intangible investment is increasing productivity -- even if it doesn’t. This

possibility, if present, leads to an upward bias in the estimate of 𝛽𝛽1 .

 Notes: This table presents the coefficients from OLS regressions at the firm-year level, where the dependent variable is an intangibles measure as described in
 each column header. The omitted category for age is 6–10 years, and the omitted category for competition is ‘many competitors, some dominant’. The sample is
 limited to March-years from 2005 to 2013. Standard errors, in parentheses, are robust and clustered at the firm level. Asterisks denote: *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, *
 p<0.10. The reported numbers of observations have been randomly rounded to the nearest multiple of 3, as required by Statistics NZ confidentiality rules.

        Another concern is ‘reverse causality’: the possibility that productivity (or profitability or

another performance measure) has its own effect on intangible investment. If for, example,

firms are constrained in their ability to generate the cash that is needed for such investment,

then firms with higher productivity—which might well produce higher sales margins—would

be more able to engage in intangible investment because the necessary funds are available. This

would, again, lead to an upward bias in the estimate. Conversely, as mentioned above, if firms

see intangible investment as a way to get themselves out of trouble, then it might be the poor-

performing firms that are more likely to undertake it, which would lead to a downward bias.

        In most analyses of this kind, the primary concern is that there are unobserved factors

that positively affect both the investment and firm performance, which leads to a concern that

the effect of investment is over-estimated. As will be seen, we find -- if anything -- negative

apparent effects of intangible investment on productivity, which led us to worry more about the

possibility of negative reverse causality. However, as we saw above, we find no evidence that

prior firm performance is negatively associated with intangible investment, so we do not think

that this is driving the results. We will return to consideration of these issues in the final

discussion below.


4.2.1      Multifactor productivity 13
        Table 5 presents the first set of estimates. The first four columns are in the form of Eq. (2),

allowing the firm’s MFP to vary with intangible investment, exploring sensitivity to different

measures of intangible investment and different data samples. Column (1) measures intangible

investment with the intangibles index, and shows a negative relationship between the level of

MFP and reported intangible activity two years previous. (Recall that each survey asks about

activity over the previous two years, so this regression estimates the effect on MFP of intangible



13Eq. (2) with MFP as the dependent variable is closely related to a model where the stock of intangible assets is
added as a factor of production in the production function (Griliches, 1979). We adopt the approach of first
constructing MFP as a residual from the production function, and then regressing this residual on the intangible
assets because we have a much larger sample of firms with production data than those for which we have the
intangibles data. Thus the other parameters of the production function (e.g. capital and labour elasticities) can be
estimated very precisely on this large sample, whereas if we estimated the production function only on the smaller
intangibles-data sample the production function would be much less well estimated.

                                                                                                                       23
investment 2–4 years earlier.) An increase in the intangibles index corresponding to one more

intangible investment out of eight is associated with a decrease in MFP of just under one

percentage point (coefficient of about .064 x 1/8). Since productivity differences among firms

are typically on the order of a few percent, this is a meangingfully large effect -- if it is real.

       Column (1) also shows the youngest firms have lower MFP, holding all else constant;

firms aged 2–5 are on average 5.6 percent less productive than firms aged 6–10. The point

estimates for the older age categories are negative, implying older firms are less productive,

though these estimates are statistically insignificant. We also see weak evidence of an advantage

for self-reported monopolists, though the estimate is also statistically insignifcant. While it is

possible that monopolists are truly more productive, if their measured productivity is really

higher it is more likely that monopolists have higher price-cost margins, which increases

revenue (deflated with an industry-based price index) and hence measured productivity (Maré,

2016).

       In column (2) we limit the sample to firms that were in the lower quartile of output in

their level 3 industry in 2004. The motivation is that yes/no survey questions may be less

meaningful for larger firms, because a large firm is intrinsically more likely to have engaged in a

given activity somewhere across the enterprise. Hence limiting the sample to small firms tests

whether focusing on a context where the measures are, arguably, more meaningful shows a

different picture. 14 We see no qualitative change in the results.

       Columns (3) and (4) of Table 5 vary the measure of intangible investment employed.

Column (3) is based on the dichotomous measure of whether any expenditure on intangibles is

reported, and Column (4) the log of intangible expenditure for firms with positive reported

expenditure. Again MFP’s negative association with intangibles remains, though it is not

statistically significant.




14We also ran output-weighted regressions to estimate the association for the average unit of output, rather than the
average firm. The results do not change qualitatively.

       As emphasized by Bontempi and Mairesse (2015), firm productivity should really be

related to the stock of accumulated (though depreciated) intangible investment, rather than to

the investment flow. This formulation is approximately equivalent to the flow’s being related to

the change in firm productivity, and our intangible indicator variable is presumably most closely

related to the flow because it asks about investment in the last 2 years. This approach is

implemented in column (5), with a point estimate that is positive but statistically insignificant

and economically modest; engaging in one more intangible activity is associated with a 0.3

percentage point increase in MFP from two years ago (0.024 x 1/8).

       Finally, the dependent variable in column (6) is an indicator for MFP’s increasing by more

than five percentage points. This is intended to look for the ‘lottery ticket’ view of intangible

investment, whereby for most firms it has no effect but for a small number of (lucky?) firms it

gives a big boost. The point estimate of the intangibles index is statistically significant though

small in magnitude; adding one intangible investment activity is associated with a 0.6

percentage point increase in the likelihood of having a greater than five percent increase in

productivity (0.051 x 1/8 = 0.064). 15 Given that the unconditional probability of an increase of

this magnitude is about 32%, this is a relatively unexciting lottery ticket, which makes it easy to

understand why the mean effect is small and statistically insignificant.

       Given these hints of what looks like a possible effect of the intangible stock on

productivity, we also estimated a crude stock version of the model, in which the total number of

affirmative responses to the investment questions over the time period was related to end-of-

period productivity levels (not reported). The sample in this specification is a balanced panel of

firms that appear in the innovation modules of 2005, 2007, 2009 and 2011. We found a

systematic negative relationship between end-of-period productivity and the accumulated stock

of intangibles. Finally, to probe further whether the negative association between investment

and subsequent productivity levels could be due to some kind of reverse causality, we


15We also ran regressions where the dependent variable is an indicator for a larger than one and a larger than 15
percentage point increase in MFP. Results are similar, with positive but economically small estimates. Average
marginal effects from the logit estimator are also similar.



26
attempted to estimate a firm fixed-effects model (not reported). The results were noisy, with no

statistically significant coefficient estimates, and the point estimate on the lagged intangibles

index was negative (-0.03)

          All of the results in Table 5 include age and competition variables. These are included

mostly as controls, and the results for the intangible variables are not sensitive to whether or

not these controls are included. For age, we find some weak evidence that younger firms (age 2–

5) have lower productivity levels than the base group (age 6–10). 16 When observing

productivity changes, we find, not surprisingly, that the oldest firms are less likely to increase

their productivity. For competition, we find some evidence of higher measured productivity for

firms with captive markets and only 1 or 2 competitors, which is consistent with market

power’s allowing an increase in markups; this appears as higher productivity because our

output measure is revenue.

          Together, the results of Table 5 provide no robust evidence of a meaningful positive link

between our measures of intangible investment and productivity. When modelling the level of

MFP in columns (1) to (4), the point estimates are negative, and in modelling the change in MFP

in columns (5) to (6), the point estimates are positive but small and statistically significant only

for the ‘lottery ticket’ version. We discuss in Section 5 different possible interpretations of these

results.

          While our industry-year interacted effects allow the intercepts of the regression to vary

flexibly, these estimates all constrain each industry to have the same coefficient on the

intangibles measure. To investigate whether this is distorting the underlying relationships,

Figure 4 presents separate coefficient estimates and 95 percent confidence intervals of the

intangibles index for each level 1 industry, using the regression model of column (1) of Table 5.




16   Note that the very youngest firms (< 2years) cannot be included in this regression because we are looking at

productivity as a function of intangible investment 2 years previous.


                                                                                                                    27
        While most of the estimates are statistically insignificant (presumably due to smaller

sample sizes), there is a general tendency towards negative rather than positive coefficients.

Further, there is no meaningful pattern to the positives and negatives, with the negative and

statistically significant coefficients appearing in two high-intangible industries (finance and

arts) and one low-intangible industry (agriculture). Consequently, while this does not give us a

particularly clear picture, it again calls into question any hypothesis of a positive effect of

intangibles on productivity.

4.2.2      Profitability and labour productivity
     Table 6 similarly examines the relationship between firm performance and past intangibles,

but measures firm performance using profitability and labour productivity among large (above

median size) firms.

     Table 7 repeats this for small (below median size) firms, because in each regression Chow

tests strongly reject the null hypothesis of no parameter differences between small and large

firms. In standard economic theory, firms do not care about their productivity, per se, but we



28
assume they are trying to maximize profits. If so, then a (presumably costly) investment activity

will only be undertaken if it yields a reasonable return on that investment. Since the firms’

investments in intangible assets are not included in the measured capital stock of the firm, the

presence of such a return on intangible assets should be reflected in higher profitability

measured relative to the observed capital stock.

      Nevertheless, we find little evidence of a positive relationship for profitability for large and

small firms: In both Table 6 and 7 the coefficient estimate of the intangibles index is negative,

large in magnitude, and statistically significant when modelling the level of profitability in

column (1); is small in magnitude and statistically insignificant when modelling the change in

profitability in column (3); and is positive, small in magnitude and statistically insignificant in

column (5) when modelling whether a firm experienced a larger than five percent increase in

profitability. 17

          Labour productivity (value added per worker) is generally expected to rise as the result of

any investment, because providing each worker with more capital should increase output per

worker. For large firms, column (2) of Table 6 shows a positive relationship between intangible

investment and the level of labour productivity, while column (4) shows a positive relationship

between intangible investment and the change in labour productivity. For example, the point

estimate of column (4) suggests an increase in the intangibles index that corresponds to one out

of eight more activites is associated with about a 0.8 percentage increase in labour productivity

(0.061 x 1/8=0.0076). Column (6) shows a positive and statistically significant relationship

between intangible investment and the likelihood of a firm’s having increased labour

productivity by at least five percent over the previous two years.




17   OLS estimates in columns (5) and (6) are similar to the average marginal effects from logit estimates. We exclude

firms with negative or zero profitability in these regressions, both in Table 6 and Table 7, because we use the log

transformation in columns (1) and (3). We similarly exclude firms with negative or zero profit in Appendix Table 7,

and firms with negative or zero labour productivity in Table 6 and 7 when modelling labour productivity.


                                                                                                                         29
      Table 7 shows that these relationships tend to be smaller for small firms (and statistically

insignificant in columns (2) and (4)), though still positive.

      How do we reconcile the positive link between the intangibles index and labour

productivity, when we found no such relationship for MFP or profitability? This could occur if

intangible investment is associated with an increase in the amount of conventional capital per

worker, whether causally or coincidentally. We will see in Section 4.4 that intangible investment

is associated with large increases in revenue, capital and labour, but not with capital intensity,

which leaves the puzzle somewhat unresolved.

      Finally, to explore a possible “growth without profitability” story and motivate the links

with firm growth that will be explored in Section 4.4, Appendix Table 7 estimates versions of Eq.

(2) where the dependent variable is the level, change, or an indicator for meaningful change of

absolute profit rather than profitability (profit per unit of capital). Absolute profit is not the best

measure of performance, as it will tend to be higher for larger firms just because they are larger

and have more capital. Nonetheless, firms looking to create a presence may be content with

increasing absolute profits.

      Column (1) shows a large and statistically significant relationship between the intangibles

index and the level of profits, implying taking up one out of eight more intangible activities is

associated with a 19 percent increase in profits. This may reflect selection by firms, as we know

that larger firms tend to report more investment and will tend to have higher absolute profits.

Columns (2) to (4) instead examine changes in profits within a firm, and imply positive

associations (though statistically insignificant in column (2)) with the intangibles index. We

explore this “growth without profitability” story in more detail in Section 4.4.

 Notes: This table presents the coefficients from OLS regressions at the firm-year level, where the dependent variable is described in the column headers. The
 sample is limited to odd March-years from 2005 to 2013, and firms that are below or equal to the small firm cut-off which is the median firm size and unique for
 each regression column. The omitted category for age is 6–10 years, and the omitted category for competition is ‘many competitors, some dominant’. Standard
 errors, in parentheses, are robust and clustered at the firm level. The reported numbers of observations have been randomly rounded to the nearest multiple of
 3, as required by Statistics NZ confidentiality rules. Asterisks denote: *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.10.

4.3      Intangibles and the distribution of firm performance
The previous section suggested that there is no positive association on average between

intangible investment and productivity. If, however, different firms use intangible investment in

different ways, it is possible that this lack of an effect on average is hiding a significant positive

effect for some firms. One might think, for example, that for poorly performing firms, intangible

investment is a mechanism to pull themselves up, while for successful firms it is pointless

gilding of the lily. Conversely, one might think that poorly performing firms do everything badly,

including making ineffective intangible investments, whereas well-run firms are able to make

intangible investments that add real value. Either of these statements suggest that whether and

to what extent intangible investment is productive varies depending on the underlying

productivity of the firm.

   Quantile regression methods allow one to explore whether the effect of a variable differs for

different levels of the dependent variable. The model estimates different effects for each

quantile of firm performance conditional on past intangibles and other covariates. Our model

then looks like equation (2) with the same dependent and explanatory variables; but the

estimator models the conditional quantile function rather than the conditional expectation

function. Industry-specific time trends remain in the model for flexibility.

      We also use the methodology of Firpo et al. (2009) to run unconditional quantile

regressions that relate different parts of the unconditional distribution of firm performance to

past intangible expenditure. The difference between the two methods lies in exactly which firms

are in each quantile. If we consider the lowest quantile, for example, the conditional method

puts in that quantile the firms whose performance is worst relative to what would be expected

based on their other characteristics. It would include in the lowest quantile firms whose

performance is not actually so bad, if their characteristics are such that we would expect their

performance to be very good. In contrast, the unconditional method includes in the lowest

quantile those firms whose performance is worst in absolute terms, regardless of what we

might expect based on their characteristics.
                                                                                                     33
       In our case, we do not have a particular theory about how the effect of intangibles might

vary with performance; we are simply exploring whether there is important variation

underlying the average. For this reason, we try both approaches, though in fact they show

similar qualitative pictures.

       Table 8 presents results from conditional quantile regressions in odd columns, and

unconditional quantile regressions in even columns. 18 Columns (1) and (2) show the results for

the intangibles index, and columns (3) and (4) use the dummy variable for reporting positive

intangible expenditure. The results show that the average negative association of past intangible

investment on current productivity is not limited to particular portions of the productivity

distribution. There is a general pattern of negative effects, although not all are statistically

significant. There is no quantile that shows a significantly positive effect for any version of the

model.

       The last four columns repeat this exercise but with log labour productivity as an

alternative measure of firm performance. Columns (5) and (6) suggest a positive relationship

between past intangibles and the various quantiles of labour productivity, with the relationship

increasing as we move up the labour productivity distribution. For example, column (5) shows

that increasing the past intangibles by one activity is associated with a 1.4 percent increase in

the conditional 10th percentile of labour productivity (.112 x 1/8); this increases to about a 1.8

percent increase in the conditional 90th percentile (.142 x 1/8). Similarly, in columns (7) and (8)

the coefficient estimates are consistently positive and increasing with the quantile when using

an indicator for reporting any intangible expenditure.

       Taken together, these results do not support the hypothesis that intangible investment

behaves quite differently for firms at different points in the productivity distribution. For MFP,

the association with recent past intangible investment is negative across all quantiles. For




18In conditional quantile regressions we cluster standard errors at the firm level using the package that was created
by Machado et al. (2015).

labour productivity, it is positive across all quantiles, with some evidence of a slightly larger

effect for the most productive firms.


4.4       Changes in inputs and outputs
One potential explanation for the puzzling negative relationship between intangible investment

and MFP in the previous sections is that firms are focused on growing; perhaps rather than

increasing performance in the short-term, intangible investment is intended to marshall

resources that will lead to growth, either as an end in itself or as a precondition for eventual

performance gains. In this section, we investigate one of the conditions that are necessary for

this to be true: Do firms increase their inputs and outputs after investing in intangibles?

      These regressions take the form:

              𝑦𝑦𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 = 𝛽𝛽0 + 𝛽𝛽1 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗−1 + 𝛽𝛽2 ℎ𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗−1 + 𝜌𝜌𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 + 𝜀𝜀𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 ,   (3)


where 𝑦𝑦𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 denotes either the firm’s log of gross output, log of labour, log of capital, or log of

capital intensity (capital per unit of labour); ‘history’ denotes the vector of past output, labour,

and capital, all in log form; and 𝜌𝜌𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 denotes industry-specific year effects. In alternative

specifications, we drop the ‘history’ variable and include firm fixed effects, and thereby focus on

within-firm variation in intangibles and how this translates to subsequent activity.

      Table 9 presents the results from such regressions, with the ‘history’ specifications in odd

columns and the firm fixed effect specifications in even columns. The dependent variables are

all in log form, so that coefficient estimates are interpreted as elasticities for the logged input

and output covariates, and as semi-elasticities for the intangibles index. Column (1) shows that

output tends to increase after intangible investment; an increase in the intangibles index

corresponding to one additional intangible investment activity out of eight is associated with a

1.4 percent increase in output (0.112 x 1/8) for a given history of past inputs and outputs.

Column (2) shows an economically and statistically significant relationship remains when

including firm fixed effects; an increase in the intangibles index corresponding to one additional

activity out of eight is associated with a one percent increase in output (0.079 x 1/8).

                                                                                                                            35

Notes: This table presents the coefficients from quantile regressions at the firm-year level, where the dependent variable is as described in the column headers. Each row shows
estimates of the association of past intangible investment on different part of the conditional distribution of performance (or unconditional, in every second column). Columns
vary by whether the distribution is conditional or unconditional, and the past intangibles measure. The regressions that estimate the coefficient on the intangibles index also
include as controls the ‘doesn't-know’ intangibles index, age-category dummy variables, and competition dummy variables. The sample is limited to March-years from 2005 to
2011. Standard errors, in parentheses, are robust and clustered at the firm level in conditional quantile regressions. The reported numbers of observations have been
randomly rounded to the nearest multiple of 3, as required by Statistics NZ confidentiality rules. Asterisks denote: *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.10.

      Columns (3) and (4) use the log of labour as the dependent variable. The results are

similar; an increase of one-eigth in the intangibles index is associated with around a one percent

increase for both specifications. Similarly, columns (5) and (6) use the log of capital as the

dependent variable, with a coefficient on the intangibles index of .12 when controlling for a

firm’s history of inputs and outputs, and .08 with firm fixed effects.

      As noted above, the positive association of intangible investment with labour productivity

when it is not positively associated with MFP suggests that perhaps intangible investment is

associated with an increase in conventional capital intensity. The results in columns (3) – (6) do

not show an obvious tendency in terms of the relative increase in capital and labour. The last

two columns of Table 9 focus directly on the log of capital intensity, measured as capital per unit

of labour. The positive point estimate of 0.028 in column (7) is economically small and

statistically insignificant, and the negative point estimate of -0.036 in column (8) with firm fixed

effects is similarly economically small and statistically insignificant.

      Together, the results of Table 9 provide strong evidence that increases in the intangibles

index are associated with increases in firm inputs and outputs; firms expand after intangible

investment. But capital intensity appears unchanged; there is no clear difference between the

growth of capital and labour inputs. This leaves unresolved the puzzle of the positive

associations with labour productivity that were shown in previous sections; intangibles-

investing firms are using more labour and capital after investment, in roughly the same

proportion, and it appears that they subsequently have higher labour productivity but not

higher MFP.

4.5      Reported satisfaction and intangible investment
The results so far suggest that intangible investment is associated with growth, but with no

positive effect on firms’ productivity or profitability. This led us to explore further what might be

happening when firms invest in intangibles that foster growth while not increasing profits or

productivity. One possibility is that intangibles support improvement in ‘soft’ aspects of firm

performance that are not reflected in the short run in productivity or profitability.

   As an exploration of this possibility, we examine whether past intangible investment is

associated with higher firm-reported customer and employee satisfaction for firms that look

otherwise similar. Our baseline model is a linear probability model and takes the form:

            𝑦𝑦𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 = 𝛽𝛽0 + 𝛽𝛽1 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗−1 + 𝛽𝛽2 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗−1 + 𝛾𝛾𝑘𝑘 + 𝛿𝛿𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝜀𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 ,   (4)


where j denotes firm, k denotes industry, and t denotes year, and 𝑦𝑦𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 is an indicator for the firm

reporting soft success (either high customer or high employee satisfaction). We derive this

indicator of success from a question that asks whether a business is lower, on par with, or higher

than competitors when it comes to customer and employee satisfaction (as described in Section

3.1); the dependent variable takes on the value one if the firm reports high customer/employee

satisfaction, and zero otherwise, ignoring the ‘don’t know’ answers. The ‘confidence’ variable is

described in Section 3.1 and controls for the fact that some managers may generically overstate

how great their firm is. We also include industry-specific year effects to allow each industry to

have its own time trend of reported satisfaction. Hence we examine whether past intangible

investment is associated with more customer and employee satisfaction for comparable firms

reporting similar levels of quality; flexibility; time to produce goods and services; and costs.

      Table 10 presents the results of this estimation. Column (1) shows a positive and

statistically significant relationship between the lagged intangibles index and firm-reported

customer satisfaction. The coefficient estimate of 0.092 indicates that adding one additional

intangible activity is associated with 1.1 percentage point increase (0.092 x 1/8) in the

probability of reporting high customer satisfaction.



                                                                                                                                      39
          One concern with such a specification is that certain managers may be overly confident

about their firm’s quality, causing them to overstate the satisfaction of their customers and

employees. Furthermore, these same respondent-specific traits may correspond with reporting

intangible investment; overly confident managers may like to report that they are training their

employees, developing new marketing strategies, and doing other admirable-sounding activities.

If this omitted-variable hypothesis is correct, our coefficient estimate of the intangibles index

will be upwardly biased in column (1). We attempt to control for the ‘confidence’ of the survey

respondent with the use of the confidence index as a control, as described in Section 3.1 and

constructed as the average reported category for questions on relative costs; relative time to

provide goods and services; relative quality of goods and services; and relative flexibility.

          Column (2) of Table 10 shows that including the confidence index as a control decreases

but leaves positive the point estimate of the intangibles index. As expected, the coefficient

estimate on the confidence index is positive, which indicates that firms that answered higher on

the underlying questions tend to report higher customer satisfaction. Column (3) instead

controls for respondent confidence by including dummy variables for each of the categories that

make up the confidence index. The coefficient estimate of the intangibles index loses statistical

significance though remains positive.

          Columns (4) to (6) replicate columns (1) to (3) but with employee satisfaction as the

dependent variable. A similar pattern emerges: Intangible investment is positively associated

with employee satisfaction, with the relationship becoming weaker but remaining positive and

statistically significant after attempting to control for the confidence of the firm. For example,

column (5) indicates that adding one of the eight intangible activities is associated with a 0.75

percentage point increase (0.06 x 1/8) in the likelihood of reporting high employee satisfaction.

          Appendix Table 8 replicates Table 10 but estimates logit models rather than linear

probability models. 19 The reported average marginal effects are very close to the corresponding

point estimates from Table 10.




19   We drop industry-specific year effects for empirical tractability, but leave in both year and industry fixed effects
      We have not established causality with these estimates; intangible investment may be

correlated with the error term in these models due to omitted variable bias. There could be

separate phenomena that increase both intangible investment and customer/employee

satisfaction or reverse causality between satisfaction and intangible investment that cannot be

solved by lagging our intangibles index. However, it is interesting that the finding holds after

comparing similar firms within an industry, and controlling for how confident the firm is on

other dimensions. This suggests a channel through which intangible investment may be affecting

firms’ outcomes.



5        Conclusion
A growing literature on intangible investment posits—and sometimes confirms empirically—

that such investment results in an intangible asset of the firm that improves firm performance.

In the standard the model, the presence of this productive input that is not included among

measured inputs should be reflected in higher productivity and profitability as conventionally

measured.

      Using firm-level data from the New Zealand, we link self-reported intangible investment

activities -- including R&D, employee training, marketing, and organisational restructuring --

with measures of firm performance and activity. We find evidence of plausible variation in our

intangible measures across different industries: Our measure of intangible investment is highest

in ‘information media and telecommunications’; ‘manufacturing’; and ‘professional, scientific

and technical services’. It is lowest in ‘agricultural, forestry and fishing’; and ‘mining’.

      Examining the characteristics of intangibles-investing firms, we find that intangible

investment is decreasing with age; increasing with firm size; is unrelated to past output growth

relative to the industry average; and is highest with a moderate amount of perceived

competition.

Notes: This table presents the coefficients from OLS regressions at the firm-year level, where the dependent variable is a dummy variable for
the firm that reports an aspect of soft success, as described in column headers. The sample is limited to March-years from 2005 to 2013.
Standard errors, in parentheses, are robust and clustered at the firm level. The reported numbers of observations have been randomly
rounded to the nearest multiple of 3, as required by Statistics NZ confidentiality rules. Asterisks denote: *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.10.
       Intangible investment in the recent past appears negatively associated with MFP, though

we do find a small, statistically significant positive effect of recent past intangible investment on

the probability of enjoying a large productivity increase. When we examine intangibles and the

distribution of MFP, we find a generally negative relationship across different quantiles, though

it is most negative for the highest quantiles.

       More generally, we have tried many different empirical formulations of the relationship

and have found no framework in which strong positive effects of such investment on

productivity or profitability can be detected. 20 Typically, we would expect the associations

shown to be upwardly biased due to unobserved attributes of good management being positively

correlated with both intangible investment and productivity. This makes the negative

relationship all the more puzzling. While there is a theoretical possibility of negative bias due to

causality running from low productivity to intangible investment, this seems unlikely given that

intangible investment seems unrelated to a firm’s past output growth relative to the industry

average.

       Although we have not estimated a causal model, the data show an association between

firm growth and intangible investment, and seem to be consistent with a story in which such

investment allows the firm to attract additional inputs and increase its revenue. We have not

pinned down the mechanisms by which this might work, but we do find that past investment is

positively correlated with firm-reported customer and employee satisfaction. This finding holds

after attempting to control for the possible tendency of some firms to overstate their

accomplishments.

       Given the weakness of the results, and their apparent inconsistency with theory, it is hard

to draw strong conclusions from this analysis. The results may be driven by some combination

of:

1.     The BOS survey responses do not meaningfully reflect ‘true’ intangible investment.



20In addition to the models that we report herein, we also explored whether any individual forms of intangible
investment or categories of such investment as used by Corrado et al. (2012) have positive associations with
productivity. We found none.
                                                                                                                 43
2.        Our LBD-derived productivity and profitability measures do not accurately capture true
          productivity and profitability.
3.        Intangible investment can increase productivity, but on average New Zealand firms are
          investing in the wrong assets, or are investing inefficiently.
4.        Intangible investment does improve firm performance, but this effect is clouded by some
          kind of reverse causality or negative selection into intangible investment.
5.        Intangible investment does improve firm performance, but with long and/or variable lags
          that make it impossible to identify empirically.
6.        Firms invest in intangibles in pursuit of firm growth, even if such growth occurs at the
          expense of productivity and/or profitability.
7.        Firms may invest in intangibles for benefits that are themselves intangible, such as
          customer and employee satisfaction.
8.        Firms may investment in intangibles expecting that it will allow them to grow and become
          more profitable/productive, but the latter outcomes are mostly unrealized.



          Explanation 1 has some plausibility: Self-reported answers to broad questions will never

perfectly capture the phenomenon of interest. But given the systematic relationships in our

regression analysis and the variation across industries, it seems that we are measuring real-

world intangible investment to some extent, and it is difficult to imagine a systematic pattern of

mismeasurement that would produce apparent negative effects. Similarly, mismeasurement of

profitability and productivity (#2) would seem more likely to yield no effect than a negative

effect.

          Explanation 3 is more a caveat on interpreting our results. Any analysis of this kind can

say only what is, not what could be. But we explore whether any of the avenues of intangible

investment in the data could be seen to have positive effects, and found none. And the measures

that we do have are associated with measurable differences for firms—they grow faster. We

cannot rule out that they could have had other effects if undertaken differently, but we are more

inclined to focus on what did happen.

          Explanation 4 seems implausible to us: Strong negative selection on MFP into intangibles

would suggest something closer to a survival story in which firms invest in a last-ditch effort

remain afloat. But our results show that investing firms tend to have had growth similar to the

industry average, which is not consistent with a widespread survival motive.

          Explanation 5 has surface plausibility: Intangible investment is associated with increased

costs in the short run and so could manifest as a negative effect in the short run while eventually
bearing fruit. We are personally sceptical of this explanation. Our main results measure

intangible investment 2–4 years previous, and it seems unlikely that lags longer than that could

yield overall positive investment results. Further, even when we cumulate investment over our

entire period, we find a negative association with end-of-period productivity.

        “Explanations” 6 - 8 are consistent with the data, but they are not really explanations in

any fundamental sense: They suggest questions about how firms see their strategic choices, and

why they choose the options that they do. But they are healthy reminders that firms are complex

institutions that operate under their own objectives and constraints. Researchers’ focus on

productivity and profitability may not correspond even conceptually to the goals that firms and

their owners pursue. And what firms seek and what they achieve may not necessarily be the

same.

        Because of these uncertainties, the policy implications of these findings seem limited. On

one level, it is useful simply to remind ourselves that even with mounds of data we have only a

cloudy lens through which to view firm behaviour. We can and should continue to try to

understand better what is going on; but we should have no illusions that with enough data and

the right econometrics we can produce The Answer.

        These results do suggest that if productivity improvement is the goal, encouraging

investment in the activities that we have considered is unlikely to be a powerful tool, at least

without better understanding how intangible investment translates (or fails to translate) into

intangible assets. This is a topic for further research, though there are inherent measurement

difficulties.

        If firms themselves are truly more focused on growth than on profitability, policy

prescriptions become quite tricky. The standard formulation of seeking public policies that

rectify market failures is predicated on the basic welfare economics optimality results, which in

turn rest on the assumption of profit-maximizing behaviour. A model in which firms

systematically seek growth rather than profits may well be realistic, but it requires a rethinking

of the appropriate role for government.


                                                                                                     45
      Finally, if firms systematically seek profits but systematically fail to use intangible

investment effectively toward that end, then there are clearly some informational issues to be

dealt with. Figuring out if policy could improve on this situation will require a better

understanding of how and why firms make the decisions that they do.

Notes: This table presents the coefficients from OLS regressions at the firm-year level, where the dependent variable is an intangibles measure that is described in
each column header. The sample is limited to March-years from 2005 to 2013. In columns (4) to (6) the sample is limited to firms with positive reported intangible
investment. The omitted category for age is 6–10 years, and the omitted category for competition is ‘many competitors, some dominant’. Standard errors, in
parentheses, are robust and clustered at the firm level. The reported numbers of observations have been randomly rounded to the nearest multiple of 3, as required
by Statistics NZ confidentiality rules. Asterisks denote: *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.10.

Notes: This table presents average marginal effects from logit regressions at the firm-year level, where the dependent variable is a dummy variable for the
firm reporting an aspect of soft success, as described in column headers. Marginal effects are for a discrete change of 1 unit, because our indices are not
continuous. The sample is limited to March-years from 2005 to 2013. Standard errors, in parentheses, are robust and clustered at the firm level. The
reported numbers of observations have been randomly rounded to the nearest multiple of 3, as required by Statistics NZ confidentiality rules. Asterisks
