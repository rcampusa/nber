                       Discounting Rules for Risky Assets




                                    ABSTRACT




     This paper develops a rule for calculating a discount rate to value

risky projects. The rule assumes that asset risk can be measured by a

single index   (e.g., beta), but makes no other assumptions   about specific

forms   of the asset pricing model. It treats all projects    as combinations of

two assets: Treasury bills and the market portfolio. We know how to value

each of these assets under any theory of debt and taxes and under any

assumption about the slope and intercept of the market line forequity

securities. Our discount rate is a weighted average of the after-tax return

on riskless debt and the expected return on the portfolio, where the weight

on the market portfolio is beta.

I. INTRODUCTION

     We still do not understand the role 6f taxes in determining optimal

capital structure, if there is an optimal capital structure. Therefore, we

have no general rule for calculating discount rates for capital investments

which are partly debt-financed. The only bulletproof rules apply to two

special cases. First, we know that risk-free, after-corporate-tax nominal

cash flows should be discounted at the after-corporate-tax risk free

interest rate. Second, we know that projects that exactly duplicate the

firm's existing assets, both in risk and financing, are correctly valued by

discounting at the firm's weighted average cost of capital.

     The discounting rules for these two special cases work regardless of

"right" theory of debt and taxes. For example, Ruback (1986) shows that the

discount rate for risk-free flows can be derived as a special case of the

adjusted discount rate formula derived by Modigliani and Miller (Ff1) in 1963

and also as a special case of Myers's adjusted present value method (1974),

which as originally presented adopted      assumptions about the value of
corporate interest tax shields. But th- same discounting rule also follows

from Miller's 1977 "Deb and Taxes" paper, because in that model the

opportunity cost of equity investment ir a risk-free asset is the after_tax

risk-free rate. Ruback proves these di unting rules by arguing that any

stream of risk-free future cash inflows can be "zeroed out" by a borrowing

plan under which after-tax debt service is matched to the penny to the cash

inflows. (Cash outflows can be zeroed out by a matched lending plan.)

Since debt service can be covered exactly, the initial amount borrowed under

the plan carr'be money in the bank at "time zero," which needless to say is -

not   difficult to value.'

          We set out to find a discounting rule which could be used to value any

risky cash flow stream. We failed. But we did find a rule which guarantees

a project value under any equilibrium theory of debt and taxes, so long as

the corporation adheres to a specific financing policy for the project.

We do not claim that this financing policy is optimal, only that it is

feasible. If there is a different optimal policy, and if the manager knows

what that Dolicy is, project value can exceed our guaranteed value. For

managers who share our ignorance of optimal capital structure, however, the

guaranteed value should be helpful as a lower bound.

      Our discounting rule does not require exotic ingredients --    only   the

risk—free interest rate, the marginal corporate tax rate, a risk measure or

measures for the stream, arid the expected rate of return on a reference

portfolio of traded securities. If a one-factor capital asset pricing model

is assume-I, as we do for convenience in most of this paper, then the risk

measure is the asset beta and the reference portfolio is the market.

      Our rue for calculating the discount rate for a risky project S:


                 r     rf (1-T) (1-s) +   r                           (1)

where rf(l-TC) is the nominal Treasury rate, after taxes at the marginal

corporate rate, T, rm is the expected rate of return on the market, and

is .the "asset beta" of the cash flow. The asset beta is the beta of a

direct equity claim on the cash flow, that is, the beta the cash flow would

have if it were traded as an all-equity finance.mini-firm. Weassume this.

beta is known.

     The intuition behind this cost of capital rule is straightforward. The

right cost of capital for a risky project is its opportunity cost, which is

the expected rate of return on a capital market investment with identical

risk. A firm     could   use investments in T-bills and the market portfolio to

form a replicating portfolio with the same risk as the project. The

replicating portfolio is constructed by investing l- percent of its funds

in the T-bills, with an after-corporate-tax return of rf(l-TC), and

investing B   percent    of its funds in the market, with an expected return of

rm. (This replicating strategy assumes that a corporation does not pay

taxes on its investment in the market portfolio.) The replicating portfolio

has the same beta as the risky project and provides an after-corporate tax

return of r*. The after-tax opportunity cost of investing in the risky

project is therefore given by equation (1), and that rate, r*, should be

used to value the project.

     Our discount rate rule can also be interpreted as a weighted average

cost of capital for a project:



                         WACC =                +
                                  rD (1-T)         rE                (2)


This project weighted average cost of capital can be usd to valie a project

as long as the debt and equity rates of return and weights are for the
                                           4




project. Our rule simply assigns specific values to the components of WACC:

the debt ratio, DIV. is set equal to 1—a; the equity ratio, Ely, is set

                    With these weights, if the debt is riskiess (so that

the equity has a beta of one and rE =

          The next section presents the discounting rule, proves it gives a

guaranteed value, and discusses. practical application and underlying

assumptions.

II. A DISCOUNTING RULE FOR RISKY CASH FLOWS.                  -

          The discount rate we propose is a weighted average of the after-

corporate        tax risk—free interest rate and the expected rate of return on a
reference        portfolio of risky securities. The weight on       the reference
portfolio's        return is the cash flow's risk relative to the reference

portfolio.

          The only requirement for the reference portfolio is that it can be

levered or unlevered to match its risk level to the risk of the cash flows.

Under the capital asset pricing model, or any single-factor model, the

natural reference portfolio is the market portfolio, and the risk measure is

beta. The beta of an equity investment in a cash flow can always be made

equal to one, the market beta, by levering or unlevering.              For now we take

the market as the reference portfolio. But it is important to emphasize

that the only aspect of the Capital Asset Pricing Model that we depend on is

that beta is the correct measure of r3k.             We   make no specic assLn—'tions

about the intercept and slope of the curity market line.                  use

mark t     a a reference portfolio becaus it is actively trade            and   is likely
to   be     ;
                 y priced, and becaus its expected return should          easie to
estim           than expected returns   other equity portfolios or specific common

stocks.   We also assume that the firm has sufficient taxable income, either

from the cash flow being valued or from other corporate assets, that it can

always use interest tax shields immediately when interest is paid. We

assume that it could borrow (l-) of the cash flow's value over any short

period at the risk-free interest rate. I!       exceeds one, this amounts to

lending (-l) times the cash flow's value at the risk-free rate.

     Finally, we assume that capital markets are complete enough to support

value additivity. We ignore transaction costs or other market

imperfections.

    -Consider an' asset generating a single cash- flow X, with expectation X =

E(X), to be received next period. X is net of corporate taxes. However,
these taxes do not reflect any interest tax shields on debt associated with,

or supported by X. In other words, the corporate tax paid on X is

calculated assuming all-equity financing.

     We will now give two proofs that discounting X at r* gives a lower

bound to its market value. The first proof is quick and simple. The second

is longer but more informative.

First Proof

     We calculate V, the market value of X, as if the asset generating

X were traded as a separately financed mini-firm. Given value additivity, V

is also the project's contribution to its parent firm's value. We can think

of adding the mini-firm's value to the left-hand side of the parent's

balance sheet and it's debt and equity values to the right-hand side of the

parent's balanc sheet.

     Suppose the firm"finances" the projfct with D =     (1-)V   dollars of

debt. That is, it accepts D =     (1-)V   a :.s capital structure policy for
the asset generating X. The mini-firm's initial market value balance sheet
                                          6



 is:
                               ASSETS         LIABILITIES

                             V = V(x,D)       D =   (1-6)v
                                              E =
                                 V                  V

Note that V may depend on debt policy. We do not assume that borrowing

 (1—)V is the best policy, only that it is a feasible policy.         We do assume,

provisionally, that the beta of V(XD) does not depend on D.2

       The beta of the equity claim on X is one. Since the beta of the

portfolio of D and E equals the asset beta, and since        =   0,

                       D V       EV
                                        —E gV                           3



Rearranging (2), and substituting the values for the project's debt ((1-)V)

and equity (By), proves that:


              BE      B(1+


Thus rE, the expected rate of return investors would demand on the equity,

equals rm, the expected rate—of return on the reference (market) portfolio.

       The expected portfolio rate of return on the debt and equity claims on

X is weighted average of rf? the risk-free-rate, and rm. the expected equity

return. The weights are the financing proportions DIV and Ely. This return

comes as a cash payout, which in total is the cash flow X plus the interes

tax shield TCrfD. The expected return per dollar invested is therefore


       2   This       not always right, because the interest tax

    Since D/V =       1 -            and E/V =    , the       left hand side is just 1 +    r*:
                                              1 +   r*   =        xlv

    In application, equation (4) is the starting point, not the end result. The

    firm forecasts X, discounts it at r* to obtain V. and then issues debt of

•   (1-)V. Our proof shows that the actual market value of X (or of the debt

    plus the residual equity claim on X) is in fact V under the assumed

    financing policy.

    Second Proof

             In the first proof, w never identified the market value of an

    unlevered claim on X. Now we introduce a security market line for equities

    under different assumptions about debt and taxes. Let T   and T    be
                                                           pe       pd
    effective personal tax rates on equity and interest income, respectively.

    Let rfe be the expected rate of return demanded by investors in risk-free

    (zero—beta) equities.

             If T     = T        ,    the MN (1963) case, then rfe              r .   But if the two
                 pe         pd                                                   f
    personal tax rates are riot equal, the after personal tax rates on safe debt

 and safe equity3 must be the same:

                                           =
                    rfe (     lTpe)                rf   (lTpd).                           (5)


Thus in Miller's (1977) model, where Tpe= 0 and the marginal investor's Tpd

equals the corporale rate, rfe= rf (1-T).

       We do not know rf1 re or the personal tax rates of the relevant

marginal investors. We assume the firm knows rf and rm, but not the

intercept or slope of the security market line because rfe is unknown:


                          r   (6)
                                      rf       +    6(r      -
                                                                 rfC).                    (6)


       Figure 1 shows three possible lines: first, the "Iffi" line with rfC =

rf.   which is the same as the original capital asset pricing model's line;

second, the "Miller line" with Tpe = 0 and rfe                           rf(l-TC); and finally an

intermediate. case. Obviously the expected return depends on the line

assumed, unless it happens that 6                   = 1.     For illustration we have marked

three possible values at 6            = 0.5.
      The MM line implies a strong tax advantage to corporate borrowing, the

intermediate line a weaker advantage, and the Miller line no advantage at

all. We do not know which line is right. But the value of a future cash

flow does       depend on the line so long as the firm                      adheres   to the d'bt

policy underlying our discounting rule.

value of the interest tax shields:

where (l-)APV =     (1-)V        is the debt issued against X; r is the discount rate

for an all equity claim to the cash flow; and T*rf (l-)APV is the net

interest tax shield when personal as well as orporate taxes are considered.

We continue our provisional assumption that interest tax shields are just as

risky as the cash flow X, and thus discount both terms in equation (7) at r.

    When the firm       switches       debt for equity, and pays.an additional dollar

of interest, the corporate tax shield is T, or Tc(lTpe) after equity

investors' taxes. At the same time the switch subjects one dollar of

investment income to tax at Tpd rather than                          at a cost to investors of

Tpd - Tpe•    The net tax gain after all taxes is Tc(lTpe) -                           +           To

so the APV calculation implicitly discounts at the rate r -                          T*rf(l_).     Thus

we must show that:
                          r —   T* rf(1) = (1—a) rf (1-Ta) +                    r   r*

Substituting for r from (7) and simplifying leaves:
                                                                            -
                      (                  - T*     =
                                                        (1-Ta)     .




Substitute      for T* from equation (8) and start cancelling: all the tax rates

offset and the equality is shown.

Numerical Example

          Suppose we observe rf           .10 and rm =           .20. The corporate tax rate is T
=   .5.     The cash flow's expected value is 100 an its beta is 0.5. Our

discounting rule gives r* =              (1   -
                                                  .5)      (.10) (1-.5) +   (.5)(.20)    = .125 and a

value V = 100/1.125 =           88.89.
      Table 1 shows that exactly the same APV is obtained under three

different assumptions about debt and taxes and the security market line.

      The calculations in Table 1 clarify why our discounting rule works

under any equilibrium model of debt and taxes. If we move from Case 1 (MM)

to Case 2 (Miller), the cash flow X loses value because T* drops from .50 to

zero. But it also gains value because r, the all-equity opportunity cost of

capital, falls from .15          to   .125. The loss and gain exactly offset. Given

rf. rm and T, and given our proposed financing policy, calculated value can

never be increased by assuming a higher value for T* because a consistent

assumption about the security market line requires increasing r to offset

the tax gain.5


            This is not a standard comparative sttic analysis of the marginal
properties of an equilibrium. Instead we st ith the observed rates, rf
and rm, which could be generated by any of a e number of equilibria. We
then ask whether project value depends on what                         :e true equilibrium is.

         The table also shows why our proposed rule may understate the cash

    flow's actual value.- Its value could be increased in cases 1 and 3 by
-
    borrowing more than 50 percent of its value. In general our discounting
    -rule will understate value j there- are significant tax advantages to

    corporate debt (T*>O), j agency, moral hazard, or bankruptcy costs do not

    prevent borrowing more than (1-)V, and j managers act to lever up beyond

    (1-)V. However, our_rule guarantees a project value to a manager who is

    uncertain about "debt and taxes," who worries about the cost of financial

    distress which may be encountered at debt levels above (1-)V, or who has

    trouble convincing a conservative organization to lever up aggressively.

    A Qualification

         So far we have assumed that the risk of the total cash payout to debt

    and equity combined does not depend on the debt amount. This is not always

    right, because the corporate interest tax shield TCrfD is a safe nominal

    flow, received when interest is paid next period. The overall beta of debt

    and equity is thus reduced by borrowing whenever interest tax shields

    contribute to firm value. If they do not contribute, the overail beta is

    unchanged by borrowing despite the addition of the safe interest tax

    shields.

         Consider the beta of investing in the total cash payout to debt and

    equity investors. It depends on the covariance of the return on this

    investment with the market return, r ,
                                        m
                                             that   jS:




                      COV[(X + rfTD)/V rm] = COV(X, r)/V.



    The safe tax shield 7fTCD affects this covariance only as it affects V.
                                   ,       14



In an MM would, as D increases, V increases and the covariance and beta

fall. In a Miller equilibrium, V does not depend on D, and the

covariance and beta are therefore constant too.

     If Miller is right., our discountingrule (Eq. 11) gives exactly the

right answer given the financing policy of D =             (1-)V.     But if MM are right,

our rule understates project value, because the equity beta is less than one

when D =   (1-)v.
     If we knew that MM were right, this problem would be fixed by slightly

modifying the assumed financing policy to put more weight on rf(lTc), the

after-tax risk free rate, and less on rm, the expected market return. We now

work through the modification to see how much difference this modification

might make.

     Safe nominal flows are valued by discounting at the after-tax risk free

rate. Thus the interest tax shield's present value is:



                      TCrfD            =            yD                         (9)
                    l+rf(lT)



Suppose the firm "cashes in" this present value by borrowing an additional

amount yD, generating this market value balance sheet:


                      ASSETS                    LIABILITIES
                     V - yD                         = (1—)(V-yD)+yD

                          yD
                    V =   v(x,D)                v
                                                  15



The debt weight works out tobe (1-)/(1-y):

              D =     (1-)(V-yD)      + yD =      (1-)V     +   yD
                =      (1-B)v
                        1-

The equity weight IS:

                1—
                              1—B         —
                                          —            B(1—y
                             1—ay                       l—y
and the debt-equity ratio is D/E = (1-6)/6(1-y). The revised discount rate
is:
                r* = (2L_) rf (1-Ta) +                        B(1-v)
                                                                       rm           (10)

      Now we show that               the beta of the equity claim, is again one despite
the addition of the safe asset yD to the                    left-hand side of the balance

sheet. Systematic          risk is the same on.both sides,

                (V-yD)        +               =         +
                                    DYD           6DD         EE

and since D =         0

                      =    (1+     D(1_v))



                      —             (l_B)(l_Y)) — 1

                                       (1-y)



Since 6E = 1,   rE     must equal rm.
                                                                            *

     The adjustment of weights in equation (10) is probably not an important

practical refinement. For example, under the ssumptions of Table 1, the

weight on the after-tax risk free rate would change from 1- =             .5   to:



                (1—8)             __________________            = .512.
                 1—ay              1
                                        '1+.10(1—.5)



The discount rate changes from r* = .125 in Table 1 to:



               r* = .512 (.10)(1-.5) +       .488(.20)   =   .123.


     Thus our discounting rule, Eg. (1), is not entirely insulated from the

debate about taxes and optimal capital structure. The rule will overstate

the correct discount rate when there is a tax advantage to corporate

borrowing. We believe the overstatement is minor - note that an estimate of

rm could easily be a full percentage point off target. Of course a manager

who believed that there is a tax advantage to corporate borrowing would

calculate r* by equation (10), taking the chance of using adiscount rate

that is slightly too low.

Discountina   over t   Periods.

     Moving   from   one to t-period discounting is easy once the t-period

financing policy is specified. Our discounting rule can be applied period

by period if debt is adjusted to the rule's specified fraction of market

value at the start of each period.

     Consider a cash flow to be received at t. Then at the start of t-2,

say, the market value balance sheet will be:

     We assume that an unlevered equity claim              can be properly valued by

discounting at a constant risk adjusted rate. That in turn means that the

ingredients of-our digcount rate r* (ire., ,          r,     and rm) are also

constant,6 and that equation (1) generates the same r* for each future

period.

     Think of how the value of an unlevered claim on                   is determined at

t—2. It is:
                            =       Et_2              Et_2     (X/(1+r))

                            =       Et_2 (Xe)
                                    (1 +   r)2
where V0 indicates the unlevered value. In other words, the unlevered value


     6    Three conditions are usually considered necessary for
          iiscounting a cash flow at a constant risk-adjusted
          rate:
          1.    A known, constant beta for the an all-equity
                claim on the cash flow;
          2.    A known, constant market risk premium;
          3.    A known, constant Treasury bill rate.
          Condition 1 implies that uncertainty is resolved at a
          constant rate over time. It also implies that the
          "detrended" stream o project cash flows would follow a
          multiplicative random walk. (tiDetrendedu cash flows are
          epressed as percentages of their ex ante expectations.)

of       at t-2 is the expectation of its uncertain value at t-1, which in turn

is linked to the expectation of X given information available at t-'2.

        The value of X at t-1 under our assumed financing policy is

proportional to V_1:

Given this proportional link, the "asset beta" of V_1 as viewed from t-2

is identical to the beta of V_ viewed from the, same point. We can

therefore treat V_1 as if it were a cash payoff to investment at t-2. The

cash payoff is discounted at r.

111. SUMNAR!

     This   paper develops a rule for calculating a discount rate to value

risky projects. The rule assumes that asset risk- can be measured by a

single index (e.g., beta), but makes no other assumptions about specific

form of the asset pricing model. The rule works for all equilibrium

theories of debt and taxes. The rule works because it treats all projects

as combinations of twoassets: Treasury bills and the market portfolio. We

know how to 'value each of these assets under any theory of debt and taxes

and under any assumption about the slope and intercept of the market line

for equity securities.

     Given the corporate tax rate, the interest rate on Treasury bills, and

the expected rate of return on the market, we can calculate the cost of

capital for a feasible financing strategy. The firm finances the project


        The r* used in equation (11) could come either from equation '1) or
equation (10). Using the latter treats each period's interest tax sn1d as
a safe, nominal flow to be received at the end of that period. However,
interest tax shields in subsecuent periods are not know, since debt le:els
will be adjusted to cx post changes in the cash flow's market value. F
example, the firm at t-2 would view the interest tax shield TCrfD_, as a
safe nominal flow to be received at t-1. But the interest tax shield tc be
received at t is, when viewed from t-2, a random variable proportional t
V_1, that is TCrfWflV_l. The beta of a claim on this final tax shield
held from t-2 to t-I is the same as the beta of an unlevered claim on
X. The value of this-claim      included in V_1, and therefore :'i      '4hen
Et_2(Vti) is discounted by r

with equity and debt in the proportions   and (l-). Value increasing

projects could be completely financed using this strategy. The weighted

average cost of financing this project provides a discount rate that values

the project correctly.

     Of course, otherfinancing strategies are possible. If the firm knew

the correct theory of debt and taxes, it could probably come up with a

financing strategy that resulted in a lower cóst of capital than our rule

provides. Conversely, a different strategy could be worse than our rule,

and result in a higher cost of capital. Our contribution is to provide a

method for valuing risky projects that works for a variety of different

theories of debt and taxes and involves a financing strategy that is

feasible. We can guarantee a project value not withstanding our ignorance

about optimal capital structure.
