                                          ABSTRACT

In this paper we use detailed job vacancy data to estimate changes in skill demand in the years
since the Great Recession. The share of job vacancies requiring a bachelor's degree increased by
more than 60 percent between 2007 and 2019, with faster growth in professional occupations and
high-wage cities. Since the labor market was becoming tighter over this period, cyclical
"upskilling" is unlikely to explain our findings.

1    Introduction

The yearly wage premium for U.S. workers with a college degree has grown rapidly in
recent decades: from 40 percent in 1980 to nearly 70 percent in 2017 (Autor, Goldin, and
Katz 2020). Over the same period, the share of adults with at least a four-year college
degree doubled, from 17 to 34 percent (Snyder, de Brey, and Dillow, 2019) (Digest of
Education Statistics, 2020). In the "education race" model of Tinbergen (1974), these two
facts are explained by rapidly growing relative demand for college-level skills. If the
college premium grows despite a rapid increase in the supply of skills, this must mean
that the demand for skills is growing even faster.
    The education race model provides a parsimonious and powerful explanation of US
educational wage differentials over the last two centuries (Katz and Murphy 1992; Goldin
and Katz 2008; Autor, Goldin, and Katz 2020). Yet one key limitation of the model is that
skill demand is not directly observed, but rather inferred as a residual that fits the facts
above. How do we know that the results from the education race model are driven by
rising employer skill demand, as opposed to some other unobserved explanation?
    We study this question by using detailed job vacancy data to estimate the change in
employer skill demands in the years since the Great Recession. Our data come from the
labor market analytics firm Burning Glass Technologies (BGT), which has collected data
on the near-universe of online job vacancy postings since 2007.
    Our main finding is that skill demand has increased substantially in the decade follow-
ing the Great Recession. The share of online job vacancies requiring a bachelor's degree
increased from 23 percent in 2007 to 37 percent in 2019, an increase of more than 60 per-
cent. Most of this increase occurred between 2007 and 2010, consistent with the finding
that the Great Recession provided an opportunity for firms to upgrade skill requirements
in response to new technologies (Hershbein and Kahn 2018).
    We present several pieces of evidence suggesting that the increase in skill demand is
structural, rather than cyclical. We replicate the findings of Hershbein and Kahn (2018)

                                             2
and Modestino, Shoag, and Ballance (2019), who show that skill demands increased more
in labor markets that were harder hit by the Great Recession. However, when we extend
the sample forward and adjust for differences in the composition of online vacancies, we
find that this cyclical "upskilling" fades within a few years. In its place, we find long-
run structural increases in skill demand across all labor markets. In fact, we show that
the increase in skill demand post-2010 is larger in higher-wage cities. We also find much
larger increases in the demand for education in professional, high-wage occupations such
as management, business, science and engineering.
   Previous work using the BGT data has found that it is disproportionately comprised of
high-wage professional occupations, mostly because these types of jobs were more likely
to be posted online (e.g., Deming and Kahn 2018). As online job advertising has become
more common, the BGT sample has become more representative, and the firms and jobs
that are added later in the sample period are less likely to require bachelor's degrees and
other advanced skills.
   We adjust for the changing composition of the sample in two ways. First, we weight
all of our results by the employment share of each occupation as well as the size of the
labor force in each city in 2006. This ensures that our sample of vacancies is roughly
representative of the national job distribution in the pre-sample period. Second, our pre-
ferred empirical specification controls for occupation-by-MSA-by-firm fixed effects. This
approach accounts for compositional changes over time in the BGT data.
   Our results suggest that increasing demand for educated workers is likely a persistent
feature of the U.S. economy post-recession. Recent work has documented a slowdown
in the growth of the college wage premium since 2005 (Beaudry, Green, and Sand 2016;
Valletta 2018; Autor, Goldin, and Katz 2020). Yet this slowdown has occurred during a
period of rapid expansion in the supply of skills. We find rapid expansion in the demand
for skills, suggesting that education and technology are "racing" together to hold the

2     Data and Sample

BGT scrapes job vacancy data from more than 40,000 online job boards and company
websites. They apply a text processing algorithm to the raw data that removes duplicate
postings and parses the data into a number of fields, including six-digit Standard Oc-
cupational Classification (SOC) code, industry, firm name, location, education and work
experience requirements, and more than 12,000 unique job skills. Hershbein and Kahn
(2018) and Deming and Kahn (2018) compare the coverage of the BGT data to the Job
Openings and Labor Force Turnover (JOLTS) survey and find that it provides good cov-
erage overall that is substantially better for professional, high-wage occupations.
    Our data from BGT start in 2007, and then are available from January 2010 through
October 2019. We restrict the sample to job vacancies with non-missing occupation, firm
name, and metropolitan statistical area (MSA) codes. This yields a sample of 120,731,719
unique job vacancies. We apply a simple regularization procedure to the firm name field
in the BGT data, eliminating punctuation and common phrases such as "LLC" or "Corp"
in order to identify firms across vacancy postings. We supplement the BGT data with oc-
cupational employment shares and MSA-level characteristics from the 2005-2006 Amer-
ican Community Survey (ACS), as well as the MSA-level unemployment rate from the
Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).
    Following Hershbein and Kahn (2018), we study cyclical upskilling using an MSA-
level shift-share instrument, which they define as the change between 2006 and 2009 in
projected annual employment growth based on employment shares in three-digit North
    1 Modestino, Shoag, and Ballance (2016) find evidence that the demand for skills declined more between
2010 and 2014 in labor markets that were hit harder by the Great Recession. They identify this "down-
skilling" by comparing labor markets within the same year, whereas we estimate the overall time trend
across all labor markets. Beaudry, Green, and Sand (2016) document a "Great Reversal" in the demand for
cognitive tasks since 2000, although they do not directly measure employer skill demands. Moreover, their
data end in 2013, when the recovery was just beginning.

American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes averaged over 2004-2005 and
national employment changes at the 3-digit industry level. We obtain these MSA-level
"Bartik" shocks directly from the Hershbein and Kahn (2018) replication file. We also
use the change in the MSA-specific unemployment rate over the same period, following
Modestino, Shoag, and Ballance (2019). All of our results are weighted by the size of the
labor force in each MSA times the national share of employment for each 6-digit (SOC)
occupation code in 2005-2006.



3     Results

We begin by estimating the following empirical specification:


                    Yi,t,m = 0 +  (t × It + 1,t shock m × It ) +  Xm +               i ,t,m               (1)
                                     t


    We regress an indicator for whether the job vacancy requires a four-year bachelor's
degree on year fixed effects (t ), interacted with the MSA-specific Bartik shock (1,t ) de-
scribed above. We also include MSA-level demographic characteristics as controls.2 Stan-
dard errors are clustered at the MSA level, although we omit confidence intervals from
the Figures in all cases because the standard errors are so small.
    Figure 1 plots the share of job vacancies requiring a bachelor's degree by year, sepa-
rately for MSAs that experienced Bartik shocks at the 5th and 95th percentile respectively.
Specifically, we compute the implied value by multiplying the shock-by-year (1,t ) coef-
ficients times the actual values of the Bartik shock for MSAs at each percentile, and then
adding that value to the constant terms for each year.3
    2 Following Hershbein and Kahn (2018), we control for share female, share black/Hispanic/Asian, mar-
riage and migration rates, educational attainment and school enrollment, the age structure, labor force
participation and mean wages in each MSA in 2005-2006.
   3 The 5th and 95th percentile values of the Bartik shock are 3.135 and 4.406 respectively. The coefficient

on the 2010 shock is 0.025, resulting in a gap of (4.406-3.135)*0.025 = 0.032 percentage points between the
solid line and the dashed line in Figure 1. The Bartik shock coefficient is near zero in the years after 2011,
which explains why the two lines converge.


                                                      5
                                         Figure 1

   Similar to Hershbein and Kahn (2018), we find a larger increase in skill requirements
in labor markets that were hit harder by the Great Recession. This difference persists into
2011, and then disappears thereafter. As Figure 1 shows, the first order fact is that BA
requirements increased everywhere between 2007 and 2010, with a magnitude ranging
from 7 to 10 percentage points in the MSAs least and most affected. From 2012 to 2017,
the share of jobs requiring a bachelor's degree stabilizes around 32 percent, with little
or no differences across labor markets. In 2018 and 2019, it falls sharply to around 27
percent.
   The specification in equation (1) does not account for changes in the composition of
the BGT sample over time. Posting job vacancies online has become much more com-
mon over time. As an illustration, there are about 900,000 unique firm-occupation-MSA
combinations in 2007, compared to about 6 million in 2019. We account for possible com-
positional change by estimating:

                                            6
                   Yi,t,o,m, f = 0 + (t × It ) +  Xm + o,m, f +   i ,t,o ,m, f          (2)
                                    t

This specification is similar to equation (1), except that we remove the shock-by-year in-
teractions and instead include a series of progressively more detailed fixed effects.




                                         Figure 2


   Our first specification follows equation (1) in controlling only for MSA-level demo-
graphic characteristics. The second specification adds fixed effects for 6-digit SOC codes.
Our preferred specification controls for occupation-by-MSA-by-firm fixed effects (o,m, f ).
The year coefficients from each of these three specifications are plotted in Figure 2. The
dash-dotted line presents results that control only for MSA characteristics, and is similar
to Figure 1. The dashed line adds controls for six-digit occupation codes, which elimi-
nates the drop in bachelor's degree requirements in 2018 and 2019. The solid line shows
results from our preferred specification, which controls for occupation-by-MSA-by-firm

                                             7
fixed effects. Here we see that the share of job vacancies requiring a bachelor's degree in-
creased from 23 percent in 2007 to 34 percent in 2010, and then steadily increased to about
37 percent in 2019. In a balanced panel of firms, jobs and labor markets, the demand for
education has remained persistently higher a decade after the Great Recession.
    Appendix Figures A1 and A2 present results for high-skilled professional occupations
such as management, business, engineering and science.4 We find very large increases
­ between 20 and 30 percentage points - in the share of professional jobs that require a
bachelor's degree. Across all professional occupation categories, around two thirds of the
increase happened between 2007 and 2010, followed by a steady rise thereafter. Finally,
Appendix Figure A3 presents results separately for high-wage and low-wage cities.5 In
contrast to the "upskilling" results, we find that the demand for education has increased
more in high-wage cities. Not only did these cities experience larger increases in skill
demand between 2007 and 2010, but their post-recession growth has been greater as well.



4     Summary

We find large and persistent increases in skill demand following the Great Recession, dur-
ing a time when labor markets have become much tighter. This suggests that employer
skill upgrading is probably here to stay, and that many more job candidates will have to
obtain a four-year college degree to compete in the labor market of the 21st century.




    4 Figure A1 presents the year effects from estimates of our preferred specification separately for SOC

codes 11 (management) and 13 (business and finance). Figure 2 presents analogous results for SOC codes
15 (computer and mathematical), 17 (engineering and architecture) and 19 (life, physical and social sciences.
    5 We define high-wage cities as the 50 MSAs with the highest weekly earnings in 2006, according to

2005-2006 ACS data. We take this measure directly from the Hershbein and Kahn (2018) replication file.
