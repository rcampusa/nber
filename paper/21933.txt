                                            ABSTRACT

This paper is my presidential address to the Economic History Association. In it, I review and extend
the economic history of racial differences in per capita income from 1870 to the present. Specifically,
I revise pre-World War Two benchmark estimates of Black/White income ratios originally prepared
by Robert Higgs. The Higgs benchmarks suggest that the Black/White income ratio increased from
1870 to 1900, but the trend was flat from 1900 to 1940. Compared with the Higgs benchmarks, mine
show less convergence before 1900 but more between 1900 and 1940. When my new benchmarks
are combined with standard post-World War Two census data they suggest that the underlying pace
of Black/White income convergence has been absolutely slow, with the notable exceptions of the 1940s
and the period of the modern Civil Rights Movement. I explore the interpretation of these long-run
features with a model of intergenerational transmission of racial inequality in which racial differences
in causal factors that determine income are initially enormous after the Civil War and which erode
slowly across generations.

1. Introduction
--“The problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color line.”

                                                           W. E. B. Du Bois, The Souls of Black Folk



          The subject of this paper is the evolution of racial inequality in the United States from the

end of the Civil War to the present. This is a massive topic that needs to be circumscribed to be

manageable. I focus on per capita income and various causal factors, such as education and race

per se.


          The subject can be motivated in different ways. Mine is visual. I ask readers to recall

two sets of images. The first is from early September 2005. These are images from Hurricane

Katrina, the massively destructive storm that took the lives of over 1,800 people and obliterated

more than 100 billion (2005) dollars of property. The specific images are of poor African-

Americans from the Lower 12th Ward of New Orleans – in harm’s way and desperate to be

rescued by boat or helicopter -- and from around the Superdome – hungry, despondent, and

dead-tired. Millions of Americans and untold numbers around the world saw these images on

television. I could summon other depressing images of contemporary Black poverty from

Detroit, Baltimore, Chicago, Cleveland, or Ferguson, Missouri.


          The second set is from early November 2008. The setting is Grant Park, Chicago, on the

evening of Barack Obama’s election to his first term as President. To call this “historic” is an

understatement. We are a little more than a half-century after the March on Washington. Would

any of the leaders of the Civil Rights Movement at the time – Martin Luther King, John Lewis,

or others – have predicted an African-American president just fifty years later? I doubt it.




                                                    2
       At any juncture in modern American history other than Obama presidency we could

readily find photographs of poor Whites and contrast these with the smiling face in the White

House. But that contrast would not bring immediately to mind the subtext of race and its lengthy

historical baggage. I have chosen the Obama inauguration because the visual image is so

arresting, but it would be easy to summon many other examples, mundane and otherwise, of

highly successful African-Americans, in virtually any walk of economic life.


       I have two goals. The first is to review and revise the economic history of racial

differences in per capita income from 1870 to the present. Specifically, I shall be revising pre-

World War Two benchmark estimates of Black/White income ratios originally prepared by

Robert Higgs. The Higgs benchmarks suggest that the Black/White income ratio increased from

1870 to 1900, but the trend was flat from 1900 to 1940. Compared with the Higgs benchmarks,

mine show less convergence before 1900 but more between 1900 and 1940. While I believe my

benchmarks are an improvement, there is more work to be done. I welcome scrutiny and further

research.


       When my new benchmarks are combined with standard post-World War Two census data

they suggest that the underlying pace of Black/White income convergence has been slow, with

the notable exceptions of the 1940s and the period of the modern Civil Rights Movement. I

explore the interpretation of these long-run features with a model of intergenerational

transmission of inequality. Income convergence is slow because racial differences in causal

factors that determine income eroded slowly across generations and because initial racial

inequality after the Civil War itself was so glaring.




                                                  3
        My findings rationalize the imagery that I opened with. Because there has been long-run

convergence we can find numerous examples today of economic success in the Black

community. Because convergence has been far from complete we can, unfortunately, find even

more examples of Black poverty. Post-Civil Rights, there is relatively more Black economic

success than pre-Civil Rights but this reflects, in part, the cumulated accomplishments of prior

generations.


2. Black-White Per Capita Incomes, 1870 to the Present: A Revision
--“To be a poor man is hard, but to be a poor race in a land of dollars is the very bottom of
hardships.”
                                                         W. E. B. Du Bois, The Souls of Black Folk



        Labor economists studying the historical evolution of racial economic differences often

focus on earnings, typically those of males (Smith and Welch 1989; Donohue and Heckman

1991, Bound and Freeman 1992). I focus instead on the broader measure of per capita income,

which includes non-labor income and also the labor earnings of women. 1

        Before proceeding I wish to emphasize several caveats. There are severe gaps in the

historical record and strong assumptions must be made to make quantitative progress. There is

nothing special about this as long as the analysis is transparent, as I hope mine is. I am after the

big picture, not minute brush strokes.

          In focusing on racial differences in per capita income I am effectively assuming that all

income generated by Blacks (Whites) is consumed within the Black (White) community. While

not literally true, historically the bias here is small because there has been so little racial

 Historically, labor force participation rates of Black women exceeded those of Whites; see Goldin (1977) and
Boustan and Collins (2014).

intermarriage, a point I return to later in the paper. Moving forward, one could imagine a not-so-

distant future United States with far more racial mixing, in which case race-specific per capita

income figures would not make much economic sense.

        Focusing on per capita income necessarily obscures changes within group populations.

While it is quite plausible that income inequality within the Black population has changed in the

long run it is impossible to document this accurately. Because my interest is mainly in the long

run I stick with per capita income.

         My analysis pertains to the civilian, non-institutionalized population. The

institutionalized population includes those in prison and, in recent decades, Black incarceration

has increased absolutely and relative to White incarceration (Neal and Rick 2014; Bayer and

Charles 2015). It is far from obvious how to compute the “income” of prisoners but excluding

them likely biases the post-1980 trend in the Black/White income ratio, possibly upward. 2

                                                 [Figure 1 about here]

        With these caveats in mind I begin with Figure 1, which displays four time series. The

one labeled “Census” is derived from post-World War Two data. From 1967 to the present

(2014), this series is the ratio of the Census Bureau’s annual estimates of Black and White per

capita income. For 1948 to 1966 the ratio is estimated by multiplying the Black-White ratio of




2
 In terms of Figure 1, the bias in the post-1980 trend in the Black/White income ratio would be upward if the income
of prisoners were less than the income generated by the same people were they not incarcerated and said income
were measured in the civilian economy (as opposed to the underground economy). On the other hand, Figure 1
makes no adjustment for imputed income from equity in owner-occupied housing. If imputed income were
incorporated into my estimates, the extent of long-run racial convergence would increase because Black/White
differences in home ownership have narrowed considerably since the end of the Civil War (Collins and Margo 2001,
2007, 2011). There has been significant racial convergence in expectation of life at birth since the early twentieth
century (Boustan and Margo 2015). Consequently racial differences in the present discounted value of lifetime
earnings narrowed more in the long run than in current per capita income. I note this point, but do not explore it
quantitatively.

adult earnings by a scaling factor. 3 Prior to 1948 there are no annual data to construct a

counterpart to the Census Bureau series. Instead, I show the three benchmark estimates for ca.

1870, 1900, and 1940 made by Robert Higgs (1977, 1989); my revisions to the Higgs

benchmarks; and a series pertaining to adult men prepared by James Smith (1984) for the census

years 1890 to 1980. 4

         I begin by focusing on the Higgs benchmarks and the post-World War Two census data

treating the two as if they were joined at the hip – the Higgs-cum-census series. In the

immediate aftermath of the Civil War, Black income per capita was far lower than White –

according to the Higgs benchmark, just shy of a quarter (0.24) ca. 1870. 5 That is, for every

dollar of income received by Whites in the immediate aftermath of the Civil War, Blacks

received 24 cents.

         My focus in this paper is on what happened next but it is also natural to compare the ca.

1870 benchmark with an ante-bellum counterpart. On the one hand, per capita income declined

sharply in the South after the Civil War, absolutely and relative to income elsewhere in the

nation (Engerman 1966; Goldin 1979). If the decline where shared proportionately by race,

Blacks would have borne the greater brunt, because relatively more were Southern, compared

with Whites. On the other hand, the vast majority of Blacks before the Civil War were

enslaved, and slaves were exploited in the neoclassical (economic) sense – they received

“income” (primarily food, clothing, and shelter) less than the value of their marginal product at

any point in time and over the life-cycle. Appendix A briefly discusses a range of (highly)

  The scaling factor is s = (Black/White ratio of per capita incomes)/(Black/White ratio of adult earnings). The
scaling factor is the average over the period for which race-specific series on per capita income and adult earnings
are both available.

  The Higgs benchmark is ca. 1870 in that most of the data used in constructing it pertains to ca. 1867-68. My
benchmark pertains to 1870 proper.

  Smith’s text (1984) is clear that his series was based on occupation status, not income but when he presented his
results in tabular form, the title read “Black-White Male Income Ratios”.

provisional estimates of Black/White ratios for 1860; these are constructed in the same general

manner as the 1870 and 1900 benchmarks (Higgs and mine). 6 The range of Black/White ratios

falls between 0.22 and 0.31, with 0.26 as a plausible point estimate. This range encompasses

both the Higgs ca. 1870 benchmark and my revision to it for 1870. The Civil War ended

American slavery as it was known, but it does not seem to have led to an immediate increase in

the relative per capita income of African-Americans.

         Returning to the narrative moving forward, between 1870 and 1900 Blacks managed to

increase their average income relative to Whites by 11 percentage points, or from 0.24 to 0.35,

according to the Higgs benchmarks. The relative progress was short-lived, however. From 1900

to 1940 convergence in per capita income stalled completely – the Higgs benchmark for 1940 is

0.34, slightly lower than in 1900 (0.35).

         After 1940 the series takes a decidedly upward turn. Between 1940 and 1960 the ratio

grows at a steady pace, which then accelerates in the 1960s. But in the late 1970s the upward

trend loses steam, and the pace of convergence after 1980 was much slower than during the

proceeding four decades. In 2010, the most recent Census year, the ratio is 0.64 – for every

dollar of income accruing to a White person the average Black received 64 cents. 7

         Over the 140 years between 1870 and 1910, therefore, the Black-White income ratio

increased by 40 percentage points according to the Higgs-cum-census series. The increase is not

uniformly continuous but occurs in a step-function or “episodic” manner in which periods of

relatively strong, steady convergence are followed by periods of stasis (1900-40) or slower

convergence (1980-present). Although the post-World War Two annual data display many ups


6
  That is, I start with estimates of Black and national per capita income and the Black population share, back out
White per capita income from the national identity, and form the Black/White ratio.
7
  It is noteworthy that the average ratio over the period 1999-2014 is also 0.64 (see Figure 1); that is, there has been
no upward movement in the Black/White income ratio since the turn of the 21st century.

                                                            7
and downs, there are no lengthy periods of “regression to the mean” during which the ratio

returns to a previous level – that is, the gains experienced during the convergence episode are

sustained. The convergence episodes are of moderate duration, approximately one human

generation (1870-1900) or somewhat longer (1940-1980).

       A consensus narrative has emerged to accompany the Higgs-cum-census series. That

some racial convergence took place between 1870 and 1900 is very plausible. The vast majority

of Blacks lived in the South before 1900, and events in that region dominate movements in the

numerator of the income ratio. Post-Emancipation, former slaves were able to migrate on their

own accord in seek of better economic opportunities (Higgs 1977). Migration within the South

was substantial, even if a large scale flow to the North was still in the future (Boustan 2015).

Adult Black illiteracy declined between 1870 and 1900, absolutely and relative to White;

literates had higher incomes on average than illiterates, regardless of race (Collins and Margo

2006). In the six Southern states that kept records after the Civil War, Blacks accumulated

taxable wealth more rapidly than Whites from 1870 to 1900 (Higgs 1982; Margo 1984).

Consistent with this, census data show Blacks moving up the agricultural ladder, especially in

owner-operator status which increased from hardly any in 1870 to around a quarter in 1900

(Higgs 1977; Collins and Margo 2011).

       But a backlash followed. Black voting rights established for men under the 15th

Amendment were drastically curtailed in the South in the late nineteenth century, and de jure

segregation expanded its reach (Woodward 1955; Kousser 1974; Valelly 2004). When law

alone proved inadequate to enforce White supremacy, Blacks were kept “in their place” through

terror and violence. Working in the opposite direction to narrow the income gap, Black

migration to the North increased when migrants got a “foot in the door” during and after World



                                                 8
War One (Whatley, 1990; Collins 1997). The economic gains to migrants were substantial but

evidently insufficient in the aggregate to further narrow the racial gap at the national level prior

to World War Two (Collins and Wanamaker 2014; Boustan 2015).

         Convergence resumed in the 1940s. During the War the United States experienced a

“Great Compression” in incomes. All incomes rose in real terms but especially those at the

bottom, which includes Black incomes (Goldin and Margo 1992; Maloney 1994; Margo 1995).

Black migration from the rural South picked up substantially during the War, and there were

special gains for those who found employment in the defense industry. Early attempts at federal

anti-discrimination intervention into the labor market, such as Roosevelt’s 1943 executive order

also played a role in fostering racial convergence (Collins 2001). Absolutely and relative to

White women, Black women substantially increased their incomes and upgraded their

occupational status after 1940 (Bailey and Collins 2006).

       The gains of the 1940s were sustained in the 1950s, and then further enhanced during the

Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s. In a famous article, John Donohue and James Heckman

(1991; see also Wright 2013) identified 1963 to 1975 as the key period of “episodic change”.

The locus was the South. By this time Black-White ratios outside the South were already

relatively high, and significant convergence in the aggregate ratio required a reduction in the

racial gap in the South. This gap did decline, and Donohue and Heckman argue that it did so

largely in response to anti-discrimination pressure from the federal government.

       Between 1940 and 1970 the Black-White income ratio rose by about 7.7 percentage

points per decade. If this pace of convergence had continued for the next forty years, the Black-

White ratio in 2010 would have been 0.88, instead of its actual value of 0.64. As Figure 1

shows, convergence slowed markedly around 1979.         There is a vast and ever growing literature



                                                  9
in modern labor economics examining post-1980 racial differences, and no shortage of

explanatory factors for the convergence slowdown. A partial list would include de-

industrialization, skill-bias technical change, and other forces leading to widening of wage

inequality; the emergence of “bad ghettos” in the 1970s and related aspects of central city

(economic) decline, some associated with the 1960s riots; a slowdown in racial convergence in

educational attainment; mass incarceration and its attendant effects on employment and earnings;

rising immigration; a slowdown in government employment, particularly at the federal level; a

reversal of some of the political and regulatory gains of the Civil Rights era; and continued racial

prejudice, less public than in the past but burrowed deeply into the nation’s institutional

framework and White consciousness. 8 It is far easier to list plausible causes of the post-1980

convergence slowdown than to convincingly quantify their relative importance, and I shall not

attempt to do so here.

        From my recounting it is clear that the Higgs benchmarks are a central part of the

consensus narrative. I shall be revising these benchmarks in what follows but readers should

keep in mind that the main point that Higgs (1977, 1989) wished to establish was that some

convergence occurred before World War Two, including during the post-bellum era. Not only

do I reach the same conclusion, cumulatively the absolute amount of convergence in percentage

points between 1870 and 1940 –10 percentage points -- is the same as Higgs. The difference is

in how I allocate pre-World War Two convergence pre-1900 versus after.

        My revisions to the Higgs benchmarks and their rationale are described in detail in

Appendix B. In brief, I contend that Higgs over-estimated Black per capita income in 1900 but

underestimated it in 1870 and 1940.

8
 The literature here is very long. See, for example, Juhn, Murphy, and Pierce (1991); Bound and Freeman (1992);
Cutler, Glaeser, and Vigdor (1999); Collins and Margo (2000, 2004, 2007); Neal (2006); Boustan and Margo
(2009); Borjas, Grogger, and Hanson (2010); Neal and Rick (2014); and Bayer and Charles (2015).

                                                       10
        The over-estimation of Black per capita income in 1900 occurs in part because Higgs

over-adjusted for non-wage perquisites received by farm laborers and also overestimated their

annual incomes; in addition, I argue that Higgs overestimated the average annual income of

Black farmers. In 1870 and 1900 Higgs estimated Black per capita income first, and then

computed White per capita income as a residual from the identity linking national per capita

income to its race-specific components. Thus, if Black income is over-estimated, White income

is too low, and the Black-White income ratio is overstated. I contend this happens in 1900. The

Higgs 1900 benchmark is 0.35; mine is 0.32.

        For 1870 my benchmark (0.28) is higher than Higgs (0.24) for two reasons. 9 First, I

estimate a somewhat higher figure for Black agricultural income. Second, my estimate pertains

to 1870 proper, whereas the Higgs benchmark pertains to 1867-68 (and thus is c. 1870).

Agricultural labor markets in the South were severely disrupted in the immediate aftermath of

the Civil War, and it is plausible this temporarily depressed Black incomes.

        For 1940 Higgs used a different procedure to estimate his benchmark, working directly

with an equation for the Black/White ratio. As described in Appendix B, I argue that Higgs

underestimated Black non-wage and salary income. Adjusting for this raises the Black/White

ratio and thus my 1940 benchmark (0.38) is higher than the Higgs benchmark (0.34).

         Returning to Figure 1, my new benchmarks suggest that, instead of convergence

occurring entirely before 1900 a la Higgs, it now occurs more or less continuously between 1870

and 1940. As previously noted, the total amount of convergence between 1870 and 1940 is the

same, but the timing is different.



9
 As Higgs (1989, p. 12) notes, Ransom and Sutch (1979) thought the Higgs 1870 benchmark (0.24) was biased
downwards whereas Sholmowitz (1983, p. 274) thought it was biased upwards; my revision sides with Ransom and
Sutch.

                                                     11
        Aside from the qualitative differences with Higgs in the timing of pre-1940 convergence,

my new benchmarks show greater quantitative change between 1900 and 1940 than suggested by

Smith (1984). However, a prima facie case can be made that that Smith understates the extent of

pre-1940 racial convergence in male worker incomes, and therefore in per capita incomes. To

understand why it is useful to review first how Smith originally made his estimates.

        Although Smith labels his estimates as “income” ratios they are not. Rather, they are

occupation-status ratios. Smith estimates national average, race-specific income-occupation

weights for 1970 based on the federal census and he uses these (same) weights to value the race-

specific occupation distributions for the census years 1890 to 1980. His Black/White ratios

change only if Black men shift into higher income occupations (as measured in 1970) relative to

White men. 10 Pointedly, they do not change when the wage distribution shifts.

        The recent book by Claudia Goldin and Lawrence Katz (2008) shows there was a secular

decline in the returns to schooling from 1890 to 1940.             During the post-World War Two period,

there is a significant negative correlation (time series or cross-section) between relative Black

incomes and the returns to schooling – that is, when returns to schooling decrease Black-White

income differences narrow, and vice versa (Mahoney 1994; Margo 1995; Juhn, Murphy, and

Pierce 1991; Bayer and Charles 2015). There is no reason to suppose a different dynamic before

World War Two. Because Smith’s income weights are constant, they cannot, by design,

accommodate the plausible impact – positive -- of the pre-1940 decline in the returns to

schooling on Black-White income convergence. 11

10
   By the same logic in the text, Smith’s ratios also understate convergence between 1940 and 1980 because they fail
to reflect wage convergence within occupations as well as the effects of the “Great Compression” of the 1940s; see
Smith and Welch (1989), Goldin and Margo (1992), and Margo (1990, 1995).
11
   Goldin and Katz document a 14 percentage point decline in the returns to schooling from 1915 to 1940. To get
some idea how this might have affected relative Black incomes before World War Two, I estimated a cross-state
bivariate regression using state-level data for 1960. The dependent variable is the actual Black/White income ratio
in the state, relative to the Black-White ratio of occupational status, and the independent variable is the ratio of

                                                        12
        Second, in the late nineteenth century per capita incomes in the South were far below the

national average (Engerman 1966; Goldin 1979). The overwhelmingly majority of the African-

American population lived in the South at the time, a far higher percentage than Whites.

Economically speaking, Black workers suffered from a substantial income “spatial mismatch”

across states, primarily one of region – the South versus the non-South. I shall more to say

about spatial mismatch later. Here, I simply point out that at the national level the Black/White

income ratio in the aftermath of the Civil War would have been far below one even if both races

received the per capita income of the states in which they resided.

                                                  [Table 1 about here]

        Over time, there was pressure on the Southern economy to converge on the non-South

through out-migration, capital inflows, and factor price equalization. Table 1 presents three

simulated Black-White income ratios. These are measures of Black cross-state “spatial

mismatch”. 12 The first computes the Black/White ratio multiplying state per capita incomes by

the race-specific population shares for the given year. This captures the overall change in spatial

mismatch. The second holds per capita income constant at the 1920 level but allows population

shares to change over time; this captures the migration, or population redistribution effect. The

third holds population shares constant at 1920 levels but allows per capita income to change.

This is the “regression to the mean” effect.

        Overall, Black cross-state spatial mismatch worsened slightly between 1880 and 1900.

However, after 1900, mismatch declined. Most of the erosion occurred because of the spatial


college to high school average incomes for Whites. The regression coefficient is negative – a reduction in the
White returns to schooling is associated with a higher Black-White (true) income ratio, relative to Black-White
occupation status. Details are available from the author on request.
12
   The simulated ratios are obviously much higher than the actual ratios because, within states, Black incomes were
lower than White incomes. The notion of spatial mismatch originates in the iconic article by John Kain (1968), who
argued that the suburbanization of jobs after World War Two coupled with the continued segregation of urban
Blacks in central cities reduced Black employment and incomes.

                                                        13
redistribution of the Black population but some, particularly in the 1930s, happened because of

regression to the mean. A portion of the population redistribution effect is captured by Smith

because some transitions of Black labor out of agriculture are positively collated with migration

out of the rural South. 13 None of the regression to the mean effect – 4 percentage points in total

between 1880 and 1940 -- is captured by Smith, however. To summarize, it is very likely that

Smith’s ratios understate the extent of racial income convergence among adult men prior to

World War Two and, as such, the overall extent of Black-White convergence in per capita

income.

        At this point caution is warranted. While I believe my new benchmarks improve upon

Higgs they are based on reworking of existing evidence with many judgement calls on my part

(see Appendix B). There are five census years between 1870 and 1940 for which there are no

benchmarks, Higgs or Margo. I cannot dismiss the possibility that the pre-1940 continuity

evident in the Margo-cum-Census series might evaporate with new data or more benchmarks. I

have offered an explanation why Smith’s series understates Black-White convergence before

World War Two, but that is different than providing direct evidence.

        To conclude this section, I have reviewed the long-run history of Black/White per income

differences. In doing so, I have revised pre-World War Two benchmark estimates of

Black/White per capita income ratios. The caveats just noted aside, the revised benchmarks do

not change the overall amount of convergence before World War Two but do indicate a

smoother time path, with one major medium-run transitional deviation that occurred between

1940 and 1980.



13
  However, many Southern blacks already had non-agricultural jobs before migrating to the North. To the extent
that their occupation remained the same – unskilled non-farm laborer, say – there would be no impact on Smith’s
ratios, because his income weights do not incorporate regional differences in pay.

3. Interpreting the Time Series: Intergenerational Transmission


--“But what on earth is whiteness that one should so desire it? Then always, somehow, some
way, silently but clearly I am given to understand that whiteness is the ownership of the earth
forever and ever, Amen!”
                                                                      W. E. B. Du Bois, Darkwater



       Between 1870 and 2010 the Black/White ratio of per capita income increased from 0.28

to 0.64, or by 36 percentage points. Ten points of the increase, or about 28 percent, occurred

before 1940 – the midpoint of my long run -- with remainder, 26 points (72 percent) occurring

after. There is still a large racial divide in income but, relatively speaking, the divide is much

smaller than in 1870 or 1940. This has two basic implications, as noted in my Introduction.

Because we have come fairly far, it is much easier to find examples of economically successful

African-Americans today than in the distant (or not-so-distant) past. Because we have far to go

it is, regrettably, easy to find numerous contemporary examples of Black poverty.

       In this section I focus not on the ups and downs of convergence per se but rather its long

run pace. Assuming a human generation to be 25-30 years there are roughly 5-6 generations

between 1870 and 2010. On average, each generation experienced a 7.7 percentage point

increase in the Black-White income ratio. How shall we interpret this number? As a way of

approaching this question I propose to think in terms of a model of intergenerational

transmission of inequality (Becker and Tomes 1979; Solon 1992, 2014, 2015).

       By “intergenerational transmission” I am referring to the relationship between economic

status in generation T and status in the prior generation, T – 1. In economics, interest has

mushroomed with the availability of modern household panels, such as the Panel Study of

Income Dynamics and the National Longitudinal Survey, which track households across

                                                 15
generations (see, for example, Solon 1992; Mazumder 2005; Aaronson and Mazumder 2008;

Black and Devereux 2011; Davis and Mazumder 2013). The canonical regression is given by

equation [1]:



[Eq. 1]: Ln yt = β x Ln yt-1 + εt



Here, yt is income, t is the current generation and t – 1 the previous generation; ε is an i.i.d.

random error; and β is the intergenerational elasticity, or IGE. In estimating the IGE steps need

to be taken to reduce the effects of transitory variation in income over the life-cycle, otherwise, β

will be biased towards zero. 14 When this is done, modern IGE estimates for the United States

fall in the range of 0.3 to 0.6, with 0.5 being a focal point (Solon 2015). Historical estimates are

less common and are almost never truly comparable with modern estimates, because historical

estimates typically measure the transmission of occupation or occupational status rather than

income per se (Ferrie and Long 2013; Olivetti and Paserman 2015). This caveat aside, historical

estimates also tend to fall into the same numerical range (see, for example, Olivetti and

Paserman 2015).

         In expectation, [Eq. 1] gives predicted or average mobility across generations – if a child

grows up poor, on average the child may or may not be as poor as an adult. The expectation

depends on initial conditions – how poor the upbringing -- and the magnitude of the IGE. If the


14
  In recent work, Gregory Clark (2014) has made a provocative argument that, despite steps typically taken to
reduce measurement error in individual earnings data, standard IGE estimates are biased downward, and 0.7-0.8 is a
plausible estimate of the “true” IGE. Clark’s argument can be recast as follows (see Solon 2015). Let S be true
“social status” which in any generation is measured with error by income: S = Y + ε. Because S is not observed, we
are forced to use data on Y to estimate [eq. 1]. However, because S is measured with error by Y, the coefficient β in
[eq. 1] will be biased downward. Averaging Y or similar measures within a group reduces the impact of the
measurement error, raising the estimate of β. “Social” mobility is not the same, in other words, as “income”
mobility, and the history of race in America offers a pertinent example.


                                                         16
IGE is close to zero, there is little or no correlation on average between poverty as a child and as

an adult. However, if the IGE is one, there is perfect immobility on average.

         In applying this logic to the problem at hand, the idea is that, even if generation t-1 of

Blacks has much lower income than Whites in t-1 on average, if β = 0.5 there should be fairly

substantial “regression to the mean” evident in generation t. again on average. As an example,

suppose the IGE ca. 1870 is 0.5, and the initial Black-White income ratio is 0.28. The predicted

Black-White income ratio one generation later, ca. 1900, is 0.53. 15 This is far higher than my

1900 benchmark, 0.32 – that is, [eq.1] seems to over-predict the extent of convergence in the late

nineteenth century.

         Alternatively, we could start with a ratio of 0.32 in 1900 (my benchmark), and predict the

ratio in 1930. The predicted ratio is 0.57. There is no benchmark for 1930, but if there were it is

inconceivable it would be this high. In 1980, the income ratio is 0.58; with an IGE of 0.5, the

predicted ratio in 2010 is 0.76, compared with an actual ratio of 0.64. The general pattern, then,

is that an IGE of 0.5 significantly over-predicts racial convergence across adjacent generations.

A partial exception is mid-century. If I start with my 1940 (1950) benchmark of 0.38 (0.41), the

predicted ratio for 1970 (1980) is 0.62 (0.64), which is not much higher than the actual ratio of

0.57 (0.58).

         To solve the over-prediction problem, labor economists propose adding a “group fixed

effect” to [eq. 1] (Becker and Tomes 1979; Hertz 2007; Bhattacharya and Mazumder. 2011;

Mazumder 2014). The group effect is negative, implying less intergenerational mobility for

Blacks than for Whites, controlling for income in the previous generation. In an instructive

mathematical example, Solon (2015) shows that a group fixed of the correct magnitude will

15
  Ln (0.53) = 0.5 x Ln (0.28). I am playing somewhat fast and loose with the prediction from [eq. 1] because per
capita income is a weighted average across generations, and some of the over-prediction error in the late nineteenth
century reflects the continued presence of ex-slave generations in the labor market.

                                                         17
reproduce the pattern of Black-White convergence across generations, and yet maintain an

individual-level IGE in the standard range within race. 16

         In thinking about this standard fix, I wish to stress two points. First, [eq. 1] does not

describe a causal mechanism. The underlying “cause” of the Black-White income ratio in the

current generation is not the income ratio in the previous generation. 17 Rather, there are causal

factors that determine income in today’s generation, along with race and “luck” (the error term).

These causal factors are transmitted across generations -- along with racial identity itself,

because the groups have to be reproduced for the group effect to be economically meaningful.

         Second, in quantitatively assessing the factors accounting for the pace of convergence

over time, we can only do as well as the data permit. I believe that if we could better measure

the factors explaining income in each generation as well as how race impacted the ability of each

generation to acquire these factors (or not), social scientists could better account for the pace of

racial convergence in the long run.

         To facilitate this argument I sketch a toy intergenerational model that allows for an

endogenous race effect. The model, inspired by Stuhler (2014) and Stuhler and Nybom (2014),

focuses on labor income (see below for a discussion of wealth). There are three equations:



16
   In Solon’s (2015) numerical simulation, Black-White differences die out in accordance with a β of about 0.8,
which happens to be the value that also rationalizes my long run time series. The recent study by Collins and
Wanamaker (2015a) can also be interpreted along the same lines. Collins and Wanamaker examine the dependence
of son’s position in the income distribution relative to father’s, using linked samples of Black and White southerners
from 1880 to 1900, and 1910 to 1930. As in Smith (1984) “income” in Collins and Wanamaker is really
occupational status, but the authors take great care that their protocol captures at least some relevant racial,
geographic, and temporal variation. At my request Collins and Wanamaker estimated [eq. 1] with a race dummy
using their linked 1880-1900 and 1910-1930 samples; as my argument in the text suggests, the coefficient of the
race dummy is negative.
17
   I recognize that income can have a causal effect via the intergenerational transmission of human capital. For
example, in a model of optimal schooling if individuals are unable to borrow fully against future earnings parental
income will serve as a substitute (Loury 1981). Higher income parents will likely have higher human capital on
average, creating a positive correlation across generations. This is certainly relevant to the long-run evolution of
Black-White schooling differences; see Margo (1990) and Baker (2015). For an alternative perspective see
Cameron and Heckman (2001)

                                                         18
Equation [2a]:                 ln yt = βwwt + βhht + εyt

Equation [2b]:                 wt = λrwt-1 + εrt

Equation [2c]:                 ht = γwt + λhht-1 + εht



Here as before, y is income and t indexes the generation. The variable w is “whiteness” – recall

the quote from DuBois that opens this section -- or racial identity; h is “human capital” and the

β’s are their market prices; βw > 0 and βh > 0. Racial identity and human capital are transmitted

from generation t – 1 to t via the λ parameters and subject to the error terms.

         The model is obviously simplified in the extreme. Equation [2a], for example, subsumes

any explicit role for labor force participation or gender in the analysis of racial convergence. 18

Equations [2a] and [2b] are reduced-form shorthand for highly complex processes that are

difficult to model formally but which can be described verbally, albeit with limited rigor. 19 The

processes begin very early in life, indeed, in utero. In infancy and early childhood, w and h are

produced close to home which may include interactions with siblings and other relatives,

including prior generations (e.g. grandparents), friends and neighbors. Around age 6 or so

children venture forth, interacting with their peers and other adults (e.g. teachers) away from

home – for example, in school or neighborhood play. The nature and extent of these

interactions remains affected by the home environment, to which may be added institutions and



18
   Labor force participation is important empirically because, in the very long run, the racial gap in aggregate
participation (labor force/population) has widened. One cannot, however, compute the effect of the widening on
per capita income convergence because some of the widening is endogenous. The most important component is
schooling; instead of entering the labor force full time at a very young age as was true under slavery, post-Civil War
generations of Black children attended school. In the early 20th century this was a clear tradeoff made by their
parents between current consumption and the well-being of future generations, which began to change as technology
and other factors lowed the value of child labor in the Southern economy (Margo 1990; Baker, 2015).
19
   Another obvious limitation is that the setup of the model treats the λ parameters as independent of the β
parameters but this would not be true in an optimizing framework in which the incentives to invest in human capital
or racial identity are determined in part by their labor market prices.

                                                         19
social norms, technology, and the government. Finally, children grow up and leave home with

their stocks of w and h, forming households of their own, starting the process anew.

       Importantly, [eq. 2c] includes a direct role for racial identity to affect human capital

development. In terms of my verbal description of the process, this occurs primarily because

“social capital” matters in human capital production and because racial identity influences access

to institutions and social networks complementary to human capital production (Loury 1977,

2002; Bowles, Loury, and Sethi 2014; Chay and Munshi 2015). The presumption is that γ > 0

because of de jure and de facto segregation. De jure segregation matters because, historically,

Blacks were legally excluded from or discriminated against in access to institutions that would

have promoted human capital development, the most obvious example being schools. De facto

segregation matters because social capital and institutional access continue to be correlated with

racial identify even without the force of law.

       Appendix C derives the IGE for income in adjacent generations in the model. The

crucial points are: (1) if w and h explain most of the variance in ln y; (2) intergenerational

transmission of w and h is strongly persistent or γ is absolutely large; then the IGE will be

substantial and racial convergence across generations potentially very slow. This coupled with

very large initial gaps in w and h creates strong links across generations – what I have referred to

elsewhere as “intergenerational drag” (Margo 1990) -- making racial inequality persistent.

In what follows I shall focus mostly on intergenerational transmission of w and h – equations

[2b] and [2c] – but I will return to the role played by the β parameters at the end of the section.

       As I conceive it, racial identity is not readily observable by the econometrician except for

one correlate – namely, whether individuals are classified in a census-type survey as Black or

White. We might assume a cutoff value, w*, such that if w < w*, the individual is classified as



                                                 20
Black and if w > w*, as White. 20 Although racial identity is not readily measurable in a

statistical sense, it can be described. It is, to be sure, complexion, but it is much more than skin

color – behavior, culture, dress, speech.

         There can be little doubt that λw has been close to one, right up the present day. The

proximate cause is the extraordinary low rate of formation of racially mixed Black and White

households, historically and at present, coupled with high rates of residential and social

segregation (Cutler, Glaeser, and Vigdor 1999; Fryer 2007). To be sure, racial intermarriage was

illegal under state law in many states until the Supreme Court declared such legislation

unconstitutional in Loving v. Virginia in 1967. But even in places were marriage between Blacks

and Whites was technically permitted by law prior to Loving, it was still very rare. Until quite

recently in American history, the multitude of factors that kept Black women from forming

households with White men with greater frequency, or (even more strongly) Black men with

White women were extremely rigid and severe. Consequently, the very great majority of Black

children had (and have) Black parents – white children, White parents.

         The above speaks to the divide between races but, historically, within the Black

population there was a long history of social differentiation along various dimensions. The

origins of this differentiation can be traced to slavery, in which light-complexioned chattel

commanded a higher market price (Bodenhorn 2015). Sexual contact between master and slave

was not infrequent, with the consequence sometimes being light-complexioned progeny. The

frequency of interracial sex post-slavery cannot be readily tracked but, of course, still happened.

20
  Historically, w* might be identified with the so-called “one drop” rule – namely, any degree of African genetic
ancestry, no matter how small. During the period of de jure segregation, the one drop rule served to distinguish
legal access to racially separate public facilities. However, as discussed in the text we know from recent studies of
racial passing (Mill and Stein 2012; Nix and Qian 2015) some individuals managed to get themselves classified as
White in the current census when they were Black in the previous census. The key point about a categorical (as
opposed to continuous) measure of racial identity is that, to the extent that w and h positively co-vary, inadequate
measurement of h will be reflected in a larger value in the coefficient of a race dummy in, for example, a regression
of labor earnings.

                                                         21
Mixed-race individuals -- mulattos – account for approximately 20 percent of the Black

population in 1910. For the post-Civil War censuses that so enquired there is abundant evidence

of positive correlations between mulatto status and socioeconomic outcomes (Bodenhorn 2015).

       Beyond complexion there was differentiation with respect to behavior and other

characteristics. In her remarkable memoir Negroland, Margo Jefferson (2015) writes about her

childhood growing up among Chicago’s Black elite, a tiny sliver of economic privilege.

Jefferson’s father was the chief of pediatrics at Provident Hospital; her mother, a “socialite” (p.

8). Jefferson played piano, attended Interlochen arts camp in Michigan in the summer,

graduated from the University of Chicago Laboratory School and later Brandeis. Her parents

warned her that “few Negroes enjoyed their privilege and plenty” (p. 163). She was taught to

have “gloves, handkerchiefs, pocketbooks for each occasion … [g]ood diction … skin care (no

ashy knees or elbows); hair cultivation … [m]anners to please grandparents and quell the doubts

of any white strangers loitering to observe your behavior in schools, stores and restaurants” (p.

165). To become pregnant and drop out of college was the equivalent of “matricide”; a girl who

slipped up “destroyed the good reputation her mother, her grandmothers and her grandmothers’

grandmothers had fought for since slavery” (p. 166). The elite believed that other Blacks should

“be emulating us when too many of them (out of envy or ignorance) went on behaving in ways

that encouraged racial prejudice” (p. 3). To themselves the elite were “self-designated

aristocrats, educated, affluent, accomplished” but to Whites they “were oddities, underdogs, and

interlopers” (pp. 90-91).


       Perhaps the most extreme historical manifestation of differentiation within the Black

population was racial “passing”. Instances of racial passing can be inferred when an individual

who was classified as Black in one census shows up as White in another. To pass at all required


                                                 22
a person not only to be sufficiently light-skinned but also exhibit sufficient “whiteness” in all

other respects to be credible within one’s social and residential network, which may explain why

passers are found more frequently among migrants settling among dark-complexioned, foreign

born Whites. Recent advances in computing have permitted economic historians to investigate

the quantitative extent of racial passing, although it may be some time before a consensus is

reached on the magnitudes (Mill and Stein 2012; Nix and Qian 2015). For my argument, what

matters is not the exact percentage of the Black population that passed at some point before

World War Two, but that passing was not extraordinarily uncommon – which appears the case.

        Changes in racial identity that served to assimilate Blacks into the majority culture would

tend to push λw away from one. But working in the opposite direction is the historical

development of a distinctive, shared “Blackness” creating strong pressures against “acting white”

(Austen-Smith and Fryer 2005; Fryer and Torelli 2010; Fryer, Kahn, Levitt, and Spenkuch 2012).

It is sometimes argued that this development was largely a manifestation of the Civil Rights

Movement but there is abundant evidence that it long pre-dates the 1960s. An important and

recently studied example involves naming patterns.            Black parents, it turns out, were giving

their offspring distinctively Black names in the early twentieth century, long before the practice

become common in recent decades (Fryer and Levitt 2004b; Cook, Logan, and Parman 2014). 21

        The above discussion speaks to the supply-side of racial identity. But there is also a

demand side, and this is reflected in the portion of βw that represents pure racial discrimination in

the economic sense.       At its root discrimination must reflect prejudicial tastes as in Becker

(1957) or imperfect information as in Arrow (1973), or some of both. But tastes and imperfect

information is not deus ex machina. The transmission of racist attitudes across generations plays

21
 Using death certificates from North Carolina from 1802 to 1970, Cook, Logan, Parman (2016) show that Black
men with distinctively Black names had slightly longer life expectancies compared with other African-American
men.

                                                      23
an important role – as Oscar Hammerstein II put it succinctly in one of the songs from South

Pacific, “You’ve got to be carefully taught”.

        There is no doubt that expressions of racial prejudice in their most extreme public forms

have diminished over time in the United States. In the early twentieth century popular culture

was permeated by racial stereotypes. The expression of racial epithets by public figures was

unremarked upon, with little or no consequence to the perpetrator at the time. But gradually

attitudes began to change and society no longer tolerated overt expressions of racial prejudice by

public figures. Various features of Black culture and racial identity that were formerly shunned

have long entered the mainstream. This is different, of course, from what people carry in the

hearts and minds. Nevertheless, it seems reasonable to argue that βw today in the United States

is smaller in absolute value than was the case early in the twentieth century, in part because of

local, state, and federal anti-discrimination legislation but also because of the secular decline of

overt prejudice (Neal and Johnson 1996; Fryer 2011). 22

        The second component of my argument invokes human capital. Again, I am arguing that

λh is substantial and, moreover γ, which is the race-specific component of human capital

production, has also been large at various historical junctures. I will illustrate by focusing on

schooling at some length, but the same general argument applies to other forms of human capital,

such as location (see below).

        The vast majority of slaves received no education. Antebellum free Blacks in the South

were also severely constrained in their schooling opportunities, if somewhat less so than slaves.

Black children in non-Southern states could (and did) attend school before the Civil War but

were a small fraction of the Black population at the time.


 As discussed later in the section and in Appendix C a decline in βw will speed up the process of convergence in
22

my toy model, with the effect being most dramatic during the transition period (Nybom and Stuhler 2014).

                                                        24
       Consequently it is not surprising, if depressing, to find extraordinarily high rates of Black

illiteracy in 1870, the first post-bellum census. In 1870, 79.1 percent of the Black population age

20 and older was illiterate, compared with 8.3 percent of the Whites, implying a racial illiteracy

gap of 70.8 percentage points. Illiteracy here corresponds to total inability to read or write in any

language, implying no schooling whatsoever.

       Economic historians and labor economists have stressed that the initial racial illiteracy

gap eroded fairly quickly over time (Higgs 1977; Smith 1984; Margo 1990; Collins and Margo

2006). In 1930, 18.6 percent of Blacks ages 20 and older were illiterate compared with 3.4

percent of Whites, a racial gap of 15.4 points. This represents a reduction of 55 percentage

points in six decades, or two generations.

       The racial gap in illiteracy could have narrowed through widespread teaching of adult

Blacks. This never happened. Instead, the gap eroded as successive generations of Black

children attended school. The vast majority of these were public schools established in the ex-

Confederate states as a condition for returning to the Union. These schools were de jure

segregated about which I will have more to say momentarily but my point here is that the schools

were crucial to the erosion of the illiteracy gap. Had they not been established in the first place

or had emancipation been delayed, the racial illiteracy gap would have persisted (Collins and

Margo 2006, p. 119). In 1870 just shy of 10 percent of Black children ages 5-19 attended school

at some point during the census year, compared with 53 percent of White children, a racial gap

of 43 percentage points. In 1930, the last year the literacy question was asked, the racial gap in

school attendance in the same age group had declined to 11 percentage points, a reduction of 32

       The substantial reduction in Black illiteracy across two post-bellum generations would

seem to belie the claim that the initial racial gap in human capital gap eroded slowly across

generations. But the reduction in Black illiteracy overstates the erosion of the human capital gap

because census literacy could be achieved through a quite limited exposure to formal education –

as little as two years (Margo 1990). On its own, the racial gap in literacy can explain statistically

only a relatively small part of the racial difference in occupational status before World War Two,

leaving a much larger role for a race dummy in any regression (Collins and Margo 2006).

       It is possible to go beyond literacy and say something about long-run trends in the racial

gap in educational attainment. The 1940 census is the first national survey to ask about years of

schooling. The post-1940 censuses and related surveys (for example, the Current Population or

American Community Survey) routinely do so. Combining these various sources yields an

annual time series of educational attainment by birth cohort. Figure 2, which is from Goldin and

Katz (2008), shows the racial gap (White – Black) in educational attainment by birth cohort,

measured at age 35. The series begins with the 1905 cohort, because this is the first to have its

educational attainment measured at age 35 contemporaneously – that is, in the 1940 census.

                                           [Figure 2 about here]

       Figure 2 reveals that the racial schooling gap narrowed more or less continuously from

the earliest birth cohort represented in the diagram (1905) until cohorts born in the 1960s, at

which point convergence ceased.     Convergence in years of schooling occurred against a

backdrop of rising educational attainment nationally.    Blacks caught up with Whites in

elementary school graduation rates and, later, in attending high school. Convergence ceased at

about the same time educational attainment began stagnating for the overall population – that is,

the point at which college graduation became more or less a necessary (if not sufficient)



                                                 26
condition for upward mobility and a middle (or higher) class lifestyle. Unfortunately, the absence

of any narrowing of the attainment gap in recent decades is one of many reasons why racial

convergence in per capita income has stalled since 1980.

        What about the pre-1905 cohorts? There is a long tradition of using the 1940 data to

back-cast attainment by race for cohorts born in the nineteenth century (Smith 1984). However,

there are serious pitfalls in doing so such that, if ignored, strongly bias the trend in the racial gap.

We may never know the exact course of the racial attainment in schooling for post-bellum

cohorts but plausible estimates suggest that the gap did narrow more or less continuously over

time (Margo 1986a,b) – but, crucially for my argument, more slowly than the erosion of the

literacy gap.

        Further, Figure 2 significantly understates the racial attainment gap at any point in

because it is not adjusted for racial differences in the quality of schooling. The public schools

established for Blacks in the South just after the Civil War were legally separate but, for two

decades or so were (mostly) equal, in the sense that expenditures per pupil and other measures of

school inputs were similar by race. But, relative to schools elsewhere in the country, the

Southern schools were poor in quality. Most Black children received their instruction in such

schools until a significant share of the adult Black population had left the South and began

having children and sending them to school elsewhere in the country. In the late nineteenth and

early twentieth century a gap in school quality between Black and White schools emerged,

reaching a peak around World War One (Margo 1990). From that point on the gap began to

narrow, slowly at first and then more rapidly in the decade or so prior to the Supreme Court’s




                                                  27
decision in Brown v. Board of Education. 23 At the time of the decision, Southern schools were

probably more “equal” than at any time since Reconstruction, but they were still of lower quality

than elsewhere.

        Economic historians have attempted many times to gauge the economic impact of racial

differences in the quantity and quality of schooling. The most recent study, and in my view the

best to date, is by Celeste Carruthers and Marianne Wanamaker (2015), who match earnings data

for Southern-born adult men in 1940 with data on school inputs in the counties where the men

grew up. Carruthers and Wanamaker find that up to 40 percent of the racial earnings gap can be

explained by racial differences in the quantity and quality schooling, a very substantial

proportion. The Carruthers and Wanamaker study pertains to the South. We have no good

sense how large racial differences in school quality were outside the South before World War

Two and their importance in the labor market at the time.

        The upshot is that γ was large during most of the era of de jure segregation in public

education. We know from the important study by Ashenfelter, Collins, and Yoon (2006) that

legal dismantling of de jure segregation started by Brown hastened the pace of Black-White

convergence across cohorts, implying that γ declined in absolute value. But we also know that

desegregation did not happen overnight and that school districts in the United States are still

separate and unequal through the influence of de facto segregation, implying that γ is still

positive. A small army of labor economists today continue to measure the relative quality of

Black educational outcomes, typically focusing on test scores. A racial gap in test scores now

emerges very early in school, and it remains stubbornly present in later grades, even after



23
  For a discussion of the factors behind pre-Brown convergence in Black-White school quality, see Margo (1990).
Economic historians have recently begun to investigate one of these factors – philanthropic assistance to Black
schools – econometrically; see Aaronson and Mazumder (2011).

                                                       28
controlling for a long list of family background and school variables (Fryer and Levitt 2004a,

2006)..

          Thus, while research on the historical evolution of racial schooling gaps can and should

continue, it is almost certainly the case that the gaps as measured at any point in time understate

true racial differences. It is also possible that these systematic measurement problems are worse

today than in the past when schooling levels were much lower, implying that the extent of long

run racial convergence is potentially quite a bit less than implied by Figure 2.

          As pointed out in Section 2, another important initial gap was spatial mismatch which,

following Sjaastad (1962), can be thought of as a type of human capital in the model. I phrased

this in terms of per capita income but it is more general than this, encompassing employment and

occupational mobility as well.

           The initial spatial mismatch pertained to region. Like the schooling gap, this gap

eroded over time slowly, and somewhat irregularly, over time and much later, morphed into a

different character (see below). The timing and rate of Black outmigration from the South is a

perennial topic in American history.     The incentive to leave was present immediately after the

Civil War. The first generation of ex-slaves did move around within the South but as my

calculation shows, this had no effect on aggregate mismatch. Movement from the South

received a large boost during World War One, in part due to the decrease in European

immigration which continued in the 1920s with the imposition of quotas (Collins 1997; Boustan

2015). Prior to this time, Black migration out of the South was positively selected but during the

first wave of the “Great Migration” migration was more general (Margo 1990, Collins and

Wanamaker 2015b). Outmigration slowed during the Great Depression but regional mismatch

continued to decline because incomes and employment in the South took less of a direct hit



                                                  29
during the downturn. The second wave of the Great Migration came during, and shortly after

World War Two and continued through the 1950s. In the process the Black population was

transformed from overwhelmingly rural to overwhelmingly urban.

       As Blacks moved into cities, distinct Black neighborhoods began to form and the level of

residential segregation increased (Cutler, Glaeser, and Vigdor 1999). There is mixed evidence

of the effects of residential segregation on Black economic outcomes, at least before 1970.       On

the one hand, segregation appears to have slowed the rate of growth of Black homeownership

(Collins and Margo 2011). On the other, the segregation pertained to race and not income, and

thus Black communities in the period were diverse in social class. This diversity may have

created positive externalities that promoted human capital investment in lower income

households, increasing the pace of racial convergence (Cutler and Glaeser 1997).

       After the passage of federal fair housing legislation in the late 1960s and subsequent

efforts to enforce it, middle and higher income Black households began to suburbanize, causing

Black residential communities in central cities to be less socially and economically diverse. As

Cutler and Glaeser (1997; see also Collins and Margo 2003) show this was a factor in the

emergence of so-called “bad ghettos”. After 1970 higher levels of residential segregation are

associated with a greater incidence of non-employment, out-of-wedlock births, and poverty in

general. But even before this, the economies of urban Black neighborhoods came under stress as

jobs started to suburbanize in the 1950s, before the Black population could follow. This created

another spatial mismatch, one that was not regional as at the turn of the twentieth century but

instead was intra-metropolitan (Kain 1968). This mismatch, too, has diminished over time as

residential segregation has lessened but it remains a significant problem to the present day

(Boustan and Margo 2009).



                                                30
        Schooling and location are far from the only types of human capital for which there were

profound initial gaps. There are many other cognitive and non-cognitive components to human

capital that are shaped within households, schools, and social networks and, as such, are

transmitted across generations. Historically, Blacks were at risk of violence from Whites if they

violated prevailing social norms of behavior. These norms required Blacks to behave

deferentially or face reprisal (Higgs 1977). Although I know of no conclusive, causal analysis it

is not a stretch to argue that the sort of deferential behavior that shielded Blacks from personal

violence in the Jim Crow era could easily have impeded economic success in the broader

economy. Health status is another feature of human capital for which there was a large initial

gap. While in the long run there has been significant convergence in relative Black health,

especially in life expectation at birth, convergence is far from complete (Boustan and Margo

2015). 24

        As specified my theoretical model pertains to labor income. To incorporate wealth

properly requires modeling intergenerational transfers and consumption-savings decisions

(White 2007). I shall leave the extension for another day but will review here the evolution of

racial differences in wealth as far as it is known.

        On average, the initial post-slavery generation of African-Americans grew up in

households that were extremely deprived in terms of physical and financial wealth. The 1870

24
   Blacks today continue to face higher mortality at birth and up until approximately age 70. Health status of the
living is also worse because Blacks are more likely to suffer from chronic conditions. The causality between health
and economic outcomes is always a matter for dispute and, in the end, probably goes in both directions. That said,
there is much suggestive evidence that health and other forms of human capital were complements. Better educated
Blacks were more likely to leave the South before World War One but some of his reflects a positive correlation
between health and education – migrants were also healthier (Logan 2009). In the early twentieth century South
children of both races suffered from high rates of hookworm infection which sapped their ability to perform well in
school or even to attend. The Rockefeller Foundation’s campaign to end hookworm was successful and led to an
increase in school attendance, and a narrowing of the Black-White schooling gap (Bleakley 2006). For modern
evidence of complementarity between health and human capital formation as it affects racial inequality, see Chay,
Guryan, and Mazumder (2009).


                                                        31
census records the ownership and value of real estate wealth of every person, and personal

property (excluding clothing) over $100 (1870) dollars. Black/White ratios derived from these

data are, in various ways, inconsistent with modern ratios. For example, the 1870 census did not

record debt, so the wealth data are gross, not net (worth). The $100 cutoff on personal property

is non-trivial; for an (unknown) fraction of the population reporting zero personal property, the

true value was greater than zero (but less than $100).

         Despite these problems, the 1870 census data are clear that, on average, adult Blacks had

very little wealth relative to Whites. I have examined a sample of adults ages 15 and over; for

this sample, the mean Black/White per capita wealth ratio is 0.039, and the median ratio is

exactly zero. The extreme wealth poverty of African-Americans just after the Civil War is not

surprising. It would have been difficult for adult slaves to have accumulated wealth of any kind

prior to Emancipation (DeCanio 1979). The 1850 and 1860 censuses which, like the 1870

census, inquired about wealth, suggest that free Blacks, too, had very little relative to the White

population.

         The 1870 was the last nineteenth century census to ask about wealth in a fairly

comprehensive way. But six states, all in the South, collected information on taxable wealth by

race and published the statistics on a regular basis. Like the 1870 census, the tax data indicated

that, on average, Blacks had very little wealth relative to Whites. The data unequivocally

suggest, however, that Blacks accumulated wealth more rapidly than Whites in the South after

the Civil War, at least up to World War One (Higgs 1982; Margo 1984). 25



25
   Using the data reported in Margo (1984) a state-level panel regression of Black/White per capita wealth ratios on
a time trend and state fixed effects implies racial convergence at a rate of 1.5 percentage points per decade from
1870 to 1910. Interestingly, if the trend rate of convergence from this regression is projected 120 years into the
future from the mid-point of the period (1890) the implied level of the Black/White wealth ratio is approximately the
level observed in the early 21st century.

                                                         32
        Other than home ownership (Collins and Margo 2011) there are no nationally

representative race-specific wealth data prior to World War Two. After World War Two there

have been a variety of regular surveys of household wealth which also include information on

race. The most widely used today are from the Census Bureau’s Survey of Income and Program

Participation (SIPP). Figure 3 shows Black/White wealth ratios, median and mean, from 1984

to the present based on the SIPP data. The unit of observation is the household, and the data

refer to total net worth.

                                               [Figure 3 about here]

        The typical Black household today has very limited net worth relative to the typical

White household. From the early 1980s until 2005 the median ratio was stable at slightly less

than 10 percent. The ratio declined in the Great Recession but shows some recovery very

recently. For the years for which the SIPP survey has provided sample means by race, the

Black/White ratio of mean wealth is typically twice as high or higher, than the median ratio, but

still far below the per capita income ratio.

        To summarize, a high degree of intergenerational persistence in the transmission of racial

identity, human capital, and wealth, coupled with a belief that causal factors, if properly

measured, largely explain income differences (as opposed to random error) goes a long way in

accounting for the slow pace of racial income convergence in the long run. However, as

Appendix B shows, the IGE in my theoretical model also depends on the labor market prices (the

β’s) in [Eq 2a]. I conclude this section with a discussion of how changes in these parameters

might have affected the persistence of racial income gaps at different junctures after the Civil

War.




                                                    33
         Consider first the early twentieth century.           The discussion above suggests that de jure

segregation and racial discrimination, particularly in education, increased at this time. This

would have increased the IGE, slowing racial convergence. However, as pointed out in section

2, the returns to schooling decreased before 1940 as did the degree of cross-state spatial

mismatch, which would have lowered the IGE, speeding up the convergence process. If my

benchmarks are taken at face value, these effects more or less cancelled out, allowing

convergence to continue apace in the four decades before World War Two.

         The pace of convergence between 1940 and 1980 was much quicker than before 1940.

Here, the reduction in βh in the 1940s, which was largely sustained until the 1970s, lowered the

IGE, as did federal anti-discrimination efforts in the 1940s and, later to much greater effect,

during the Civil Rights movement (Donohue and Heckman 1991). Increases in the relative

quality of Black schooling, some of which began before Brown v. Board of Education, and

others that were a consequence of school desegregation, further reduced the IGE (Ashenfelter,

Collins and Yoon 2006). It is thus no accident that the standard intergenerational regression,

with an IGE of 0.5, is reasonably good at predicting Black-White convergence in this period.

Lastly, during the period from 1980 to the present, there has been a substantial rise in the returns

to human capital in the labor market. This serves to increase the IGE, both directly and also

indirectly to the extent that there are still race-specific barriers to human capital production (a

non-zero value of γ in the model) causing racial convergence to slow relative to the 1940-80

period. 26



26
   In models of the type considered by Nybom and Stuhler (2014) changes in the parameters in any of the equations
can generate transitional dynamics that impact the IGE across multiple, not just adjacent generations. The initial
impact will affect the current generation, but the effects will also continue into subsequent generations before a new
steady state is achieved. The discussion in the text sidesteps this point, but it could be important empirically.

       The Black/White ratio of per capita income rose from slightly more than a quarter in

1870 to about two-thirds in 2010, a span of about 5-6 human generations. In the not so distant

past in the United States, the gap in income between Blacks and Whites was more like a chasm

and examples of economically successful African-Americans were uncommon. Today, they are

many more examples, absolutely and relative to Whites, but Black poverty is still with us and

will likely be for the foreseeable future.

       I have argued that to understand racial economic progress in the century and a half since

Emancipation, it is useful to think inter-generationally. At any point in time the labor market

establishes prices on human capital and racial identity; Blacks earn less than Whites because

there are racial gaps in human capital and because of racial discrimination. Labor market prices

are affected by technical progress, supply/demand factors, and institutions. Black incomes are

also lower because Blacks own much less of the capital stock. The gaps in human and physical

capital today reflect the slow erosion across generations of what were extremely large initial

differences in the aftermath of the Civil War. Modern labor economists have at their disposal

many tools and much evidence to study intergenerational transmission in the US today and its

racial implications.   To better understand why racial inequality has eroded so slowly in the

United States, economic historians need to devote more attention to historical patterns of

intergenerational transmission and how these played out in the ongoing evolution of America’s

most enduring dilemma.




                                                35
5. Appendix A

         I begin with Fogel and Engerman’s (1974) estimate of slave per capita income in 1860 as

reported in Vedder (1975, p. 455), $43 (in 1860 dollars). Sacerdote (2005) argues that, within

the Black population after the Civil War the intergenerational elasticity (IGE) was approximately

0.5 and that the gap in economic status – positive -- between former free Blacks and ex-slaves

eroded more or less completely by 1920. I will assume, therefore, that free Black per capita

income in 1860 is 20 per cent higher than slave per capita income ($52), as this is consistent with

Sacerdote’s findings. 27 In 1860 free Blacks were 11 percent of the total Black population,

implying a figure of $44 for overall Black per capita income (= 0.89 x 43 + 0.11 x 52). Using

Fogel and Engerman’s (1974, p. 248) estimate of national per capita income in 1860, $128, and a

Black population share of 0.14, White per capita income is $142, and the Black/white ratio is

0.31 (= 44/142).

         Fogel and Engerman’s estimate of slave income has been criticized as too generous or,

equivalently, that their estimate of the expropriation rate is too low (David and Temin 1974;

Vedder 1975). If I adopt Vedder’s estimate of $30 for slave income (I consider this a plausible

lower bound) and perform the same calculation (again assuming a 20 percent income premium

for free Blacks), the estimated 1860 Black/White ratio is 0.22 in 1860. If I adopt $35 as a

middling estimate (see Vedder 1975, p. 455), the estimated 1860 Black/White ratio is 0.26. 28 As

mentioned in the text, the range of estimates, 0.22 to 0.31, brackets the Higgs ca. 1870

benchmark (0.24) and my revision to it (0.28).


27
   After two generations with an IGE of 0.5, a premium of 20 percent would decline to a little more than 4 percent
assuming exponential decay. A 20 percent premium is also consistent with the differences in occupation status for
former free Blacks and ex-slaves in the early post-bellum period; see Sacerdote (2005, Figure 5, p. 227).
28
  Lindert and Williamson (2016, forthcoming, Table 7.7) estimate 0.26 for the 1860 Black/White per capita income
ratio. Lindert and Williamson estimate of slave incomes is roundabout; in particular, they estimate labor productivity
in southern agriculture, which is then reduced by an assumed rate of expropriation as applied to slaves.

                                                         36
6. Appendix B


       This appendix describes the construction of Figure 1, which includes my new benchmark

estimates of Black-White per capita income ratios for 1870, 1900, and 1940, contrasting with

previous estimates made by Robert Higgs (1977, 1989). I begin with the 1900 benchmark rather

than 1870 because its estimation is the more elaborate of the two and the estimation of the 1870

benchmark uses some of the same assumptions Higgs made for the 1900 estimation.

1900: Higgs (1977, p. 145) made benchmark estimates of the Black-White per capita income

ratio for 1870 and 1900. The estimation begins with the following identity for per capita

income:



Per capita income = (income per rural worker x rural labor force participation rate x rural

population share) + (income per capita of the urban population x urban population share)



       Higgs estimates the various components in this equation for Blacks, plugs these into the

expression, and computes Black per capita income. Using an estimate of national per capita

income and the percent Black, he backs out an estimate of White per capita income. His

Black/White ratios for ca. 1870 and 1900 are based on these race-specific estimates.

       The first step is to estimate income per Black farm laborer. Higgs (1977, p. 64) uses

daily wage rates for harvest and non-harvest labor, assuming 50 days of harvest work and 150

days of non-harvest work. This gives him an annual income estimate, which he then inflates to

account for perquisites, including board (Higgs 1977, p. 99). There are two problems with his

procedure. The daily wage rates he uses are quoted “without board”; these are higher than wage

                                                37
rates “with board”, the difference being the value of board per day. To impute board to wages

quoted without board is double counting. Second, while some farm laborers were certainly hired

by the day, most full time workers were hired monthly (or annually). On a per diem basis

monthly wages were lower than daily wages because monthly pay included a compensating

differential for unemployment risk (Margo 2000).

        My calculation begins with an estimate of average monthly wages of farm labor with

value of board imputed for the South, taken from Margo (2004): $15.00. 29 I assume 8 months of

full time equivalent employment for farm laborers (this is slightly higher than Higgs), or $120

per year. This figure does not include perquisites other than board. I assume these to be worth

$2.50/month of full time employment, which is 50 percent of the total value per month of

perquisites assumed by Higgs (1977, p. 99). This gives an estimate of $140 of annual income

per full-time equivalent (FTE) farm laborer. To estimate the racial distribution of FTE farm

laborers in the South in 1900, I use the 1900 IPUMS sample, assuming that FTE means 4 or

fewer months of unemployment; my estimates are that FTE farm laborers were 51 percent Black

and 49 percent White. Following Higgs I assume that Black farm laborers earned 10 percent less

than Whites (a Black/White ratio of 0.9). My final estimate of income per Black farm laborer is

$133.00.

        For Black farmers, I divide these into owner-operators and tenants. 30 I estimate income

per Black owner-operator following the protocol described by Abramitzky, Boustan, and

Ericsson (2012, Appendix A, p. 29; see also Olivetti and Paserman 2015), which uses

information reported in the Census of Agriculture to estimate owner-operator incomes. There is

sufficient information reported in United States Bureau of the Census (1904) to apply this

29
   This is an average of the average monthly farm wage for the South Atlantic and South Central regions in 1899,
rounded to the nearest dollar.
30
   Tenants include share, cash, and farm managers.

                                                        38
protocol for all farms operated by Black farmers and for Black owner-operators separately. For

Black owner-operators the estimate is $300 per owner-operator. 31 For Black farmers overall, the

estimate is $342. In 1900 25.2 percent of Black farmers were owner-operators; therefore, on

farms operated by Black tenants, income per farm is estimated to be $356. I shall assume,

following Higgs (1977, p. 79) that half of this income was retained by the tenant, or $178. Thus,

income per Black farmer is estimated to be $209 (= 0.252 x $300 + 0.748 x $178). These

figures do not include any earnings off the farm; Higgs (1977, p. 79) assumes these to be 20

percent of average farm income. Adopting this figure, annual income per Black farmer is

$251. 32

           Income per Black agricultural worker is a weighted average of income per farm laborer

and income per farmer. I estimate the weights from the 1900 IPUMS, restricting the population

to Blacks reporting to be in the labor force with no more than 4 months of unemployment, living

in a rural area, and who report an occupation of farmer or farm laborer. The assumption on

months of unemployment is an attempt to adjust for full-time equivalent employment. The

weight for farm laborers is 0.54 and that for farmers is 0.46. Therefore, income per Black

agricultural laborer is $133 x 0.54 + 0.46 x $251 = $187.

           Next, I follow Higgs and assume that all rural Black workers earn the same amount as the

average Black agricultural worker. I use the 1900 IPUMS to estimate the full-time equivalent


31
   The Census report gives the necessary data for “colored” farm owners, by which is meant non-White; this
includes, for example, farmers in Hawaii and Native Americans; I have no way of computing averages just for Black
owner-operators. However, the vast majority of non-White farm owners in 1900 were Black.
32
  By comparison, Higgs (1977, p. 99) estimates an average income of $300 per black farmer in 1900. Of this $300,
$250 is Higgs’ estimate of income from farm operations. This is 83 percent of my estimate of the net income per
farm of owner-operators, which seems too high a ratio, given that farm owners were at the top of the agricultural
ladder. In producing his $250 figure, Higgs assumed that the typical Black farmer was a sharecropper who grew
only cotton, managing to produce 10 bales worth $500, retaining half ($250). However, according to data reported
by U.S Bureau of the Census (1904, pp. 75, 76, 85), average bales of cotton per farm operated by Black farmers in
1900 was 4.8 bales, and cotton’s share of gross farm output (not fed to livestock) was 71 percent. The protocol
adopted in the text is far from perfect, but seems a better way to estimate Black farm incomes in 1900.

                                                       39
labor force participation rate of rural Blacks. The initial estimate is 0.34, but this includes

individuals who failed to properly answer the unemployment question in 1900 but who are coded

by the IPUMS as a zero. I assume the true figure is 0.3 (slightly higher than Higgs, who assumes

0.25). My final estimate of rural Black per capita income is $56.

         For urban Blacks, I adopt Higgs’ (1977, p. 97) estimate of $100. 33 Per capita income is a

weighted average of rural and urban = 0.77 x $56 + 0.23 x $100 = $66. This compares with $73

for Higgs. The final step is to infer White per capita income using the overall identity for

national per capita income. For per capita income ($192) and the black population share (0.12) I

use the same figures as Higgs (1977, p. 246). White per capita income is $209, so my estimated

Black/White ratio is 0.32 (= $66/$209), compared with the Higgs (1977, p. 246) benchmark of

0.35.

1870: I begin by estimating income per Black farm laborer. Based on Margo (2004) I estimate a

monthly average farm wage (with value of board imputed) of $20 per month for the South in

1870. 34 To this I add $3.00 for perquisites other than board. 35 I assume that, as in 1900, Black

farm laborers earned 90 percent of the average for White farm laborers. I have no way of

estimating FTE farm laborers by race in 1870, so I assume the same weights as in 1900, 51

percent Black and 49 percent White. The resulting estimate of the average monthly wage of




33
   As will become clear shortly in the text, I am privileging the Higgs estimate of urban per capita income ($100) in
my calculations for 1870 and 1900. As Higgs notes, his urban figure is 50 percent higher than his rural figure. If I
assume that the 50 percent excess is correct rather than the absolute number, urban Black per capita income would
be $84 in 1900, overall Black per capita income would be $62, and the Black-White income ratio would be 0.30. I
also use the $100 figure as an estimate of urban Black per capita income in 1870. If, instead, I use the 50 percent
excess ratio, urban Black per capita income is $86 in 1870, overall Black per capita income is $61, or $36 in 1900
dollars, and the Black-White income ratio would be 0.27.
34
   The $20 figure is an unweighted average of my estimates for the South Atlantic and South Central regions,
rounded to the nearest dollar.
35
   I am assuming that, in 1870, the ratio of perquisites other than board to money wages is 0.15, approximately the
same as in 1900.

                                                         40
Black farm labor is $21.80. As in 1900 I assume 8 months of FTE employment, so income per

Black farm laborer is $174. This compares with Higgs’ (1977, p. 101) estimate of $150.


        To estimate income per Black owner operator, I assume that the ratio of income to farm

value in 1870 was the same as in 1900, 0.413. I use the 1870 IPUMS to estimate the average

value of Black owner-operated farms (this is the total value of real estate reported to be owned

by Black farmers in 1870 divided by the number of Black farmers reporting a positive value,

$760). 36 My estimate of income per Black owner operator is $314. There are no published data

comparable with those for 1900 to estimate tenant incomes in 1870; I shall simply assume that

tenants earned on average 50 percent more than farm laborers, the same assumption made by

Higgs (1977, p. 101), or $264.


       According to the 1870 IPUMS, 15 percent of Blacks who reported having a farm

occupation (1950 codes) were farmers (occupation code 100 or 123), 13 percent of whom

reported owning real estate; I consider the real estate owners to be owner-operators. My weights

for the farm worker income estimate, therefore, are: farm laborer, 0.85; owner operator 0.02 (=

0.13 x 0.15) and tenant, 0.13. Income per farm worker is 174 x 0.85 + 264 x 0.13 + 0.02 x 314 =

$189. As in 1900 I assume that rural nonfarm workers earn the same on average as rural farm

workers. I use the same rural FTE participation rate as in 1900, 0.3, so rural per capita income is

$57. This is virtually identical to my (nominal) estimate for 1900, so I assume that urban Black

per capita income is $100, as in 1900. Thirteen percent of the Black population is urban in 1870,

so my overall estimate of Black per capita income is $63. To put this into 1900 dollars, I follow

Higgs (1977, p. 101) and multiply by 0.6, or $38; this compares with Higgs’ estimate of $30.


36
  To place this figure in perspective, if I use the same procedure to compute the average value of White owned-
farms in 1870, the Black/White ratio of average owner-occupied farm values is 0.168; this is a national average.

                                                         41
       I assume income per head in 1870 of $122 in 1900 dollars (slightly higher than Higgs,

whose estimate of $111 pertains to 1867-68). 37 For the Black population share I use an average

of 1860 and 1880 census figures, 0.136. From the per capita income identity I back out White

income, $135. The resulting Black/White ratio is 0.28 (= 38/135), compared with the Higgs

benchmark of 0.24.


1940: The Higgs (1989, p. 26) benchmark for 1940 is based on the equation:


                                   Black/White income ratio = E x L x β


where E = is a weighted average of the “male earnings ratio” (0.45) from Smith (1984) and the

female earnings ratio from Gwartney (0.36), with weights of 0.67 for males and 0.33 for females;

L = 1.03, the ratio of black labor force participants per capita to white labor force participants per

capita, from the 1940 published census. Higgs sets the parameter β equal to labor’s overall share
                                                                             38
of national income for 1937, 0.79, taken from Hendricks (1961).


       This calculation has several problems. First and most important, the equation will

understate the Black/White ratio unless Blacks literally have zero non-labor income in 1940,

which is surely incorrect. Second, the term β should be labor’s share of total income among


37
   On average per capita GNP grew very rapidly in real terms between 1869-1878 and 1879-1888, 3.9 percent per
year. Assuming that 2.5 years separates Higgs’ estimate of $111 from the 1870 value and applying this growth rate
gives a per capita income of $122.
38
   Gwartney’s estimate of the female earnings ratio appears to be biased downwards, based on careful analysis of the
1940 IPUMS by Baily and Collins (2005). What Higgs calls the “earnings ratio” in his equation is actually a
mixture of wage and salary income and business/farm income for males, and wage and salary income only for
females. The 1940 census collected information on the amount of wage and salary income, but not the amount (only
the incidence, if the amount was in excess of $50) of other income, such as self-employment or business income,
dividends, interest income, or rents. By using Smith as the source of the earnings ratio for males, Higgs is
implicitly including more than wage salary income because Smith’s income weights are derived from the 1970
census, which collected information, for example, on the incomes of farmers and other self-employed individuals.
In my re-computation of Higgs’ formula, I divide income into two parts, wage and salary, and non-wage and salary
income. I use the 1940 IPUMS to estimate the Black/White ratio of per capita wage and salary income and, as
discussed in the text, make assumptions about the ratio of per capita non-wage and salary income.


                                                        42
Whites, but as noted above the value actually used in the calculation pertains to labor’s share of

national income. The value among Whites will be lower than this, because the aggregate is a

weighted average of race-specific figures, and labor’s share for Blacks will be higher than for

Whites (because Blacks derived relatively more of their income from labor; as just noted, Higgs’

calculation assumes that for Blacks, labor’s share is one).


         To compute my 1940 benchmark I start with the same formula as Higgs. I use the 1940

IPUMS to estimate race-specific per worker averages of wage and salary income for persons

who are in the labor force in 1940 and whose class of worker is wage and salary worker with at

least $1 of wage and salary income in 1939, ages 15+. Under these assumptions, the

Black/White ratio of earnings is 0.42. Such workers are 31.9 percent of the Black population

(ages 1 and over) and 31.2 percent of the White population (ages 1 and over) in 1940. We do not

know the share of wage and salary income in total income for Whites in 1940. I will assume that

it is 0.78, very slightly lower than Kendrick’s figure for the overall economy. 39 We also do not

know per capita non-wage income by race in 1940; I shall assume it is 0.23. 40                  According to the

1940 IPUMS, 17.8 percent of White population (ages 1 and over) received non-wage income of

$50 or more in 1940 compared with 14.6 percent of the Black population; I assume these are

accurate estimates of the shares receiving non-wage income of any amount. 41 My overall




39
   A value of 0.78 for Whites is implied if the national average is 0.79 (as in Kendrick), the Black/White per capita
income ratio is approximately 0.4 (which it is in 1940, according to my benchmark), the wage and salary share for
Blacks is 0.9 (unknown, but plausible), and the Black population share is 0.1 (the value in 1940). Based on the
IPUMS, tn 1950 (1960) the wage and salary share of White income is 0.74 (0.76) for persons reporting non-negative
values of total personal income and wage and salary income. It is plausible that the wage and salary share for
Whites is higher than either of these values in 1940 because of the effects of wage compression during the 1940s
(Goldin and Margo 1992).
40
   This is an average of Black/White ratios computed from the 1950 (0.26) and 1960 (0.20) IPUMS samples for all
persons reporting non-negative values of business/farm income.
41
   Strictly speaking, the 1940 IPUMS yields estimates of the shares of individuals ages 14 and over receiving non-
wage income of $50 or more; I am assuming no persons under age 14 of either race received non-wage income.

                                                         43
estimate of the Black-White income ratio in 1940 is 0.38 [= 0.78 x (0.42 x (0.319/0.312)) + 0.22

x (0.23 x (0.146/0.178))], compared with 0.34 for Higgs. 42


1948-2012: The basic source is

http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/data/historical/people/, Tables P1, P3. For 1967-

present the Census produces annual estimates of per capita income by race (Table P1). For 1948-

present, the Census Bureau reports average annual earnings for persons age 15 and over, by race

and sex (Table P3). I use the reported number of workers by gender to produce race-specific

earning series for 1947-1966.          Let BWEARN be the Black/White ratio of average annual

earnings, BWPINC be the Black/White ratio of per capita income, and Z(t) =

BWPINC/BWEARN for year t, t = 1967-2012. I compute the median value of Z(t); call this µ.

My estimate of BWPINC(t) for t = 1948-66 is µ x BWEARN (t).


7. Appendix C

           This appendix derives the IGE for the theoretical model in Section 3. To derive the IGE,

I lag [Eq.2a] by one generation:


                                          ln yt-1 = βrwt-1 + βhht-1 + εyt-1

I substitute [Eq. 2a] and [Eq. 2b] into [Eq. 2a] for generation t:

                                   ln yt = (βwλw + βhλhγ)wt-1 + βh λhht-1 + ε*yt


Here, ε* is a function of the error in y in generation t, lagged errors in the human capital and

racial identity equations, and the various parameters.

           I shall assume that all errors are uncorrelated with each other across equations within a

generation and also across generations. I shall also assume that the variance-covariance matrix
42
     No adjustment is made for top-coding, which understates White per capita income more than Black.

                                                         44
of y, w, and h has unit values on the diagonal. With these assumptions the IGE between

generation t and t- 1 is given by equation [3]:



[Eq. 3]: IGE (t, t-1) = (βw2 + βwβh γ)λw + βw2λw + [βwβh (λr + λh) + βh2λwγ]σrh



As an example, suppose that βw = βh = 0.5, λw = λh = 0.8, γ =0.2, and σrh = 0.7. Then w and h

explain 85 percent of the variance of ln y and the IGE is 0.75. Stuhler (2014) points out that in

models of this type the multi-generational IGE – for example the correlation between generation

t and t-2 – decays more slowly than exponential. A high level of initial inequality, therefore, can

persist across multiple generations.

The columns in this table are produced by multiplying state per capita income by race-specific

population shares by state, summing across states, and dividing the Black total by the White

total. In column 1, per capita income and population shares are for the given year (e.g. 1880). In

column 2, income per capita is held fixed and population shares vary across years. In column 3,

income per capita varies across years and population shares are held fixed at 1920 values. Race-

specific population totals are from the Census. Income per capita data: see Easterlin (1960).
