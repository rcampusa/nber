        This paper utilizes a national sample of nearly 1,600 households
linked in the census manuscript schedules to investigate causes and
consequences of migration to urban areas during the midst of America's
industrial revolution. Although record linkage was limited to the subset of
households that had at least one child in 1850, the data are relatively rich
in socioeconomic information. A regional analysis of migration and
occupational change shows that while established households were generally
mobile, they were extraordinarily reluctant to commit labor to urban—
industrial pursuits. The evidence suggests that the presence of children,
retraining costs, lack of control over fertility, risk aversion, and an
unfavorable view of urban areas by rural residents contributed to their
avoidance of cities and towns. The findings also contribute to debates over
the compression of the wage structure and the extent of socioeconomic
mobility.

       Urbanization was unquestionably important for the economic, social,

political, and demographic development of the United States during the 19th

century. The rise of production and distribution centers, the supply of

labor and its geographic distribution, the emergence of labor unions, the

operations of urban political machines, and the public health movement are

examples of familiar themes associated with urbanization in American

history. The importance of migration to urban growth is also indisputable.

Because birth rates were low but death rates were high, migration fueled

urban growth during the 19th century. Indeed, many cities and towns would

have declined in size without an inflow of people that replaced the excess

of deaths over births.

        Study of migration and urban growth has been hampered by lack of

suitable data. Systematic registration of births and deaths was scanty

before the end of the 19th century and, unlike some European countries, the

United States never had a system of migration registration. Instead,

scholars have utilized various data collected for other purposes. For

example, a measure of migration called the persistence ratio has been widely

calculated by tracking names through manuscript schedules, city directories,

and other sources. Though popular for its modest data collection

requirements, this measure incorporates amounts of mortality and

underenumeration that are usually uncertain and is silent on where people

went or what happend to them after moving. Moreover, efficiency in data

collection and availability of records have directed efforts toward studies

of particular urban areas, often large cities. Though highly valuable, as a

group these local studies frequently involve diverse data sources, different

time periods, and contrasting methodologies, all of which complicate

comparisons of results. From the ingredients of local studies and the
                                   2



emphasis on cities at the expense of towns and villages it has been

difficult to weave a coherent and complete picture of urbanization. A

national study that included towns and villages as well as cities would help

to unify research on urban development.

        This paper utilizes a national sample of nearly 1,600 households

linked in the census manuscript schedules to investigate causes and

consequences of migration to urban areas during the midst of America's

industrial revolution. Although record linkage was limited to the subset of

households that had at least one child in 1850, the data are relatively rich

in socioeconomic information. A regional analysis of migration and

occupational change shows that while established households were generally

mobile, they were extraordinarily reluctant to commit labor to urban—

industrial pursuits. The evidence suggests that the presence of children,

retraining costs, lack of control over fertility, risk aversion, and an

unfavorable view of urban areas by rural residents contributed to their

avoidance of cities and towns. The findings also contribute to debates over

 the compression of the wage structure and the extent of socioeconomic

 mobility.



 I. REGIONAL PATTERNS OF URBANIZATION

         Although the United States as a whole urbanized rapidly during the

 mid 19th century and a major branch of the development literature stems from

 rural—urban two—sector models, evidence on regional patterns of urbanization

 and information on regional patterns of specialization and development

 suggest that a regional approach to rural—urban migration would be

 productive for the United States. Statistical tests on household migration

 patterns, reported in later sections of the paper, confirm that a regional
                                  3



approach is appropriate. Data reported in Table 1 convey the overall

picture and the regional contrasts. The proportion of the population living

in urban areas, defined as incorporated places of 2,500 or more residents,

increased more than five fold, rising from slightly over 6 percent early in

the century to nearly 40 percent by 1900. The annual rate of growth of

population in urban areas peaked at 6.5 percent during the decade of the

1840s but was also high (5.6 percent) during the 1850s. The regional

pictures were quite different, however. The share of population living in

urban areas exceeded 18 percent in the Northeast by 1840 but this level was

not exceeded in the North Central states until 1870 and in the South until

1900. The demographic evidence on the regional pace of urbanization accords

well with regional patterns of industrial development. The South was dotted

with commercial towns and also had a few small cities but remained devoted

to agriculture throughout the century. The process of industrialization

undoubtably began in the Northeast, perhaps within a decade or two following

the War of 1812 but surely by the 1840s, depending on one's definition and

emphasis. Mercantile towns were generally numerous in the settled portion

of the North Central region by the 1830s while aspects of industrial

activity were clearly evident in that region by the 1850s.

        High rates of urban growth characteristic of the early years of

settlement outside the Northeast are somewhat misleading as an overall guide

to change because the population base was small. The urban population

rapidly reached 16 percent of the total in the West before the Civil War,

for example, but less than 2 percent of the nation's population lived in

that region in 1860. Therefore the number of people who moved to urban

areas in the West was relatively unimportant for the national picture during

the antebellum period. For this reason and because there are few
                                   4


observations in the sample for study of rural—urban movement in the West,

this region is omitted from the analysis of househould migration.

        During the sample period of 1850 to 1860 one would expect to find

that rates of household migration to urban areas were highest in the

Northeast, followed by the North Central and the South regions. Moreover,

the Northeast should have been characterized by migration related to

industrial activity, the South by movement for commercial lines of

employment, and the North Central region by a hybrid of purposes.



II. A FRAMEWORK AND PERSPECTIVE

        Although several frameworks for the study of migration have been

proposed during the past century, including Ravenstein's "laws," gravity

models, push and pull approaches, and explanations focusing on intervening

opportunities, economic motives are a prominent theme in migration research.

Broadly and properly interpreted, Larry Sjaastad's formulation of migration

as an investment encompasses and recasts what appear to be diverse

approaches to the subject.1 In Sjaastad's view, the money costs of the

investment include expenditures on food, lodging, and transportation, and

the nonmonetary costs include foregone earnings while traveling, searching

for and learning a new job. Psychic aspects include net losses from leaving

family, friends, and associates and also incorporate perceptions and

appraisals of the general environment at the place of origin relative to

potential destinations. Obviously the overall psychic price of a move could

be positive or negative. The returns include a positive or negative

increment to a real earnings stream attributable.to a change in earnings; a
                                     5



change in the costs of employment; or a change in the prices paid by or

received by the migrant.

        Variables that may influence the costs and returns and the rate of

return on the investment include:2       (1) Age. Excluding retirement

migration, the probability of movement ordinarily declines after the late

teens and early twenties in part because the horizon over which returns are

realized from migration declines with age. It has also been argued that the

transactions costs of moving, psychic costs and possibly risk aversion may

rise with age; (2) Education. Awareness of and response to economic

opportunities elsewhere and ability to adapt to a new environment rises with

education; (3) Wealth. The ability to finance a move rises with wealth, but

the transactions costs of moving may also rise with wealth so the net effect

of this variable is unclear; (4) Family status. A spouse and children add

to the cost of a move, but it is possible that higher eanings for the

spouse and children of working age could more than offset the higher costs;

(5) Occupation. Highly skilled and specialized occupations tend to have

thin markets, which may increase the costs of finding employment elsewhere.

Higher migration rates may be associated with declining or emerging

occupations; (6) Ethnicity. The foreign—born and particularly recent

immigrants may have had fewer or less effective channels to acquire

information about employment opportunities than native—born and may have

spent more time searching, via migration, for employment. Alternatively,

the number of communities of the same ethnic background but in different

localities that existed to facilitate adjustments to migration may have been

smaller for the foreign compared with the native—born.
                                  6



       Georgaphic patterns of wages are obviously relevant for migration

decisions but unfortunately the available information is scanty. Evidence

on the daily wages of common labor across states, examined by Stanley

Lebergott, suggests that migrants responded to wage incentives and that

regional differentials narrowed during the 19th century, pointing to the

creation of a national labor market.3 Reliable data on wage differrentials

for a variety of occupations by areas as small as counties are simply

unavailable, and thus wages cannot be incorporated formally into the

statistical analysis. Instead, migration flows will be used to shed light

on wage patterns.
        European immigration, particularily from Ireland and Germany, was

important to American population growth by the middle of the century and

since many foreign—born located in urban areas, any analysis of rural—urban

migration should recognize the impact of this group on urban labor markets.

In this regard, the occupations and geographic patterns of settlement of the

immigrants will be incorporated into the discussion.

        Before considering determinants of migration, it is useful to

discuss the overall plausibility of results from the household data. The

extent of movement is an important dimension in this regard. In the sample

of 1,581 households that were matched, 498 or 31.5 percent of those found in

 1850 resided in a different county in 1860, which implies a level of

 persistence of 68.5 percent. Although studies have reported persistence

 rates as low as 20 to 30 percent among some population groups over a 10 year

 period during the nineteenth century, Donald Parkerson and David Galenson

 and Daniel Levy remind us that persistence measures embody downward biases

 of mortality and underenumeration that may amount to 20 to 30 percentage
                                       7




points      or more.4 Moreover, single individuals and young couples without

children generally had higher rates of mobility than established families.

Thus, the implied persistence rate of 68.5 percent falls within a plausible

range and suggests that the households in the sample were neither unusually

mobile or immobile given their socioeconomic characteristics.

             Patterns of rural to rural migration are a useful backdrop against

which to study rural to urban movement. Table 2 presents the results of a

logistic regression that explains rural to rural migration from 1850 to

        5                     .
                                                                               the
1860.        The dependent variable is dichotomous and takes a value of 1 if

household resided in a different county in 1860 compared with 1850 and is 0

otherwise. The data base includes only those households that resided in a

rural area in both censuses and the explanatory variables refer to values

taken in 1850. Although the direction of effect of an independent variable

on the dependent variable is the same as the sign of its coefficient,

because the estimated relationship is nonlinear the practical significance

of a variable may be difficult to discern from the magnitude of a

coefficient. Therefore, a variable's impact will be assessed by evaluating

other independent variables at their sample means and converting the

information into expected probabilities. As anticipated, the chances of

migration declined systematically with age and with wealth (value of real

estate). The expected probability of migration fell from 36.8 percent at

age 25 to 23.0 percent at age 50 while it was 32.5 percent among households

with $100 of real estate, 21.8 percent at $5,000, and only 13.8 percent at

 io,ooo.6 The probabilities of movement were not significantly different

 among the foreign—born compared with native—born whites. Nor were free

 blacks less mobile than native-born whites; one might have hypothesized that
registration requirements and other impediments would have acted to reduce

the movements of free blacks. Though negative as expected, the coefficient

on illiteracy was not statistically significant.   Children may have

increased the costs of migration, but apparently the expected returns to

their migration were such that no net systematic effect prevailed on the

probability of household migration. Among occupational groups, only blue

collar workers (expected probability equalled 37.0 percent) were

systematically more mobile than farmers and other occupations (expected

probability equalled 28.7 percent).7 The chances of movement differed

substantially across regions, taking on values of 15.7 percent in the

Northeast, 43.4 percent in the North Central, 33.7 percent in the South, and

28.1 percent in the Vest. About 45.1 percent of these households resided

less than 100 miles from their place of origin in 1850.8 Rural to rural

mobility was understandably low in the Northeast because most sites suitable

 for farming were already taken by 1850 and many of those who were interested

 in expanding farm operations had left the region by that date. The

 probability of movement was about 10 percentage points lower in the South

 compared with the North Central states, which contradicts, or at least does

 not support, claims that antebellum southern farmers were notorious for

 exhausting the soil and moving to new lands.

         The technique of comparing expected probabilities by changing the

 value of one variable while holding others constant is useful for appraising

 practical significance, but it obscures the diversity within the sample.

 The wide range of expenience is made clear by changing the values of several

 variables. For example, among native—born, literate whites the chances of

 movement were 62.1 percent for a 25 year old, blue collar worker who had
                                  9



$100 in real estate and resided in the North Central region, whereas it was

only 7.5 percent for a 50 year old farmer who had $5,000 in real estate and

resided in the Northeast.

        Although the 1950 census defined an urban area as an incorporated

place of 2,500 or more residents, there are several reasonable definitions

of the term "urban." Because the major structural change in the 19th

century was the transition from agriculture to industry, however, it is

appropriate to focus on the exodus from agriculture. The existence of small

manufacturing operations in what would be called "rural" areas by the 1950

census definition also suggests that a broad definition of "urban" is

reasonable for study of change during the era of industrialization.

Accordingly, "urban" is defined in this paper as a village, town, or city of

any size that was enumerated by the census and rural to urban migration is

defined as movement from a rural area to an urban area of any size.

        The focus on the decline of agriculture is legitimate but obscures

the interesting phenomenon of movement within urban areas. Which urban

areas grew most rapidly? To what extent was there increasing concentration

of populaton in major cities? Did small towns and villages act as feeders

for larger urban areas? Though not the focus of analysis in this paper,

Table 3 gives some perspective on these questions and on the definition of

rural to urban migration. The first row of the table shows that those who

no longer resided in rural areas after 1850 tended to avoid large cities;

 about 42 percent went to villages (under 2,500) while only 11 percent went

 to places of 25,000 or more. Though qualified by the fact of small sample

 sizes, the available evidence supports the hypothesis of upward movement to

 larger urban areas; over one—half of those who resided in an urban area of

 less than 2,500, for example, resided in a larger urban place in 1860.   The
                                   10


feeder pattern occurred in striking contrast to reverse migration; virtually

all of those who did not move up or remain within the same category moved to

a rural area. Almost without exception the smaller cities and towns were

not repositories for those who departed from larger urban areas.

        The finding that 43 percent of those who resided in urban areas in

1850 resided in rural areas in 1860 appears to be consistent with Frederick

Jackson Turner's hypothesis that the frontier acted as a safety—valve for

urban labor. However, none of those who left eastern urban areas moved to


the frontier.9   Rural areas may have been an outlet for urban labor but

the frontier was tangential to the process, at least for established

households during the time period from 1850 to 1860.



III. RURAL TO URBAN MIGRATION

        Of the 1,429 households residing in rural areas in 1850, 6.9

percent resided in urban areas in 1860. Though rural to urban migration

rates were low throughout the sample, the extent of movement differed by

region, varying from 9.2 percent in the Northeast, to 6.0 percent in the

North Central, and 6.9 percent in the South)°

         Of those who moved from a rural to an urban area, only 30.3 percent

 departed from their county of residence in 1850 and of these 63.0 percent

 traveled less than 100 miles. The importance of local migration to

 urbanization during the decade of the 1850s contrasts with a later era. By

 1940 and 1950 the majority of migrants to urban areas probably originated

 outside the state)1
         Data reported in Table 4 explain rural to urban movement in terms

 characteristics of the household head. In this and other logistic
                                  11


regressions in the paper, the dependent variable is dichotomous and takes

a value of 1 if the household moved. The strong negative association of age

and wealth observed for movement from rural to rural areas is absent from

the rural to urban movers. Indeed, the table shows that five out of six

coefficients on these variables were positive. As expected, children

impeded movement to urban areas; all six coefficients on the chilren's

variables were negative, however only two were statistically significant.

Although it is well—known that the foreign—born populated cities, their

migration behavior from rural areas was not systematically different from

that of the native-born.'2 Cities, towns, and villages throughout the

country systematically absorbed white collar and blue collar workers from

rural areas, but the rate of flow was greatest in the Northeast. In that

region the expected probability of migration to an urban area was 1.6

percent for farmers and other occupations but 21.3 percent for white collar

workers and 16.9 percent for blue collar workers. In the South the chances

were 4.5 percent for farmers and other occupations, 17.3 percent for white

collar workers and 10.4 percent for blue collar workers. The behavior of

unskilled workers was not systematically different from farmers and other

occupations in any region.



IV. URBAN TO RURAL MIGRATION
         Of the 148 households that resided in an urban area in 1850, 63

households or 42.6 percent resided in a rural area in 1860.13   Though high

 compared with the rate of 6.9 percent noted for rural to urban migration,

 the base for the reverse flow was small. Since 99 of 1,429 households moved
                                   12


from rural to urban areas, there was a small net gain of established

households in urban areas.

        Table 5 depicts the results of logistic regression explaining urban

to rural migration.14   As was the case for rural to urban migraton, but

unlike rural to rural migration, age and wealth had no systematic influence

on urban to rural movement. The evidence on numbers of children and

persistence in urban areas was mixed: only four out of six coefficients on

the number of children were positive and only the one for children under 10

in the North Central states was statistically significant. The systematic

retention of the foreign—born accords with perceptions of cities as

concentration points for emigrants from Europe; in the Northeast, for

example, the chances of outflow were 61.6 percent among native—born but only

5.6 percent among the foreign—born. With the exception of the Northeast

there was no systematic retention according to city size. In that region

the chances of outflow decreased from 77.1 percent for areas under 25,000 to

25.6 percent for cities of 25,000 but under 75,000, to 12.7 percent for

cities of 75,000 and above. White collar and blue collar workers tended to

persist in urban areas (all coefficients on these variables were negative),

but with the exception of blue collar workers in urban areas of the South

 there were no statistically significant patterns of departure by occupation.



V. MIGRATION AND OCCUPATIONAL CHANGE

         The extent to which 19th century America approached an egalitarian

 society has been an enduring source of animated debate.15 One aspect of the

 controversy concerns the relationship between geographic mobility and social

 and economic mobility. Some insights into the issues are available from
                                   13


data reported in Table 6. The table arranges the occupations reported in

1850 and 1860 of those who moved to or from urban areas and of those who

persisted into a matrix of categories used in the analysis of migration

(unskilled, farmer, blue collar, white collar, and other). Because the

total number of observations is reasonably small, the meaning of

"occupation" as listed by census enumerators is sometimes ambiguous, and the

choice of occupational groupings is partly arbitrary, conclusions suggested

by these data are necessarily tenative.'6 Given these qualifications, the

results are consistent with the hypothesis that upward mobility accompanied

movement to urban areas. About 13.0 percent of the stationary households

moved upward while 21.7 percent of those who moved to an urban area rose in


occupational classification.17 Unfortunately the number of unskilled who
moved to urban areas was very small and cannot be studied separately.

However, it is notable that among those unskilled (essentially laborers) who

did not migrate, 39 percent became farmers and about 23 percent became blue

collar or white collar workers. Recalling that all of the unskilled were

heads of established families in 1850, the finding that nearly two—thirds

 improved their position suggests that upward mobility in American society

was not a process confined to the acquisition of skills or wealth in advance

 of family formation.

         One half of those who were farmers in 1850 and who moved to urban

 areas continued to list farming as their occupation, while the other half

 were distributed among unskilled (13 percent), blue collar (16 percent),

 white collar (16 percent), and other occupations (6 percent). The farmers

 of urban residence presumably raised food for export to the city or town by
                                   14


working near the outskirts of the urban area and, in addition, they may have

engaged in nonagricultural pursuits on a part-time basis.

        It is not surprising that the farmers who left urban areas usually

remained devoted to farming. However, there was greater occupational shift

among blue and white collar categories when moving away compared with

movement into urban areas. About 43 percent of the former residents of

urban areas who were blue collar workers switched to farming while about

half as many (23 percent) of the white collar workers made this transition.

High rates of outflow from urban to rural areas, the extent of the shift to

farming among those who left urban areas, and the lack of mobility from

larger to smaller urban areas (noted in connection with the discussion of

Table 3) suggest that some of those who moved to urban areas may have had

the intention of accumulating a grubstake for use in agriculture.



VI. IMPLICATIONS
         There is widespread agreement that the United States was in the

 midst of industrialization during the 10 years after 1850, yet the package

 of evidence on the migration behavior of established households during this

 decade demonstrates the considerable reluctance of this group to commit

 labor to urban—industrial pursuits.18 Evidence on the migration behavior of

 households in the sample, given in the last row of Table 7, shows that

 established households in rural areas declined by only 2.6 percent.

 Although urban households increased by 24.7 percent, total population in

 urban areas increased by 73.2 percent, which implies that the share of

 established households in the total population of urban areas declined

 during the decade from 1850 to 1860. While it is too strong to characterize
                                  15


their behavior as an obstacle to industrialization, the supply of urban—

industrial labor, and presumably the rate of industrialization, was less

than it would have been had established households been more than modestly

involved in urban labor force growth. Industrial expansion in urban areas

was forced to cope with minor participation by a group that dominated the

total labor force.

        Why did established households add so little to labor force growth

in urban areas? The answer cannot be found in a general reluctance to move:

Over a 10 year period about 31.5 percent of all households in the sample

resided in a different county. This rate of mobility is several times

higher than the rural to urban rate of 6.9 percent, a pace which understates

the actual contrast because over two—thirds of the moves in this measure

occurred within the county of origin. Admittedly the rate of movement to

urban areas was higher in the Northeast (9.2 percent) where

industrialization was concentrated, but the conclusion that participation

was small also holds for that region.

        Instead, the search for an answer should begin in terms of the

economic model that views migration as an Investment. Their behavior

suggests that established households did not perceive the financial and

psychic package associated with movement to an urban area as a good

investment. Exactly which components in the package weighed heavily in the

decision—making process of established households is unclear, but the

regressions and information on regional rates of growth suggest some

insights into their priorities. One consideration is the presence of

children. Data in Table 4 make clear that children, especially those below

age 10, impaired rural to urban migration while information in Table 5 shows

 that young children tended to induce an outflow from urban areas. This
                                   16


result can be interpreted in terms of the financial outlays and opportunity

costs of caring for children in relation to their contribution to household

income and services. Children were relatively costly in urban areas on this

score.

         A strong negative relationship between age of the household head and

the chances of rural to rural migration was noted earlier. Yet, age did not

systematically influence rural-urban migration: households headed by older

men were about as likely to move to urban areas as those headed by younger

men. Why were mobile households headed by older men relatively more likely

to move to urban areas? One hypothesis consistent with this behavior is

that migrants to urban areas were failures at agriculture or at other

occupations characteristic of rural areas. Since the judgement of failure

was reached after a period of experimentation, trial, and error, the

migrants to urban areas were naturally older.    Opposed to this line of

thought is the finding that wealth, as measured by value of real estate, had

no systematic influence on the chances of moving to urban areas.   While it

is possible that some migrants to urban areas were financial failures, the

group included successful individuals as well. A different approach to the

question highlights the costs and benefits of children in urban versus rural

areas and therefore the importance of control over fertility as an

ingredient in the decision to migrate. Although there is some evidence that

 family limitation may have been practiced in parts of the United States by

 the mid 19th century, the extent of the practice, and especially its

 effectiveness is questionable.19 It is likely that most couples who might

 have contemplated a move to an urban area could not have controlled family

 size reliably. Under these circumstances some families may have delayed a
                                  17


move until the biological clock either assured that additional children were

not forthcoming or had significantly reduced the chances of conception.

        Preferences expressed by rural—urban migrants for continuing a given

line of work may also be understood within the investment framework. In

addition to the costs of moving, changing occupations to a line of work

suitable for urban areas may have required outlays and foregone earnings for

retraining that were not feasible or possible for many prospective migrants.

Risks of earnings loss could be added to the liabilities of moving to an

urban area. Cities were unhealthy places of residence during the mid 19th

century and the possibility of incapacitation through illness and poor

health was probably greater for recent migrants.2°   Households that had

incurred commitments for the care of children would have been understandably

risk averse, and so retraining costs and the possibility of poor health

could have weighed heavily in decisions to avoid urban areas. The finding

that rural residents who were white collar or blue collar workers were more

likely than farmers to move to urban areas is consistent with an important

role for retraining costs and risk aversion. In this context, the

acquisition of skills marketable in urban areas while living in rural areas

 may have been an important first step in the use of labor from established

 households in urban areas.

         Table 7 shows that established households increased at a rate

 substantially below total population growth in urban areas of the Northeast

 and the North Central states while the rate actually exceeded total

 population growth in urban areas of the South. The rate of outflow from

 rural areas was also relatively high in the South. Why did the composition

 of migration to urban areas of the South include relatively more established
                                   18



households? A complete answer to this question would require information on

expected earnings and living costs by household type and region in rural and

urban areas. While it is conceivable that considerations of cost and

earnings alone could explain these migration patterns, the differences in

migration were so large relative to likely differences in earnings and costs

that other factors were probably involved. Perceptions of cities and the

urban way of life in the mind of rural residents may have been among the

other factors. The late antebellum period witnessed a moral crusade that

intertwined themes of anti—slavery, temperance, and Christian principles of

clean living. Evangelical Protestants were particularily effective in

promoting the movement. Reinforced by anti-Papal sentiments, many northern

rural Protestants saw their cities as dens of iniquity that were inhabited

by foreigners, many of whom were Roman Catholics, and given to places of

drinking, gambling, and vice. In this view cities would have been

undesirable places for raising a family, regardless of the number of

children. Rural southerners were also suspicious of the social and moral

climate of cities but avoidance of urban areas may have been greater among

northerners because their cities were larger and more likely to have been

inhabited by foreigners and Catholics and because the antislavery campaign

in that region strengthened the moral crusade. Although the Protestant

ethic has been cited as promoting the development of capitalism, the ethic

of Protestants may have inhibited the creation of an urban labor force

during America's industrial revolution.

        The distribution of income and related patterns of real wages during

 the 19th century have been a lively topic of research in recent years.

Jeffrey Williamson and Peter Lindert have argued that inequality of wealth

and income increased in the United States after 1820 through a process of
                                  19



wage "stretching." Although an increase in the ratio of skilled to

unskilled wages could have been caused by relatively rapid increases in the

supply of unskilled labor associated with European immigration, which was

particularily heavy from the mid 1840s through the mid 1850s, their general

equilibrium analysis attributes the widening gap principally to different

growth rates in the demand for labor. Specifically, they argue that capital

accumulation and mechanization displaced the unskilled but favored skilled

labor, which was need as a complement ot machinery. Others have debated the

                                                      21
conceptual and the empirical basis of their claims.        The migration

patterns discussed in this paper furnish indirect evidence on the

controversy over whether the skilled wage premium increased.     The phenomenon

of "stretching" the wage structure required relatively inelastic supplies of

skilled labor; the finding that established households were reluctant to

move to urban areas is consistent with this requirement. The fundamental

issue, however, is changes in demand relative to supply. If the rewards to

skilled labor were increasing relative to unskilled labor in urban areas,

 then one would expect to observe higher rates of migration to urban areas by

skilled compared with unskilled labor; this pattern of migration existed

 throughout the country and was particularily strong in the Northeast.     In

 that region the chances of migration were insignificantly different for

 unskilled workers versus farmers and other occupations while the probability

 of movement was 1.6 percent for farmers and other occupations but 21.3

 percent for white collar workers and 16.9 percent for blue collar workers.



 VII. CONCLUDING REMARKS
                                  20


       Because migrants to urban areas during the 19th century were often

unattached young adults, one may question the contribution of research on

established households to the overall picture of urbanization.22 Even

though their patterns of migration were not studied, by implication and

extension this research sheds light on aspects of young adult behavior.

That larger numbers of children impeded movement to urban areas, for

example, is consistent with the high rates of movement observed among the

young and unattached. Assuming that responses to Incentives were similar,

or at least not perverse, rates of movement among the unattached, though

higher in general, should have followed patterns broadly characteristic of

established households. One would expect, regardless of family attachment,

that rates of movement to urban areas were relatively higher among white

collar and blue collar workers, and rates of urban persistence were

relatively higher among the foreign-born and among those who resided in

larger cities of the Northeast.

                           APPENDIX: THE DATA

       A sample of households linked in the 1850 and 1860 census

manuscripts was prepared to study urbanization, spatial patterns of

mobility, and the selectivity of movement and their relationship to the

functioning of labor makets and economic growth.23 To help address diverse

issues, the total sample consisted of parts selected according to criteria

of area and population. The number of counties selected per state was

proportional to the relative population of the state among all states in the

area sample, while in the population sample it was proportional to the

relative population of the state among all states. Ten households were

selected at random from each county and at least one county was selected

from each state for each sample. Households were sought from a total of 300

counties, of which 150 were allocated to each type of sample. All the

information from the manuscript schedules was coded for 2,861 households.

The total number falls short of 3,000 because the schedules for some

counties did not exist, were not legible, or had less than 10 families

meeting the criteria discussed below.

        The approach to matching exploited the indexes of household heads

that exist for each state enumerated in the 1850 census. These indexes,

which were prepared by Accelerated Indexing Systems of Salt Lake City, are

arranged alphabetically by last name and include the county of residence and

the page number where the family was recorded in the manuscript schedules.

However, many individuals could have had the same name, approximately the

same age, and the same state of birth, and so additional restrictions were

 imposed on the selection of families from the 1860 census to assure

 identification in 1850. All households were sought in the same county and,
                                   22


providing there were no more than 10 heads with the same name in the state,

within the same state of residence as located in 1860, but it simply was not

feasible to trace those not found in this way among the indexes for all

states. Instead, those families selected from the 1860 schedules were

required to have a child at least 10 years old. The reported state of birth

of the youngest child greater than or equal to 10 acted as a pointer to the

state where the family was likely to be found in 1850.

        Of course, not all families were located by these methods. Of the

2,861 recorded from the 1860 census, 180 or 6.3 percent were not sought for

reasons of a common name, and 59 percent of the remainder were found. In

appraising these results it is important to distinguish losses that occurred

through the equivalent of a random process (not systematically related to

migration) from those that were attributable to the object of investigation

 (migration). Random losses merely increased the costs of data collection

while losses attributable to migration could bias results. The incidence of

 common names was not systematically related to known determinants of

 migration such as wealth, age, and occupation.24 About 25 to 30 percent,

 and concieveably more, of the 41 percent not found were unavoidable losses

 attributable to underenumeration in the 1850 census. Errors of omission and

 transcription in the census indexes and reporting errors in the 1860 census,

 which were arguably unrelated to migration, may have been the source of 60

 to 70 percent of the matching failures. Approximately 31.5 percent of those

 matched in 1850 lived in a different county in 1860, and thus it seems

 likely that only a small share of potentially observable intercounty moves

 were lost through the matching procedure.

Geographic Persistence Rates," Historical Methods, 19 (Fall 1986), pp. 171—

 5. Based on a likelihood—ratio test, the determinants of rural to rural

migration were systematically different from those for rural to urban

migration at 0.005. The logit model and methodology of testing are

discussed in Gregory C. Chow, Econometrics (New York, 1983), pp. 255—263.

       Additional analysis of rural to rural migration will be reported in

subsequent work.

     6. The value of -2 log X shown at the bottom of the table, and in other

 tables of the paper, is a measure of the significance of the regression

 relationship. The term X is the likelihood ratio and equals the value of

 the likelihood function obtained when all parameter values are set equal to

 zero divided by the value of the likelihood function obtained under the
                                  31


maintained hypothesis. The variable —2 log X has a chi—square distribution

with as many degrees of freedom as parameter values set equal to zero, which

is 13 in the case of Table 2.

    Many migration studies have found that migration rates are nonlinear as

a function of age. The chances of movement rise from low rates at ages in

the teens, reach a peak in the mid—twenties, and then fall more or less

regularily at the older ages. See, for example, Hope T. Eldridge and

Dorothy Swain Thomas, Population Redistribution and Economic Growth, United

States, 1870—1950, Vol. 3, Demographic Analyses and Interrelations

(Philadelphia, 1964), pp. 132—138. Given this pattern, one could argue that

a squared term in age should be included among the regressors. However, the

the sample is composed overwhelmingly of household heads whose ages fell on

the declining portion of the age—migration relationship. Only 3.5 percent

of the heads were below age 25 in 1850. Moreover, age and age—squared are

jointly insignificant if included in this equation and are usually

insignificant in other equations involving age reported in the paper. The

exception involves urban to rural migration in the North Central states; in

that instance the chances of movement reached a minimum at age 37.3.

 7. The definitions of occupational groups follow those outlined in appendix

B of Stephan Thernstrom, The Other Bostonians. (Cambridge, 1973). Given

the imprecision of occupational listings by the census and the debate over

what constitutes appropriate groupings, the results give only a general

impression of migration flows by occupational categories. In 1850 the white

collar workers consisted primarily of clergyman (3.0%), clerks (5.5%),

doctors and physicians (9.7%), grocers (2.5%), innkeepers (2.1%), lawyers

and attorneys (7.2%), lumber merchants (2.1%), manufacturers (3.0%),

merchants (22.4%), overseers (4.2%), teachers (3.4%), and traders (2.1%).
                                   32



The blue collar workers were composed largely of blacksmiths (8.2%),

bricklayers and masons (4.2%), butchers (2.3%), cabinet makers (3.3%),

carpenters (18.6%), coopers (4.2%), millers (3.3%), shoemakers (10.1%),

tailors (4.2%), wagon makers (3.6%), and wheelwrights (2.3%). Laborers

(89.1%) dominated the unskilled.

 8. Distances were measured from centroids of population in each county.

 9. Of 124 households that resided in urban areas of the East (defined as

east of the 90th meridian, which is a few miles east of St. Louis), none

moved to rural areas of the West (defined as west of the 90th meridian).

Changing the definition of region to the 88th or the 92nd meridian has no

effect on the results.

10. In this discussion region is defined by place of residence in 1860.

The regional comparisons should be viewed cautiously because methods of

enumerating town and village populations may have varied. The published

census for New England, for example, tended to report separately only the

 larger urban areas. The measure of rural to urban migration may therefore

 understate the actual extent of movement in the Northeast compared with

 other regions. Townships that had populations in excess of 10,000 residents

 were arbitrarily counted as urban areas. Even if all concentrations of

 population corresponding to towns and villages of size less than 10,000 were

 not distinguished from truly rural areas in the New England census, however,

 the measured extent of rural to urban migration by established households in

 the Northeast (9.2 percent) is remarkably small compared with the extent of

 urban growth, however defined, in the region.

    Likelihood—ratio tests indicate that determinants of migration differed

 systematically across regions. The regression relationships were
                                   33


significantly different at 0.05 (Northeast versus North Central), 0.20

(Northeast versus South), and 0.15 (North Central versus South).

11. Eldridge and Thomas, Population Redistribution, p. 210.

12. Unfortunately, there are insufficient observations to distinguish among

country of birth for the foreign—born. Similarily, observations are lacking

to investigate the behavior of blacks and the illiterate by region.

However, if the regions are combined in a single analysis, the probability

of migration to urban areas was systematically higher for blacks compared

with whites. The finding of higher mobility for blacks reinforces the

point on the mobility of this group made in the section on rural to rural

migration.

13. These figures pertain to the Northeast, North Central, and South only.

High rates of outmigration, which have been documented for specific urban

areas in the United States, also characterized European cities in the 19th

century. See Peter R. Knights, The Plain People of Boston, 1830—1860: A

Study in City Growth (New York, 1971), pp. 103—104; Paul M. Hohenberg and

Lynn Hollen Lees, The Making of Urban Europe, 1000—1950 (Cambridge, 1985),

p. 255.

14. Likelihood-ratio tests indicate that determinants of urban to rural

migration differed systematically by region. The regression relationships

were significantly different at 0.10 (Northeast versus north Central), 0.025

(Northeast versus South), and 0.08 (North Central versus South). In

addition, within each region the regression relationships determining rural

to urban versus urban to rural migration were significantly different at

0.005.

15. The controversy is illustrated by the debate over the "egalitarian

myth." See Robert E. Galiman, "Professor Pessen on the "Egalitarian Myth,'"
                                  34



Social Science History 2(Win. 1978), PP. 194—207; Edward Pessen, "On a

Recent Cliometric Attempt to Resurrect the Myth of Antebellum

Egalitarianism," Social Science History 3 (Win. 1979), PP. 208—227. The

debate extends beyond social and occupational mobility and incorporates the

distribution of wealth. The matched sample of households includes

information on wealth (measured by value of real estate) but my analysis of

these data will be reported in another paper.

16. A critique of the debate over occupational classification and social

mobility is available in Patrick M. Horan, "Occupational Mobility and

Historical Social Structure," Social Science History 9 (Win. 1985), pp. 25—

47.

17. Upward is defined as movement from unskilled to farmer, blue collar, or

white collar; farmer to blue collar or white collar; and blue collar to

white collar. The percentages are significantly different at 0.10.

 18. This pattern has been observed in other countries. Young, single adults

 also comprised the majority of newcomers to European cities in the 19th

 century. However, there were instances of widespread movement of families

 to cities in Ireland and Germany. See Hohenberg and Lees, The Making of

 Modern Europe, pp. 255-56.

22. Established households and unattached individuals do not exhaust the

demographic classification of those who migrated to urban areas. Some men

who moved from rural areas temporarily left their wife and children to find

 employment in the city.

 23. Record linkage going forward from 1850 to 1860, though desirable, is an

 very difficult task (prohibitively expensive) for a substantial national

 sample (given present technology and data resources) because households

 would have to be sought in all possible locations. Backward linkage from

 1860 to 1850 is feasible, however, by using information on the likely place

 of origin of the family contained in reports of places of birth of children.
