Health Status, Disability and Retirement Incentives in Belgium

                                           ABSTRACT

Many Belgian retire well before the statutory retirement age. Numerous exit routes from the labor
force can be identified: old-age pensions, conventional early retirement, disability insurance, and
unemployment insurance are the most prominent ones. We analyze the retirement decision of Belgian
workers adopting an option value framework, and pay special attention to the role of health status.
We estimate probit models of retirement using data from SHARE. The results show that health and
incentives matter in the decision to exit from the labor market. Based on these results, we simulate
the effect of potential reforms on retirement.

    1. Introduction
    In previous volumes of this NBER series on Social Security Programs and Retirement around the

World, Pestieau and Stijns (1999), Dellis et al (2004), Desmet et al (2007) and Jousten et al (2010,

2012) documented how the Belgian social protection landscape offers a variety of pathways to

retirement before reaching the normal retirement age (NRA) – that is currently fixed at 65. For

contractual wage‐earners, who represent the majority of the Belgian workforce, these early exit

routes include an early exit option in the old‐age pension scheme (OAP), conventional early

retirement (CER), unemployment insurance (UI) and disability insurance (DI).


    In this chapter, we focus our attention on the potential link between health status, disability

insurance and retirement for contractual wage earners aged 50‐64. Jousten et al (2012) already

explored the link between aggregate indicators of health and disability, on the one hand, and

retirement on the other. The present study extends the analysis by taking a cross‐sectional approach

at the individual worker level.


    For this purpose we use the Belgian sample of SHARE, the Survey of Health, Ageing and

Retirement in Europe which has been collected since 2004.2 The survey is a cross‐national panel

database of micro data on health, socio‐economic status and social and family networks of European

individuals aged 50 and over conducted since 2004‐05. It covers a broad range of variables of special

interest for this study such as information on employment, health and the household context. We

       This paper uses data from SHARE wave 4 release 1.1.1, as of March 28th 2013 or SHARE wave 1 and 2
release 2.5.0, as of May 24th 2011 or SHARELIFE release 1, as of November 24th 2010. The SHARE data
collection has been primarily funded by the European Commission through the 5th Framework Programme
(project QLK6‐CT‐2001‐00360 in the thematic programme Quality of Life), through the 6th Framework
Programme (projects SHARE‐I3, RII‐CT‐2006‐062193, COMPARE, CIT5‐CT‐2005‐028857, and SHARELIFE, CIT4‐
CT‐2006‐028812) and through the 7th Framework Programme (SHARE‐PREP, N° 211909, SHARE‐LEAP, N°
227822 and SHARE M4, N° 261982). Additional funding from the U.S. National Institute on Aging (U01

use detailed self‐reported information on health to compute a continuous health index and

retrospective data to compute retirement incentives. We also construct an option value indicator as

in Stock and Wise (1990) to compare the relative values of continued work versus retirement. We

then use both of these indicators as independent variables in a micro‐estimation of retirement

decisions by means of a probit model.


    While Dellis et al (2004) relied on administrative records on Belgian workers our estimation is

based on SHARE survey data. One distinct advantage of SHARE is the availability of a rich set of health

indicators (both subjective and objective); a distinct disadvantage is a significantly smaller availability

of information on careers as compared to the pension register data.


    This chapter is organized in several sections. The following section presents some stylized facts

on disability participation among the people aged 50 to 64 years. Our empirical approach is described

in Section 3, including a detailed description of the construction of a synthetic health index and the

option value indicator. A rich set of probit models are estimated and results are reported in Section

4. Section 5 provides some micro‐simulations of some stylized reform scenarios. Section 6 concludes.




    2. The role of Disability Insurance
    The role of DI has been changing quite substantially over time – as can be document using

administrative data. Jousten et al (2012) provided a detailed discussion of the role of DI in the

retirement landscape. Figures 1 to 2 summarize the trend in DI participation as observed in

administrative data for the population of wage earners (aged 50 and more), by age group and sex. 3

wage‐earner. The denominator includes all active wage‐earners, as well as all social security beneficiaries

(excluding pensioners) who are receiving benefits based on a work spell as a contractual wage‐earner.


                                                                        4
    For men, DI participation rates decreased over time for the three age categories 50‐54, 55‐59

and 60‐64, with a particularly strong decrease among the 60 to 64 category. As reported in Jousten et

al (2012), the decreasing evolution of DI cannot be traced to an increased DI stringency over time,

but rather to the progressive introduction and successive decreases in stringency of other early exit

routes. Among women, the longer‐run trend towards a decrease in DI participation for the age

groups 50 to 54 and 55 to 59 has more recently been reversed, with a likely link with stricter

eligibility criteria in early retirement options as indicated by Jousten et al (2012). Therefore, as in the

case of men, the evolution is less in relation with changes in DI stringency than in relation with the

evolution of eligibility rules under alternative pathways.


    The situation for women aged 60 to 64 is an outlier to this picture, and predominantly driven by

changes in the normal retirement age (NRA). Before 1997, the NRA was 60 years for women, de facto

leading to very few active women beyond this age. From 1997 to 2009 women’s normal age of

retirement was progressively increased by one year of age every three calendar years so as to reach

an NRA of 65 for women in 2009 – the same as has been applicable for men for the last decades.4

This explains the fast increase in DI rates among women in this age category.


    Figure 3 and 4 present the labor force participation rate and the DI participation rate for the

older age group of 60‐64. While the DI participation for women follows the labor force participation

for the reason explained above, it is not the case for men where trends are opposite in the later part

of the observation period. This apparent lack of synchronization between the variables can be traced

to several causes, two of which are particularly marked. First, multiple early retirement pathways

        The alignment of the normal age of retirement for women on that of men was decided in response to a

judgment of the European Court of Justice ruling that differential criteria by sex constitute discrimination.

exist and interact, hence leading to a weakening of the link between each one of them and the

aggregate labor market outcomes. Second, since the late 1990’s, a reversal of the longstanding trend

towards lower effective retirement could be observed all across a wide variety of countries (see the

previous volumes of this series), and this to a large degree irrespectively of the incentive structure

prevailing in any specific country.

           DI has a very diverse impact the various subgroups of the population – particularly when

comparing along the education and health dimensions. As Belgium does not have any systematically

collected administrative data on those topics, we turn to SHARE to derive some stylized facts. Figures

5 and 6 illustrate the evolution over the period ranging from the first wave of SHARE (2004‐2005) to

the last one available to date (2010‐2011). 5 They summarize the DI probabilities for male and female

wage‐earners respectively, within the 50 to 64 age group stratified by education level. Overall, there

is a strong negative gradient between education level and DI probability for wage‐earners. The sole

exception is the case of women in 2006/07 (SHARE wave 2), where the DI probability is higher for the

intermediate category than for the low educated, likely due to a small‐sample problem.




           5
                      Three waves of SHARE are useable for this analysis: waves 1 (2004‐2005), 2 (2006‐2007) and 4 (2010‐

2011). Wave 3 conducted in 2008‐2009 (known as SHARELIFE) does not include questions on individuals’

current situation, but mainly retrospective questions.

     Figures 7 and 8 illustrate the evolution of DI probabilities among men and women, respectively,

by health quintiles. Without entering in the details of health quintiles computations, which will be

presented in detail in Section 4.3, we observe in these figures that DI probabilities are positively

related to health in SHARE, but above all that for people in the lower health quintile the DI

probability reaches values as high as 50% in some survey waves.

the combined SHARE waves 1, 2 and 4. Employment increases along the health gradient, both for

men and women, and is negatively correlated with education.

     3. Empirical approach
     As mentioned before, our main goal is to understand the influence of health status and the

provisions of social protection schemes on retirement decisions. For this purpose we estimate a

discrete‐time retirement model in which exit from the labor market Ri  1 is explained by social

protection incentives, health and other covariates.

     For individual i:


                         
      Pr Ri  1  Pr X i'    OVi   H i                                                       (1)


     where X i' is a vector of taste‐shifters variables, OVi is a social security incentive, an option value

measure, and Hi is a measure of health status.


     In our econometric analysis, we use the first two waves of data from SHARE collected in 2004‐05

and 2006‐07 for Belgium. The third wave of data, known as SHARELIFE (collected in 2008‐09), asked

all previous respondents (waves 1 and 2) and their partners to provide information not on their

current situation but on their entire life–histories. This provides retrospective information on

childhood, health, living and professional career. We combine the first two waves with the




                                                               11
retrospective data from SHARELIFE to obtain a full career history for each individual.6 For individuals

surveyed in any wave we can observe when they exited the labor market and through which

pathways. This means that while there are usually 2 years between each wave we can observe a

year‐to‐year transitions. The advantage is that instead of seeing an individual just once between two

waves, we follow him along the years between two waves and we know his actual status in each

year. We restrict the sample to the individuals who are aged between 50 and 64. In each wave (1 or

2) we select those individuals who were employed as wage earners and exclude retired, unemployed,

sick and disabled. We also exclude individuals for whom retrospective information is not available in

SHARELIFE. Finally we drop all the records for the years that are subsequent to the year when the

individual exited the labor force. Our analytical sample consists of 1,210 observations.

    Two crucial steps in our analysis relate to the derivation of a synthetic health measure and the

calculation of a summary indicator of retirement incentives. For the former, we rely on a continuous

health index computed using a principle component analysis based on nearly 25 self‐reported health

indicators. For the latter, we rely on an “inclusive” version of the concept of option value, de facto a

weighted average of the option values for each pathway to retirement. We detail the approach

below.



    3.1. Measurement of health status
    Identifying the effects of health on retirement is complicated because people’s health is not

directly observable. The use of surveys wherein people report subjective self‐assessments of their

physical capacity can often be misleading. Indeed, it is a subjective assessment and there is no reason




    6
        SHARE wave 4 data was also available but not usable for this purpose given that wave 3, SHARELIFE, did

not report detailed information on health and on other key variables for this study.


                                                          12
to expect that such assessments are entirely comparable across individuals. Also, answers may not

be independent of the outcomes we wish to study. For example, individuals who are inactive often

have an incentive to report worse than actual health. In such situations, subjective health indicators

measure leisure preferences rather than true health status.

    It is thus preferable to use objective indicators of health. The issue is to find objective measures

that are correlated with work capacity and that truly reflect the individuals’ ability to work. The

SHARE data contain a variety of objective and subjective measures of health. Using objective

measures of physical ability in addition to self‐reported health status, we propose to derive a latent

health index similar to Poterba et al (2010). To construct the index we use responses to 24 questions

and obtain the first principal component of these underlying indicators of health. The first principal

component is the weighted average of the health indicators, where the weights are chosen to

maximize the proportion of the variance of the indicators that can be explained by the first principal

component.7

    All data from waves 1, 2 and 4 of SHARE are used to calculate the principal components. These

are then in a second step applied to all observations of waves 1 and 2 that are the basis for our

econometric analysis – de facto attributing a health index for each individual in each one of the two

waves under study. Thus an individual may experience changes of the health status across the survey

waves. The health score obtained from the first principal component is converted into percentile

scores for each observation with 1 the worst health and 100 the best. Later on the analysis we group

persons by health status quintiles using this score. Figure 11 displays the average health percentile in

        The list of health questions used in the principal component analysis is available in the Appendix, as well

as the correlation coefficients corresponding to the first component.

      3.2. Pathways to retirement
      Wage earners face several typical pathways to retirement. A first pathway consists of an

immediate transfer from work into the old age pension system (OAP). The OAP currently allows

claiming early retirement as of age 60, when some career requirements are met. The normal

retirement age, at which anybody can claim OAP benefit independently of career requirements, is

currently set at age 65 for both men and women. Notice that during the first two waves of SHARE

data collection from 2004‐2005, the normal retirement age for women was still under the transitory

regime reaching 63 for the first wave and 64 for the second.


      Benefits correspond to 75% of average lifetime earnings for one‐earner couples and to 60% for

singles – with two earner couples having the right to a top‐up to the said 75 percent if the secondary



                                                                14
earner’s pension is smaller than this household supplement. Claiming early does not imply any

actuarial adjustment of benefits as compared to claiming at NRA.


    A full career corresponds to 45 years of earnings or assimilated periods, with average lifetime

earnings computed over the same 45 year period. A specificity of the Belgian retirement landscape is

that periods spent on replacement income (such as CER, UI or DI) fully count as years worked in the

computation of the retirement benefits. For any such periods, fictive wages are inserted into the

earnings history. For the period of our analysis, these fictive wages correspond to the real wage that

the individual was earning right before his period of inactivity. Benefits are shielded against inflation

through an automatic price adjustment and an earning test frequently applies before the NRA.


    Next to the public pension system, several early retirement pathways have emerged. The CER

program was explicitly designed as an early exit route. It is based on collective agreements, which are

negotiated between employee and employer associations. Within this program, the workers exit the

labor market and receive an unemployment compensation paid by the UI system and a bonus paid

by the employer, which equals half of the difference between the individual’s last net wage and the

special unemployment benefit applicable to CER beneficiaries. Both benefits and reference wage

have caps and floors. The CER program implies that workers cannot draw public pension benefits

before the NRA, at which age he is automatically rolled over into the OAP system. The generally

applicable eligibility rule sets out that they have to satisfy a minimum age of 58 and a career of at

least 25 years, but exceptions exist that allow some workers to exit through CER as early as age 50

with as little as a career of 10 years.

    Regular UI benefits represent a second effective exit route into retirement. In Belgium there is no

generally applicable time limit for UI benefit receipt, except for the automatic rollover provision of

unemployed into retirement upon reaching the NRA. The level of these benefits depends on the


                                                     15
family status and the duration of the unemployment spell. In theory, they are equal to 60% of the

previous net wage if the individual is single or has family dependents. If the spouse or partner has

income, benefits are equal to 55% of last net wage. In practice, they have caps and floors that vary

according to the duration of the unemployment spell, de facto somewhat weakening the mechanical

nature of the mentioned replacement rates.

    Within the group of unemployed, special rules are applicable to some categories of older

workers, a system known as Old‐Age Unemployment (OAU) as documented in Jousten et al (2012).

While the system has played an important role in the Belgian retirement landscape, we do not

explicitly take it into account in our analysis for two reasons. First, in SHARE data, OAU is

observationally indistinguishable from UI. Second, successive policy changes over the course of the

last decade have effectively dismantled the system as a stand‐alone program and brought it back into

the realm of the regular UI. In fact, the two key benefits of the system as compared to regular UI

have been decoupled and significantly tightened: a waiver from the general job search requirement

and the conditions for benefiting from a seniority supplement.

    Last but not least, though a priori exclusively targeted at those withdrawing from the labor

market for reasons of bad health, DI may also serve as an early exit route. The eligibility is based on

loss of earnings capacity. In order to be eligible, the worker has to suffer from a loss of earnings

capacity of 66% over a period of 12 months. The benefit level is a function of the household status

and is equal to 65% of reference wage if the worker has dependents. It is reduced to 53% if the

insured lives alone and to 45% if the individual cohabits. As for unemployment, benefits are payable

up to the NRA with automatic rollover into OAP occurring at that age.

    Figures 12 and 13 provide empirical evidence on the importance of the various programs across

time, for men and women separately. The percentages are computed as the proportion of all social

protection beneficiaries, within the 50 to 64 years old category, in a particular program at each year.

                                                    16
We see the role of the various pathways in absorbing the change in one or another – with UI

effectively playing the role of program of last resort.

     For men we observe over the last years an increase in the proportion of pensioners (OAP). For

women, Figure 13, we observe on the contrary a dramatic decrease in the proportion of pensioners,

due to the progressive postponement of the NRA from 60 to 65 compensated mainly by

unemployment (UI) and, in a lower proportion, by disability (DI). Over the transition period, from

1997 to 2009, the number of women aged 50 to 64 years old and beneficiaries of these programs

increase of more than 50%.

     3.3. Weighting the pathways to retirement
     As described above, there are four potential pathways to retirement for wage‐earners in

Belgium. Our empirical strategy relies on the computation of a summary financial incentive that

summarizes the incentives associated with the four pathways. The idea is to calculate for each of

these pathways to retirement an incentive measure that is aggregated into one final inclusive

measure using path‐specific weights.

     Since we cannot observe each individual’s exact eligibility for the various exit routes, we are not

able to determine the probability that a given pathway is a realistic option for the individual. Instead

we impute to each pathway a weight that the pathway is on average a realistic prospect for the

population aged 50 and more. The weights are based on administrative data. We use the share of the

population for the age group 50‐64 that is either on disability (DI), unemployment (UI) or early


                                                                     18
retirement (CER). Old age pension (OAP) takes the residual such that the sum of the weights is equal

to one. The 50‐64 age‐window corresponds to the main ages at‐risk of retirement in Belgium. Figures

14 and 15 present these weights for the last twenty years. Interestingly, we observe for men a

decrease of the weight of disability but an increase for women due to the postponement of women’

normal age of retirement.

    3.4. Option value calculations
    Thanks to the data from SHARELIFE we are able to reconstruct the individual’s career history and

thus ultimately to calculate the entitlements to benefits. SHARELIFE asks the respondents to provide

start and end dates of each paid job they had, the characteristics of the job, as well as the first

monthly wage. For those who are still employed at the time of the interview, the last monthly wage

is also asked. All these amounts are after taxes.

    This information is used to construct a panel with one wage observation per year for each

individual, from the first job until the interview year. For simplicity we convert all amounts to EUR of

2008. The wage path is obtained using linear interpolation of wages for the years where we lack

wage information. During unemployment, sickness and disability as well as early retirement periods,

fictive wages equal to the last observed wage are assigned, as required by calculation rules of public

pension. As a result, we can project each individual’s entitlements under the 4 exit routes based on

each individual’s own earnings history.

    As indicated before, our financial incentive measure (OV) is a forward‐looking measure based on

the concept of option value of retirement, as defined by Stock and Wise (1990). In the option value

model, an individual evaluates the expected present discounted value of income for all possible

future retirement ages through a route to retirement and then compares the value of retirement

today versus the value at the optimal age. It is based on a utility‐maximization framework. Under the

reduced form formulation, the value at age a of retirement h, Va (h) , is given by (to simplify the

presentation, we hide here the individual’s subscript index i):

               h 1                   s
    Va (h)   ( s )  s  aWs   ( s )  s  a kBh ( s )
                                                              
                                                                                                 (2)
              s a                   s h




                                                              20
    Where θ (s ) is the survival probability at age s, ρ is the rate of time preference and Bh (s) is the

benefit expected at age s if the worker retires at age h. W s is the earnings from continued working.

Depending on the household situation, θ (s ) also accounts for survivor benefits.8


    The variable γ is a parameter of relative risk aversion and is set equal to 0.75. Finally, the

parameter k expresses the relative weight of utility of retirement income and is set equal to 1.5.


    Letting h * be the year in the future at which the individual maximizes her/his expected value of

retiring, the option value (OV) is then defined as the difference in utility terms between retiring at

                                    
the best point in the future h or now a  :
                              *




    OVa ( h * )  Va ( h * )  Va ( a )                                                                      (3)


    We rely on an inclusive version of the option value that is a weighted average of the option value

associated to each potential route (pathway) to retirement. In order to compute the OV for each

pathway to retirement, we need to make a projection of individual‐level wages. In our analysis, we

assume a real growth of wages of 0 going forward. Using this information and the whole career

information compiled from SHARELIFE, we compute expected benefit flows for every pathway to

retirement (DI, UI, CER and OAP) for each possible age of retirement up to the NRA. Finally, we

integrate expected benefits and expected wages in equations (2) and (3) to derive the option value

for each retirement pathway.

    Figure 16 and 17 show the mean OV for each pathway for men and women. The pattern is

downward sloping for each OV as well as for both men and women. That is that the utility to be



    8
        We use a discount rate of 3% which is very often used in the literature. Mortality tables by sex for the

Belgian population are used to compute θ(s). The source is the Human Mortality Database (www.mortality.org).


                                                            21
gained from working one more year tends to decline with age and gets closer to zero at the NRA. The

positive nature of the OV over the whole age range is mainly due to the utility term associated with

wage income and the benefit formulae applicable under the various Belgian social security programs.

Figure 16 and 17 show that the incentive to stay in the labor force when having an option to exit

through CER, UI and DI is rather weak at ages below 60, as the OV indicator is flat over the entire age

range. It is only when focusing on the OAP route that retirement before 60 is a highly uninteresting

option – as for the latter case the individual would be getting zero income until the age of 60 (the

early retirement age of the OAP system).

    The inclusive OV indicator summarizes these path‐specific OV’s into a single measure using the

previously derived weights. For each individual and for each possible age of retirement, inclusive OV

is calculated. The mean of the inclusive OV by age is plotted on Figures 16 and 17 by means of a

continuous curve, for men and women respectively. Unsurprisingly, given the weight structure, the

OV associated with OAP exerts a predominant effect on the inclusive OV indicator, hence leading to

an overall incentive to delay retirement.

    4. Results
    In this section we present a series of results obtained from binary probit estimations. The

dependent variable is the binary retirement indicator: it is equal to one if the individual exits the

labor force within the year, and zero otherwise. In each specification, we include the inclusive OV as

a summary measure of financial incentive, to which we add a series of control variables that vary

depending on the specification. Marginal effects are presented.

    In specification 1 and 2 in Table 2, we only include the inclusive OV as well as a health indicator in

the specification. For heath, we use dummies for each health quintile (based on the previously

defined health index). Specification 1 uses linear age while specification 2 is set up with age

dummies. In specification 3 and 4, we include a richer set of socio‐demographic variables such as

gender, the level of education as well as dummies for marital status and active spouses.

Furthermore, to capture wealth effects, we include the total household financial assets.

    Specification 5 conceptually deviates from the previous ones in that it does not contain any linear

or age dummy effect. The rationale for this alternative is related to an identification problem in all of

these regressions: which is the pure effect of age on retirement, independently of the effect of

pension schemes rules? The data we use does not allow us to address this identification issue, many

more waves of SHARE would be necessary. Hence, in specifications 1 to 4, the age dummies or the

linear age trend capture a mix of both.


    In specification 5 we take an extreme alternative by estimating the effect of OV under the

assumption that any age‐of‐eligibility effect is fully taken into account by the inclusive OV variable.

Implicitly, this also implies that we give the inclusive OV incentive variable a maximum role, though it

does not by itself address the identification problem – it just takes a slightly different view. The

approach turns out to be particularly useful when trying to gauge the effect of reform simulations

(see the next section).
                                                      24
    Finally, Specifications 6 to 10 are similar to the five first specifications except that it includes a

different indicator for the health status of individuals. In this second batch of specifications, health is

introduced as the linear health index obtained from the principal component analysis rather than the

relative position in the population by quintile.


    The incentive measure turns out to be strongly significant in all specifications. The effect is

negative, as expected, which means that a larger value of continued work leads to lower probability

of retirement. In brackets, we also report the effect of a one‐standard‐deviation change in the OV as

the coefficient on the OV can be sensitive to the mean and the variance of the OV. The results are

similar to those for the coefficient on OV. In line with expectations, specifications 5 and 10 show a

much bigger effect of the inclusive OV as it now captures the full scope of incentives that are

otherwise partially captured by the age term.

    Regarding health, results are somewhat unexpected. Individuals in the fifth quintile are

significantly less likely to retire (at thresholds of 5 or 10 percent, according to the specification) than

individuals in the first quintile. Only for some specifications and for a 10 percent significance level,

individuals of the third quintile also display similar features. When looking at specifications with the

health index, no significant pattern can be distinguished as a function of the health index. This even

holds true when interacting the incentive measure with the health index as in Table 3.

    Our findings with regards to the influence of health status have clear policy relevance: our

findings show that the link between health and retirement in Belgium is either weak or not

significant. This stands in sharp contrast to the analysis of section 2, indicating the importance of

performing econometric analysis instead of relying on mere correlations.

    While the gender dummy is insignificant, other variables have strong impacts: Age plays a

significant role. Education also has a strong explanatory power, with higher education leading to


                                                       25
significantly lower retirement probabilities. Being married has a positive impact on the likelihood of

retirement, while having an active spouse reduces the retirement probability. Household financial

wealth also leads to a higher probability of retirement – in line with intuition.

    Table 4 is analogous to specification 1 to 4 of Table 2 but instead of the inclusive OV, we use the

percent gain in the utility from delaying retirement till the optimal retirement date. The underlying

idea is simple: a similar level of OV can represent very different realities for different individuals, as

they may have very different starting positions in terms of initial incomes and well‐being. Hence, we

define this percent gain in the utility of delayed retirement as the ratio of OV to the level of utility the

individual would obtain if he were to immediately retire.9

    The estimated coefficients on the incentive variable again turn out highly significant and robust

to the specification choice. The observed effect of the financial incentive variable is much stronger

than in Table 2, indicating that the relation to initial levels of well‐being matter in the Belgian

retirement landscape.10




    9
        In terms of the terminology of the previous section, this corresponds to dividing expression (3) by

expression (2), the latter evaluated upon immediate retirement.


    10
         We have tested alternative specifications including the two terms of this ratio as separate variables and

have not found any stable relation. Results can be obtained from the authors upon request.

     Figures 18 and 19 compare, by age, for men and women separately the predicted retirement

probabilities to the actual probabilities. The predicted probabilities are obtained from the full


                                                                        28
specification with health quintiles and age dummies (specification 4 in Table 2). It will be our baseline

for the simulations hereafter. The predictions follow closely the change in the actual probabilities,

both for men and women. Although not reported here, the predictions made on the basis of

estimations with a linear age are not so good. This indicates that the age dummies are important to

capture some of the nonlinearities that the incentives or the health cannot capture; such as the key

role played by eligibility ages.

     Figures 20 and 21 display the simulated labor market survival process for men and women

separately. These figures are derived using the cross‐sectional actual and predicted retirement

probabilities of the preceding figures to simulate the survival for a hypothetical cohort of 50 year old

to whom we apply these cross sectional retirement probabilities as they age. Implicitly, this assumes

that the currently observed age patterns of retirement remain valid for the hypothetical cohort going

forward to the future.11

           Figure 22 relates the effective retirement behavior to what could be expected from our OV

     measures. It plots the cumulative retirement probabilities and the cumulative percentage of


                                                                      31
     individuals who, according to our incentive measures, have reached the maximum utility. It

     shows that a large majority of wage‐earners in Belgium retire before they have reached the

     utility maximizing age of retirement as predicted by the model.

     5.2.             Simulations
     Using our estimations results of Section 4 we investigate the effect of a change in the Belgian

retirement architecture on retirement behavior. We use specification 4 of Table 2 as our reference.


     The first type of simulation (Simulation 1) considers that all persons in the sample face only one

of the four exit routes rather than a weighted combination of all. Expressed differently, we simulate

the impact on retirement behavior of restricting access – and thus OV’s – to one of the programs:

OAP, CER, UI or DI. We apply the estimated coefficients of the inclusive OV to these path‐specific

OV’s. Implicitly, we thus view our estimates from the previous section as being instrumented

estimates of the true relations – with the population‐wide averages serving as instruments for true

individual eligibility. Figure 23 summarizes the results in terms of retirement hazards by age under

                                                              32
the alternative scenarios. In line with figures 16 and 17, the strongest differences appear between

the OAP and the other pathways with OAP leading to substantially lower hazard rates. Restricting

access to CER, UI or DI would lead to only marginally different retirement patterns. Figure 26

provides another look at the same underlying information. As for Figures 20 and 21, it again

represents the simulated labor market survival for a hypothetical cohort of 50 year olds facing the

same retirement hazards in the future as the cross‐sectional data reveals at present. Table 5 provides

a simple summary statistic based on the same information as Figure 24: the expected remaining

years of work after age 50. It shows that the average expected remaining working life differs by more

than 2 years, or expressed in relative terms by approximately 40 percent between the most generous

pathway (CER) and the least generous pathway (OAP), with UI and DI falling in between.

     A second type of simulations (Simulation 2) focuses exclusively on reforms that affect the people

who are observed to be exiting through the DI pathway. The idea is simple: if we restrict the

availability of DI, it will most directly affect those currently on the beneficiary rolls. Hence, the

second type of simulations explores how this specific subgroup would react to changes in the

                                                                       34
program generosity that it faces. A priori, one could expect this population to be less responsive to

financial incentives if the system actually (partially or completely) achieves its goal of covering people

with a loss of earnings ability. The results are again summarized in Table 5. Overall, DI recipients are

significantly less responsive to changes in their incentives than the overall population. This would

point to significant differences in their characteristics as compared to the population at large. Also,

these simulations show that the differences between DI, CER and UI are sufficiently marginal so as

not to have any noticeable effect in terms of average retirement age.


    In a third set of simulations (Simulation 3), we still focus on those who retired through DI, but

this time with a less categorical policy implementation. In order to mimic the effect of a tightening of

the eligibility criteria, we randomly assign a fraction of them (1/3 or 2/3) to the DI path and the

remainder is excluded from DI. To reflect the communicating vessels idea, we successively explore

the assignment of these people who are refused to DI to the various programs. Allocating them to

CER or UI means that access to these programs is not tightly monitored, hence leading to a shift

between social security programs. Allocating them to OAP can be seen as a residual approach,

whereby these individuals would be kept at bay from the UI and DI programs, de facto depriving

them of current income until the early retirement age under OAP rules.


    Simulations 2 and 3 illustrate that differences between CER, UI and DI are sufficiently small so as

to lead to absolutely marginal effects when shifting people between these programs. There is an

immediate policy relevance of this finding: when limiting access to DI without strictly enforcing

access conditions for UI and CER, we should broadly expect a mere shift from one program to

another – without any positive labor market response. It is only by enforcing the access conditions to

these programs that the reform of the DI system can have an effect.

    Finally we explore a fourth set of simulations (Simulation 4) applying the policy change of

Simulation 1 on the basis of the estimates of specification 5 of Table 2. Essentially, the idea is to see

to which degree the inclusion or exclusion of age in the regression will influence the effect of reforms

to the incentive structure. Given the significantly stronger estimates for the inclusive OV variable

under specification 5 of Table 2 (as compared to specification 4), we unsurprisingly find a significantly

stronger impact of the reform scenario in terms of the average remaining working life. Our results

show that not controlling for age gives much lower work expectancy for the generous exit paths

(CER, UI and DI) and higher work expectancy for the OAP route – leading to an increase of more than

100 percent of remaining work years between the most generous and the least generous route.

Simulation 5 thus provides a way of gauging the maximum effect that one can expect to obtain from

a reform of eligibility of these programs. It shows that the reference simulations can be seen as

conservative estimates of the likely real world effects.




6. Conclusion
    The present paper set out to explore the link between health status, disability programs and

retirement in Belgium. We documented that disability trends in Belgium are largely disconnected

from the employment and labor market participation of older workers aged 50 and more. In Belgium,

it turns out that it is rather the CER and UI programs than DI that shape labor market behavior over

time and across individuals.


    While simple cross tabulations of health and retirement probability tend to indicate a strong

correlation, econometric analysis shows that such a relation does not uphold in a more complete

estimation when controlling for a rich set of other variables. This finding is of quite some policy

relevance, as it means that health is not a key driver of retirement in Belgium.



                                                     36
    The regression analysis also shows that financial incentives as captured by the (inclusive) option

value of retirement play a substantial role in explaining retirement behavior. Simulations based on

these estimates document that by tightening the eligibility conditions for early retirement programs

(CER, UI and mostly DI), one can substantially increase the number of years an individual would stay

active on the labor market. Our simulations also show that any tightening of such eligibility criteria in

a given early retirement program would need to be associated with strict monitoring of access to the

other early exit routes, as else the total effect would be marginal at best.
