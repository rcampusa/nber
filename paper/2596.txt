         External Debt and Macroeconomic Performance in South Korea:

                                   Abstract


     During 1980-1986, South Korea went from being the world's fourth largest

debtor country, in the midst of an economic crisis, to a model of successful

adjustment, with high growth rates and a current account surplus. This paper

summarizes the findings of an in depth analysis of Korea's performance,

focusing on the experience with external debt.

    We argue that the explanations for Korea's recovery are closely linked

to the explanations for Korea's very rapid growth during the l960s and

l970s. The centerpieces have been a comprehensive export focused investment

plan with external borrowing used to supplement domestic savings in

financing the investment and an active, interventionist government policy.

I.   Introduction

     In 1981, South Korea was the world's fourth largest debtor country and in

the midst of an economic crisis. She had accumulated $17.6 billion of debt

within three years, raising her debt stock to $32.1 billion and her debt/GDP

ratio to 49 percent. Output had declined by 4.8 percent in 1980, compared to

average growth rates in excess of 9 percent during 1970—1979. Inflation had

doubled from 14.4 percent in 1918 to 28.7 percent in 1980.

     Korea's adjustment to the 1979-1962 debt crisis has been remarkable. By

1986, she had substantially reduced the debt burden. Inflation had fallen to

just three percent, while the government budget deficit had been cut in half.

Exports grew by 15 percent. fueling a 12.5 percent increase in output, and a

current account surplus nearly 5 percent of GNP. At the same time, real

wages, per capita income and consumption all increased, and the country

maintained historically high levels of fixed capital formation.

     In stark contrast, the 1986 world Development Report (p. 54) describes

the plight of seventeen of the middle income debtor countries as follows:

     "The bulk of the adjustment has been undertaken through lower

     demand, which has meant, in practice, reducing imports and

     investment... .GOP has stagnated since 1980, and per capita incomes

     have declined substantially.   .   . .Vet the main indicators of debt at

     the end of 1985 were close to their previous peaks. Despite their

     adjustment efforts, these countries seem to be as far as they ever

     were from reconciling growth and credit worthiness."

     The purpose of this paper is to summarize the findings of an in depth

analysis of Korea's macroeconomic performance, policy and prospects, with
                                      -2—



primary focus on the experience with external debt.1 The paper begins with an

overview of Korea's experience. Four questions arise from our summary:

          1. What caused Korea's debt crises?

          2. bow was Korea able to achieve rapid, successful recoveries?

          3. What role has external borrowing played in the experience?

     and 4. Are there lessons for other debtor countries?

Answering these questions involves synthesizing a number of interrelated

factors. In ection III, we summarize our conclusions about each of these

pieces individually. Section IV puts the pieces of the puzzle together and

examines the implications, answering questions 1—3. The final sections

discuss the lessons to be learned and the prospects for Korea.


It. Overview of Macroeconomic Experience

     Korea's macroeconomic history can be divided roughly into five periods.

The early period, from 1945 to 1953, was one of continued disruption. First

came the division into North and South Korea at the 38th parallel after World

War II. The South was left with rich agricultural lands and light

manufacturing industries, but almost no heavy industry or power facilities.

Attempts to begin economic recovery were interrupted by the devastation of the

Korean War which is estimated to have killed over one million people and

destroyed over one third of South Korea's physical capital.

     Another development during this period, with lasting implications for

Korean development, was a major land reform. During 1947—1949, farmland

previously owned by Japanese landlords, was either redistributed or sold,

dramatically decreasing the concentration of land ownership. This development
                                      —3—


is perhaps the most important factor in explaining the relatively egalitarian

distribution of income in Korea.

      The second period, (1953-60) was one of slow recovery, financed by

massive foreign aid, primarily from the United States. Foreign aid inflows

averaged nearly US $300 million per annum during 1955—59, reaching 16 percent

of GNP in 1951. Inflation rates jumped to 60 percent immediately following

the War, while output growth remained moderate. Under the complex system of

trade restrictions erected by the Syngmari Rhee dictatorship, exports grew by

only 1.3 percent per year.

      In contrast, the third period, from 1950—73, saw a dramatic economic

turn—around fueled by rapid rates of export growth. Exports grew by 40—50

percent per year during 1960—74 while output grew by 10 percent during

1965—74.

      The economic transition coincided with a change in political regime and

economic policy. Syngman Rhee was forced to resign in 1960 after a student

uprising. The new government, led by Chang Myon, collapsed in May 1961

following a military coup led by General Park Chung Nec, who remained

President of Korea until a second coup in 1979.

      Under General Park, Korea switched from an import—substitution strategy

to an active export-promotion strategy. The first of a series of Five-Year

Plans, initiated in 1962, identified investment and export—led economic growth

as the number one priorities. Other hallmarks of the strategy were extensive

government intervention in domestic and international capital markets, the

development of close links between government and industry, import

liberalization and the more active use of exchange rates to maintain

compet it i veness.

     Foreign aid inflows fell dramatically during the period. During 1960-64,

they averaged $210 million per year, over ten times the average annual

accumulation of external debt. This inflow dropped to $110 million per year

during 1955-69, just one-third of the average annual debt accumulation, and

only $28 million per year during 1970—74, or 0.03 percent of the debt

accumulation. Foreign aid to Korea had essentially ended by 1915.

     Gross fixed investment was raised from 15 percent of GNP in 1965 to 26

percent in 1969 (Table 2). To finance the investment, declining foreign aid

flows were replaced by increased reliance on external borrowing and by

increased domestic savings. Firms (especially exporters) were given strong

incentives to borrow abroad. A system of loan guarantees substantially

reduced the risks and the real cost of borrowing abroad was negative.

External debt jumped to 27 percent of GNP by 1969.

     Difficulties emerged during 1970-12. As growth slowed, domestic savings

dropped, increasing the current account deficit and reducing Korea's debt

service ability. A devaluation to stimulate exports exacerbated repayment

difficulties for externally indebted firms. The government bailed them out.

and continued to pursue its investment strategy, combined with further

depreciation and some monetary and fiscal restraint. Taking advantage of

strong world demand, exports grew by 90 percent in 1973, stimulating a record

16 percent output growth, a spurt in domestic savings and pulling Korea out of

the first period of debt difficulties.

     The fourth period (1973-70) includes a second period of rapid debt

accumulation, economic difficulty and recovery (table 3). It also coincided

with a major shift in econosic strategy -—   a renewed industrialization,

coupled with increased government intervention.

     The "Big-Push" was a massive investment program in heavy and chemical

industries, initiated in 1973 because policy makers feared that Korea's

comparative advantage was shifting away from light industry. The program

coincided with a resurgence in inflation, a slowdown in export growth, a rise

in the incremental capital—output ratio and a deterioration in the

distribution of income. Import restrictions and credit rationing increased.

In addition the exchange rate was fixed (1975-79) and allowed to appreciate in

real terms. Although widely viewed as a policy mistake, some of the

investments (steel and autos) have begun to pay off.

     Economic growth again slowed during 1974-5 in the aftermath of the oil

price rise. Domestic savings again dropped, increasing the borrowing

necessary to finance the investment program. Korea elected to "borrow her

way" through the crisis so as to fulfill planned investment and to relax

monetary and fiscal policies. As world demand recovered during 1976-78, high

growth rates resumed raising domestic savings and improving the debt

position.

     In 1979, Korea again underwent a shift in economic strategy. Motivated

by concern over rising inflation rates and economic distortions from the Big

Push, a new stabilization plan included monetary and fiscal restraint plus the

gradual reduction of price controls, import restrictions and financial market

interventions.

     However, 1979-82 were years of crisis for Korea. In 1979, the

assassination of President Park together with a disastrous agricultural

harvest and the second oil shock all contributed to a severe economic and

political crisis in 1960. The military assumed effective control of the

country in May 1980 under General Chun Doo Hwan. He was elected President in

1981 and his term is due to end in 1988.

     The poor 1979-92 performance is documented in Table 4. Output stagnated,

actually declining during 1980. As domestic savings plunged, the current

account deficit mushroomed, financed by massive external borrowing. Korea

accumulated over $22 billion of debt during 1979-82, raising the stock to 53.5

percent of GNP.

     During 1980-81, the exchange rate was devalued, however the stance of

monetary and fiscal policies alternated. Korea continued to borrow heavily to

maintain investment. By 1982, growth was still low by Korean standards (5.4

percent) and exports stagnated, but inflation and the current account deficits

had fallen significantly. The government initiated a more expansionary policy

to stimulate growth.

     As world demand recovered and the terms of trade improved during 1963-84,

Korea again underwent a remarkable economic recovery. Growth rates spurted.

Savings rose reducing the current account deficit. Authorities responded to

the 1985 slowdown in export growth as world demand stagnated with 6 percent

real depreciation in 1985, a further 15 percent real depreciation in 1986.

     By 1986, the economy was booming, inflationary difficulties had been

resolved and there was a substantial trade surplus. In contrast to many of

the other large Third-world debtor countries currently negotiating

rescheduling arrangements with their creditors, Korea not only met all debt

service obligations, but was In the position to actually reduce her debt stock

by $2.25 billion.

III. The Pieces

A.   External Debt

     Foreign capital inflows have played a critical role throughout Korea's

recent development. The preceding discussion has already emphasized the

importance of foreign aid in the decade following the Korean War and

documented the rapid accumulation of external debt, concentrated during

1965—69, 1974—75 and 1979—82.

     Rapid growth of output and especially exports has meant that Korea's

actual debt burden grew much more slowly than the nominal debt stock.

Although the debt (denominated in U.S. dollars) grew at an average rate of

34.6 percent in the eighteen years from 1964 to 1982, the debt to GNP ratio

reached 53.5 percent, while the ratio of debt service to exports reached only

20.6 percent. Korea ranked only eleventh in terms of her Debt/GOP ratio and

fifteenth in terms of her debt service ratio.2 Korea's growth performance is

a key piece of the puzzle surrounding the quick adjustment to the 1979-B? debt

crisis.

     External borrowing in Korea was used primarily to finance current account

deficits. In particular, there has been little capital flight. This points

to an analysis of domestic savings and investment as the key to explaining

debt accumulation, because the current account deficit, or foreign savings,

finances the portion of investment not financed domestically.

     It is also notable that Korean debt has been carefully monitored by the

Ministry of Finance since the borrowing began in the early 1960$.

Applications for loans must be approved, and the government has actively used

the allocation of foreign (and dc,mestic) credit as part of an Industrial

policy, providing growth incentives for particular industries and firms.
                                      —13—


     Borrowing is a central component of Economic Planning in Korea. In many

periods, the amount of borrowing required to finance desired investment was

forecast quite accurately, however unexpected external and internal

developments during 1974-5 and 1979-81 meant that the forecast turned out to

be a sizable underestimate. In any case, the Korean government has maintained

excellent debt statistics thro2hout the period. It was not faced with the

additional difficulty of faulty or incomplete information in responding to the

1979-SO crisis.


B.   Economic Growth

     Korea's phenomenal growth rates since 1965 have been well documented. Of

particular significance is that Korea was able to avoid the dramatic slow-down

which most of the other fast growers experienced after the first oil price

shock. A detailed analysis of the economic sources of Korea's growth

identifies fixed capital accumulation as the central factor.

     During the 1960s. Korean growth is attributable to a combination of

increased factor accumulation, improved resource allocation, economies of

scale and technological improvement. Fixed capital accumulation accounts for

1.1 percent average annual growth during 1963-72. In contrast, capital

accumulation accounts for a growth rate of 2.6 percent during 1973-82. Korea

offset reductions in factor productivity after the first oil shock with a

substantial increase in investment.

     Increased labor has also played a key role. The average work week

increased throughout the period to 54.8 hours, placing Korea at the top of the

International Labor Organization's list. Furthermore, the work force is

well-educated and disciplined.
                                       —14—


     It is interesting to point out that the sources of Korean growth are

quite different from the sources of Japanese growth during her 1953-71 rapid

acceleration period. Factor accumulation explains only 45 percent of the

Japanese growth rates as compared to 60 percent of the Korean growth rates.

     A decomposition from the demand side identifies exports as the "engine of

growth" during 1975-85, as well as during the earlier period. It is important

to stress the role of exports because, as mentioned above, exports generate

the foreign exchange essential to repaying external debt.

     Investment demand has also been consistently strong. However, since

import requirements for investment ranged from .36 to .48, investment has been

only a moderate source of demand for domestic output. Finally, we point out

that government consumption has played at best a minor role.

     The data also document that labor productivity has consistently grown

faster in the manufacturing than in the nonmanufacturing sector. The domestic

price of manufactured goods -- a proxy for the "tradeable goods sector" --rose

relative to the price of other —-   nontraded   -- goods throughout the 1960-85

period. However this real appreciation has represented technical progress and

not a deterioration in external competitiveness or a reallocation of resources

away from the production of tradeables.

     One of the most enviable aspects of Korea's recent recovery has been

trade balance improvement combined with growth. In contrast, most debtor

countries have achieved trade surpluses through recession induced reductions

in imports. In fact, the very low income elasticities of Korean imports

during 1961-83 are unusual by Korean standards. They are explained in large

part by disastrous harvests during 1978—80, necessitatIng a surge In food
                                       —15—


imports, followed by a very favorable harvest during 1981-2 which both raised

domestic output and reduced imports. Exports did not begin to recover (in

value terms) until 1983, and this turnaround is explained by a combination of

increased world demand, a terms of trade improvement, the lagged impact of a

real depreciation and numerous investments targeted to export industries

gradually coming on stream.


C.   Investment and the Five-Year Plans

     Korea instituted a series of Five-Year Economic Plans, beginning in 1962,

The first step in the formulation of these plans has been to determine the

investment required to achieve a desired rate of growth. Thus, investment for

growth has been the number one priority, while external borrowing emerges at

the other end as the residual --   the gap between investment and available

domestic financing. In the mid 1950s, it was an important supplement to

declining foreign aid. More recently it has been used to substitute for

shortfalls in domestic (especially household) savings.

     The Plans identify particular sectors of the economy for growth with

overwhelming focus on exports. Furthermore, the government has actively

controlled the allocation of credit, thereby playing a key role in determining

the industrial concentration of capital accumulation,

     Even the best plan will have little impact if it can not be implemented.

A large part of the success of the Five Year Plans is attributable to Korea's

centralized decision making combined with a very close link between government

and business. Authorities maintain current data, including information about

individual firms performance. Decisions are made quickly, and policies are
                                     —16—


pragmatic, often involving direct intervention at the firm level. One

implication of this approach has been that, by selecting previously successful

firms to undertake new projects, the government has helped to create a number

of large conglomerates (chaebol) and a highly concentrated industrial

structure.


0.   Savings Behavior

     Korea's savings rate has risen from 14 percent in 1965 to over 34 percent

in 1985, however, the remarkable secular increase has been interrupted

periodically. These plunges have accelerated foreign borrowing so as to

finance desired rates of investment, leading to a "crisis".

     Two aspects are especially notable. First, savings declines are

primarily attributable to drops in household savings, and not to deteriorating

government budgets. Second, current account improvement during the adjustment

has not been brought about by cuts in investment to close the gap. Instead.

the key has been the recovery of household savings, supplemented by increased

government savings.

     Disaggregation shows that both the secular rise and the plunges occurred

in the household sector. The performance is explained quite well by a model

in which the marginal propensity to consume is higher out of permanent income

than out of transitory income. Thus, Korea's strong growth, leading to upward

revisions in permanent income, accounts for the secular rise in savings, while

growth slowdowns account for the 1970-11, 1975 and 1980—el plunges, as

households reduced savings to smooth consumption. Although interest rates are

estimated to affect savings positively, we do not find   the estimates to be

significantly different from zero.
                                     —17—


E.   Exchange Rate Policy

     Overall, Korea has followed a consistent, credible exchange rate policy,

maintaining a competitive, sometimes undervalued, real exchange rate with low

variance. In adjusting to external imbalance during both 1974 and 1980, the

policy packages included a substantial (20 percent) one shot devaluation in

addition to an exchange rate regime change.

     The nominal exchange rate was fixed to the U.S. dollar during 1975—79,

during which time authorities did permit a 14 percent real appreciation.

Since 1980, the exchange rate has been continually adjusted vis a vis a basket

of currencies. The real exchange rate depreciated by 6 percent    ;ring

1980-82, and by a further 14 percent during 1982—86. There has been gradual

appreciation during 1987.


F.   Wages and Competitiveness

     Even more striking than Korea's success in maintaining external

competitiveness throughout most of the 1955-86 period is the fact that real

depreciations were often (e.g., 1973, 1983-86) accompanied by real wage

increases. Again, rapidly increasing labor productivity is the key to the

puzzle, providing a wedge which can be split between increased competitiveness

and increased real income.

     During 1965—72. real wages grew at an average annual rate of 9.0 percent

while productivity (using the value added measure) grew by 14.4 percent.

However, during 1973—79, real wages grew by 12.5 percent, outpacing the 11.1

percent productivity growth. Shortages in skilled labor associated with the

Big—Push towards heavy industrialization, led to rapid nominal wage gains.
                                     —16-


Unit labor costs, measured in dollars, grew 2.3 times as quickly for Korea

than for Taiwan, a major competitor in third markets.

     It is important to point out that real wages declined both at the outset

of Korea's export led growth and as Korea reestablished her competitive

position after the 1976—79 real appreciation. During 1960-64, the average

annual real wage decline was 1.96 percent, despite 7.46 percent productivity

growth. Real wages fell at the beginning of the adjustment (1981—2) with all

of the productivity gains going to reduce unit labor costs. This, plus

exchange rate depreciations dramatically improved Korea's competitive position

since 1982.

     We note a few other characteristics of Korea's labor market, Worker

organizations are extremely weak. There is evidence that they have increased

job security, but not that they have influenced wages. Bonuses average 15

percent of employee compensation, which enhances flexibility. Finally, the

fact that wages are not indexed to past inflation rates has meant that

inflation shows little inertia.


0.   Trade Policy

     Korea's switch from a policy of import substitution to one of export

promotion during 1960-64 is well known. However, despite the liberalization

of many import restrictions, trade policies continued to play a central role.

In particular, tax preferences and interest rate subsidies became important

mechanisms to subsidize domestic industries after 1965. Through the mid

1970s, export incentives were maintained with little variability. Subsidies

were used to compensate exporters during periods of real appreciation.
                                      —19—


      Import restrictions increased during the Big Push and have been gradually

relaxed since 1980. Quantitative restrictions, domestic content and other

regulations have remained critical, so that tariff rates substantially

underestimate the degree of protection. For example, the share of

manufactured items subject to import restriction jumped from 34 percent in

1968 to 61 percent in 1978. These restrictions have been important in

developing "infant industries" such as automobiles and steel allowing Korea to

become competitive enough to begin exporting these products. The restrictions

help to explain why almost all Korean imports are raw materials, intermediate

products or capital goods, with consumer products amounting to less than 5

percent of Korean imports.

     Korea also stands out in not maintaining a structure of protection which

penalizes agriculture. The political economy of that outcome is clearly

linked to the relatively equitable income distribution due primarily to the

land reform.


H.   Industrial   Policy

     Korea has been extremely successful in selecting "growth industries", and

in managing the industrial transition for these infant industries. A large

Dart of the success lies in the development of credible, comprehensive

strategies in which investment projects to promote exports formed the

cornerstones of Five Year Macroeconomic Plans.

     Korean businesses targeted for expansion have not been concerned about

oolicy inconsistencies or government policy reversals. They have been given

referential access to domestic credit, to external funds and to imported
                                     —20—


materials. The government has maintained its commitment, bailing out firms

threatened with bankruptcy during downturns or financial panics. It has also

created a few conglomerates which are enormous, even by world standards.

     In retrospect, some of the policies were mistakes -—   particularly   during

the 1974—79 Big Push. For example, government intervention led to substantial

overcapacity in petrochemicals. However, the entire policy should, by no

means, be written off as a mistake. Many of the investments in heavy

industries are beginning to pay off and exports of these products are growing

rapidly.


I.   Fiscal Policy

     Fiscal policy in Korea is perhaps most notable for the role it did not

play in accumulation of external debt. Government savings has been positive

in every year since 1962.

     The budget deficit (which includes public investment as an outlay) has

been kept under control, ranging from 1 percent to 4 percent of output. A tax

reform arid switch to value added taxation in the alas did succeed in raising

revenues from 15 percent to 18 percent of GNP. Large deficits in 1975 and

1980—81 are attributable primarily to increased expenditures in the Grain

Management Fund. Social expenditures, such as education and housing, have

been low historically, but rising over time. Since 1980, they have amounted

to 30 percent. Indicators of fiscal stance show that fiscal policy has been

counter cyclical, used by the government in attempts to "fine—tune" economic

performance.

     Overall, fiscal deficits have not been financed through rapid money

creation. The deficits themselves have been relatively small. Also
                                      —21—


authorities have alternated between domestic and foreign credit. For example.

after jumps in the banking sector credit to the public sector during mo-si,

net credit was reduced during 1982-84.


.3.   Monetary Policy

      The banking system,.including the Bank of Korea, has been monitored by

the Ministry of Finance since 1962 so that macroeconomic policy making is

extremely centralized, We highlight four aspects. The first is the key role

for credit allocation in the industrial strategy, as discussed above. A

second objective of monetary policies (especially interest rate adjustments)

has been to increase household savings. As discussed above, it is very

difficult to quantify how large a part this tactic has played in raising

savings rates.

      Third, Korean financial markets have three levels. The official banking

sector is highly controlled, although therehas been some liberalization since

1982. including the privatization of five commercial banks. There is also a

partially controlled nonbank financial sector, and an unorganized curb market.

The latter two have added flexibility to Korea's financial system, providing

credit (often at high interest rates) to those firms which were not given

access to scarce bank credit. Since a 1982 financial scandal, however, the

curb market has shrunk considerably. Nonbank financial institutions have been

growing rapidly, accounting for one half of all deposits of banks plus

nonbanks in 1985, as compared to one fifth in 1978.

      Korea's financial system has been anything but a unified system in which

credit is allocated by market forces. While it is certain that the outcomes
                                     —22—


under such a system would have been different, it is very difficult to assess

whether they would have been "better" of "worse". To us. the most sensible

conclusion is that the Korean government successfully used an active and

pervasive policy of intervening in financial markets to promote its growth

objectives.

     Finally, there has been some movement towards financial liberalization of

the banking sector. But unlike the trade liberalization, the changes so far

seem to have been greater on paper than in practice. Credit allocation

remains a cornerstone of Korean industrial policy.


K.   Two Themes

     Two unifying themes emerge from these ten pieces in the puzzle of Korea's

successful performance. The first is the importance of rapid growth rates

(particularly of exports), rising labor productivity and expanding human and

physical capital resources. These factors gave Korea the leeway to borrow

heavily while keeping the burden of debt repayments manageable and to avoid

squeezing real incomes when increasing international competitiveness. The

rapid productivity growth in export and import competing goods production has

eased the problem of mobilizing and transferring domestic resources so as to

pay external debts.

     The second theme is the usage of active, interventionist government

policy which is credible, consistent and coherent. These policies placed

investment to promote exports as the number one priority and led the economy

through a fundamental industrial restructuring.
                                      —23—



IV. Implicat ions: A Synthesis

     in this section, we synthesize the pieces discussed above in order to

answer the questions posed at the outset, The first question, important in

distinguishing Korea's experience from that of many other debtor countries, is

why the debt crises occurred.

     Since 1165. Korea has been vulnerable to external and internal shocks

because of its determined investment policy which left no buffers between

desired investment and domestic savings. External borrowing was treated as

the buffer, or residual.

     The country has been hit by a number of external shocks, in particular

oil price and interest rate changes, but the role of internal "shocks" must

not be underestimated. During 1974-5, terms of trade deterioration accounts

for only a part of the current account deficit. Like 1970—72, this period

seems better described as a slowdown than as an economic crisis. External

factors were more important during 1979-80. However, the cris.is would have

been much less severe if these had not been exacerbated by the agricultural

disaster, political turmoil and previous policy mistakes.

    How was Korea able to recover so quickly from slowdowns and crises? We

believe the central factor has been successfully distinguishing between

permanent and temporary shocks, and responding appropriately. The devastation

of the Korean War was clearly a permanent shock. In designing and carrying

through the Impressive structural readjustment of the 1960s, policy, makers

learned hold to put together an adjustment package that worked.

    They chose to embark on another structural readjustment during 1973-79

because of pessimistic forecasts for medium term growth on the 1950s
                                      —24—



industrialization path.   In contrast, Korea borrowed to smooth adjustment to

the 1973 jump in oil prices because the shock was judged unlikely to alter the

medium to long run prospects for heavy industry. However, policy makers have

not been rigid. A third shift in focus came as doubts emerged about the

efficacy of further heavy industrialization, and the economy found itself

saddled with the massive debts accumulated during 1979-80.

     The point is closely linked to the role of external debt in Korea's

adjustment. The debt has been used to supplement domestic savings in

financing investment, enabling faster rates of growth. The debt has also been

used to smooth over temporary shocks, without jeopardizing the on-going

structural adjustment plan. However, Korea has been admirable in not using

external borrowing to avoid undertaking a structural readjustment.

     What is the adjustment package that has worked for Korea? The

centerpiece has been a comprehensive export focused investment plan,

operationalized through competitive exchange rates, credit rationing, tax and

other incentives for targeted industries, trade policies and allocation of

external credit. Initial declines in real wages have helped to boost

competitiveness, but once the investment-growth cycle has been put on track,

productivity gains have been split between raising wages and enhancing

competitiveness.

     Traditional macroeconomic "stabilization" tools -— monetary expansion and

fiscal deficits —— have been important in the passive sense that they have

been kept in line. Fiscal deficits have remained small and authorities have

been careful to limit domestic credit expansion to the public sector.

However, these policies played at best a supporting role in pulling Korea out
                                        —25—


of slowdowns and crises. Both were quite variable with many reversals
                                                                          during

1980-61. By the time a definite monetary/fiscal expansion emerged in 1982,

Korea was already well on the way to recovery.

     Good fortune has also helped Korea to recover. In particular, the first

oil shock gave Korea an unexpected boost during 1976-76 through revenues from

construction in the middle east. The recent recovery was fueled by terms of

trade improvements beginning in 1981.


V.   Lessons

     We begin by pointing out two lessons which, most certainly, can not be

learned from the Korean experience. The first is how to design "short-run

macro-economic stabilization" packages. There are no "quick-fixes" in Korea's

recent history.

     The second is the benefits of liberalized trade regimes and (domestic and

international) capital markets. Active intervention has been a mainstay of

Korean policy. However, there are numerous examples of extensive intervention

in other countries which have coincided with poor economic performance. Korea

does contain lessons about which types of intervention are likely to be

effective,

     We draw four lessons from Korea's experience. A first lesson is the

value of credibility, consistency and coherence in economic policy. As in

Korea, this may well necessitate coordinated trade, industrial and credit

policies in order to promote infant industries. It certainly includes

maintaining a competitive .real exchange rate together with a sustainable

fiscal policy, and •oderate monetary gros'ith.

     A second lesson is the value of long term structural adjustment policy

with investment in exports as the top priority. When things have gone well in

Korea, high rates of investment have stimulated growth, raising both domestic

savings and export earnings and enabling Korea to finance the external debts.

When difficulties emerged, Korea consistently avoided cutting investment so

that the economy was poised to take resume growth when external and/or

internal conditions improved.

     Of course1 the difficulty with such an investment program is that it must

be financed, and extensive borrowing can lead to repayment difficulties. The

Korean experience highlights the value of external borrowing in enabling an

investment policy to be carried through, as distinguished from external

borrowing used to avoid structural adjustment.

     Finally, Korea's ability to recover from downturns emphasizes the value

of monitoring economic performance and maintaining accurate statistics for key

variables.


VI. ProsDects

     The prospects for rapid growth to continue over the short to medium tern

are excellent. Our view is based both on Korea's recent good fortune

(especially the decline in oil prices and interest rates and the appreciation

of the Japanese yen) and on Korea's very competitive position as a result of

1985-6 real depreciations and the heavy investments over the past decade which

are beginning to pay off.

     We look at two of the many policy issues facing the government. First,

some gradual real appreciation is unlikely to disrupt growth prospects, and

may well be important to mitigate protectionism in the U.S.

     Second. many have expressed surprise that Korea has decided to reduce the

external debt. There remain many high return investments. There are also

arguments for borrowing so as to take advantage of current favorable external

conditions through investment and stockpiles. On the other hand, Korea does

have a substantial external debt and reducing it will reduce the potential for

future debt crises. Furthermore, careful forward looking decision making has

been an asset in the past. Caution today may well pay off handsomely as

external conditions become less favorable down the road.

     In addition to important social and political issues, there are two

difficulties facing the country. Continued access to especially U.S. markets

is critical to continuation of Korea's export led growth. Current efforts to

identify new markets for Korean products and to reduce dependence on the U.S.

are timely given the uncertainties about U.S. trade policy.

     Finally, shifts in Korea's industrial mix have created a new domestic

policy problem -— how to respond to the difficulties of declining industries.

The options, involving distribution and efficient resource allocation, are

important and controversial. Thus, incorporating declining industries into an

industrial policy which has successfully targeted growing industries poses a

fundamental challenge to Korean econociic planning. Hopefully, Korea's

response will result in new lessons.
