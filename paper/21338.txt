                                             ABSTRACT

From the streets of Hong Kong to Ferguson, Missouri, civil disobedience has again become newsworthy.
What explains the prevalence and extremity of acts of civil disobedience?This paper presents a model
in which protest planners choose the nature of the disturbance hoping to influence voters (or other
decision-makers in less democratic regimes) both through the size of the unrest and by generating
a response. The model suggests that protesters will either choose a mild “epsilon” protest, such as
a peaceful march, which serves mainly to signal the size of the disgruntled population, or a “sweet
spot” protest, which is painful enough to generate a response but not painful enough so that an aggressive
response is universally applauded. Since non-epsilon protests serve primarily to signal the leaders’
type, they will occur either when protesters have private information about the leader’s type or when
the distribution of voters’ preferences are convex in a way that leads the revelation of uncertainty to
increase the probability of regime change. The requirements needed for rational civil disobedience
seem not to hold in many world settings, and so we explore ways in which bounded rationality by
protesters, voters, and incumbent leaders can also explain civil disobedience.

   I.      Introduction


    In both democratic and undemocratic nations, political protestors sometimes engage in civil
disobedience. They break the law in order to register their protest, often with the hope of
increasing the likelihood of significant reform. A particularly interesting feature of civil
disobedience is a distinctive motivation, which is to produce an aggressive response from the
relevant authority, which will in turn lead to a heightened sense, on the part of the public as a
whole, that the authority needs to be reformed or replaced. On this view, the goal of civil
disobedience is both to deepen and to widen public concern through the adverse reaction that it
provokes, and through that route to produce large-scale reform.

    In general, achievement of that goal would seem to be most unlikely. Those who break the
law usually fail to win public support. On the contrary, they discredit themselves; they produce
widespread opprobrium. When they are met with force, the public approves. But some cases,
law-breakers succeed. Protestors rarely invoke Lenin’s idea of “heightening the contradictions,”
but in some cases, they seem to do exactly that, and ultimately have significant effects. Why and
when? Our purpose in this Article is to answer that question.

         As we understand it here, civil disobedience is about signaling, and in two different ways.
First, the disobedients (as we shall call those protestors who break the law) signal that they are
displeased with the governing authority, and in particular that the authority is responsible for
serious mistakes and injustice. That signal might have a major influence on other citizens, which
is to alter their own judgments (by informing them of what other people think) and also to reduce
pluralistic ignorance (people’s ignorance about the beliefs and preferences of other people). As
in the conventional models of protest (Granovetter 1978; Lohmann 1994, DiPasquale and
Glaeser, 1998), so too for the disobedients: They might create a kind of cascade in which large
numbers of people ultimately “tip” (cf. Kuran, 1998; Murray, 2015). At the same time (and we
see this as particularly important), disobedience can make injustice salient when it might
otherwise be seen as some kind of (inevitable) background fact. In these respects, disobedience
should be seen as a strong form of ordinary protest activity, in which the “volume” of the action
is increased (and potentially greatly so) because it is inconsistent with law. If citizens see that
some or many others are willing to risk sanctions, they will have an enhanced sense of the
intensity of current disapproval of the status quo, thus altering informational signals (about its
true character) and also reputational incentives (by revealing the views of fellow citizens). By
itself, this signal might have a sufficient effect on the authority, who might respond by moving in
the desired direction.

        Second (and this is a central part of our focus here), the disobedients sometimes seek to
provoke the authority to signal its own bad character or type. Of course it is usually best, from
the standpoint of the disobedients, if the authority changes the status quo in the desired way (in
the extreme case, by relinquishing authority). But if that is not possible, the disobedients might

                                                 2
want instead to provoke, from the authority, the revealing signal.1 To achieve that end, the
disobedience must be damaging enough to elicit a forceful response, providing that signal, but if
it is too damaging, there is a grave risk, which is that forceful responses will seem fully
justifiable and therefore welcome. “Damage” can be understood both in terms of the particular
law that is being violated and the number of people who are violating it. If, for example, the
disobedient commit murder, rape, or assault, citizens will ordinarily welcome a forceful
response2; if the disobedient walk the streets at a time when they are not permitted to do so, the
use of force will be less likely to be well-received. And if 500 people walk the streets, force will
be far less welcome than if the streets are blanketed by 100,000 (which may bring productive
activity to a halt).

         The disobedients must therefore find some kind of “sweet spot” in which their action is
sufficient to provoke either widespread sympathy or a forceful response while ensuring that that
response contains the desired signal about the character of the authority. The authority must find
sweet spots of its own, ignoring certain disobedience (on the ground that a reaction would fuel
the relevant movement) but responding sufficiently to other disobedience (on the ground that
passivity would allow dangerous growth). As we shall see, these conclusions have strong
implications not only for the responses of rational authorities but also for enforcement activity
and prosecutorial discretion in the face of civil disobedience (see Dworkin, 1967). Prosecutions
can themselves create a desirable signal for the disobedient, and prosecutors should be aware of
that risk in thinking about the best way to deter conduct.

         Much of our analysis will elaborate on the two signals associated with civil disobedience,
with the assumption that the relevant actors are rational. In many cases, the assumption tracks
reality, or at least it is close enough. The disobedients, or their leaders, can be highly strategic
actors; Martin Luther King, Jr. is a prime example. In other cases, however, psychological or
behavioral factors much complicate the analysis. For example, the disobedients might well be
outraged, and their outrage might compromise their strategic goals; expression of outrage might
seem an end in itself, even if it is unlikely to produce good consequences. (In fact, an apparently
noninstrument motivation for engaging in civil disobedience might be helpful in instrumental
terms.) Alternatively, the disobedients might suffer from unrealistic optimism, which might lead
them to engage in civil disobedience even though the prospects for change are vanishingly small.
Group influences can aggravate these effects. For its part, the authority might also be subject to
outrage and from unrealistic optimism (a particular problem for those confronted with civil
disobedience), leading to responses that play directly into the hands of the disobedients.

       Bounded rationality on the part of voters and leaders can also encourage civil
disobedience. If voters, for example, ignore problems unless they are made salient, then civil

harsh repression as in Glaeser (1995).

                                                 3
disobedience can serve to generate salience. If leaders are prone to excessively heavy responses
which make protests more effective with voters, then this will also increase the appeal of civil
disobedience to those who want a change in regime.

    A great deal of empirical work would be necessary to evaluate these speculations, but we
offer some brief remarks on the possibilities. We also bring the analysis to bear on a pervasive
dilemma faced by criminal prosecutors: In the face of civil disobedience, is it best to initiate
proceedings, or instead to exercise prosecutorial discretion so as to leave the underlying activity
unpunished?



   II.     Civil Disobedience: A Historic Taxonomy


There have been law-breakers as long as there have been laws, but if all law-breaking is defined
as civil disobedience then the term has no value. Our focus will be on law-breaking that is
motivated by larger political purposes, or designed to effect political change. Table 1 attempts
to organize the types of civil disobedience.

   A. Non-Instrumental Disobedience

Some of history’s most famous examples of civil disobedience were fundamentally non-
instrumental. Antigone’s decision to disobey the law of King Creon and bury her brother is
surely civil disobedience, but it is motivated by conscience alone. Since Sophocles ascribes her
decision to a desire to follow her conscience rather than the King, there is no challenge in
understanding her actions.

Similarly, Thoreau’s famous “Civil Disobedience” urges disobedience not because he has any
faith that his actions will have an impact, but because he believes that it is immoral to support a
government that allows slavery and wages war in Mexico. In a sense, Thoreau seems to believe
that cooperating with the government would pollute his soul. He prefers prison time to such
pollution.

While there may be interesting legal questions about such behavior – what is the appropriate
punishment, if any? (Dworkin, 1967) -- modelling it would merely mean assuming that
individuals have such a strong aversion to an action, for moral reasons, that they are willing to
pay a large penalty to avoid taking the action. But we acknowledge that “taking a stand” can and
often does often help motivate civil disobedience even when it is most unlikely to produce
reform.

   B. Effective Power



                                                 4
We focus instead on those forms of civil disobedience that are intended to change political
outcomes. (We cannot rule out the possibility that Antigone or Thoreau also hoped that their
actions would have larger consequences.) The variety of such civil disobedience is enormous,
ranging from disobedience in recent years in Ferguson, Missouri and Baltimore to an Indian
boycott on British goods and services to the 14th Century Peasant’s Revolt. One method of
categorizing civil disobedience is based on the effective power of the group.

1. Revolution. If the group is mighty enough to produce a real challenge to the military power of
the state, then any uprising offers at least the threat of out-and-out revolution. In some cases,
the disobedience begins directly as a rebellion, such as the Peasant’s Revolt, where Wat Tyler
led a mass of ordinary Englishman to the capital, attacking prisons and legal structures. In other
cases, an uprising begins peacefully, but as the crowd expands, violent confrontation ensues
either accidentally or at the direction of the uprising’s leaders.

The February Revolution in St. Petersburg turned from peaceful disobedience to violent conflict
in an apparently haphazard, unplanned function. Its ultimate success hinged on the mutiny of
the Tsar’s soldiers. The French Revolution begins with the relatively peaceful actions of the
Estates General, but edged towards violent conflict with the formation of the National Assembly
and the defection of formerly royal soldiers to the National Guard. The storming of the Bastille
was the planned toppling of royal authority in central Paris.

Both events remind us that the success of a popular uprising often hinges more on a psychology
than on real or apparent military might. The central question in many uprisings is whether
soldiers are willing to obey orders and fire on unarmed disobedients. The unwillingness of
Egyptian soldiers to fire on the crowds in Tahrir Square marked the obvious end of the Mubarak
regime.

2. Ensuring bargaining. A second form of instrumental civil disobedience involves causing non-
violent pain to political leaders in the hopes of bringing them to the bargaining table. In these
cases, the disobedients are either too weak to effectively rebel or choose, at least temporarily, to
avoid the downsides of violent conflict. Colonialists used boycotts of British goods after the
stamp tax of 1765, which may have helped induce the repeal of that act. Boycotts were also used
to disobey the Townsend Acts of 1767. Gandhi employed a similar tactic in 1921, with non-
cooperation and the Swadeshi policy, which represented a boycott of British goods. In 1931, the
Viceroy Lord Irwin agreed to a series of Gandhi’s demand in exchange for an end to the non-
cooperation.

General strikes, aimed at governments more than companies, also fit within this middle category
of civil disobedience. The British General Strike of 1926 aimed more at getting support for
coal miners from Stanley Baldwin’s government than it did at moving the mine owners
themselves. The Austrian General Strike of 1950 may have been intended to bring
Communists to power.

                                                 5
Civil disobedience as a bargaining tool seems, to us at least, to be so similar to a labor strike that
there is little need for new theory. The economic literature on labor unions as strikes, including
Ashenfelter and Johnson (1969), Farber (1978), Jun (1989) and Fernandez and Glazer (1991), is
copious and filled with insight. The models from the strike and bargaining literature can be
readily used to understand the economics of civil disobedience as a bargaining tactic.

3. Provoking authority and shifting public opinion. We focus instead on civil disobedience by
groups that are too weak to effectively generate either a revolution or to cause significant direct
harm to the political leadership over a sustained period. Our principal concern is civil
disobedience that provokes a forceful (hostile) response from authority, but disobedience can
also produce reform in the absence of that response, and what we say touches on that
phenomenon as well. In some cases, disobedients may hope that the sheer size of their protest
will sway public opinion.

The civil disobedience that occurred in October 2014 after the killing of Michael Brown in
Ferguson, Missouri, certainly posed no direct military threat to government of either the U.S. or
Missouri. Neither the state nor the city governments were hampered materially by the
disobedience itself, which involved largely nighttime conflicts. Moreover, it was not obvious
that the disobedient had leaders who could effectively bargain or commit to perpetuate the
disobedience until demands were met. Nonetheless, the disobedient said that they were hoping
to change outcomes in the short run (indict the policemen) and in the long run (change police
behavior towards African-Americans). They certainly did not say that they were just expressing
themselves.

A similar example followed the arrested on April 12, 2015 of Freddie Gray, who died a week
later in police custody at the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center as a result a severed
spinal cord.3 For nearly two weeks following Gray’s arrest and injury, the Baltimore Police
department maintained that the police involved in his arrest had not used excessive force.4
Peaceful protests against the lack of transparency and accountability around Gray’s arrest began
prior to Gray’s death, but escalated in size and disruption following his death and the April 24th
acknowledgement by the Baltimore Police Commissioner that Gray had not been given
necessary medical attention and had not been wearing a seatbelt while being transported to the
police station.5

The signal worked: On May 1st, four days after the worst of the rioting, the short-term goals of
the protestors were met. The state’s attorney for Baltimore, Marilyn Mosby, announced that
charges ranging from reckless endangerment to second degree murder would be brought against

all six officers involved in Gray’s arrest.6 In outlining the charges, Mosby described the events
surrounding Gray’s arrest and the officers’ actions that resulted in their criminal liability for
Gray’s death, providing the transparency and accountability sought by protestors.

Though the destruction and violence of the rioters resulted in unsympathetic media coverage, the
police response to the disobedience revealed certain elements of the Baltimore law enforcement
and criminal justice system that protestors sought to expose in pursuit of their long-term
objectives. The widespread arrests were criticized as failing to distinguish between peaceful
protestors and destructive rioters, particularly as peaceful demonstrators were arrested days after
the initial violence for violating the curfew that remained in place.7 Human rights organizations
criticized the exorbitant bail set for arrested protestors as well as the governor’s order allowing
those arrested during the protests to be held longer than 24 hours without charges or bail.8 By
April 29, roughly half of those arrested during the violence of April 27th were released without
bail or charges amid criticism that they had been illegally detained.9

Such forms of civil disobedience, like non-violent disobedience in many democracies, seems
aimed at producing political reform by changing public opinion more broadly, which may
change policy either by voting a leader out of office or by prodding that leader to change course,
perhaps in fear of being ousted. In response to the disobedience, Governor Nixon did switch
policing duties for Ferguson from the St. Louis County Police to Missouri State Highway Patrol,
which can be seen as something of a victory, albeit a modest one, for the disobedient.

The attempt to shape public opinion is significant even in larger forms of civil disobedience.
Gandhi’s 1930 Salt March was far more politically powerful as a symbol of the Indian desire for
self-rule than as a reduction in the revenues of British salt monopoly. As Gandhi himself wrote
“Satyagraha,” or nonviolent resistance “is a process of education public opinion such that it
covers all the elements of society and in the end makes itself irresistible.”

Most disobedience marches are meant to alter public opinion, such as the 1963 Great March on
Washington. There was a debate during the Great March about how much to focus on
inconveniencing political leaders (by shutting down Washington) and how much to focus on just
demonstrating the enormous scope of unrest. The mere threat of a march on Washington in
1941 had prodded President Roosevelt into desegregating the war industries. The 1894 march by

Coxey’s Army and the 1932 Bonus March were notably less successful, partially because they
faced far more hostility in Washington, including serious armed opposition in 1932.

Gandhi’s thinking on non-violence seems to have been partially shaped by Tolstoy’s “The
Kingdom of Good is Within You,” which is something of a bridge between non-instrumental and
instrumental non-violence. The bulk of Tolstoy’s writing supports non-violence for largely non-
instrumental moral reasons, but in Chapter IX, he expounds upon the political power of non-
violent disobedience. He writes that “To punish men for refusing to act against their conscience
the government must renounce all claim to good sense and benevolence,” which eliminates the
moral authority of government, because “they assure people that they only rule in the name of
good sense and benevolence.” According to Tolstoy, non-violence is so powerful because
“authorities are in such a defenseless position before men who advocate Christianity, that but
little is necessary to overthrow this sovereign power which seems so powerful.”

Gandhi read and revered Tolstoy and urged civil resisters to “joyfully suffer even until death,”
presumably because “those who die unresistently are likely to still the hand of violence by their
wholly innocent sacrifice.” The innocence of the nonviolent resisters was critical, and he urged
them to “put up with assaults from the opponent, never retaliate,” “protect” officials from insult
or attack, and “behave courteously towards prison officials.” Such policies would make little
sense if civil disobedience was the political equivalent of a labor strike, the goal of which is to
inflict economic pain on your opponent. Gandhi may have advocated cheerful suffering for
primarily moral reasons, but it was also effective politics that energized his supporters and
reduced British support for the Raj.

Independent of Gandhi and Tolstoy, there was a strong traditional of nonviolence within the U.S.
and elsewhere. Thoreau was an early proponent, and Quakers served as a continuing source of
advocacy for nonviolence, through organizations like the American Friends Service Committee,
which helped train Bayard Rustin and helped funded Martin Luther King’s 1959 visit to India to
study Gandhism. Both Rustin and King studied Gandhi. His success – achieving independence
through non-violent disobedience—greatly increased the appeal of this approach to a wider range
of social actors, particularly those in the Civil Rights Movement in the United States.

The success of the Civil Rights Movement during the 1960s had little in common with either
violent revolution or a general strike. The southern states, which were presumably paying the
direct cost of Freedom Rides, sit-ins and other disobedience, never independently softened their
policies. Non-violent civil rights disobedience were effectively in generating non-Southern
support for civil rights. The images of non-violent young disobedients facing the dogs and
hoses of southern authority and the deaths of northern activists in the south helped change the
political atmosphere outside the south.

The model that follows is meant to describe events of that kind, where civil disobedience causes
political change by altering political views. The model is largely rational, where both

                                                 8
disobedience and the repression of disobedience provide new information to the median voter.
We later discuss the role of psychological factors for the disobedient and for leaders, involving
anger, salience, and unrealistic optimism.


   III.    Instrumental Civil Disobedience



We now formally model the decision to engage in civil disobedience. The core idea that drives
the model is that disobedience can create political change by generating information revelation.
The model begins with the decision of private individuals to engage in civil disobedience. A
political leader then decides whether or not to repress this disobedience. Voters then absorb
what has happened and the decide whether to re-elect or oust the leader. We now go through
those steps and describe the model’s formal assumption.

Acts of civil disobedience, both in the paper and in the real world, have at least two critical
dimensions: the number of disobedients and the damage done by each act of disobedience.
Massing illegally on a public space on a Sunday does little damage, but may involve a large
number of disobedients. Blowing up a Federal Post Office building does a great deal of damage
even though it involves only a small number of disobedients.

To capture this distinction, we will separate out the disobedients into a planner and followers.
The planner will choose the nature of the civil disobedience thinking strategically about how that
will impact the number of people who act and the influence of the mass action. The disobedients
themselves are too small to have an individual influence and therefore will be guided by
fundamentally non-instrumental motives.

We make the simplifying assumption that the total damage D equals the number of participants
in the act of civil disobedience, N, times the damage per disobedient d. We assume that the
individual participants can decide about whether they want to participate in the action, but that
there is a unitary actor – the disobedience planner—deciding on the nature of the disobedience
and hence the value of d. This value of d may then impact the number of participants in the
protest.

The disobedience planner’s choice may have major impacts on the public sphere, and therefore
we assume that choice is motivated primarily by instrumental factors. By contrast, we assume
that each potential disobedient is only a tiny part of the total movement, and therefore the
disobedients are motivated by non-instrumental reasons. We allow for the possibility that
protesters prefer to be involved in larger events. Nonetheless, the nature of the civil
disobedience may influence the number of protesters who attend, both because it influences their
desire to participate and because it will determine the response of civil leadership.


                                                 9
These assumptions are simplifications. In many cases, individual protesters decide both on
participation and how much damage to do. In other cases, there is far more central planning of
protests, as there was during the Civil Rights movement and by Gandhi.

The protest will have influence on the election if it reveals information about the leader. We
will assume that leaders differ along two dimensions: generic toughness and hostility to the
unhappy group that may engage in civil disobedience. Moreover, we will treat this dimension
as binary, so that a leader can be either tough or benign, in terms of general toughness, and can
be either hostile or neutral, in his attitude towards the group that is engaging in disobedience.
Only the leader knows whether he is tough or benign. The potentially disobedient group knows
whether the leader is hostile or neutral towards them. One goal of civil disobedience may be to
signal the unhappiness of a group. A second goal may be to get the leader to reveal his level of
toughness.

The primary effect of the leader being tough is that he will have a lower cost of repressing
disobedience than if the leader is benign. This cost is largely meant to be psychic, perhaps
because benign leaders have more empathy towards the disobedient group. We also assume that
voters’ preferences for re-electing the leader may depend on whether the leader is thought to be
tough or benign.

The leaders’ hostility to the out-group only matters to that group. If the leader is hostile to the
group, then the members of that group have a greater taste for civil disobedience and the planner
of the protest cares more about seeing the leader lose his position.

Since there are two dimensions and two possibilities for each dimension, there are four possible
types of leader. The probabilities of the four possibilities are summarized in the following table:



Probabilities of         Leader is hostile to     Leader is neutral to     Total
Leader Type              disobedient group        disobedient group

Leader is Tough                  𝜎𝜇𝑝0                    (1 − 𝜎𝜇)𝑝0                  𝑝0

Leader is Benign              (1 − 𝜎𝑝0 )𝜇             1 − 𝜇 − 𝑝0 + 𝜎𝜇𝑝0            1 − 𝑝0

Total                              𝜇                       1−𝜇



The unconditional probability of the leader being tough, rather than benign, is 𝑝0 . The
unconditional probability of the leader being hostile, rather than neutral, to the disobedient group
is 𝜇. The correlation between the two events is captured by the parameter 𝜎. When 𝜎 = 1, the



                                                 10
two events are unrelated and the group has essentially no information to reveal about the leader.
When 𝜎 > 1, then the leader is more likely to be tough, if he is hostile to the disobedient group.

The disobedience planners’ welfare if the leader is ousted equals 𝐵𝑗 ∈ {𝐵𝐻 , 𝐵𝑁 }, where 𝐵𝐻 is the
welfare if the leader is hostile and 𝐵𝑁 is the welfare if the leader is neutral, with 𝐵𝐻 > 𝐵𝑁 . The
protest is planned maximizing the expected value of 𝐵𝑗 minus 𝜉𝑑, where 𝜉 is arbitrarily small but
still strictly greater than zero. The role of 𝜉 is just to ensure that if there are many different
types of protest that yield identical political outcomes, the protest planner will always choose the
type of protest that has the lowest value of d.

The disobedients themselves may also hope that a tough leader is removed, but we need not
model that aspect of their utility, since their individual actions will not impact the probability that
the leader is removed. Their welfare is normalized to zero if they do not participate in civil
disobedience. If they join in the action, their welfare from disobedience will be 𝑏𝑗 + 𝜀𝑘 if the
disobedience is not repressed or 𝑏𝑗 + 𝜀𝑘 − 𝑐(𝑁) if the disobedience is repressed. Again,
𝑏𝑗 ∈ {𝑏𝐻 , 𝑏𝑁 }, where 𝑏𝐻 is the benefit from disobedience if the leader is hostile and 𝑏𝑁 is the
benefit if the leader is neutral, with 𝑏𝐻 > 𝑏𝑁 . These benefits and costs are largely psychic.

We assume 𝐶(𝑁) ≥ 0, 𝐶′(𝑁) ≤ 0, 𝐶"(𝑁) ≥ 0 and 𝑙𝑖𝑚𝑁→∞ 𝐶(𝑁) = 0. The core idea is that the
cost of being repressed are positive, but get smaller as the size of the protest increases, reflecting
the fact that the probability of arrest is small in a larger crowd as in DiPasquale and Glaeser
(1997). However, the impact of crowd size has diminishing returns, and ultimately the
probability of arrest goes to zero and N gets arbitrarily large. We assume that the maximum
value of 𝜀𝑘 is denoted 𝜀𝑀𝑎𝑥 and we typically assume that this value is finite. We assume that
there is a symmetric, single-peaked distribution of 𝜀, with a mean and median of zero that is
described by a cumulative distribution 𝐺(𝜀) and a single-peaked density 𝑔(𝜀), hence 𝑔′(𝜀) ≥ 0
and 𝑔"(𝜀) ≤ 0 for 𝜀 < 0 and 𝑔′(𝜀) ≤ 0 and 𝑔"(𝜀) ≥ 0 for 𝜀 > 0.

The total population of potential disobedients is denoted Q. Therefore size of the protest will
equal (1 − 𝐺(−𝑏𝑗 ))𝑄 if it is known that the protest will not be suppressed. If it is known that
the protest will be suppressed, then the size of the protest is a fixed point of the equation
(1 − 𝐺(𝑐(𝑁) − 𝑏𝑗 )) 𝑄 = 𝑁, which will always be less than the size of the protest if it is known
that the protest will be not be repressed.

Our bifurcation between planner and individual disobedient means that there we have separated
out the two functions of most disobedience: regime change (which is the interest of the planner)
and non-instrumental expression of unhappiness (which is the interest of the individual
disobedient).

After the decision about the nature of the protest and the amount of protest, the leader will have
the choice of two actions: repression or accommodation. The critical assumption is just that

                                                  11
there is one response which harms the disobedients more and second that harms them less. In
principle, the tougher response could include prosecution or police brutality. The lesser
response could include changing policies in line with the disobedients’ requests or merely benign
neglect.

The leader’s welfare equals V, a continuation value, times the probability that he remains in
office, minus D if he accomodates or 𝐾𝑙 if he represses, where 𝐾𝑙 = 𝜑𝐾 if the leader is tough
and K if the leader is benign. The level of D represents the inconveniences and embarrassment
to the leader if disobedients have seized public or private spaces, or whatever other downsides
are linked to the disobedience. The costs 𝐾𝑖 reflect the embarrassment and inconvenience of
using the forces of the state to clear the streets and restore order. These costs of repression
occur at the time when the disorder is suppressed; they are distinct from the electoral
consequences of dealing with the disorder.

The value of V reflects the benefits of leadership, the extent to which the leader values the
future, and the probability that the leader will be ousted for some other reason in the future.

The leader is then be accountable to voters, or possibly, someone further up in a hierarchy.
Disobedience in democracies typically seek to influence the electorate, but in more dictatorial
regimes, disobedience of a regional leader may be seeking to have him replaced by central
leadership. Even dictators often rely upon tacit support from elites and the army, and the
opinions of these groups could be shaped by widepread disobedience. Voters may have their
opinions altered either by the disobedience or by the response of the leader.

We have assumed that leaders have heterogeneous costs of repressing disorder but the cost of
accommodating are homogeneous, but this is largely irrelevant. The important assumption for
the model is that there is heterogeneity in the difference in leader welfare between
accommodating and repressing.

In the third period, voters choose whether to re-elect the leader. We assume that all voters vote
and vote to reelect the leader if and only if the net benefit from re-electing the leader is positive.
For voter i, the net benefit for re-electing the leader is 𝜃𝐿 − 𝛾𝑝𝑉 + 𝜉 + 𝜀𝑖 . They will vote to re-
elect the leader whenever this quantity is positive. The first term, 𝜃𝐿 , is a constant that reflects
the leader’s core appeal, including his charisma, past track record and other attributes as a leader.
The second term reflects the beliefs about the leaders’ character, where 𝑝𝑉 , is the voters’ belief
after the disobedience has occurred that the leader is tough. If 𝛾 is positive, then voters will be
less likely to support a leader who is perceived as tough. If 𝛾 is negative, then the opposite is true
and voters prefer law and order.

The last two terms, 𝜉 and 𝜀𝑖 , are noise terms that equal zero in expectation. The term 𝜉 is a
common shock that impacts all voters but is not known at the time of the disobedience. The
cumulative distribution of 𝜉 is described by a function F(.). The 𝜀𝑖 term reflects individual
tastes that also have mean zero. The leader is re-elected if a majority of voters support the
                                                 12
leader’s re-election if and only if 𝜃𝐿 − 𝛾𝑝𝑉 + 𝜉 > 0. The probability of the leader being ousted
is therefore 𝐹(𝛾𝑝𝑉 − 𝜃𝐿 ). We let 𝑝𝐷 denote the probability that the leader is tough conditional
upon disobedience taking place. now adopt the notation: 𝜗1 = 1 − 𝐹(𝛾 − 𝜃𝐿 ), 𝜗0 = 1 −
𝐹(−𝜃𝐿 ) and 𝜗𝐷 = 1 − 𝐹(𝛾𝑝𝐷 − 𝜃𝐿 ), where 𝜗1 < 𝜗𝐷 < 𝜗0 as long as 𝛾 > 0. These are the
probabilities of winning re-election condition upon the beliefs of the voters.

From our perspective, voters are essentially just a machine for turning beliefs about the leader
into an outcome that both the leader and the disobedience planner care about. Our final key
assumption concerns belief formation by voters off the equilibrium path.

As discussed already, tough leaders have a lower cost f engaging in repression. We will assume
that voters will always interpret repression as being an indication that leader is more likely to be
tough. More formally, following the logic of the D1 Refinement discussed by Banks and Sobel
(1987) and Cho and Kreps (1987), we assume that if voters expect all leaders to repress, then
they will believe that a leader who does not repress is benign. If voters expect all leaders to do
nothing, then they will believe that a leader who responds harshly is tough.

The Leader’s Decision

As we have already specified the behavior of voters in period 3, we now proceed recursively to
period 2 and turn to the decision of a leader who is facing disorder of size D. The leader’s
behavior is response to that disorder will then shape the decisions of the disobedients in the first
period.

The leader’s welfare equals (1 − 𝐹(𝛾𝑝𝑉 − 𝜃𝐿 ))𝑉 minus the costs of either repressing disorder or
doing nothing. The leader’s decision is complicated because his action may signal his type.
Repressing or accommodating acts of civil disobedience become a complicated signal indicating
whether the leader is benign or tough.

The equilibria of this model can take three forms: pooling, separating and semi-pooling. In a
pooling equilibrium, both types of leaders take the same action. In a separating equilibrium, they
take different actions. In a semi-pooling equilibrium, leaders of one type randomize between
actions while leaders of the other type usually take a single action.

We also let 𝑝𝐷 denote the probability assigned by voters to the leader being malign conditional
upon disorder occurring, which may be different from 𝑝0 .

We focus on the case where 𝛾 is positive, so that leaders wish to appear as benign, but we also
discuss the largely symmetric case when 𝛾 is negative.

Proposition 1: (i) If 𝐾 > 𝜑𝐾 > 𝐷 and 𝛾 > 0, then neither type of leader will suppress disorder
harshly.



                                                 13
       (ii) If 𝐾 > 𝐷 > 𝜑𝐾 and 𝛾 > 0,, then there exists a value of V, denoted 𝑉, where if
𝑉 < 𝑉, h all tough leaders repress and benign leaders do nothing, and there also exists a second
greater value of V, denoted 𝑉, where if 𝑉 > 𝑉, all leaders do nothing. If 𝑉, < 𝑉 < 𝑉, then tough
leaders randomize between the two responses, while benign leaders do nothing.

       (iii) If 𝐾 > 𝐷 > 𝜑𝐾 and 𝛾 < 0,, then there exists a value of V, denoted 𝑉, where if
𝑉 < 𝑉, h all tough leaders repress and benign leaders do nothing, and there also exists a second
greater value of V, denoted 𝑉, where if 𝑉 > 𝑉, all leaders repress. If 𝑉, < 𝑉 < 𝑉, then benign
leaders randomize between the two responses, while tough leaders always repress.

        (iv) If 𝐷 > 𝐾 > 𝜑𝐾 and 𝛾 > 0, then when V is low, all leaders repress and if V is
sufficiently high, all leaders do nothing. For intermediate levels of V, there can be three
equilibria: one in which all leaders repress, one in which benign types randomize between the
actions, while tough leaders repress, and one that depending on the value of V, can include
involves separating, semi-pooling or pooling.

       (v) If 𝐷 > 𝐾 > 𝜑𝐾 and 𝛾 < 0, then all leaders will repress.

        Proposition 1 details the basic predictions of the model about behavior of the leader and
Table 3 reports the parameter values under which different equilibria can occur. If 𝐾 > 𝜑𝐾 >
𝐷, then the costs of repression are greater than the costs of doing nothing for both types of
leader, and both types of leaders do nothing. If voters prefer benign leaders, then there is never
any strategic reason to be harsh, given our assumption that voters prefer benign leaders. As
such, if the disorder is sufficiently mild then there is no reason to pay the costs of beating it
down.

       This result would change if voters actually preferred tough leaders. In that case, for high
enough values of V, tough leaders would start to repress, even if their own preferences favored
leniency, in order to signal their toughness. We will not explicitly deal with this case, primarily
because civil disobedience is particularly inexplicable if voters have a taste for leaders who are
tough enough to harshly repress civil disobedience.

        The middle case, in which 𝐾 > 𝐷 > 𝜑𝐾, is the most interesting. For those parameter
values, benign leaders would intrinsically prefer doing nothing while tough leaders would like to
repress. Politics, however, pushes tough leaders towards tolerance if 𝛾 > 0. If V is sufficiently
low, so that career concerns are relatively unimportant, then tough leaders act tough and ignore
the political consequences. For higher values of V, however, tough leaders start imitating the
benign leaders and do nothing. This can be understood as capturing the dictator who allows the
disobedience to continue, ignoring his core instincts, because he wants to show a good face to the
world. At the highest levels of V, harsh punishment disappears altogether, because tough
leaders are really desperate to keep their jobs.


                                                14
       These results would reverse if 𝛾 < 0, and voters wanted tough leaders who would repress
disorder. In that case, again assuming that 𝐾 > 𝐷 > 𝜑𝐾, leaders continue to act their type when
V is low. But if 𝛾 < 0, as V rises, then benign leaders increasingly start acting tough and for
very high levels of V, both types of leaders repress any disobedience. Oddly, in this case,
disobedience stands the best chance of leading to the ousting of the most benign leaders, which
should presumably deter protesting. If 𝛾 < 0, and 𝐷 > 𝐾 > 𝜑𝐾, then disobedience always
engenders repression. We have avoided characterizing the case where 𝛾 < 0 and 𝐾 > 𝜑𝐾 > 𝐷,
because it is complex and in our opinion, unlikely to be all that relevant.

        Our focus on the case where voters prefer benign leaders to tough leaders, does not imply
that we think that this is the norm in U.S. history. In many cases, voters seem to prefer law-and-
order candidates to accomodationists. Naturally, this will create the possibility that disobedience
will increase the probability of ousting a benign leaders—a boomerang effect-- where
disobedience entrenches the tough and ousts the mild. A classic example of that boomerang
effect was when the 1967 Detroit riot discredited liberal Mayor Jerome Cavanagh and led to the
election of the far more conservative Roman Gribbs.

        Returning to the case where 𝛾 > 0, we next consider the setting where 𝐷 > 𝐾 > 𝜑𝐾,
which is fairly complex. When V is very low, then both leaders act tough, which is their
preferred action in the absence of career concerns. When V is very high, the both types of
leaders act leniently, despite the fact that neither is innately interested in being lenient. This
outcome is related to the problem of wasteful signaling first highlighted by Spence (1973). Both
types of leaders are doing something that neither wants to do, because if they don’t, then voters
will think that they are tough. In this case, the interests of the wider public may be different
from the interests of the leaders and as such, the signaling done by tolerating disorder could be
beneficial.

        For intermediate levels of V, there will be exactly three equilibriums. If V is somewhat
              𝐷−𝐾
greater than 𝜗        , then three equilibrium will include one equilibrium in which both types
              0 −𝜗1
suppress, one equilibrium in which only malign types suppress and one equilibrium in which
malign types randomize between repression and doing nothing. We define 𝜗0 as the posterior
belief that the leader is tough condition upon the leader. This multiplicity exists because if all types
are repressing, then benign types gain less by switching to doing nothing. If only tough types are
repressing, then benign types don’t want to switch to suppression because then voters will think
that they are surely malign. Likewise, there is an equilibrium between these other two in which
all some but not all benign types act leniently. In this case, the gain in reputation from acting
leniently is less than in the separating equilibrium but more than in the pooling equilibrium, and
exactly enough to make the benign types indifferent between the two actions.

As V rises, the configuration of equilibria changes slightly. For higher values of V, the
separating equilibria disappears and becomes another semi-pooling equilibrium. Eventually, as

                                                   15
V becomes sufficiently high, the number of equilibria drops from three to one. The basic
intuition when 𝐷 > 𝐾 > 𝜑𝐾 is not so different than when 𝐾 > 𝐷 > 𝜑𝐾, but the predictions are
more complicated, and we will focus on comparative statics when 𝐾 > 𝐷 > 𝜑𝐾. The next
proposition provides comparative statics assuming that condition holds:

Proposition 2: When 𝐾 > 𝐷 > 𝜑𝐾 and 𝛾 > 0¸ then 𝑉 (the highest value of V for which all
tough leaders repress) increases with D, declines with K, 𝜑, and 𝛾 and increases with 𝜃𝐿 if and
only if 𝑓(−𝜃𝐿 ) < 𝑓(𝛾 − 𝜃𝐿 ). The value of 𝑉 (the lowest value of V for which all tough leaders
do nothing) increases with 𝐷 and 𝑝𝐷 and decreases with 𝜑 and K. The value of 𝑉 increases
with 𝜃𝐿 if and only if 𝑓(𝛾𝑝𝐷 − 𝜃𝐿 ) < 𝑓(𝛾 − 𝜃𝐿 ) and decreases with 𝛾 if and only if 𝑝𝐷 𝑓(𝛾𝑝𝐷 −
𝜃𝐿 ) < 𝑓(𝛾 − 𝜃𝐿 ). If 𝑉 > 𝑉 > 𝑉 , then the share of tough leaders who do nothing is falling
with D and rising with 𝜑, K and V.

The logic of the proposition is relatively straightforward. When V is low, then the benign types
are tolerant and the tough leaders repress. The range of values of V for which this occurs
expands with D because larger values of D, the costs of disorder to the leader, make it less
attractive for tough leaders to imitate the benign leaders and do nothing. Lower values of K and
𝜑 also expand the range of values of V where tough leaders repress because they reduce the costs
of repression. A higher value of 𝛾 will increase the desire to be seen as benign and therefore
make it more attractive for tough leaders to want to appear to be benign.

If the leader is innately stronger, with a higher value of 𝜃𝐿 , then this will expand the range of
values for which repression is attractive to tough types as long 𝑓(−𝜃𝐿 ) is less than 𝑓(𝛾 − 𝜃𝐿 ).
If 𝑓(𝛾 − 𝜃𝐿 ) is higher, this means that charisma is more valuable with voters if the leader is
thought to be malign, and therefore complements suppression.

When V is greater than 𝑉, then the tough leaders do nothing in order to appear benign. This
cutoff should be interpreted as one measure of how attractive it is for tough leaders to imitate the
benign. This lower bound is rising with D and falling with 𝜑 and K because 𝐷 − 𝜑𝐾 determine
the net cost, for the tough types, of doing nothing. In this pooling equilibrium, a higher value of
𝑝𝐷 will lead voters to believe that tolerant behavior still comes from a malign leader. This will
make pooling less attractive, holding V constant. The lower bound rises with 𝜃𝐿 as long as
𝑓(𝛾𝑝𝐷 − 𝜃𝐿 ) is less than 𝑓(𝛾 − 𝜃𝐿 ), which should be interpreted as meaning that charisma
complements being tough.

Perhaps most importantly, this lower bound, 𝑉, decreases with 𝛾 if and only if 𝑝𝐷 𝑓(𝛾𝑝𝐷 − 𝜃𝐿 ) is
less than 𝑓(𝛾 − 𝜃𝐿 ). This condition will hold as long as the densities are similar, which seems
reasonable. Higher values of 𝛾 mean that the population really wants a benign leader, and
unsurprisingly, this will make it more likely that the tough will imitate more tolerant leaders.
Conversely, as 𝛾 goes to zero, this cutoff goes to infinity. If the population doesn’t value



                                                 16
tolerance much, then there is essentially no case in which the tough will imitate the benign. If 𝛾
were negative, then with high values of V, the benign would imitate the malign.

The last set of comparative statics concern the share of tough types who choose to imitate the
benign in the semi-pooling equilibrium. This parameter is important because it determines the
expected amount of suppression. The share of malign leaders who are tolerant falls with D.
Unsurprisingly higher costs of disorder lead to more suppression. Higher values of 𝜑 or K,
which capture the costs of suppression, lead to less suppression. Higher values of V, which
implies a greater weight put on re-election, also leads to more imitation of the benign.

The Choice of Civil Disobedience by Individual Protesters

We now turn to the choice of disobedience. There are actually two separate choices to consider.
The decision of the individual protester and the decision of the protest planner. Since the planner
moves first, we must continue to solve the model recursively, first describing the behavior of the
protester for a given value of d.

From the protesters’ perspective there are three possibilities. First, if the protest will not be
repressed then the protesters will participate as long as 𝑏𝑗 + 𝜀𝑘 > 0. We will always assume that
𝑏𝐻 + 𝜀𝑀𝑎𝑥 > 0, so that there is some potential for protest, but that 𝑏𝐻 + 𝜀𝑀𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑛 < 0, so that the
protesters always represent a minority of the total group. As a general point, the size of the
protest will generically fully reveal the value of 𝑏𝑗 . As a result, the protest planner will be able
to transmit the information about the state of his group’s unhappiness just by having a protest.
It doesn’t need to be large.

If it is known that the protest will be suppressed with probability 𝜋, then the size of the protest is
                                                          𝑁
a fixed point of the equation 1 − 𝐺(𝜋𝑐(𝑁) − 𝑏𝑗 ) − 𝑄 = 0.           There can easily be multiple
equilibria of this function. For example, if 𝜋 = 1 and 𝐺(𝑐(0) − 𝑏𝑗 ) = 1, and there exists a point
        𝑄−𝑁
which         > 𝐺(𝑐(𝑁) − 𝑏𝑗 ), then there can readily be three equilibria. The first has no
          𝑄
disobedience. In the second, there is some disobedience but the equilibrium is unstable in the
casual sense that a slight increase in the number of disobedients would cause the returns from
being disobedient to rise. In the third, there is a stable and significant amount of disobedience.

We make a number of simplifying assumptions. First, we assume that c(.) is convex, reflecting
the decreasing returns to having fellow protesters. Second, we assume that G(.) is single peaked
at the median. This will reduce the possible types of multiplicity of equilibrium.
                      𝜀𝑚𝑎𝑥 +𝑏𝑗
Proposition 3: If                > 𝜋 , then there exists a unique equilibrium with a positive level of
                        𝑐(0)
disobedience, and the level of disobedience is rising with Q and 𝑏𝑗 and falling with 𝜋. If
1                                𝑐′(0)
    > −𝑔(𝜀𝑚𝑎𝑥 )(𝜀𝑚𝑎𝑥 + 𝑏𝑗 ) 𝑐(0) , then there is no equilibrium with positive disobedience for
𝑄



                                                     17
𝜀𝑚𝑎𝑥 +𝑏𝑗               1                           𝑐′(0)
              < 𝜋. If 𝑄 < −𝑔(𝜀𝑚𝑎𝑥 )(𝜀𝑚𝑎𝑥 + 𝑏𝑗 ) 𝑐(0) , then for all values of Q there will exist a
     𝑐(0)
unique value of 𝜋, which determines the maximum level of repression, denoted 𝜋𝑚𝑎𝑥 at which
                                                                                                   𝜀𝑚𝑎𝑥 +𝑏𝑗
disobedience can occur. The value of 𝜋𝑚𝑎𝑥 is rising with Q and 𝑏𝑗 . If 𝜋 lies between                𝑐(0)
and 𝜋𝑚𝑎𝑥 , then there are multiple equilibria: one with no disobedience, and two with
disobedience. The share of potential protesters who are disobedient in the equilibrium with
more disobedience is rising with Q and falling with 𝜋.

Proposition 3 characterizes the behavior of potential disobedients, which is determined by the
probability of repression, the intensity of preferences, and the size of the group.  When the
                                                𝜀𝑚𝑎𝑥 +𝑏𝑗
probability of repression is low (less than                ) then there is a unique equilibrium and it is
                                                  𝑐(0)
well behaved. When the size of the group is bigger, a greater share of the group will be
disobedient, except in the limit where the probability of repression is zero. Group size matters
because larger groups mean lower costs of repression to each person who is disobedient.

The probability of repression increases the costs of disobedience and causes the size of the
protest to decline. Intensity of preferences also matters, unsurprisingly, since groups with
strong tastes will have more protesters holding the probability of repression constant.

One important corollary of this proposition is that the size of the protest completely reveals the
depth of protestor preferences. In any equilibrium with a positive amount of protesting, the
strength of preferences will be completely revealing. Signaling the group’s preferences can
therefore be done quite cheaply, with an arbitrarily non-threatening protest. Since protesters
don’t behave strategically on the individual level, their behavior is always revealing. This is a
big advantage for protests that are formed by voluntary attendance of the many, as opposed to
concerted acts of the few.
     𝜀𝑚𝑎𝑥 +𝑏𝑗
If              < 𝜋, and if Q is small, then the only equilibrium involves no disobedience at all. If
       𝑐(0)
Q is larger than there will exist multiple equilibrium. In one equilibrium, there is no
disobedience. There is a second equilibrium that is unstable in the casual sense that if slightly
more people were disobedient the net returns to disobedience would rise and even more people
would be disobedient. There is a third equilibrium with a higher level of disobedience and at
that level there is stability. The same comparative statics apply for the level of disobedience in
that third equilibrium.

The proposition highlights that for a given level of Q and the depth of preferences there is a
maximum level of 𝜋 that permits disobedience to occur. When Q is high, then an equilibrium
disobedience can exist even if the probability of repression is one. If Q is low, then such an
equilibrium does not exist. Protesters will not be willing to show up in they are sufficiently
sure that there will be repression.


                                                         18
The proposition illustrates the constraints faced by the planners of civil disobedience. They need
to ensure that protesters participate. Participation can be sure either if (1) the probability of
repression is small, (2) the taste for disobedience is high or (3) the size of the community is large
enough so that the costs of repression to the individual protester are small. Essentially, either
strong tastes or a big community can free a protester to take actions that are really harmful to the
existing regime.

We will deal with the multiple equilibria issue by assuming that the planner always has the
power to select the equilibrium that is chosen by coordinating the activities of his people. This
will mean that if a given set of parameter values admits an equilibrium with disobedience that
will be the equilibrium that will occur. This is a significant assumption, but it does capture the
organizing role of the planner and it seems a reasonable a way of dealing with multiple
equilibria. We do not, however, allow the planner to choose which equilibrium occurs when the
multiplicity is on the part of the political leader.



The Choice of the Disobedience Planner

Just as there are two types of leaders, there are effectively two types of disobedient planners:
those who know that the leader has been hostile to them and those who know that the leader has
not been hostile to their group. That information is private and the planner wants to signal that
information, but it will be signaled as long as he can organize any sort of disobedience at all.
Since the individual disobedients are non-strategic, the size of the action will automatically
reveal the state of their minds. This is not a feature of two states, the value of 𝑏𝑗 is revealed as
long as there is any disobedience.

Lemma 1: The disobedience planner always prefer the equilibrium with an infinitesimal level of
“d” and no repression (the epsilon protest) to any other equilibrium in which all types of leaders
do the same thing.

Lemma 1 reflects the fact that either type of disobedience planner can costlessly reveal their type
with an arbitrarily small, harmless protest that does not engender any repression We call this
type of protest an epsilon-protest, which is the most non-threatening protest possible meant
entirely to illustrate the number of one’s supporters. This is perhaps the nature of legal, non-
violent marches that disperse quickly causing little harm.

A more complex information structure would make it possible for planners to prefer more
damaging events even if they were not repressed. In our model, one parameter captures the
extent of out-group sentiments. If there were two parameters, one of which captured the depth of
dissatisfaction and one of which captured the width of dissatisfaction then more dangerous
protest might be a way of showing that anger was both wide and deep.


                                                 19
We now focus on the planners’ decision about whether to engage in more damaging protests
within the structure of the model. The only reason to take that route in our model is to elicit
repression and reveal something about the political leader, since the protesters’ feelings can be
shown with an epsilon-protest. We assume that planners representing groups that are not
hostile to the leader will not protest, and focus on the intensive margin of protest for a planner
whose group is hostile to the leader. In principle, there could be a perverse situation in which
planners’ who represent groups that are happy with the leadership might choose to protest also,
perhaps because they wanted to show voters that they were happy to help the leader keep his job.
But since there is full revelation of the planners’ type automatically with any protest, the
situation is largely symmetric for the two groups and would be essentially the same for any
distribution in the tastes of protesters and protest planners. This implies that the expected
probability that the leader is tough is 𝜎𝑝0 conditional upon any protest by the more harmed
disobedients.

To determine the planners’ welfare, we must now address the case in which there are multiple
equilibria for the leaders’ response to a disorder of size D. This multiplicity occurs specifically
when D is greater than (𝐹(𝛾𝜎𝑝0 − 𝜃𝐿 ) − 𝐹(−𝜃𝐿 ))𝑉 + 𝐾 and less than 𝑉(𝐹(𝛾 − 𝜃𝐿 ) −
𝐹(−𝜃𝐿 )) + 𝐾. For this range of values, it can be that all types of leaders repress; both types of
leaders would prefer repression in the absence of career concerns. Alternatively, there can be
an equilibrium in which there is semi-pooling, all tough leaders repress and some mild leaders
randomize between repression and accommodation. This third equilibrium is unstable in the
casual sense that if a slight higher share of mild leaders are thought to repress, then all mild
leaders would choose to repress, while if a slightly higher share of mild leaders are thought
tolerate, then all mild leaders tolerate. Still, its instability leads us not to consider this
equilibrium.

The last possibility is that there is a sequence of equilibria, as in the case where D<K, where the
leaders actions depend on parameter values. There is tolerance when D is low, then semi-
pooling where some tough leaders repress and all mild leaders accommodate, separation for
middling levels of D is high, semi-pooling where all tough leaders repress and then eventually
total repression by all types of leaders.

We will assume that the equilibrium is known at the time that the planer is fixing his level of d,
and that the resulting equilibrium generates a value of D, denoted 𝐷̂ , which lies between
(𝐹(𝛾𝜎𝑝0 − 𝜃𝐿 ) − 𝐹(−𝜃𝐿 ))𝑉 + 𝐾 and 𝑉(𝐹(𝛾 − 𝜃𝐿 ) − 𝐹(−𝜃𝐿 )) + 𝐾. For values of D that are
less than or equal to 𝐷̂ , the sequence of equilibria described above occur. For value of 𝐷 > 𝐷 ̂,
total repression will occur. The value of 𝐷 ̂ is known by the protest planner, and it follows
immediately from Lemma 1, that the protest planner will never choose a value of D that is
greater than 𝐷̂ . Total repression will be no more information to voters than total accomodation
and will cost the planner more.


                                                 20
We first assume that Q is sufficiently high and 𝜉 is sufficiently close to zero so that 𝜋𝑚𝑎𝑥 = 1, so
the planner faces no restraints and can effectively chooses “D”. In this case, it follows that

Proposition 4: If F(.) is concave over the region, [−𝜃𝐿 , 𝛾 − 𝜃𝐿 ], then the protest planner will
always prefer the epsilon protest. If F(.) is convex over the region, [−𝜃𝐿 , 𝛾 − 𝜃𝐿 ], then: (1) if
̂ > 𝜑𝐾 + 𝑉(𝐹(𝛾 − 𝜃𝐿 ) − 𝐹(−𝜃𝐿 )), then the planner will set “d” so that 𝐷 = 𝜑𝐾 +
𝐷
𝑉(𝐹(𝛾 − 𝜃𝐿 ) − 𝐹(−𝜃𝐿 )), (2) if 𝜑𝐾 + 𝑉(𝐹(𝛾 − 𝜃𝐿 ) − 𝐹(𝛾𝜎𝑝0 − 𝜃𝐿 )) < 𝐷        ̂ < 𝜑𝐾 +
𝑉(𝐹(𝛾 − 𝜃𝐿 ) − 𝐹(−𝜃𝐿 )), then the planner will set d so that 𝐷 = 𝐷   ̂ , and (3) if 𝜑𝐾 +
𝑉(𝐹(𝛾 − 𝜃𝐿 ) − 𝐹(𝛾𝜎𝑝0 − 𝜃𝐿 )) > 𝐷   ̂ , then the planner will just choose the epsilon protest.

Proposition 4 highlights the determinants of rational disobedience when the protest planner is
largely unconstrained in his ability to foment a large and painful protest and when the costs of
planning a difficult protest are low. The proposition highlights the central role of the concavity
of the vote distribution. Ultimately, the advantage of a high cost protest is information
revelation—over and above the information that is revealed by the size of the protest itself.

We have assumed that the protest planner can, at low cost, reveal whether his group is being
abused by planning an epsilon-protest and demonstrating his group’s unhappiness through the
size of the crowd. The potential added benefit of the protest will not be predictable to the
planner. The leader may reveal his type by repressing the protest with too much determination.
Since the protest planner doesn’t know the leaders’ type, this benefit is a roll of the dice, and like
most gambles, its attractiveness depends on the concavity of the gamblers welfare function,
which in this case is determined by the concavity of the vote distribution.

If the distribution of F(.) is concave, then the planner prefers an epsilon protest. If the
distribution of F(.) is convex, then the planner wants to induce leaders to separate themselves.
Convexity means that the planner gains more by showing the leader to be tough than he loses by
showing the leader to be mild.

The distribution F(.) concerns the common shock experienced by the leader after the protest, and
to build intuition, it makes sense to assume that this distribution is single peaked at zero, which
implies that the distribution is convex when the probability of the leader losing is less than one-
half and concave if the probability of re-election is less than one-half.     The intuition then is
that the protest planner will be more likely to take action against popular leaders (that have
harmed his own group), against whom the marginal impact of protest is high than among
unpopular leaders, who are likely to lose their positions anyway.

The planner will never choose a costly protest that has no potential information value, and that
means that 𝐷̂ is an upper bound on the damage of the protest. This provides the point where
even risk-taking planners must find a sweet spot for civil disobedience, which is high enough to
elicit some repression but not high enough to elicit repression by everyone.



                                                  21
We now consider the more realistic case where the planner faces constraints created by his
participants. We need not consider the concave case, where the planner wants an epsilon-
protest. In that case, the planner can propose such a plan and the probability of repression will
be zero. The risks of repression therefore will not limit the concave planner who wants an
epsilon protest. The risks of repression will bother the planner who wants to cause enough
trouble to induce tough leaders to reveal their types.

Proposition 5: If 𝜋𝑚𝑎𝑥 > 𝜎𝑝0, planners’ behavior is described in Proposition 4, but if F(.) is
convex over the region, [−𝜃𝐿 , 𝛾 − 𝜃𝐿 ], and 𝜋𝑚𝑎𝑥 < 𝜎𝑝0 then if 𝜑𝐾 + 𝑉(𝐹(𝛾 − 𝜃𝐿 ) −
                                                                       𝛾𝜋
                 ̂ , the epsilon protest dominates, if 𝜑𝐾 − 𝑉𝐹 (
𝐹(𝛾𝜎𝑝0 − 𝜃𝐿 )) > 𝐷                                                   𝑚𝑎𝑥
                                                                                   −𝜃𝐿 ) +
                                                                1−𝜎𝑝 +𝜋  0   𝑚𝑎𝑥
              ̂ > 𝐾 + 𝑉(𝐹(𝛾 − 𝜃𝐿 ) − 𝐹(𝛾𝜎𝑝0 − 𝜃𝐿 )), then the planner will set d so that
𝑉𝐹(𝛾 − 𝜃𝐿 ) > 𝐷
  ̂ , and if 𝑉𝐹 (𝛾(𝜎𝑝0 −𝜋𝑚𝑎𝑥 ) −𝜃𝐿 ) + 𝑉𝐹(𝛾 − 𝜃𝐿 ) < 𝐷
𝐷=𝐷                                                  ̂ , then the planner will set d so that a
                   1−𝜋       𝑚𝑎𝑥
           𝜋𝑚𝑎𝑥
fraction          of tough leaders repress in equilibrium.
           𝜎𝑝0

Proposition 5 emphasizes that when constraints bind, the planner chooses the level of D that
generates that most separation. If 𝜋𝑚𝑎𝑥 > 𝜎𝑝0, then the planners’ ideal does not run counter to
the tastes of his constituents. Given the fully separation equilibrium that the planner prefers, the
disobedients are still willing to turn out in force. In that case, Proposition 4 describes the
planner’s behavior. The more interesting case is when 𝜋𝑚𝑎𝑥 < 𝜎𝑝0, for in that case, the
constituents will not protest if all tough leaders are expected to repress. The threat of repression
deters them from action. The planner must therefore choose a milder protest than would be his
first choice.

When 𝐷 ̂ is low, then this parameter remains is the relevant constraint. The planner then either
gives up and plans an epsilon protest, or sets d so that 𝐷 = 𝐷  ̂ . When 𝐷̂ is higher, the relevant
constraint becomes 𝜋𝑚𝑎𝑥 and the planner sets d so that the threat of repression does not exceed
that amount. The combination of two constraints, and the interconnected choices of protest
planner, activists and political leader produce a rich set of comparative statics discussed in the
next proposition.

Proposition 5 also reminds us that there can a substantial difference of interest between the
individual protesters and the protest planner. The planner wants to generate regime change and
generating repression can help that happen. Individual protesters may well prefer not to be
subjected to a policeman’s nightstick. Given the preferences that we have assumed, the
protester would always prefer the epsilon protest to the more aggressive actions.

Naturally, we have assumed that protesters themselves do not care about regime change. If they
do, and that is quite possibly then case, then the planner may well be acting in the interests of the
entire group, even if each individual protester would prefer to face a lower probability of
repression.

                                                    22
Proposition 6: If the planners is unconstrained and F(.) is locally convex, D is rising with 𝜑, K,
V, 𝛾 and falling with 𝜃𝐿 . If the planner sets 𝐷 = 𝐷  ̂ , then an increase in 𝐷
                                                                              ̂ will cause the size of
the protest to shrink but the intensity of the protest to rise. Holding D constant, increases in 𝜑, 𝐾,
and V cause the intensity of disobedience to fall and number of disobedients to rise, while
increases in 𝜃𝐿 , 𝜎 and 𝑝0 , cause the intensity of disobedience to rise and the number of
                                                     𝜋𝑚𝑎𝑥
disobedients to fall. If d is set so that a fraction 𝜎𝑝     of tough leaders repress, then the total
                                                      0
amount of disorder and the level of d is rising with 𝜑, K, V, and falling with 𝜃𝐿 , 𝜎, and 𝑝0 , but
the number of disobedients is independent of these variables. The value of D is rising with 𝑏𝑗 and
Q.

Proposition 6 describes the empirical predictions of the model about the intensity and size of
rational civil disobedience. If the planner is unconstrained, then the model predicts that the level
of overall disorder, D, is just high enough to induce all tough leaders to repress and no mild
leaders to repress (the sweet spot), but that level can be achieved with a higher intensity of
protest (d) and a lower number of protesters or a lower intensity of protest and a higher number
of protesters. The planner is essentially indifferent between these options. The overall level
of damage (D) is rising with 𝜑 and K because it needs to be high enough to induce the tough
leaders to pay the cost of repression. Higher values of V and 𝛾 also induce more damaging
protests, because stronger career concerns push the tough leaders to want to copy the mild leader
more, and as a result the protest must be more severe to induce repression.

A higher value of 𝜃𝐿 reduces the size of disorder because the gains from appearing benign are
less if the leader is inherently more charismatic. This means that the tough leaders have less
reason to imitate mild leaders.

Some but not all of these comparative statics remain when the constraints bind. For example, if
                                                                       ̂ ), then other parameters do
the damage is just at the upper limit set by the leaders’ equilibrium (𝐷
not change the overall level of disorder, which must be just low enough to avoid total repression.



Discussion

The model differentiates between two different types of instrumental civil disobedience. The
first type as peaceful as possible and meant primarily to show the relative size of an unhappy
minority. The model predicts that this type of disobedience is preferred when the protest’s
planners believe that they have private information that will matter to voters, about the degree of
unhappiness of the out-group. The planner must also prefer the relatively predictability of a
large scale, low intensity, protest to a smaller scale, higher intensity event. The preference for
predictability, itself, reflects concave returns for the protester, which in the model are more likely
to exist when the regime is more likely to be voted out even without the protest.


                                                 23
This suggests that the large scale peaceful protest is an act of confidence. The planner believes
that the scale of the protest will matter and that it isn’t necessary to risk violent repression. As
we will discuss later, this suggests that this type of disobedience may be more common when
groups believe that they are overly representative of the public as a whole.

The second type of disobedience will be smaller scale, since the risk of repression and that will
be deter some potential protesters. This disobedience can occur even when the minority group
recognizes that its unhappiness will have no impact on the median voter. The point of the
protest is not to signal the number of unhappy group members, but rather to induce repression by
the political leaders. The protest planner does not need to assume that knowledge of his group’s
unhappiness will generate a change in voter sentiment, but rather that there is some chance that
the political regime will engage in behavior that will make the look terrible.

Even when the point of the protest is to generate a response, leaders of large groups will typically
prefer milder protests when possible. As the planners’ core constituency becomes smaller, his
protests will become more severe, because severity is a substitute for size. A small number of
terrorists can generate a massive crackdown if they do enough damage.

That example corresponds to the case in the model where the protest leader has access to a hard
core of constituent who are willing to suffer any repression to act again the government. In that
case, the protest planner who wants to generate his preferred outcome—the most information and
the highest probability of regime change—can always get his wish. He just needs to set the
damage high enough so that the tough leaders choose repression over tolerance.

The terrorist case also reminds us that over-doing the disobedience will tend to be ineffective. If
the equilibrium is one in which all leaders would repress, then there is no information generated
by the repression and no reason to engage in disobedience to begin with.



   IV.     An Extension: Non-Persuasive Instrumental Disobedience



We now briefly discuss a slightly different setting where the point of persuasion is bargaining
not regime chance. We therefore ignore the possibility of electoral consequences here and
assume that has a third alternative: policy change. Policy change will cost the leader “A”, and if
he undertakes the policy change the disobedience disappears. Disobedience will not influence
the leaders’ probability of surviving in power. This might occur because there is no information
to reveal or because the leader is entrenched or because the leader is term limited.

We consider this case largely archaic in U.S. politics, more relevant for the American Revolution
than the Ferguson protests, although even in the American Revolution, a war was waged for elite
English opinion. Changing public opinion has clearly become even more important in modern

                                                 24
protesting. Moreover, individual leaders in the U.S. today rarely have the ability to
accommodate the demands of much disobedience.

A significant exception is that this bargaining seems quite relevant for campus protests.
Typically, university leadership does have the ability to accommodate the protesters’ demands.
Moreover, campus leadership appears to face extraordinarily high costs of repression,
presumably increases the appeal of campus civil disobedience.

If a protest occurs, the leader has the choice of changing policy, which will cost him A, ignoring
the protest, which will cost D, or repressing which will cost either 𝐾 or 𝜑𝐾. If 𝐴 > 𝑀𝑖𝑛(𝐷, 𝐾),
then changing policy is never the least costly option for either type of leader. Hence, the leader
will never change policy and there is no benefit from civil disobedience. If 𝑀𝑖𝑛(𝐷, 𝜑𝐾) > 𝐴,
then accommodation is the least costly option, even for the tough leaders. In this case, civil
disobedience would be universally appealing. If 𝑀𝑖𝑛(𝐷, 𝐾) > 𝐴 > 𝜑𝐾, then benign leaders
will change policy in response to the disobedience will tough leaders will not. In that case, the
disobedience will occur if and only if (1 − 𝑝0 )𝑌 > 𝐶(𝑑), where Y denotes the benefit to the
protest planner of accommodation.

This last case seems like a common one, where the outcome of the disobedience is uncertain and
depends on the character of the leader. It may be a reasonable model for the actions of American
colonists after 1763, where they engaged in civil disobedience in the hope that British leadership
would accommodate their requests, which it did under the Marquess of Rockingham in 1765, but
not under Lord North in the 1770s. It seems unlikely that the colonists anticipated that their
actions would topple the Hanoverian dynasty. Rockingham’s first term as Prime Minister was
ended partially because of the repeal of the Stamp Act, but this can hardly have been a desirable
outcome to the colonists.

In the non-informational archaic setting, the desired outcome for the protester is that a particular
leader will change his or her policy. If the costs to the disobedience planner C(d) are
independent of d,, then if 𝜑𝐾 > 𝐴, the planner must just ensure that 𝑑𝑁 > 𝐴 which will ensure
that both types of leaders will change policy. In this case, the disobedience will occur whenever
Y>C.

If 𝐾 > 𝐴 > 𝜑𝐾, then the disobedience planner again need only ensure that 𝑑𝑁 > 𝐴. This will
ensure that the benign leaders will change policies, and it is impossible to get the tough leaders to
change policies, since repression is always less costly. In this case, protest is beneficial for the
planner as long as (1 − 𝑝0 )𝑌 > 𝐶.

If C’(d)>0, then the disobedience planner would always choose the minimal level d needed to
elicit bargaining. If 𝐾 > 𝐴 > 𝜑𝐾, then d=N/A, if protest occurs. If 𝜑𝐾 > 𝐴, then the d will
equal A.



                                                 25
In this case, the model predicts the disobedience will be more common when 𝑝𝑖 is low and
leaders are more likely be benign. This fact suggests that historical theories that try to explain
disobedience by focusing on bad government may be looking in the wrong direction. Tough
dictators are less attractive targets for civil disobedience than benign rulers, who have higher
costs of brutal suppression. In a sense, this simple point is no more than the algebra behind
Tilly, Tilly and Tilly’s (1975) empirical statement about rioting: “repression works.” This fact
would only be exacerbated if benign leaders also had lower costs of accommodation.

A notable difference between the archaic case and the modern case is that in the archaic case
there is really no downside to extreme civil disobedience. The goal is to cause pain to the
sovereign who can alleviate that pain by changing policies. Given that logic, perhaps it is
unsurprising, that civil disobedience led to rebellion, for the logic of this non-informational
protest is just to cause enough pain to induce the leader to change his policies.



    V.      Bounded Rationality and Civil Disobedience

Our model presents a benchmark setting where civil disobedience is rational persuasion. The
act of disobedience teaches voters about the preferences of the protesters or the nature of the
leader. Rational protesters interested in the first objective will just choose an epsilon protest.
The second objective calls for a more pain-producing protest that will elicit repression by the
tough leaders but not the benign leaders.

Yet the behavior of protesters doesn’t necessarily seem to be as rational as the model suggests.
The whole field of civil disobedience is one in which rational calculation has rarely seemed at
the forefront. We here discuss the ways in which behavior by the different actors may be less
than fully rational in the sense of that they act in a way that is counter to their personal interests.
In the next section, we discuss other psychological factors.

We have illustrated how disobedience can be a rational tool for toppling disliked leaders. Yet
there are reasons why we might think that the conditions for such disobedience are unlikely to be
met within the U.S. It seems quite possible that 𝛾 < 0, and voters prefer tough leaders, which
seems to have been empirically true that American history post-1968. Moreover, it also seems
quite likely than many disobedience planners have little private information about the nature of
the leader.

If protest planners have little private information, then their protest intrinsically will do little to
generate unhappiness with the current regime. Their one hope is that the protest will reveal
information about the regime. In principle, the value of information is the same whether voters
like toughness or mildness. In either case, a separating equilibrium causes the types to become
known, which is desirable to the planner if his preference are convex.


                                                   26
Yet if protest planners would like to eliminate more repressive regimes, their strategies seem
likely to have the opposite impact. While disobedients from a particular group signal their
unhappiness by protesting. But their unhappiness does not do much to convince the median
voter that the leadership is bad. On the contrary, a forceful response might convince the median
voter that the leadership is good – which is a plausible account of the reaction of California
voters to the tough response of Governor Ronald Reagan in the late 1960s.

We seem to observe significantly more civil disobedience than would be expected on purely
rational grounds, at least if the purpose of disobedience is to produce reform. We occasionally
see protest repression which seems far more extreme than would seem to optimal from the
perspective of the leader.

We now consider whether bounded rationality among disobedients, voters and leaders can
explain why civil disobedience appears to occur even when the conditions implied by our model
are not met. In the case of the protesters, we will not need any additional mathematics. It is
fairly obvious why errors by disobedients can engender more civil disobedience since the
disobedients are making the disobedience decision themselves. In the case of voters and
leaders, the impact on disobedience works through the behavioral choice of the disobedients.
We will therefore use two illustrative models that illustrate the ways in which boundedly rational
voting or leadership can lead to more civil disobedience.

Bounded Rationality among the Disobedients

We now discuss several additional behavioral complications that can explain why civil
disobedience seems more common than our hyper-rational model might suggest. It is true that
people might engage in civil disobedience even if the likelihood of triggering reform is low: To
the disobedients, the costs of disobedience might be quite low compared to the discounted
benefits, even if the realistic probability of success is under (say) 10 percent. Nonetheless, there
are reasons to think that those who engage in disobedience will often exaggerate their prospects.

We differentiated between the behavior of the individual disobedients and the disobedience
                                                                                            𝑁
planners. The size of the protest, N, is a solution to the equation 1 − 𝐺(𝜋𝑐(𝑁) − 𝑏𝑗 ) − 𝑄 = 0.
In this equation, bounded rationality might distort the perceived value of 𝜋 (the anticipated
probability of a crack-down), 𝑏𝑗 (the taste for disobedience) or Q (the perceived size of the
aggrieved minority). The disobedience planner is more like to plan a significant action if he
perceives F(.) to be convex and if he expects the equilibrium number of disobedients to be
significant. As such, if the planner erroneously overestimates the value of 𝑏𝑗 or Q are high,
then disobedience will become more appealing.

Those reasons come from well-established behavioral findings, but we emphasize that their
application here is speculative and requires further empirical work.


                                                 27
(1) Unrealistic optimism. In many contexts, human beings are prone to “optimistic bias” – to
    an unrealistically rosy sense of their future prospects (Sharot 2010). Optimistic bias can
    be seen as a form of motivated reasoning -- as, for example, where people believe that
    they are not subject to certain health risks because they are strongly motivated to have
    that belief. If people engage in civil disobedience with the goal of changing the status
    quo, there is a risk of excessive optimism about the actual prospects. In a sense, that
    optimism can be helpful insofar as it is motivating. But it might well lead people to
    engage in civil disobedience with an exaggerated sense of the probability of success.

   In the context of our model, this might mean that disobedients believe that 𝜋 is too low,
   which would reduce the perceived costs of disobedience and make the size of
   disobedience larger. If the planner believes that the individual protesters underestimate
   the probably of repression than the planner will anticipate larger crowds and that makes
   protest more likely. Holding the beliefs of the individual diobedients constant, the
   planner himself is more likely to protest if he overestimates the value of 𝜋, since
   suppression is likely to make the protest more effective in generating regime change.
   Overoptimism could well lead the protest planner to have an overly high assessment of
   the probability of repression (since that is what he is hoping for) and for the individual
   disobedients to have an overly low assessment of the repression probability (since they
   are hoping not to experience repression).

   Over-optimism could also function by changing the planners perceived assessment of the
   function F(.)—the voters preferences. An overly optimistic planner might be more likely
   to believe that voters will oust a leader who reveals himself to be tough and that will also
   make disobedience more attractive.

(2) Overestimating one’s representativeness # 1—which basically means that if you believe
    that a leader is cruel or unjust, then others will share your dislike of him. Consider the
    robust psychological finding of “egocentric bias”: People tend to think that other people
    share their values and tastes. Those who are engaged in civil disobedience are highly
    likely to think that other people are likely to do so, or at least share their opinions. Here
    as well, the result can be an inflation of the prospects for success.

   In the model, this would be reflected by an overassessment of the value of Q, the size of
   the aggrieved group, by either the disobedients themselves or the disobedience planner.
   If the disobedients themselves make the error, then the protest will be larger because
   anticipating a bigger crowd means anticipating less downside if a crack-down does occur.
   If the planner makes the error, then this will make a protest more likely because they
   planner is more likely to think that he can engineer a really effective protest.



                                              28
(3) Overestimating one’s representativeness # 2—thinking that more people share your taste
    for civil disobedience. Egocentric bias might also lead people to believe that others will
    be willing to engage in disobedience. It should be unsurprising to find that protestors
    often offer greatly inflated predictions of the numbers of people involved (though the
    inflation might also be strategic).

   This could also be captured by an exaggerated assessment of the size of Q by either the
   individual disobedients or the planner. This could also be captured by an
   overassessment of the value of 𝑏𝑗 by the planner, which will also lead him to anticipate a
   larger protest and then will make disobedience more appealing.

(4) Outrage. Those who engage in civil disobedience are often motivated in whole or in part
    by outrage: They believe that they are responding to serious injustice. When this is so, it
    is natural for people to think in retributive rather than strategic terms and to act as if the
    goal is to punish or to inflict pain on the authority, regardless of the effects of doing so
    (see Kahneman et al. 2000). If some or many of the disobedient are seeking to impose
    such punishment, they might fail to promote reform (and might not much care if they do
    fail). One result of outrage is to produce futile or counterproductive acts of disobedience.


   In our model, outrage would reflect a larger value of 𝑏𝑗 which would make disobedience
   more attractive both to the individual disobedients and to the planner.

(5) Group dynamics. The psychological mechanisms do not, of course, operate in a social
    vacuum. They are greatly affected by group dynamics and social influences. A central
    phenomenon is group polarization (Glaeser and Sunstein 2009), by which, members of a
    deliberating group usually end up adopting a more extreme version of the position
    toward which they tended before deliberation began. The problem is especially severe for
    groups of like-minded people, who typically become more extreme as a result of
    deliberation (Sunstein and Hastie 2014). Group polarization has been found in hundreds
    of studies involving more than a dozen countries, including the United States, France,
    Afghanistan, and Germany. In the context of civil disobedience, group polarization is
    likely to play a serious role, and in multiple respects. If members of the group begin with
    certain substantive views, and if they talk and listen mostly to one another, those views
    will be heightened. The same is true is they suffer from unrealistic optimism or
    egocentric bias, or if they begin with high levels of outrage.

   Here, then, is a psychological account of why civil disobedience will sometimes occur

       inflated probability estimates from rational “moon shots” and from acts of conscience,
       which support disobedience whether or not it is likely to be successful. This structure
       would require a more complex formal model, but we hope that the basic logic is
       nonetheless clear.



Boundedly Rational Voters

Bounded rationality can also generate civil disobedience even if the disobedients themselves are
completely ration. We first examine the possibility that voters are boundedly rational and
examine what that does to the incentives to protest. We next examine the possibility of
boundedly rational leadership.

The rational voter literature typically suggests that very act of voting is not particularly
compatible with hyper-rational instrumental activity, but we don’t mean to reenter that ancient
debate. Our question is whether voters appear to respond to civil disobedience in ways that are
compatible with rational inference. Did a protest change people’s opinions by revealing
something significant?

The quantitative version of this question is whether protests that revealed something meaningful
effected more change in voter sentiment than protests that revealed little. Certainly, there are
many protests that seem to have revealed little and that also did little change the political
equilibrium, but it isn’t obvious that the most successful protests, including the Civil Rights
movement in the America South, revealed all that much pure information.

The facts about the American Jim Crow south had been presented by reasonable sources, notably
Gunnar Myrdal, years before the Civil Rights movement became nationwide news. It is
perhaps plausible that the Civil Rights movement made northerners more aware of the degree of
unhappiness in the South. It is also plausible that the movement revealed the extreme unpleasant
character of this repressive regime in a distinctly stark fashion.

Yet that revelation can hardly have been starker than the numbers of lynchings reported in the
north before World War II that seem to have had little impact on northern attitudes. The
preferences in the north surely shifted somewhat before and after the war, perhaps because of the
experience of fighting a war against a virulently racist regime. Yet still, it is hard to think that
the civil rights movement is best seen as a purely informational success. Similar arguments are
easy to make about Gandhi’s success with British popular opinion.

An alternative view is that information obtained through reading Myrdal’s American Dilemna is
just radically less salient that information obtained by watching the evening news and seeing
peaceful protesters being attacked by hoses and dogs by Southern police officers. The salient,
moving images are just vastly more effective at shaping public opinion than the printed word.


                                                 30
We can model this gap within the context of the model with a slight deviation from standard
extreme rationality. We assume that citizens will not make any inference about the leaders’
toughness from peaceful protest—and that as long as the leader is not actively repressing a
protest, the citizens believe that the leader is tough with probability 𝑝0 . Moreover, we look at
the behavior of protest planner who knows the leader is tough with probability 𝜎𝑝0 , which may
be substantially higher than 𝑝0 . We assume that Q is sufficiently high and 𝜉 is sufficiently
close to zero so that 𝜋𝑚𝑎𝑥 = 1 and 𝐷   ̂ > 𝜑𝐾 + 𝑉(𝐹(𝛾 − 𝜃𝐿 ) − 𝐹(−𝜃𝐿 )):

Proposition 7: If voters do not learn from non-repressed protests, then if F(.) is concave on the
interval [−𝜃𝐿 , 𝛾 − 𝜃𝐿 ], there exists a value of 𝜎 between 1 and 1/𝑝0 at which protest planners
are indifferent between doing nothing and setting d to generate a fully separating equilibrium.
For higher values of 𝜎, the planner’s strictly prefer a separating equilibrium while for lower
values of 𝜎 the planner prefers doing nothing. The value of 𝜎 which makes planners indifferent
between doing nothing and protest is

Proposition 7 addresses a very simple form of limited rationality among voters that can readily
generate disobedience and repression. The Proposition assumes that voters just won’t be
persuaded by any form of mass action. Such actions are just assumed to be non-salient and they
don’t move the opinons of the voters. Voters will only change their beliefs when they see
repression.

We therefore consider the choice of planners’ who choose between enough protest to generate a
fully separating equilibrium where tough leaders repress and mild leaders do not and doing
nothing, where voters persist in their old beliefs. The planner however has private information,
and therefore he thinks that his protest is relatively more likely to create repression. Thus on
average, the repression will occur more likely than the voters’ expect it too.

This generates an incentive for significant protest even when the returns are concave. If the
planners’ beliefs diverge sharply from those of the voters then he will choose to risk repression.
A failure to internalize non-salient information opens a gap in beliefs between protesters and
voters if salient protest is the only way to change voters’ beliefs then this will generate civil
disobedience.

We do not think that this discussion diverges too strongly from the rational case discussed above.
We have just emphasized that voters might need salient signals, not just solid information, which
would be natural if there were costs of processing information. Voters have few sharp incentives
to figure out political facts. A highly salient act of disobedience with particularly salient
repression is just one means of reduce the costs of processing information.

According to this view, northern Americans were vaguely aware of the state of the American
South in 1955 but they hadn’t bothered to really figure out what that meant for the well-being of
southern African-Americans or the brutality of the regime. The protests broadcast searing
images that lowered the cost of information. If this is correct, then Martin Luther King didn’t
                                                31
have to face convex returns. He just had to hold a belief that the Southern regime was brutal
which was higher than the belief of the average northerner.

Another interpretation of Proposition 7 is that it is the protest planner, rather than the general
public, who is in error. In this case, the public prior on the leaders’ type is correct, but the
planner incorrectly believes that the leader is more likely to be repressive and the public is
wrong. This error will also lead to more civil disobedience, but if the error is on the part of the
planner then the disobedience is unlikely to be successful.

This is surely not the only plausible form of bounded rationality in the voting both, but it is a
simple possibility and it illustrates one way in which bounded rationality among voters can make
civil disobedience more appealing even if the disobedients are rational themselves.



Boundedly Rational Leaders and Dyer’s Error

If voters are rational and disobedients are rational, then it is still possible for bounded rationality
on the part of the leader to encourage civil disobedience. Since the disobedience planner and the
leader have opposing objectives, the planner’s incentives to protest typically increase when the
leader is bad at serving his own interests.

Given that the behavior of leaders is based on unobservable tastes for repressing disorder, it
would be impossible to ever claim that they acted irrationally. The narrower question is whether
leaders act in ways that are contrary to their career concerns. Do we see political leaders
regularly making decisions that come back to haunt them in their careers or at the voting booths?

The traditional “error”, which we associate with Reginald Dyer is an overly tough response to
mild disorder that plays havoc with a leader’s career. Dyer was the Brigadier General in the
Indian Army who gave the order to open on a crowd of thousands of peaceful Indians who were
celebrating the Baisakhi festival. Martial law had been declared, so that the celebrants were
violating the law, whether consciously or not. Dyer’s response involved ordering over ten
minutes of firing at the thick of a crowd that was trying to disperse causing the deaths of
hundreds.

The Amritsar massacre would not be remarkable if perpetrated by an autocratic regime, but it is
unusual by Dyer’s superiors were ultimately responsible to British (but not Indian) voters.
While there was certainly a vocal minority that strongly supported Dyer, his own career was
over. The force of public response required the end of Dyer’s career. British horror at British
brutality in India has been often thought to represent a turning point in the history of the Raj.

Naturally, there are many ways of arguing that Dyer was fully rational. While his military
career was ended, he did receive an enormous fund for his retirement raised privately raised by
Rudyard Kipling and the Morning Post. He seems to have had a taste for brutal repression over

                                                  32
accommodation. Perhaps most reasonably, prior to World War I, British repression in India
had received far less opprobrium and perhaps he just made a mistake, not recognizing how the
sensitivity to slaughtering hundreds of unarmed civilians might have been heightened. Any
action can be rational and still a mistake.

When leaders make Dyer’s error, then the benefits of protesting to the planner (if not the
individual protester) can increase. Since the disobedience planner anticipates this overly heavy
response, the planner knows that the protest is more likely to be revealing. This in turn makes
protest more appealing.

One can plausibly argue that Southern policemen who turned the hoses and dogs on civil rights
protesters were guilty of their own version of Dyer’s mistake, because their actions helped end
the regime they were allegedly trying to support. Yet from a private career’s concern model, it is
far less obvious that a Southern sheriff had much to fear from getting tough on protesters. The
voters of the south eagerly returned tough leaders at least until African-Americans made up a
large fraction of the voting public. A reasonable view is that each individual sheriff who was
repressive acted in their own private career’s interest, but that taken as a whole, the Southern
leaders might have done better (strictly for their own long term survival) by agreeing upon more
accommodation.

Two particularly salient examples of leaders who appeared to suffer because of a tough response
to protest are Richard J. Daley and New York Police Chief Kelly. Daley’s public image suffered
significantly in response to the Chicago Police’s tough tactics when faced with the protests at the
1968 Democratic Convention. Yet Daley was re-elected by his Chicago voters until his death.
The New York Police Department’s handling of Occupy Wall Street has been seen as helping to
support the progressive anti-Bloomberg wave that helped elect DeBlasio and replace Kelly.

These individual cases may represent repression with negative longer term consequences, but
they are rare. Since the 1960s, police response to disorder within the U.S. has generally been
muted and the public has rarely punished any leader for heavy-handedness. That track record
leads us back to where this section began—the protest planners themselves seem most likely to
be influenced by bounded rationality.



   VI.     Prosecutorial Discretion and Civil Disobedience


Our emphasis has been on the use of force by authorities, with the canonical example being the
invocation of police. But the same analysis applies to a more common dilemma, by which
prosecutors must decide whether to initiate proceedings against people who have engaged in
various forms of civil disobedience. Consider, for example, tax protestors, who refuses to file
because of disapproval of actions of the national government; civil rights protestors who have

                                                33
unlawfully occupied streets and refused to disperse; or journalists who refuse to divulge their
sources (in violation of the law, and on principle). In cases of this kind, should prosecutors bring
the force of law to bear, or should they exercise their discretion so as to leave the actions
unpunished?

There are of course moral questions about the appropriate approach (Dworkin 1967), but
prosecutors should also ask a purely instrumental question, which is whether prosecution will be
helpful or harmful if underlying goal is to prevent repetition of the underlying behavior. In the
abstract, it could go either way. Like any other use of force, prosecution might increase the
resolve of those who are agree with the law-breaker (and promote imitation), or it might serve
instead to deter them.

The work in this paper highlights that the power to persuade will lie in the response far more
than in the initial action. While disobedients seem likely to have little information relative to
the general public, the authorities surely know themselves. As such, their actions always have a
great deal of power to inform the public. This suggests an asymmetry between the protesters,
whose ability to screw-up is minimal, and the police, whose ability to screw up is enormous.

In a rational model, there are two primary reasons why disobedients think that rolling the dice
and potentially eliciting a response may be sensible. First, it may be that the returns are convex,
and in our model, this came from a convexity in the distribution of voter tastes. But more
generally, the requirement is that revealing a leader to be tough is far more important than
allowing a leader to remain appearing innocuous.

Disobedience will also become more attractive to individuals who believe that they know that the
leaders are truly bad guys. They think that the leader will respond harshly with a high
probability and hence they want to provoke the leader. Notably, this would be true if their
beliefs were rational or if they had a less accurate but still negative view of their leaders.

It seems quite possible that a degree of bounded rationality may help explain the popularity of
disobedience given its poor track record of creating change in recent decades. As the model has
emphasized, individual protesters must themselves be moved by intrinsic motivation. This is the
civil disobedience equivalent of the voters’ paradox. Since no individual disobedient makes a
difference, they must like doing it.

Nonetheless, in our model, the planning of the protest required instrumental aims, and we are left
wondering whether the conditions needed for rational disobedience planning are actually
satisfied in the U.S. in recent decades. Harsh responses occasionally occur, but most American
voters seem comfortable re-electing tough leaders. Indeed, it seems quite possible that most U.S.
leaders are more concerned with acting tough than pretending to be easy-going. In that case, it is
quite difficult to generate rational disobedience. If this is the case, the disobedience is more
likely to reflect either over-optimism or intrinsic motivation than a rational plan to inform voters.


                                                 34
   VII.    Conclusion



Civil disobedience is often expressive rather than instrumental; people sometimes violate the law
because of the perceived dictates of conscience. In many of the most interesting cases, and those
that are most important from the standpoint of history, disobedience is designed to produce
reform, either by changing public opinion (by showing the number and intensity of opponents to
practices or regimes) or by triggering a forceful response that seems to reveal that the regime has
a bad character.

Disobedience is a strong form of protest, because those who engage in it are risking sanctions.
For that reason, the signal of their actions may become very loud. In some occasions, they can
make misconduct or injustice salient when it would otherwise be in the background. On other
occasions, the signal will convey information about the depth and width of public disapproval
(Lohmann 1994). At the same time, the signal might alter reputational incentives, in part of
dissipating pluralistic ignorance, showing people that opposition is far more widespread than
they previously thought (Kuran 1998).

Much of our focus here has been on a particular motivation for civil disobedience, which is to
provoke the leader to respond in ways that will shift public opinion in significant ways. For the
disobedient, the challenge is to avoid action that is so weak that it fails to provoke or so
aggressive that even the most forceful response will seem justified. We have explored the
circumstances in which rational disobedience can surmount that challenge, consistent with some
of history’s most celebrated examples. At the same time, we have emphasized that optimism
bias, egocentric bias, and outrage can produce futile or counterproductive disobedience,
consistent with what is commonly observed.

Appendix I: Proofs of Propositions

Proof of Proposition 1: A useful lemma for all subsequent proofs is that it is impossible for both
types of leaders to randomize between the two strategies. We let 𝑝𝑁𝑆 reflect the posterior belief
that the leader is malign conditional upon the leader not suppressing the disorder and 𝑝𝑆 reflect
the posterior belief that the leader is malign conditional upon the leader suppressing the disorder.
For the malign leader to be indifferent between suppressing and not suppressing disorder, it must
be that (1 − 𝐹(𝛾𝑝𝑁𝑆 − 𝜃𝐿 ))𝑉 − 𝐷 = (1 − 𝐹(𝛾𝑝𝑆 − 𝜃𝐿 ))𝑉 − 𝜑𝐾. If this condition holds, then
(1 − 𝐹(𝛾𝑝𝑁𝑆 − 𝜃𝐿 ))𝑉 − 𝐷 > (1 − 𝐹(𝛾𝑝𝑆 − 𝜃𝐿 ))𝑉 − 𝐾 and the benign leader will always
strictly prefer non-suppression. As such, at least one type of leader will always follow a single
strategy with probability one.

The same logic implies that if malign leaders choose not to suppress with any positive
probability, which implies that (1 − 𝐹(𝛾𝑝𝑁𝑆 − 𝜃𝐿 ))𝑉 − 𝐷 ≥ (1 − 𝐹(𝛾𝑝𝑆 − 𝜃𝐿 ))𝑉 − 𝜑𝐾, then
benign leaders will never suppress because (1 − 𝐹(𝛾𝑝𝑁𝑆 − 𝜃𝐿 ))𝑉 − 𝐷 > (1 − 𝐹(𝛾𝑝𝑆 − 𝜃𝐿 ))𝑉 −
𝜑𝐾. Similarly, if benign leaders suppress with any positive probability, which implies that
(1 − 𝐹(𝛾𝑝𝑁𝑆 − 𝜃𝐿 ))𝑉 − 𝐷 ≤ (1 − 𝐹(𝛾𝑝𝑆 − 𝜃𝐿 ))𝑉 − 𝐾, then malign leaders will always
suppress because (1 − 𝐹(𝛾𝑝𝑁𝑆 − 𝜃𝐿 ))𝑉 − 𝐷 < (1 − 𝐹(𝛾𝑝𝑆 − 𝜃𝐿 ))𝑉 − 𝜑𝐾. This implies that
the only possible semi-pooling equilibria are ones in which all benign leaders and some malign
leaders choose not to suppress or ones in which all malign leaders and some benign leaders
suppress harshly. As such, it follows that in all semi-pooling equilibria, 𝑝𝑆 ≥ 𝑝𝑁𝑆 , voters
always believe that harsh suppression is more likely to reflect a malign leader.

If 𝐾 > 𝜑𝐾 > 𝐷, then the cost of disorder is less than the cost of suppression for both types of
leaders. Consider an equilibrium in which both types of leaders do not suppress disorder. If
either type deviates to suppressing disorder, they will receive an immediate welfare loss, because
the costs of suppression are greater than the costs of disorder, and they will be thought to be
malign, which will reduce their chances of re-election. As such, this is an equilibrium.

Consider a candidate pooling equilibrium in which both types of leaders harshly suppress
disorder. If either type deviates to non-suppression, they will receive an immediate welfare gain,
because the costs of suppression are greater than the costs of disorder, and they will be more
likely to be re-elected by voters will perceive them as being benign. As such, this cannot be an
equilibrium.

No semi-pooling equilibrium is possible if 𝐾 > 𝜑𝐾 > 𝐷, because leaders will always lose by
suppressing harshly. They lose directly because the costs of suppression are higher than the
costs of disorder and they lose indirectly because the voters will be more likely to think that they
are malign. As a result, they will always prefer non-suppression.

We now adopt the notation: 𝜗1 = 1 − 𝐹(𝛾 − 𝜃𝐿 ), 𝜗0 = 1 − 𝐹(−𝜃𝐿 ) and 𝜗𝐷 = 1 − 𝐹(𝛾𝑝𝐷 −
𝜃𝐿 ), where 𝜗1 < 𝜗𝐷 < 𝜗0 . 𝜗1 reflects the probability of winning re-election if voters believe


                                                 39
that the leader is malign with probability one. 𝜗0 reflects the probability of winning re-election
if voters believe that you are malign with probability zero. 𝜗𝐷 reflects the probability of
winning re-election if voters believe that you are malign with probability 𝑝𝐷 , which will be true
in any pooling equilibrium.

We first consider the case where 𝛾 > 0. A separating equilibrium, where all malign leaders
suppress harshly and all benign leaders do not suppress, is possible if and only if 𝜗1 𝑉 − 𝜑𝐾 ≥
𝜗0 𝑉 − 𝐷 ≥ 𝜗1 𝑉 − 𝐾. These conditions ensure that neither type will want to deviate from the
                                                                                                   𝐷−𝜑𝐾
pooling equilibrium. This condition can be broken into two conditions on V, that 𝜗                          ≥𝑉≥
                                                                                                    0 −𝜗1

         . If 𝐾 > 𝐷 > 𝜑𝐾, then the separating equilibrium exists when V is low (i.e. below                            ).
𝜗0 −𝜗1                                                                                                       𝜗0 −𝜗1
If 𝐷 > 𝐾 > 𝜑𝐾, then the separating equilibrium can only exist if V is neither too low nor too
high, i.e. between the two bounds.

A pooling equilibrium where both types suppress harshly can exist if and only if 𝜗𝐷 𝑉 − 𝐾 ≥
𝜗0 𝑉 − 𝐷. This condition ensures that the benign leaders will not want to deviate, which ensures
                                                                                                     𝐷−𝐾
that the malign leaders will also not want to t deviate. This condition requires that 𝜗                      ≥ 𝑉.
                                                                                                     0 −𝜗𝐷
As such, this equilibrium can only exist if 𝐷 > 𝐾 > 𝜑𝐾, and if V is sufficiently low. Notably
𝐷−𝐾            𝐷−𝐾
         <𝜗            , so there exist values of V for which both this pooling equilibrium and the
𝜗0 −𝜗1         0 −𝜗𝐷
separating equilibrium both exist, as long as 𝐷 > 𝐾.

A pooling equilibrium where both types do not suppress can only exist if 𝜗𝐷 𝑉 − 𝐷 ≥ 𝜗1 𝑉 − 𝜑𝐾,
which ensures that the malign types will not want to deviate, which implies that the benign types
                                                                           𝐷−𝜑𝐾
will also not want to deviate. This condition requires that 𝜗                       ≤ 𝑉. If 𝐷 < 𝜑𝐾, this would
                                                                            𝐷 −𝜗1
always hold, which is why this equilibrium always exists in that case. If 𝐷 > 𝜑𝐾, then this
equilibrium only exists if V is sufficiently high to compensate the malign leaders with sufficient
career returns to offset the immediate loss in utility.
      𝐷−𝜑𝐾       𝐷−𝜑𝐾
As 𝜗           ≥𝜗            , then minimum cutoff needed for this pooling equilibrium is above the
       𝐷 −𝜗1         0 −𝜗1
maximum cutoff needed for the existence of separating equilibrium.

There is one semi-pooling equilibrium in which malign types randomize between the two
actions, while the benign types always fail to suppress. We denote the probability of re-election
condition upon semi-pooling at non-suppression as 𝜗𝑁𝑆 , which will lie between 𝜗0 and 𝜗𝐷 . The
indifference condition needed for semi-pooling is that 𝜗1 𝑉 − 𝜑𝐾 = 𝜗𝑁𝑆 𝑉 − 𝐷 or 𝜗𝑁𝑆 = 𝜗1 +
𝐷−𝜑𝐾
         . The range of values for 𝜗𝑁𝑆 , then imply that this semi-pooling equilibrium can only occur
     𝑉
      𝐷−𝜑𝐾               𝐷−𝜑𝐾
if             ≥𝑉≥𝜗                  .   If the V values are too high, then the malign types will always want to
     𝜗𝐷 −𝜗1                  0 −𝜗1
imitate the benign types and not suppress. If the V values are too low, then the malign types will
never want to do anything other than punish harshly, as long as D>𝜑K.

                                                               40
There is a second semi-pooling equilibrium in which benign types randomize between the two
actions, while the malign types always suppress harshly. In this case, we denote the probability
of reelection conditional upon semi-pooling at harsh suppression as 𝜗𝑆 , which will fall between
𝜗1 and 𝜗𝐷 . The indifference condition needed for semi-pooling is that 𝜗𝑆 𝑉 − 𝐾 = 𝜗0 𝑉 − 𝐷, or
                 𝐷−𝐾
𝜗𝑆 = 𝜗0 −               .    Obviously, a necessity for this equilibrium to exist is that D>K, so that benign
                    𝑉
types lose in current welfare from non-suppression.                               The range of values of V for which this
                                          𝐷−𝐾                  𝐷−𝐾
equilibrium exists is that                         ≥𝑉≥𝜗                .
                                         𝜗0 −𝜗𝐷                0 −𝜗1


Using these conditions, we can characterize the equilibria that can exist under the two remaining
configurations for D. If 𝐾 > 𝐷 > 𝜑𝐾, then there is no semi-pooling or pooling equilibrium
where the benign suppress harshly. The benign prefer not suppressing and voters will always be
more likely to think that they are benign if they don’t suppress. There is a semi-pooling
                                                                                        𝐷−𝜑𝐾                   𝐷−𝜑𝐾
equilibrium where the malign do not suppress as long as 𝜗                                       ≥𝑉≥𝜗                   .         There is a
                                                                                        𝐷 −𝜗1                  0 −𝜗1
                                            𝐷−𝜑𝐾
separating equilibrium when 𝜗                           ≥ 𝑉.     There is a pooling equilibrium where both types do
                                                0 −𝜗1
                              𝐷−𝜑𝐾
not suppress when 𝜗                     ≤ 𝑉. As such, generically, there is a unique equilibrium in this cases,
                               𝐷 −𝜗1
and the equilibrium is determined by the value of V. For high values of V, all types pool on
leniency. For low values of V, there is separation. For intermediate values of V, there is
pooling, where some, but not all, of the malign types imitate the benign types with leniency.
                                                                                                                                           𝐷−𝐾
If 𝐷 > 𝐾 > 𝜑𝐾, then there is a pooling equilibrium where both types suppress exists if                                                              ≥

We now turn to the two cases considered when 𝛾 < 0 and all leaders would like to appear tough.
In this case, if 𝐷 > 𝐾 > 𝜑𝐾, then it would be impossible for either type of leader to do nothing,
since both get negative direct utility from doing nothing, and neither can benefit reputationally
by doing nothing. As such both types of leaders will be tough.

IF 𝐾 > 𝐷 > 𝜑𝐾, then it will never be the case that tough types do nothing, since their
reputation can only be hurt. Thus we must only consider the behavior of the benign types. For
low enough values of V, it must be that the direct utility from action dominates the reputational
consequences and a separating equilibrium exists. This equilibrium will exist as long as
(𝐹(−𝜃𝐿 ) − 𝐹(𝛾 − 𝜃𝐿 ))𝑉 (the reputational benefit for benign type imitating tough types) is less
than 𝐾 − 𝐷 (the cost of imitating tough types). For high enough values of V, there is an
equilibrium in which all of the benign types imitate the tough types, this equilibrium can only
exist as long as (𝐹(−𝜃𝐿 ) − 𝐹(𝛾𝑝𝐷 − 𝜃𝐿 ))𝑉 (the loss from deviating to doing nothing) is greater
than 𝐾 − 𝐷. There can also exist an equilibria in which the benign types mix between the two
actions and that equilibrium requires that (𝐹(−𝜃𝐿 ) − 𝐹(𝛾𝑝𝑀𝑖𝑥 − 𝜃𝐿 ))𝑉 = 𝐾 − 𝐷, as 𝑝𝑀𝑖𝑥 , the
share of tough types conditional upon repressing can only range from 𝑝𝐷 to 1, the values of V for
                                                                           𝐾−𝐷                        𝐾−𝐷
which this semi-pooling equilibrium exists ranges from 𝐹(−𝜃                              to 𝐹(−𝜃                  .   As
                                                                          𝐿 )−𝐹(𝛾−𝜃𝐿 )             𝐿 )−𝐹(𝛾𝑝𝐷 −𝜃𝐿 )
such, there is a unique equilibrium for every value of V.


                                                                                     𝐷−𝜑𝐾
Proof of Proposition 2: The separating equilibrium exists when 𝐹(𝛾−𝜃                                   ≥ 𝑉.     This
                                                                                         𝐿 )−𝐹(−𝜃𝐿 )
upper limit is increasing in 𝐷, and decreasing in 𝜑, 𝐾, 𝛾. Differentiation also yields that the
limit is increasing with 𝜃𝐿 if and only if 𝑓(−𝜃𝐿 ) < 𝑓(𝛾 − 𝜃𝐿 ). The pooling equilibrium where
                                                        𝐷−𝜑𝐾
both types do not suppress occurs when 𝐹(𝛾−𝜃                              ≤ 𝑉.   This lower bound is increasing
                                                       𝐿 )−𝐹(𝛾𝑝𝐷 −𝜃𝐿 ),
in 𝐷 and 𝑝𝐷 and decreasing with 𝜑, and K. The lower bound if increasing with 𝜃𝐿 if and only if
𝑓(𝛾𝑝𝐷 − 𝜃𝐿 ) < 𝑓(𝛾 − 𝜃𝐿 ). The lower bound is decreasing with 𝛾 if and only if 𝑝𝐷 𝑓(𝛾𝑝𝐷 −
𝜃𝐿 ) < 𝑓(𝛾 − 𝜃𝐿 ).

                                             𝐹(                − 𝜃𝐿 )
                                                  1 − 𝑝𝐷 + 𝑥𝑝𝐷

In the semi-pooling equilibrium, the tough randomize between suppressing harshly and imitating
the benign and being tolerant. We lot x denote the share of the malign who imitate, and this
                                 𝛾𝑥(1−𝑝𝐷 )
share must satisfy: (1 − 𝐹(1−𝑝               − 𝜃𝐿 )) 𝑉 − 𝐷 = (1 − 𝐹(𝛾 − 𝜃𝐿 ))𝑉 − 𝜑𝐾, or 𝐹(𝛾 − 𝜃𝐿 ) −
                                    𝐷 +𝑥𝑝𝐷
𝐷−𝜑𝐾        𝛾𝑥(1−𝑝𝐷 )
       = 𝐹 (1−𝑝            − 𝜃𝐿 ). This equality holds for some value of x between zero and one,
  𝑉               𝐷 +𝑥𝑝𝐷
which adjusts to make the equality hold. The left hand side of the equality is increasing with x,
and hence x must be falling with D and rising with 𝜑, K and V.

𝐺(𝑣(𝑧) − 𝑏𝑗 ) and hence −𝑔(𝑣(𝑧)−𝑏 ) = 𝑣′(𝑧) and −                                  3   = 𝑣"(𝑧). The first derivative is
                                                𝑗                    𝑔(𝑣(𝑧)−𝑏𝑗 )

always negative, and the second derivative has the opposite sign of 𝑔′(𝑣(𝑧) − 𝑏𝑗 ). The
assumption that the distribution of 𝜀𝑚 is single peaked at the median implies that 𝑣"(𝑧) < 0 if z
is less than ½.

The net benefit for the marginal disobedient is 𝑣(𝑧) − 𝜋𝑐(𝑧𝑄). Equilibria occur at the point in
which 𝑣(𝑧) crosses 𝜋𝑐(𝑧𝑄). The first derivative of 𝑣(𝑧) − 𝜋𝑐(𝑧𝑄), with respect to z is
       1
                − 𝜋𝑄𝑐′(𝑧𝑄), which is ambiguous in sign since c’(zQ)<0. The second derivative is
−𝑔(𝑣(𝑧)−𝑏𝑗 )

−                  3   − 𝜋𝑄 2 𝑐"(𝑧𝑄), which must be negative for z<.5.
     𝑔(𝑣(𝑧)−𝑏𝑗 )


For all values of 𝜋, 𝑣(. 5) − 𝜋𝑐(. 5𝑄) < 0, as we have assumed that 𝑣(0) > 0 > 𝑣(.5). Since
v(z) is continuously decreasing, there must exist a unique value of z<.5 such that 𝑣(𝑧) −
                                              𝜀𝑚𝑎𝑥 +𝑏𝑗
𝜋𝑐(𝑧𝑄)=0, if 𝑣(0) > 𝜋𝑐(0) or                             > 𝜋.   The equilibrium level of disobedience is rising
                                                𝑐(0)
with Q and falling with 𝜋, as 𝑣(𝑧) − 𝜋𝑐(𝑧𝑄) crosses zero only from above when 𝑣(0) > 𝜋𝑐(0).
     𝜀𝑚𝑎𝑥 +𝑏𝑗
If              < 𝜋, then one equilibrium will always involve no disobedience, but there may be
       𝑐(0)
others.

Let 𝑤(𝑧, 𝑄), equal 𝑣(𝑧)/𝑐(𝑧𝑄), and let W(Q) equal the maximized value of w(z,Q), which is
                                                                               1                                           𝑐′(0)
concave.        If the derivative of w(z,Q) at zero is negative, or 𝑄 > −𝑔(𝜀𝑚𝑎𝑥 )(𝜀𝑚𝑎𝑥 + 𝑏𝑗 ) 𝑐(0) ,
                               𝜀𝑚𝑎𝑥 +𝑏𝑗                                                1                                     𝑐′(0)
then W(Q) will equal                      , which is independent of Q. If 𝑄 < −𝑔(𝜀𝑚𝑎𝑥 )(𝜀𝑚𝑎𝑥 + 𝑏𝑗 ) 𝑐(0) ,
                                 𝑐(0)
                                                                                            𝜀𝑚𝑎𝑥 +𝑏𝑗
then w(z,Q) will be greater than zero and W(Q) will be greater than                           𝑐(0)
                                                                                                       .     The value of
W(Q) is monotonically increasing with Q and will eventually be greater than one.

If 𝜋 > 𝑊(𝑄), then for all values of z, 𝜋𝑐(𝑧𝑄) > 𝑣(𝑧) and no equilibrium can exist with positive
disobedience. If 𝑣(0)/𝑐(0) < 𝜋 ≤ 𝑊(𝑄), then there must exist no just one but two values of z
for which 𝜋𝑐(𝑧𝑄) = 𝑣(𝑧) as 𝑣(𝑧)/𝑐(𝑧𝑄) is concave and goes to zero as z goes to one-half and
to 𝑣(0)/𝑐(0) as z goes to zero. Hence there must exist two crossing points that correspond to
two equilibria. The third equilibrium has z=0. The level of z in the higher equilibrium which
occurs when 𝜋 = 𝑣(𝑧)/𝑐(𝑧𝑄) and 𝑣(𝑧)/𝑐(𝑧𝑄) is downward sloping with z and hence is
increasing with Q and 𝑏𝑗 and decreasing with 𝜋.

                                                                                                     𝑣′(𝑧)       𝑐′(𝑧𝑄)𝑄
The value of W(Q) is increasing with Q and the associated z must satisfy                                     =             , or

The maximum value of 𝜋 is also increasing with 𝑏𝑗 .

Proof of Lemma 1: There is exactly the same information revelation with the smallest value of
d, as there is with any higher level of d if, in equilibrium, all leaders do the same thing. As such,
the political benefits to the disobedience planner are the same, and we have assumed that the
planner has a slight, but still real, preference for protests with the lowest possible level of d.

Proof of Proposition 4: The welfare to the planner from a pooling equilibrium, whether or not
the leaders repress or tolerate, equals 𝐵𝐻 𝐹(𝛾𝜎𝑝0 −𝜃𝐿 ). Any separating equilibrium in which
leaders take different actions will yield welfare of 𝐵𝐻 (𝜋𝐹(𝛾𝑝1 −𝜃𝐿 ) + (1 − 𝜋)𝐹(𝛾𝑝2 −𝜃𝐿 )),
where 𝜋 represents the unconditional probability that the leaders will take the first action, and 𝑝1
represents the conditional expectation that the leader is tough if the leader takes action 1 (which
we always assume is weakly greater than 𝑝2 , since we can define action 1 as the action taken
more often by the tough leaders). Adding up requires that 𝜋𝑝1 + (1 − 𝜋)𝑝2 = 𝜎𝑝0, so
substituting in yields that the planner’s welfare equals
                                            𝜎𝑝0 −𝜋𝑝1
𝐵𝐻 (𝜋𝐹(𝛾𝑝1 −𝜃𝐿 ) + (1 − 𝜋)𝐹 (𝛾               (1−𝜋)
                                                     −𝜃𝐿 )).       The derivative of this with respect to 𝑝1

                                      𝜎𝑝0 −𝜋𝑝1
equals 𝜋𝛾 (𝑓(𝛾𝑝1 −𝜃𝐿 ) − 𝑓 (𝛾          (1−𝜋)
                                               −𝜃𝐿 )),        which is always negative if F(.) is concave in this

region. Hence is always better for the planner to have the same share of tough and mild leaders
taking each action. If the shares are the same, then there is no advantage in not having all
leaders take the same action and hence the epsilon equilibrium is the best outcome possible.

the planner will always choose the highest value of D, up to the point where D equals 𝐷̂ or full
separation occurs which requires that 𝐷 = 𝜑𝐾 + 𝑉(𝐹(𝛾 − 𝜃𝐿 ) − 𝐹(−𝜃𝐿 )). If it is impossible to
generate any repression, then the epsilon protest generates the best outcome possible.



Proof of Proposition 5: If 𝜋𝑚𝑎𝑥 > 𝜎𝑝0, then the planners can induce a protest even in his
preferred fully separating equilibrium with repression from the tough leaders. As a result, the
preferences of his followers do not restrict his actions and the results of Proposition 4 apply. If
𝜋𝑚𝑎𝑥 < 𝜎𝑝0, then he will not be able to achieve a fully separating equilibrium. The planner will
face two constraints. D must be less than or equal to 𝐷 ̂ and the maximum value of 𝜇(𝐷) then
                                                                                 𝛾(𝜎𝑝0 −𝜋𝑚𝑎𝑥 )

value of 𝜎 between 1 and 1/𝑝0 at which 𝜎𝑝0 𝐹(𝛾 − 𝜃𝐿 ) + (1 − 𝜎𝑝0 )𝐹(−𝜃𝐿 ) = 𝐹(𝛾𝑝0 −𝜃𝐿 ).
Monotonicity implies that the planner will always prefer protest if 𝜎 is higher than that amount
and doing nothing if 𝜎 is lower than that amount.
