                                          ABSTRACT

The unemployment rate in the euro area appears to contain a significant nonstationary component,
suggesting that some shocks have permanent effects on that variable. I explore possible sources of
this nonstationarity through the lens of a New Keynesian model with unemployment, and assess their
empirical relevance.

1         Introduction
The existence of signi…cant di¤erences in the behavior of U.S. and European
unemployment has been long recognized, at least since Blanchard and Sum-
mer’s in‡uential hysteresis paper.1 Such di¤erences are apparent in Figure
1, which displays quarterly time series for the unemployment rate in those
two economies, spanning the period 1970Q1-2014Q4, and with the (current)
euro area taken to represent Europe (here and throughout the paper). The
U.S. unemployment rate shows substantial cyclical volatility, but with a clear
tendency to revert back to some (nearly constant) resting point. By contrast,
the unemployment rate in the euro area wanders about a (seemingly) upward
trend, showing variations that are both smoother and more persistent than
its U.S. counterpart. Each recession episode appears to pull the euro area
unemployment rate towards a new, higher plateau, from which it eventually
drifts away as the economy recovers, but without any apparent tendency to
gravitate towards some constant long-run equilibrium value.
        In the language of time series analysis, the behavior of the U.S. unem-
ployment rate seems consistent with a stationary stochastic process, while in
the euro area the same variable displays ‡uctuations characteristic of a sto-
chastic process with a unit root, i.e. a nonstationary process with a random
walk-like permanent component.
        In the present paper I take seriously the hypothesis of a unit root in euro
area unemployment and explore some of its possible causes.2
    1
     Blanchard and Summers (1986). See Ball (2008) for a recent analysis of potential
hysteresis in unemployment in a large number of OECD countries.

     See below for some caveats on a literal interpretation of the unit root property in the
unemployment rate.



                                             1
   The presence of a unit root in the unemployment rate implies the existence
of at least one type of economic disturbance that has a permanent e¤ect on
that variable. In the analysis below I seek to uncover possible sources of
that unit root, and assess their empirical plausibility, using as a reference
framework a New Keynesian model with unemployment, as developed in
Galí (2011a,b) and Galí, Smets and Wouters (2012).
   Below I put forward three (non mutually exclusive) hypotheses on the
source of the unit root in unemployment, which I refer to as the natural rate
hypothesis, the long-run tradeo¤ hypothesis and the hysteresis hypothesis.
The analysis in the paper suggests that none of the three hypothesis can, by
itself, account for the evidence on unemployment and wage in‡ation for the
period 1970-2014, though both the long run tradeo¤ hypothesis and hysteresis
hypothesis can help interpret certain aspects of the joint behavior of the
unemployment rate and wage in‡ation. In particular, the long run tradeo¤
hypothesis could in principle account for the secular rise in unemployment
in the 1970s and 1980s as a consequence of the disin‡ation experienced over
that period, though the large decline in the unemployment rate is hard to
rationalize. The hysteresis hypothesis, on the other hand, can potentially
account for the remarkable stability of wage in‡ation over the post-1994,
despite the persistent nonstationary movements in the unemployment rate.
   From a modelling point of view, the present paper can be seen as sug-
gesting alternative approaches to allow for a nonstationary unemployment
in a standard macro model. That analysis may prove useful in e¤orts to
incorporate unemployment in DSGE models for the euro area.
   The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 contains a …rst pass at the


                                     2
data, focusing on the seemingly nonstationary behavior of the euro area un-
employment rate and its comovement with wage in‡ation. Section 3 sketches
the main elements of the New Keynesian model. Section 4 discusses the three
possible sources of a unit root in the unemployment rate through the lens
of that model, and discusses their relative empirical relevance in accounting
for the euro area evidence. Section 5 summarizes and concludes with a brief
discussion of the policy implications.


2         Unemployment and Wages in the Euro Area:
          A First Look at the Data
2.1        The Unit Root Hypothesis

As discussed in the introduction, even a casual glance at a plot of the unem-
ployment rate in the euro area and the U.S. reveals substantial di¤erences
in the behavior of that variable between the two economies (see Figure 1).
In particular, the unemployment rate in the U.S. appears to behave like a
mean reverting variable, while its euro area counterpart displays a random
walk-like pattern.
        That visual assessment is con…rmed by formal statistical tests. As re-
ported in Table 1, an Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test of the null of a
unit root cannot be rejected for the euro area unemployment rate at conven-
tional signi…cance levels. The opposite result obtains for the U.S., where the
null of a unit root is rejected at a 5 percent signi…cance level.3
    3
    When I restrict the sample period to the single monetary policy one (1999Q1-2014Q4)
I cannot reject the null of a unit root in either the euro area or the U.S. unemployment
rate. The latter …nding may re‡ect the well known low power of unit root tests in small
samples.


                                           3
   The di¤erent persistence properties of the two variables are also re‡ected
in their estimated autocorrelations, shown in Figure 2. The one for the U.S.
unemployment rate declines rapidly as the lag order increases, whereas the
corresponding autocorrelation for the euro area remains close to unity even
at relatively high lags, showing the very slow decline characteristic of unit
root processes.
   The previous characterization has potentially dramatic consequences on
the long run unemployment gap between the U.S. and the euro area. To
illustrate this point, I simulate an out-of-sample path for those variables
using two parsimonious statistical models that …t their behavior surprisingly
well. In particular, for the U.S. unemployment rate I use the AR(2) process


                  uUt S = 0:26 + 1:63 uUt S1    0:68 uUt S2 + "Ut S
                          (0:08)   (0:05)       (0:05)

with an estimated standard deviation for the residual of 0:25.
   For the euro area, the following AR(1) model for the …rst-di¤erence of
the unemployment rate seems to …t the data well

                            uEA
                             t  = 0:80 uEA     EA
                                        t 1 + "t                          (1)
                                      (0:04)


with a residual standard deviation of 0:11.
   Figure 3 shows the simulated paths for the unemployment rate in the
euro area and the U.S. for the out-of-sample period 2015-2050, as generated
by the statistical models above given observed initial conditions at the end
of 2014. Note that, in the simulation, the euro area unemployment rate
drifts gradually away from its U.S. counterpart, hovering about a 15 percent
plateau at the end of the simulation period, while in the U.S. it ‡uctuates

                                            4
around a value of about 5 percent, as it has done over the past decades.
The previous …gure illustrates a key di¤erence in the properties of the two
models: the ‡uctuations in the U.S. unemployment rate remain (statistically)
bounded around an unchanged mean, though no such "anchor" appears to
exist for euro area unemployment.
      A …rst caveat must be raised at this point: a unit root process like (1)
cannot describe the behavior of the unemployment rate unconditionally, given
that by de…nition that variable is bounded between 0 and 100 and nothing
prevents model (1) to generate unemployment paths that eventually violate
those bounds. Thus, a stochastic process with a unit root like (1) should
only be taken as a (local) approximation to the behavior of unemployment
in the euro area during a particular sample period. In other words, one
should not interpret (1) as a data generating mechanism that will remain
valid independently of the evolution of the unemployment rate.
      A second caveat has to do with the power of unit root tests. Whether or
not it is possible to uncover a unit root using a …nite number of observations
spanning a limited period has been the subject of long controversies in the
literature.4 I do not plan to contribute to that debate. Instead, in the
remainder of the paper, I take seriously (i.e. as a fact) the presence of a
unit root in the euro area unemployment rate in a sense that I …nd both
meaningful and plausible, namely, that some shocks may have a permanent
e¤ect on that variable. With that premise in mind, I explore the possible
sources for that unit root and some of its implications.

2.2     Unemployment and Wages: Some Reduced Form
        Evidence

A central element in the analysis of Blanchard and Summers (1986) was the
hypothesis that the high persistence of unemployment in Europe may be due
to the nature of its wage setting institutions and the impact of the latter on
the sensitivity of wages to unemployment. In particular, one may consider
the hypothesis that wages are insu¢ ciently responsive to unemployment as
a possible explanation for the high persistence of unemployment ‡uctuations
in the euro area.
    Next I present some evidence on the joint comovement between wage
in‡ation and the unemployment in the euro area, in the form of pictures and
simple regression estimates. That evidence will lay the ground for some of the
analysis and discussion in subsequent sections. Characterizing the relation
between wage in‡ation and unemployment, the two variables found in the
original Phillips curve (Phillips 1958), thus seems a good …rst step in the
quest for an explanation for the unit root behavior in unemployment. The
model in section 3 below also provides a theoretical justi…cation for focusing
on those variables.
    Figures 4 and 5 provide two perspectives on the evolution of the unem-
ployment rate and wage in‡ation in the euro area.5 Figure 4 plots those two
variables against time, while Figure 5 displays the same variables against
each other on a scatterplot. In both Figures wage in‡ation is shown in year-
on-year terms.
   5
     Year-on-year wage in‡ation is shown in the Figure, for smoothing purposes. Regression
estimates are based on quarter-on-quarter wage in‡ation.




                                            6
       That graphical evidence is supplemented with OLS estimates of the re-
duced form Phillips curve equation.

tion, ut is the unemployment rate and                t 1   denotes average price in‡ation
over the past four quarters. The presence of the latter variable is meant to
capture the e¤ects on wages of possible indexation to past in‡ation.6 All
data are drawn from the ECB’s Area Wide Model (AWM) data set, which I
update through the end of 2014.7
       A number of observations stand out, which I summarize in the form of
bullet points.

         As shown in Figure 4, wage in‡ation shows a marked downward trend
         over the period 1970-1993. The decline in wage in‡ation coexists with
         a substantial rise in the unemployment rate. Wage in‡ation appears
         to stabilize after 1993, hovering about a mean of 2:2 percent, in an-
         nual terms. The unemployment rate, however, persists in its seemingly
         nonstationary behavior. The two variables, thus, appear to have de-
         coupled.

         The previous impression is veri…ed by some formal tests. Thus, an ADF
         test cannot reject the null of a unit root in wage in‡ation for the full
   6
     See Blanchard and Katz (1999) and Galí (2011b) for estimates of a similar speci…cation
using U.S. data.
   7
     See Fagan, Henry and Mestre (2001). The wage refers to compensation per worker.
The in‡ation variable corresponds to the average growth rate in the harmonized index of
consumer prices (HICP) over the past four quarters.


                                             7
      sample period as well as for the 1970Q1-1993Q4 period. However, it is
      rejected for the post-1993 period. This contrasts with the results of an
      analogous test applied to the unemployment rate, for which a unit root
      cannot be rejected in both subsample periods. The previous …ndings
      are consistent with the idea of a near-decoupling between wage in‡ation
      (which appears well anchored) and the unemployment rate (that keeps
      behaving in a random walk-like manner). Furthermore, A Phillips-
      Ouliaris test rejects the null of no cointegration between wage in‡ation
      and the unemployment rate (with and without price in‡ation) for the
      full sample period, as well as for the 1970Q1-1993Q4 period. Thus the
      marked (stochastic) trends in wage in‡ation and the unemployment
      rate observed in the data before 1993 seem to be related.

      The previous observations are clearly re‡ected in the wage Phillips
      curve displayed in Figure 5a, which shows a marked negative slope in
      the …rst part of the sample, but appears to ‡atten out almost com-
      pletely after 1993. Figure 5b zooms in on the post-1993 subsample
      period, revealing the persistence of an inverse relation between the two
      variables, but one that is much weaker than in the pre-1993 period.

      The estimates of the reduced form wage equation, shown in Table 2,
      capture well some of the previous observations. For the overall 1970-
      2014 period they point a strong inverse relation between that variable
      and the unemployment rate. That relation is highly signi…cant, statis-
      tically and economically.8 After 1992, however, the sensitivity to unem-
  8
    The presence of unit root in both wage in‡ation and the unemployment rate should
make us view with caution the estimated standard errors, however.


                                         8
      ployment drops considerably, though the relation remains statistically
      signi…cant. Finally, note that there is evidence of partial indexation
      to lagged in‡ation in the …rst part of the sample period, but not after
      1994.

    Below I use the previous evidence to assess some of the hypotheses on
the sources of the unit root in euro area unemployment.


3     A New Keynesian Model with Unemploy-
      ment: A Benchmark Speci…cation
In the present section I sketch the main elements of a model that I use as
a benchmark in the analysis of section 3 below, where I seek to uncover
possible sources of a unit root in the unemployment rate and to assess their
plausibility as an explanation of the euro area experience.
    The model described next is an extension of the standard New Keynesian
(NK). The main di¤erence with respect to the standard NK model lies in the
use of a formulation of the household problem which allows for an explicit
de…nition of unemployment, as well as a notion of its natural rate. That
formulation of the labor market was originally introduced in Galí (2011a,b)
and further developed in Galí, Smets and Wouters (2012).
    As discussed below, the benchmark model described in the present sec-
tion is inconsistent with the existence of a unit root in the unemployment
rate. In a subsequent section I consider three variations on the benchmark
model, each of which is, by itself, a potential source of nonstationarity in
unemployment.


                                      9
   Next I sketch the main elements of the benchmark model, with special
emphasis on the equations describing the labor market. The reader can …nd
a more detailed description, together with derivations, in Galí (2015a).

3.1    Unemployment and the Wage Markup

A key ingredient of the model is the (log) reservation nominal wage wt of the
marginal worker employed, which is assumed to be given (in logs) by

                               wt = pt + ct + 'nt

where pt is the (log) price level, ct is (log) consumption, and nt is (log)
employment. Galí (2015a) provides microfoundations for that assumption,
based on the optimizing behavior of a representative household.
   A second ingredient is the (log) labor force, lt , which is implicitly deter-
mined by
                               wt = pt + ct + 'lt                              (2)

and which can be interpreted as the measure of individuals whose reservation
wage is no higher than the current average wage, given the price level and
consumption. By de…nition, those individuals will choose to participate in
the labor market–and hence constitute the labor force–though only a subset
nt of them will be employed.
   A third key element of the model is the average wage markup,      w;t ,   which
is de…ned as the gap between the average (log) nominal wage and the (log)
reservation wage of the average marginal worker:


                                  w;t   wt   wt


                                        10
   Finally, the unemployment rate is de…ned as the (log) di¤erence between
the labor force and employment:

                                    ut         lt   nt

   Combining the previous equations one can derive a simple relation be-
tween the unemployment rate and the average wage markup, namely

                                         w;t   = 'ut                          (3)

   Figure 6 represents graphically the relationship between the average wage
markup and the unemployment rate, using a conventional labor market dia-
gram. The labor supply is given by the participation equation (2). The un-
employment rate corresponds to the horizontal gap between the labor supply
and labor demand schedules, at the level of the prevailing average real wage.
The wage markup     w;t ,   on the other hand, is represented in the …gure by the
gap between the wage and the reservation wage (both expressed in real terms
now), at the level of current employment nt . Given the assumed linearity,
the ratio between the two gaps is constant and given by ', the slope of the
labor supply schedule, as implied by (2).
   Both the unemployment rate and the average wage markup are endoge-
nous variables. Their determination is in‡uenced by the wage setting frame-
work in place, among other factors.

3.2    Wage Setting

In the benchmark New Keynesian framework I assume the Calvo-style model
of staggered wage setting originally proposed in Erceg, Henderson and Levin
(2001) and generally adopted by the literature due to its tractability. In that

                                               11
model only a constant fraction of worker-types (or the unions representing
them), drawn randomly from the population, are able to reset their nominal
wage in any given period. Under that assumption the evolution of the average
(log) nominal wage is described by the di¤erence equation

                                 wt =    w wt 1    + (1     w )wt                        (4)

where         w   is the fraction of worker-types that keep their wage unchanged, and
wt is the newly set (log) wage in period t. The fact that the wage remains un-
changed for several periods makes the implied optimal wage setting decision
to be forward-looking. In particular, when setting the wage wt , unions take
into account the current and future demand for their work services, which is
given by:
                              nt+kjt =    w;t (wt       wt+k ) + nt+k                    (5)

for k = 1; 2; 3; :::where nt+kjt denotes period t + k demand for labor whose
wage has been reset for the last time in period t, and where                    w;t   > 1 is
the (possibly time varying) wage elasticity of labor demand e¤ective in that
period.
      When resetting the wage, each union seeks to maximize the utility of the
representative household, to which all union members (employed or unem-
ployed) belong. This gives rise to a (log-linearized) wage setting rule of the
form:
                                         X
                                         1
                                                      k      n
                       wt = (1      w)         (   w ) Et    w;t+k   + wt+kjt            (6)
                                         k=0

where wt+kjt           pt+k + ct+k + 'nt+kjt is the relevant reservation wage in t + k
                                                                                       n
for a union that has reset its wage for the last time in period t, and                 w;t
        w;t
log   w;t     1
                  is the natural wage markup in period t. It is easy to show that

                                                   12
the latter is the wage markup that any union (acting independently) would
choose if wages were fully ‡exible, given a labor demand schedule with an
exogenous wage elasticity            w;t .

       Combining (4) and (6) (after some algebra) yields the wage in‡ation equa-
tion:
                               w              w                                n
                               t   = Et f     t+1 g          w ( w;t           w;t )           (7)
            w                                 (1     w )(1     w)
where       t    wt   wt   1   and     w           w (1+ w ')
                                                                    . The previous equation can in
turn be combined with (3) to obtain a New Keynesian Wage Phillips Curve:

                               w               w
                               t   = Et f      t+1 g         w '(ut           unt )            (8)

can be thought of as a natural rate of unemployment, de…ned as the rate
of unemployment that would prevail in period t if wages were fully ‡exible
                                                                    n     9
(and, hence, the wage markup was given by                           w;t ).

       A particular case of the model above, and a common assumption in
the literature, corresponds to that of a constant natural wage markup, i.e.
 n          n
 w;t    =   w   for all t.10 In the estimated DSGE model of Smets and Wouters

process, and shown to be an important source of ‡uctuations of key macro
variables at business cycle frequencies. More generally, and to the extent

      In contrast with the original Phillips curve (Phillips (1958)), which involved a sta-

parameters. In Galí (2011b), I showed how an extension of (8) allowing for wage index-
ation to past price in‡ation and assuming a constant natural rate …ts postwar U.S. data
surprisingly well.

3.3       Monetary Policy

I specify monetary policy by assuming an interest rate rule of the form:

                    bit =    b
                            i it 1   + (1   i )[    (   p
                                                        t   )+   y   yt ]          (10)

where bit      it   ( +       ) and with           denoting the central bank’s in‡ation
target.
   For values of      i   close to unity (as assumed in the simulations below) the
previous rule is similar to the one proposed in Orphanides (2006) and Smets
(2010) as a good approximation to ECB policy.

   The remaining blocks of the model are standard. Their formal descrip-
tion, as well as the derivation of the relevant equilibrium conditions, can be
found in Galí (2015a, chapter 6). I include a brief summary in the appendix,
which also contains a description of the calibration used.

3.4       Implications of the Benchmark Model for the Un-
          employment Rate
                                                                                  n
Under the (standard) assumption of a stationary natural wage markup f             w;t g,

the equilibrium of the benchmark model described above can be shown to
generate a stationary unemployment rate. This is the case even in technology
and demand shocks are permanent.
   That result is due to the fact that the gap between the average wage
markup and its natural counterpart remains stationary, since the presence

                                             14
of nominal wage rigidities only generates a transitory wedge between the
two, given that all wages eventually adjust. As a result, and given (3),
the gap between the unemployment rate and its natural counterpart will
also be stationary. Since the natural rate of unemployment is stationary
under the assumption of a stationary natural wage markup, so will be the
unemployment rate.
    Accounting for the unit root in the euro area unemployment rate thus re-
quires deviating from some the assumptions of the benchmark model above.
The next section discusses three possible such deviations that are capable of
generating, by themselves and through independent channels, a nonstation-
ary unemployment rate.


4     Interpreting the Unit Root in Unemploy-
      ment Through the Lens of the New Key-
      nesian Model: Three Hypotheses
Next I examine the possible sources of a unit root in the unemployment rate
through the lens of the New Keynesian model developed above. I consider
three hypotheses, which I refer to, respectively, as the natural rate hypothesis,
the long run tradeo¤ hypothesis and the hysteresis hypothesis. Each of these
hypotheses is associated with a particular deviation from the assumptions of
the benchmark model described in the previous section.
    Next I introduce each of the hypotheses, illustrate them by means of some
simulations, and discuss their consistency with the empirical evidence.




                                       15
4.1    The Natural Rate Hypothesis

Under the natural rate hypothesis, the unemployment rate inherits its non-
stationarity from the natural rate of unemployment. Nonstationarity in the
latter variable is in turn assumed to be inherited from the natural wage
markup, given the relation
                                         1
                                 unt          n
                                              w;t
                                         '
   Note that if we take the model at face value, any permanent change in the
natural wage markup must result from a corresponding change (of opposite
sign) in the wage elasticity of labor demand            w;t .   More generally, it seems
reasonable that any exogenous factors of a structural or institutional nature
that imply a permanent change in the bargaining power of wage setters would
have a similar e¤ect (e.g. a change in …ring costs, unemployment bene…ts,
or in the composition of the labor force).
   Variations in the natural unemployment rate of this sort are presumably
the ones that authors like Gordon (1997) or Staiger, Stock and Watson (1997)
have sought to uncover in their e¤orts to estimate the NAIRU and its changes
over time.
   Next I analyze the model’s predictions regarding the e¤ects of shocks to
the natural wage markup under the assumption of a random walk process
for that variable (and, hence, for the natural rate of unemployment):

                               n         n
                               w;t   =   w;t 1   + "w
                                                    t


   I calibrate the standard deviation of "w
                                          t so that the standard deviation of

the innovations in the random walk component of unemployment generated
by the model matches its empirical counterpart. I estimate the latter using a

                                         16
multivariate Beveridge-Nelson decomposition, with the unemployment rate,
price in‡ation, and wage in‡ation included in the information set. The re-
sulting estimate is 0:45 percent, which given (9) and ' = 5 implies a standard
deviation for "w
               t of 2:25 percent.
                                 11


       Figure 7 displays the dynamic responses to a one standard deviation (pos-
itive) innovation in the natural wage markup based on a calibrated version of
the New Keynesian model described above. In response to that shock the un-
employment rate raises on impact, and then keeps increasing until it reaches
a permanently higher plateau, close to half a percentage point above its ini-
tial level. The response of output is, qualitatively, the mirror image to the
unemployment response. Wage and price in‡ation (reported in annualized
terms, here and in all subsequent …gures) also increase in response to that
shock, but their variation seems rather small.12 Most importantly, however,
note that both in‡ation rates covary positively with the unemployment rate.

4.1.1      Empirical Assessment

To what extent can the unit root in euro area unemployment be viewed as the
result of exogenous permanent changes in the natural rate? It should be clear
that a proper answer to that question should be based on the analysis of an
estimated model with a richer speci…cation to the one considered here. That
analysis is beyond the scope of the present paper. Yet, a …rst assessment can
  11
     Note that the stationarity of the unemployment gap, combined with equation (??)
implies that ("w t ) = ' (ut
                            BN
                               ). Given the baseline setting ' = 5, it follows that ("w  t ) =
5(0:0045) = 0:0225:
  12
     Note that the reason why wage in‡ation increases is that the unemployment rate does
not increase as much as its natural counterpart in the wake of a shock to the latter. In other
words, the average wage markup remains persistently below its desired counterpart, leading
workers/unions adjusting their wages to raise the latter, thus generating the observed
positive response of wage in‡ation.


                                             17
be made by contrasting with the data some of the predictions of the above
framework under the null hypothesis that the unit root in unemployment is
caused by a unit root in its natural rate.
       A number of empirical observations appear to be in con‡ict with that
hypothesis. I’ll discuss them in turn.
       Note …rst that under the maintained assumption of a random walk process
for the natural wage markup, the hypothesis of an exogenous natural rate
implies that we can recover the latter as the "permanent" component in a
Beveridge-Nelson decomposition of the unemployment rate, while the unem-
ployment gap will correspond to the "transitory" component of the same
decomposition. Under the random walk assumption, that correspondence
holds independently of the exact speci…cation and calibration of any other
aspect of the model, including the sources of ‡uctuations.
       Figure 8 displays the natural rate of unemployment and the unemploy-
ment gap, constructed as described above, together with the actual unem-
ployment rate. The shaded areas correspond to euro area recessions, as dated
by the CEPR.13 Note that the amplitude of the ‡uctuations in the unem-
ployment gap appears quite small relative to the unemployment rate itself.
Furthermore, and most importantly, none of the substantial increases expe-
rienced by the unemployment rate during the recession episodes since 1970
seem to be driven by increases in the unemployment gap. In fact, the latter
is shown to go down during many of the recession episodes. Instead, the
bulk of unemployment ‡uctuations is attributed to exogenous changes in the
natural rate itself, with no other disturbances playing a signi…cant role. Such
  13
    At the time of writing no call has been made regarding the trough of the last recession,
though 2013Q1 has been pointed to as a tentative date.


                                            18
an interpretation of unemployment ‡uctuations seems to be clearly at odds
with conventional accounts of European business cycle episodes.
       The empirical relevance of the natural rate hypothesis can also be assessed
by comparing its prediction regarding the evolution of wage in‡ation with
actual wage in‡ation. Note that (8) can be solved forward to yield:

                                                   X

Given that fe
            ut g is (by construction) stationary it is clear that the previous
model has no chance of accounting for the nonstationary behavior of wage
in‡ation in the pre-1994 period. In order to give the model a better chance,
and given the evidence reported in section 2, I use a version of (8) that allows
for indexation to past price in‡ation and which implies:14

   Figure 9a displays actual and predicted wage in‡ation for the full sample
period. Predicted wage in‡ation tracks actual wage in‡ation reasonably well,
especially over the medium and long term. The correlation between the two
series is 0:91. But it should be clear that such high correlation is driven by
lagged price in‡ation, combined with the fact that wage and price in‡ation
comove strongly at low frequencies. This is made clear by looking at the
component of predicted wage in‡ation associated with current and expected
                                    P1 k

in the same …gure (labeled as "adjusted"), and which can be seen to play a
negligible role in accounting for the overall correlation.
   Figure 9b zooms in on the 1999-2014 period, which is characterized by
more stable in‡ation stability and where, as a result, the unemployment gap-
related component should in principle play a more central role in accounting
for wage in‡ation ‡uctuations. But, as the …gure makes clear, the natural rate
model has a di¢ cult time accounting for such ‡uctuations. The correlation
between actual and predicted wage in‡ation is now only 0:24, and gets as
low as   0:20 when the lagged in‡ation component is removed.

   On the basis of the evidence above, I conclude that exogenous changes in
the natural rate are not a plausible explanation for the unit root in euro area
unemployment, at least when examined through the lens of the NK model
above.

4.2      The Long Run Tradeo¤ Hypothesis

Under the long run tradeo¤ hypothesis, the unit root in the unemployment
rate results from the presence of a unit root in wage in‡ation, given the long


                                      20
run relation between those two variables implied by the wage Phillips curve
(8). The unit root in wage in‡ation is assumed to be inherited, in turn, from
a unit root in the central bank’s in‡ation target. Thus, under the present
hypothesis the assumption of a constant in‡ation target embedded in (10) is
relaxed, with the modi…ed interest rate rule being given now by:

                      bit =   b
                              i it 1     + (1           i )[       (     p
                                                                         t       t)   +   y   yt ]

where the central bank’s in‡ation target f t g is now assumed to follow an
exogenous random walk process


                                                t   =      t 1     + "t

and where bit        it ( +       t ):   Permanent changes in the central bank’s in‡ation
target eventually lead, in equilibrium, to permanent changes in both price
and wage in‡ation.
       On the other hand, the long run relation between the unemployment rate
and wage in‡ation follows from (8) and is given by:16

                                                               1
                                         ut = un                             w
                                                                             t
                                                                   w'

       The existence of that long run tradeo¤ in the New Keynesian model has
a simple explanation: the "engine" of wage in‡ation in the model is the
existence of a discrepancy between the average wage markup and its desired
  16
       In the case of partial indexation to price in‡ation that long relation becomes

(or natural) counterpart. Accordingly, the only way to attain permanently
higher wage in‡ation is to increase that gap or, equivalently, the gap between
the unemployment rate and its natural counterpart, as implied by (8).
      Figure 10 displays the model’s implied dynamic responses of unemploy-
ment, output, wage in‡ation and price in‡ation to a permanent reduction of
1 percentage point in the (annualized) in‡ation target. Note that the disin-
‡ation generates a large recession in the short run, with an output decrease
of nearly 2 percent and a rise of unemployment of 2:5 percentage points.
In the short run, in‡ation, output and unemployment overshoot their long
run level. Most importantly, however, the predicted long run e¤ect on the
unemployment rate is very small. This constitutes the main limitation of the
long run tradeo¤ hypothesis, as further discussed below

4.2.1      Empirical Assessment

The long run tradeo¤ hypothesis seems, at least qualitatively, consistent
with the evidence of cointegration between wage in‡ation and the unemploy-
ment rate uncovered above. Figure 11 highlights the existence of that long
run relation by plotting the unemployment rate against wage in‡ation, after
changing the sign of the latter. It is clear that cointegration is driven by the
comovement between the two variables during the …rst part of the sample.
      The estimated coe¢ cient in a cointegrating regression of the unemploy-
ment rate on wage in‡ation (with the latter expressed in quarterly terms) is
 2:04 (s:e: = 0:09).17 If one interprets that empirical relationship as a struc-
tural one (in a way consistent with the model), that estimated coe¢ cient
 17
      Using the shorter 1970-1993 period yields an identical estimate.



                                             22
implies a permanent increase of 0:5 percentage points in the unemployment
rate for every percentage point of (permanent) reduction in annualized in-
‡ation. That estimate re‡ects the large increase in the unemployment rate
experienced by the euro area economy during the disin‡ation between the
mid-1970s to the early 1990s.
       The unemployment costs of disin‡ation implied by the estimated cointe-
grating relation described above are substantially larger than those implied
by the model, at least under its baseline calibration. In the latter, the long
run increase in the unemployment rate from a permanent reduction in (an-
                                                               1
nualized) in‡ation of one percentage point is given by        4    w'
                                                                        , which under my
baseline calibration equals 0:13, which is well below the 0:5 estimate.18
       The long run tradeo¤ between unemployment and wage in‡ation implied
by the model can be reconciled with the estimated cointegrating relation
(and, hence, with the size of the rise in unemployment that accompanied the
disin‡ation of the 70s-80s) by assuming a lower value for '. In particular,
this is possible if I set ' = 0:08, implying an Frisch labor supply elasticity
of 12:5, well above any estimates found in the literature. Perhaps not sur-
prisingly, a simulation of the model under that alternative calibration and
using the innovations in the multivariate Beveridge-Nelson decomposition of
wage in‡ation as a measure of in‡ation target shocks generates a highly coun-
terfactual standard deviation of 22 percentage points for the unemployment
rate, as a result of in‡ation target shocks only.
       Independently of the role that the presence of a long run in‡ation-unemployment

     Note that allowing for indexation to past in‡ation makes things even worse, for in
that case the long run e¤ect on in‡ation is given by (1 4 )(1

tradeo¤ e¤ect may have played in accounting for the permanent changes in
the unemployment rate in the 1970s and 1980s, it is clear that such a mecha-
nism cannot have played a signi…cant role in accounting for the low frequency
movements in the unemployment rate observed in the post-1994 period, for
wage in‡ation has remained highly stable after that date,19 while the unem-
ployment rate has persisted in its random walk-like behavior, as Figure 11
makes clear.

      To summarize: the low frequency comovement between wage in‡ation
and the unemployment rate over the period 1975-1993 seems qualitatively
consistent with the long run tradeo¤ hypothesis, which would attribute the
permanent variations in the unemployment rate over that period to perma-
nent changes in the in‡ation target and, in particular, to the (successful)
disin‡ationary monetary policies of that period. Yet, neither the relative
magnitude of the changes in the unemployment rate and in‡ation, nor the
subsequent decoupling between those two variables after 1994, can be easily
reconciled with that hypothesis, at least through the lens of a conventionally
calibrated New Keynesian model.

4.3       The Hysteresis Hypothesis

In their seminal 1986 paper, Blanchard and Summers propose a theory
of unemployment that emphasizes insider-outsider considerations in wage
setting as an explanation for the high persistence in European unemploy-
ment. The basic assumption underlying their theory, closely related to the
insider-outsider models of Lindbeck-Snower, Gottfries-Horn and others,20 is
 19
      A unit root in wage in‡ation is easily rejected in the post-94 period.
 20
      See, e.g. Gottfries and Horn (1987) and Lindbeck and Snower (1988).

                                             24
described in the words of Blanchard and Summers as follows:

            "...there is a fundamental asymmetry in the wage-setting process
         between insiders who are employed and outsiders who want jobs.
         Outsiders are disenfranchised and wages are set with a view to
         ensuring the jobs of insiders. Shocks that lead to reduced em-
         ployment change the number of insiders and thereby change the
         subsequent equilibrium wage rate, given rise to hysteresis..."

       Here I use a version of the Blanchard-Summers model consistent with the
Calvo wage setting formalism, and hence one that can be readily embedded
in the New Keynesian model, replacing the standard wage setting condition
(6). My assumed wage setting rule is a limiting case of a more general rule
in the New Keynesian model with insider-outsider labor markets developed
in Galí (2015b).21 In particular, I assume that unions resetting the wage
in period t choose the latter so that, in expectation, only current insiders
are employed over the duration of the wage. Current insiders are in turn
assumed to correspond to individuals that were employed at the end of the
previous period.
       Formally, the wage wt (j) for an occupation j that can readjust its wage
in period t is set so that the following condition is satis…ed:
                             X
                             1
                  (1      w)    ( w )k Et fnt+k (j)g = nt 1 (j)
                               k=0
       The previous assumption, combined with the sequence of labor demand
schedules
                       nt+k (j) =     w (wt (j)   wt+k ) + nt+k
  21
    See Galí (2015b) for a detailed derivation and analysis of its monetary policy impli-
cations.

                                           25
for k = 0; 1; 2; :::implies that the average newly set wage, wt , will be given
by:
                          1                                X
                                                           1
                                                                                          1
                                                                          k
              wt =                nt   1   + (1       w)         (   w)       Et wt+k +       nt+k   (11)
                              w                                                           w
                                                           k=0

      Thus the newly set wage is increasing in current and expected future
aggregate wage and employment, for higher values of those variables raise
the current and expected future demand for the type of labor provided by
the workers/unions currently setting the wage. On the other hand, a high
level of employment in the previous period calls for moderate wages in order
to preserve the employment status of current insiders.
      Rewriting (11) in recursive form and combining the resulting di¤erence
equation with (4) yields, after some straightforward algebra, a modi…ed ver-
sion of the New Keynesian Wage Phillips curve:

                                             w             w
                                             t    = Et f   t+1 g     +    n    nt                    (12)

                1
where     n
                      w
                    w w
                          .
      Note that wage in‡ation no longer depends on the gap between the un-
employment rate and its natural counterpart, but on the change in (log)
employment. As illustrated below, that feature, when embedded in the full-
‡edged New Keynesian model generates a unit root in both employment and
the unemployment rate: shocks of any nature and persistence –even if purely
transitory–that have an initial impact e¤ect on employment, will have a per-
manent e¤ect on that variable, as well as on output and the unemployment
rate. The reason is that unions have a narrow objective when setting wages:
maintaining employment at its most recent level (in expectation). Thus,
any change in employment resulting from an unanticipated disturbance is

                                                           26
bound to become permanent, even after the shock that triggered it has faded
away. This is the phenomenon Blanchard and Summers (1986) referred to as
"hysteresis".
   Under the assumed wage setting arrangement, the relation between the
average wage markup and the unemployment rate (3) is still valid. The wage
markup (together with unemployment) evolves endogenously in response to
any shock, above and beyond the ‡uctuations associated with wage sticki-
ness. Note that in the present environment, and in contrast with the wage
setting model found in the standard New Keynesian model, there is no "an-
chor" value towards which the wage markup converges after any deviation
caused by an exogenous disturbance. As a result, and given (3), there is
no mechanism that guarantees that unemployment will revert back towards
some constant natural level. Instead, in the wake of an adverse shock, the
economy may "stabilize" at a level of employment and output permanently
lower, and with a higher unemployment rate.
   The previous phenomenon is illustrated in Figure 12, which displays the
e¤ects of a transitory adverse demand shock in the insider-outsider version of
the New Keynesian model. The demand shock is formalized as an exogenous,
transitory increase in households’discount rate, which triggers a decline in
consumption and, hence, output and employment. The standard deviation
of the shock is calibrated for consistency with the observed volatility of the
random walk component of the unemployment rate. Note that a one stan-
dard deviation shock leads to a permanent increase in unemployment and a
commensurate decrease in output. That permanent e¤ect is an illustration
of the hysteresis property emphasized by Blanchard and Summers (1986).


                                     27
Note also that the impact on wage and price in‡ation is very small.

4.3.1   Empirical Assessment

A key element behind the model’s hysteresis property is wage equation (12),
which I reproduce here for convenience:

                               w                w
                               t   = Et f       t+1 g   +   n    nt                     (13)

             1
where   n
                   w
                 w w
                       . A feature of the previous equation, namely, the depen-
dence of wage in‡ation on employment growth –as opposed to employment
or unemployment levels– is the source of hysteresis in the model. Next I
try to assess the extent to which an equation like (13) is consistent with the
observed joint behavior of employment and wage in‡ation in the euro area.
   To begin with one should note that (13) implies a highly implausible
positive long run relation between wage in‡ation and employment growth,
which is a very strong form of non-superneutrality. Such a relation is at odds
with the lack of evidence of a unit root in                     nt . Furthermore, a (pseudo)
                                            w
cointegrating regression of        nt on    t    yields a negative estimated coe¢ cient
( 0:03), in contrast with the positive one implied by (12), namely (1                  )=   n.

   The previous counterfactual implication can be overcome through a (stan-
dard) modi…cation of the model to incorporate indexation to past in‡ation
between reoptimization periods, as assumed earlier when evaluating the New
Keynesian wage Phillips curve under the natural rate hypothesis. I assume a
form of indexation which gives rise to the modi…ed wage in‡ation equation:

                              ew        w
                               t = Et fet+1 g +             n    nt                     (14)

                        p
where ew

                                            28
       Next I assess the empirical relevance of (14), by constructing its im-
plied prediction of wage in‡ation, given (current and expected) employment
growth, and comparing that prediction with actual wage in‡ation. Thus,
note that (14) implies:

                                  p
                                                  X
                                                  1

                                                  k=0
                                  P1          k
       I construct a measure of         k=0       Et f nt+k g using forecasts of employ-
ment growth based on an estimated VAR for xt                          [ nt ; e w
                                                                               t ]. Again, under

the null that the model and calibration are "true," the wage in‡ation series
thus constructed should correspond to its empirical counterpart.22
       Figure 13a displays the path of wage in‡ation predicted by the insider-
outsider model with and without indexation, together with its observed coun-
terpart. The baseline calibration (which implies                  n   = 0:074) and in the pres-
ence of indexation ("IO model + indexation"). Note that predicted wage
in‡ation in the model with indexation tracks well the medium and long term
variations in actual in‡ation: the correlation between the two series is 0:91.
Note, in particular, that the model can account for the substantial stability
of wage in‡ation in the post-1994 period in the face of a persistent random
walk-like behavior of the unemployment rate.
       Of course, as it was the case for the natural rate model analyzed above,
indexation together with the large low frequency variations in in‡ation in
the early part of the sample period are responsible for much of the observed
high correlation, as demonstrated by the limited variation of predicted wage
in‡ation in the absence of indexation. Focusing on a more recent period
  22
    See, e.g. Campbell and Shiller (1987). Galí (2011b) for an application to wage in‡a-
tion.

                                                  29
with low and stable in‡ation and in which indexation is likely to have been
less relevant, may provide a better assessment of the model. Figure 13b,
shows predicted wage in‡ation using the insider-outsider model without in-
dexation over the single currency period (1999-2014), together with actual
wage in‡ation. A signi…cant positive comovement between the predicted and
actual series is apparent, with a correlation of 0:55. Furthermore, a closer
look at Figure 13b suggests that the previous correlation would be signi…-
cantly higher if it weren’t for the model’s failure to account for the stubborn
stability of wage in‡ation during the 1998-1999 episode, in the face of a
persistent decline in employment. The presence of downward nominal wage
rigidities, ignored in the model above, is a potential candidate explanation
for the di¤erence.23
       To conclude the empirical assessment of the wage in‡ation model implied
by the insider-outsider assumption, I compare the path for wage in‡ation
implied by the latter model to that generate by the constant natural rate
model, and which in the absence of indexation is given by
                                           X
                                           1
                           w                     k
                           t   =   '   w             Et fut+k     un g
                                           k=0

       Again, I focus on the recent single currency period and approximate the
natural rate of unemployment by average unemployment over that period
                                                     w
(9:4 percent). I use a VAR for xt           [ut ;    t ].to   forecast future unemployment
rates. Figure 13c displays the implied path for wage in‡ation generated by
  23
     Notice also that the model is predicting correctly the level of wage in‡ation at the
end of 2014, and its seeming stability. According to the model, wage in‡ation remains
relatively stable as a result of two countervailing forces: on the one hand, current and
expected employment growth would call for an increase in wage in‡ation (see "adjusted"
series). On the other hand, lower price in‡ation is helping contain that pressure, through
the indexation mechanism.

the insider-outsider and constant natural rate models, under my baseline
calibration, alongside with actual wage in‡ation. As the …gure makes clear,
the wage in‡ation ‡uctuations generated by the constant natural rate model
are an order of magnitude larger than those experienced by actual wage
in‡ation or predicted by the insider-outsider model. Thus, I conclude that the
wage in‡ation equation implied by a simple, calibrated New Keynesian model
with insider-outsider labor markets …ts the observed patterns of employment
and wage in‡ation in the euro area better than the constant natural rate
model.


5     Summary and Concluding Remarks
The present paper has o¤ered a preliminary exploration of a phenomenon
that has (unfortunately) become a distinctive feature of the European econ-
omy, namely, the (seeming) nonstationarity in its unemployment rate. I have
sought to uncover some clues about the nature and sources of that nonsta-
tionarity by analyzing the joint behavior of unemployment and wage in‡ation
in the euro area, over the period 1970-2014 and trying to interpret it through
the lens of a textbook-like New Keynesian model, to which unemployment is
incorporated, following the approach in Galí (2011a,b) and Galí, Smets and
Wouters (2012).
    In particular, I have put forward three alternative hypotheses regarding
the unit root in the euro area unemployment rate: the natural rate hypothesis,
the long run tradeo¤ hypothesis, and the hysteresis hypothesis.
    My analysis suggests that exogenous permanent variations in the natural
rate are unlikely to be behind the unit root in unemployment. The reason


                                     31
is that the behavior of the unemployment gap implied by that hypothesis is
hard to reconcile with the observed patterns of wage in‡ation.
   The long run tradeo¤ hypothesis could in principle account for the sec-
ular rise in unemployment in the 1970s and 1980s as a consequence of the
disin‡ation experienced over that period. Yet, the model cannot simultane-
ously account for the size of the unemployment decline that accompanied the
disin‡ation and the observed volatility of unemployment.
   The hysteresis hypothesis, on the other hand, does not appear to be
strongly at odds with any aspect of the data. In particular, it can poten-
tially account for the remarkable stability of wage in‡ation in the face of
persistently nonstationary movements in the unemployment rate over the
post-1994 period.
   It goes without saying that further research is needed, possibly involving a
richer, estimated structural model in order to draw more precise conclusions
about the sources of the unit root behavior in euro area unemployment. Yet,
a number of remarks seem warranted in light of the previous evidence.
   Firstly, the low sensitivity of wage in‡ation (and, by extension, price in-
‡ation) to the unemployment rate in the euro area since 1994, uncovered
in the estimates above, may have signi…cant implications for the design of
monetary policy. On the one hand, it implies that demand-driven ‡uctua-
tions in the unemployment rate will have small e¤ects on wage in‡ation and,
consequently, on price in‡ation as well, with smaller second round e¤ects.
This may facilitate the attainment of the ECB’s price stability objectives.
On the other hand it should require a stronger focus on unemployment sta-
bilization, since a policy that were to respond only to signi…cant deviations


                                     32
of in‡ation from target could imply excessive ‡uctuations in unemployment
and economic activity, given the ‡atness of the Phillips curve.
      Furthermore, if the low sensitivity of in‡ation to the unemployment rate
is due to the presence of hysteresis e¤ects, a case for a greater emphasis on
unemployment stabilization can be made, as a formal analysis of optimal
monetary policy under hysteresis show.24 There are two reasons for this.
First, in the absence of a countercyclical policy there is no "anchor" that
guarantees that unemployment will revert back to some "natural" level. Ac-
cordingly, in the absence of a forceful countercyclical policy, the economy
may be stuck with an ine¢ ciently low level of activity for a protracted pe-
riod. Secondly, and in response to shocks that generate a policy tradeo¤,
any given tightening of monetary policy in response to a deviation from the
in‡ation target would trigger a much larger and persistent increase in the
unemployment rate. As a result, the optimal policy is likely to involve a
stronger accommodation of in‡ationary pressures and a greater stability of
the unemployment rate than under the labor market environment assumed
in the standard New Keynesian model.

      I assume the existence of a continuum of di¤erentiated goods, each pro-
duced by a monopolistic competitor, with a production function:

                                                Yt (i) = Nt (i)1                                              (15)

where Yt (i) denotes the output of good i, Nt (i) is a CES function of the
quantities of the di¤erent types of labor services employed by …rm i, whose
elasticity of substitution is given by                   w;t .    Cost minimization by …rms gives
rise to the labor demand schedule (5) introduced above.
      Price-setting is assumed to be staggered (à la Calvo), with a constant
fraction            p    of …rms that keep prices unchanged. Firms’ desired markup in
the absence of price rigidities is assumed to be constant and given by                                            p
          p
log   p       1
                  , where     p   is the price elasticity of demand. Aggregation of price-
setting decisions, gives rise to a New Keynesian Phillips curve of the form

                                      p              p
                                      t   = Et f     t+1 g        p ( p;t       p)


                                                                                         (1   p )(1       p )(1       )
where             p;t   is the average price markup in period t and                  p        p (1    +     p)
                                                                                                                          .
      Equilibrium in the goods market, together with the household’s intertem-
poral optimality condition gives rise to a version of the so called dynamic IS
equation:
                                                                        p
                                  yet = Et fe
                                            yt+1 g     (it       Et f   t+1 g    rtn )                        (16)

where the output gap, yet                  yt     ytn , is de…ned as the (log) deviation between
output and its natural counterpart, with the latter corresponding to the

wages. The natural real rate rtn is de…ned in a similar way. The assumptions

"demand" shock, henceforth) that follows an exogenous AR(1) process with
autoregressive parameter         z.   Furthermore, the following relation between
the output and markup gaps can be shown to hold:

   Calibration

   Impulse responses and simulations are based on a (rather conventional)
calibration of the model’s parameter values, which for the most part follows
that in Galí (2015a). Thus, I assume                 = 0:99, which implies a steady state
real (annualized) return on …nancial assets of about 4 percent. I also assume
' = 5 (which implies a Frisch elasticity of labor supply of 0:2),                   = 1=4,
and   p   = 9 (implying Mp = 1:125, i.e., a steady state markup of a 12:5
percent). When relevant, I set           w   = 4:5, a value consistent with an average
unemployment rate of 5 percent, roughly the mean unemployment rate in
the postwar U.S. economy. I also assume                  p   =   w   = 3=4, which impliy an
average price and wage durations of four quarters, consistent with much of
the empirical evidence. As to the interest rate rule coe¢ cients, I assume
    = 1:5;    y   = 0:5, and      i   = 0:9. That calibration is close to the one
proposed in Orphanides (2006) and Smets (2010) as a good approximation
to ECB policy.
